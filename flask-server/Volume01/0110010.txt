Let Truth roll on Eoll on, thou mighty tide of Truth, and deluge ali the land; Sweep error from a suffering World, where now it holds command. Koll on, roll on, nor cease to flow, 'till each vile weed shall die,— The worthless tareg and bitte? fruit sown by the enemy* Too long already hath this tide let back upon Its source| But yet 'twas gaining added strength and a resistless force; And as the rains from heaven descend, this swelling; torrent deep1 Shall dash the foam impetuously, and every barrier leap. Then raise the flood-gates, free its course, and let it onward go j The thirsty earth will drink it in, and better fruit wiil grow. Why should we waste our precious stores, in this the time of dearth, When lo ! grim want and famine gaunt, are stalking o'er the earth. Why not get free this blessed stream, to irrigate the land; Why not ' go into all the world,' obeying Christ's command? These solemn thoughts and feelings deep, are surging in my soul, I can no longer silence Ikeep, Truth must and will control. To wakeful watchers, it is true, the night seems very long; Some fear in darkness should we work, it might be all done wrong ; But morning now is dawning bright upon the traveler's way, And glorious rays of gleaming light declare the coming day. 'Tis time for gospel light to spread abroad o'er land and sea; And man must learn that nothing else but truth can make him free. O, let it have an outlet wide—let gospel graces shine, 'Till all can see and own, that love and virtue are divine. E. H. Persons, Harvard
