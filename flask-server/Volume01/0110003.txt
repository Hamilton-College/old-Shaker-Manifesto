In character, in manners, in style... In character, in manners, in style, in all things the supreme exceUence is simplicity. Nothing new, nothing great, nothing curious, nothing marvelous, nor even miraculous in creatures, tends in the least to effect the work of regeneration. This is wrought by daily self-denial, mortification and suffering ; by quietly and patiently doing and suffering the will of God in preference to our own. Nothing can long delight him who dclighteth not, above all things, in God. True repentance is turning from evil to good; from self to God. Tears, without turning, will never be owned for repentance. Grant, O Heavenly Father, that I may fear nothing but sin; hate none but self; love nothing but thee and thine. Count not that time lost which is spent in meditation and prayer. Pelham.
