Divine Influences When in a proper condition, physically and spiritually, we inhale and exhale the spiritual atmosphere as really as we do the natural air. We receive from, and impart to each other, spiritual influences, as readily as the Sun's rays are absorbed by objects upon which it shines, or the thirsty earth imbibes the rain that falls from the clouds, and reciprocatingly returns the same in a purer form. It is said, the rays of the sun move the massive monument on Bunker Hill! How much more should the heavenly Luminary—God—sway the masses of human intellect and feeling, to act in consonance with it, for the promotion of the life that is divine—to live, move and exist only in Him—in his service, who is ' the way, the truth, and the life!' ' When we are resurrected from the mists of error, false edu- cations and superstitions, into the glorious sunshine of everlasting truth, we shall see the right way, and walk therein; we shall know of the truth, and obey; we shall know of the life, the divine, spiritual element, and live in it, as do the Angels, now in heaven. As the soul grows in the divine life, the loves of this gross, animal existence will disappear; the habits will no longer be related to earthly things, but will be fashioned after the Angelic. It is in our power to make a large measure of heaven on the earth, by engaging only in those soul enjoyments that occupy the inhabitants of the Christ sphere. With the All-wise, the All-pure there is no trouble, and in the ratio we are wise and pure, there certainly will be none with us—our life will be divine. H. B., Shakers, N. Y.
