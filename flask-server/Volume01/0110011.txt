Retrospection A century has passed since Mother Ann's gospel was revealed to mortals; and, though we may think the progress slow, that but little has been achieved, yet let us consider how great, how laborious, was the work of the first pioneers. I have watched the rise and progress of Pleasant Hill from my childhood up, for sixty-two years. I saw the brethren, with their own industrious hands, fell the sturdy oaks and maples, right here, where our large and commodious dwellings now stand and have stood for many long years. I saw very soon, young as I was, that providing for the outer man was not their greatest aim, but they sought first the kingdom of heaven, and then, by giving their hearts to God and putting their hands to work, they wrought wonders in this land. How very easy now for the wayfaring man, the widow and the orphans to find a home oi sweet rest, where everything is ready, provided by the hands of kind and tender friends. ] verily believe, that in the course of another century, the beautiful villages, that are being reared by the hands of the pure and righteous servants of God, will become ''As diadems on the brow of the Universe.'
