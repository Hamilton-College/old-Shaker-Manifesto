THE MIND BUILDS ITS OWN HOUSE ' A sensual disposition deforms 'the handsomest features. A cold, selfish heart shrivels and distorts the best looks. A mean, groveling spirit takes all noble character out of the countenance. A cherished hatred transforms the most beautiful lineament into an image of ugliness. ' It is impossible to preserve good looks,with a brood of bad passions feeding on the blood, a set of low loves trampling through the heart, and a selfish, disdainful spirit enthroned in the will. ' Badness and beauty will no more keep company than poison will consort with health. The experiment of putting them together has been tried for thousands of years, with one unvarying result. The laws of spirit work with unfailing effect, making sin punish itself. Every bad passion turns tell-tale, and publishes its disgraceful story in the features of those who have given themselves up to every sort of wickedness. This may not be all, but this transforming a face once full of hope and innocence, into deformity, is terrible. ' There is no sculpture like the mind. The man who thinks, reads, meditates aright, has intelligence in his features, stamped on his brow, and gleaming in his eye. There is nothing that so refines and ennobles face and mien as the constant presence of great thoughts, a high determination, a virtuous principle, an unquenchable enthusiasm. But more powerful still than any of these, as a bcautifier of the person, is the overmastering purpose and pervading disposition of impartial kindness in 94: THE S H A. K E the heart, a universal benevolence, and desire to make others happy. The soul that is full of pure and generous affections, fashions the features into its own angelic likeness, as the rose, by inherent impulse, grows in grace and blossoms into a lovliness which art cannot equal.'
