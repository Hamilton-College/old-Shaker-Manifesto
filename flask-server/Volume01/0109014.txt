Where is God? He's in the kindly faces of parents, teachers, friends, And in the goodly graces which love with chiding blends; He's in the tender sympathy one feels for other's woes, And in the warm affection with which the heart o'erflows. All honest, upright actions, no matter here or there. Bespeak God's glorious presence, and God's peculiar care. He's in the beauteous blossom, and in the whispering breeze, And in the sparkling sunbeams which dance among the trees; He 's in the sounding music of every rippling rill, And in the bird's sweet melody, on. every woodland hill; He 's in the grasses waving so gracefully and green, And in the luscious fruitage of autumn, God is seen. In all, where life is teeming, there God our Father dwells, And with his gracious goodness earth's mighty bosom swells. In the sun's sweet morning rising, in the pearly drops of dew, And the noon-tide's bright effulgence his glorious presence view; When it retires at evening, in gorgeous, grand array, We see therein Jehovah's mysterious majesty! When the gentle moon arises, and unveils her queenly face, She but reflects an image of his wondrous, loving grace; And in the blue, arched heavens, bespangled o'er with gold. Our God's unrivalled beauty and changeless love is told! In the fury of the elements, when thunder shakes the main, And in the silent grandeur of the lightning's lurid flame; In affliction's fearful tempest, in the spirit's peaceful calm, Alike we see our Maker—the loving, Great I Am! Wrhere sin is not, there God is found—in life that's pure and clean, And that theology 's not sound that will not life redeem. Hancock.
