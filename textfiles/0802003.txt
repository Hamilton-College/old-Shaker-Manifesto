FACIAL INFLUENCE. EMMA J. NEAL Meeting a friend not long since, I remarked to myself as I passed: 'What can be the matter with sister S. ! she looks so gloomy, and acts in such a reticent manner, when we are such genial friends and our tastes so generally concur ? What can this mean ?' A voice seemed to interrupt my ponderings saying; 'You beheld the visage of your sister: had you been able at that moment to have seen your own countenance, I think the sight would respond to your inquiry. At this kind admonition of my mental guai-dian, I tried to reproduce the tenor of thought, in which I was occupied when passing my sister ; and soon succeeded in painting the whole scene that was then agitating my brain. I hastened to my room; placed myself before the mirror, and strove to repeat the expression of countenance, which I imagined to have seen, to see how I should be affected at a sight of my real self; but dear reader I need hardly tell you the result. In entire disregard of my efforts at self examination, mirthfulness predominated ; and if sister S. had seen me, the seeming coldness would have melted into a genial laugh, at the strange contortions of the facial muscles, first moulded by mj former thoughts, then suddenly twisted into a broad grin, at the real sight of my ugly self. It is in this way, great evils are often created; and many friendships broken or cooled ; being unmindful of the influence that even a look may sometimes have upon our surrounding friends. While our faces should ever be set as a flint against wrong, and the flatterer's smile, we should be careful not to rob them of the sunshine of virtue, as we may, by a sullen countenance, and thus, unintentionally perhaps, close the avenues of love ; but on the contrary we THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 29 should create affection, by kindly words seasonably spoken. In all the great duties of life, let us be mindful that, 'Sands form the mountain and little acts make up the sum of life.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
