1880 Now, let us jnake the prophecies come true if we can — prophecies that culminate in this year to the unfoldment of all the people; that is in the THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 11 engagement of the most gigantic display of spiritual truth. Very many prophecies of the olden days, among us, culminate during this year. Exceeding spiritual influences were predicted before the year's close, either among the Shakers as a people; outside of our order, or both inside and outside. May the predictions prove true, even to the arousal of a universal revival of the most effective, religious fervor. We do not want the bubbling, trivial excitements of the churches, which only quicken the heart for the time to things above earthly vanities, and finally end by stirring the baser elements of humanity — the animal, reproductive, etc.— end in courtships, marriages or something worse. But we want something that will change the whole heart, so that ' a new creature ' will be the regeneration ; a soul convicted and converted from ' old ¦ heavens and earth' to new life, wherein old things will be done away and all life will be new, and all of God ; a new life that not only bears no resemblance to the old life, but that the latter is made by comparison, to appear beneath the exalted dignity of the converted soul. We have seen the power of God manifested in Methodist revivals, to the discarding then and there of artificial adornments and worldly paraphernalia ; and had there been a continuance of such revival, with an increase, the worldly, fleshly lives would have been cast out with the gew-gaws. But will the predictions be consummated? Are we ready ? Do we want the overturning of our little, vain worlds, upside down ? And yet if we pray : ' Thy kingdom come on earth,' we know that there must occur the most radical conversions, the most diametrically oppositeness of our inclinations if we do God's will — do, act, live as we think they do in heaven. Let the religious wave come; let us welcome it; lave in it, live in it, die in it unto all that is not of Christ, and that will be losing our carnal, selfish lives to find Christ life. ' Come Lord, come quickly.'
