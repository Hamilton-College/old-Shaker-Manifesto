South Union, Kye Beloved Elder Henry ;�Not much to write about this time. Farmers are done fallowing for wheat, but will not sow this month. Center Family have just sold 844 bu. at $1.00 pr. bushel. Potatoes, sw^et and Irish promise good crops; corn, medium. I would like to see in the Manifesto, the general 'Bill of Fare' in our different locations, but ours being rather scant at this time, I conclude to copy from the Journal kept by a good Sister in the year 1866, soon after the war. She recorded as follows :�As to our fare in general, we have the cream of the earth : plenty of flour, meal, milk and butter. Irish and sweet potatoes, apples and peaches, dried and canned; strawberries, asparagus, lettuce radishes, peas, preserves, honey, molasses, beef, mutton, chickens, eggs ; buttered waffles, fritters, doughnuts, baked dumplings, or (toad in the hole,) peach pies, apple pies, pie-plant pies, puddings, sweet cake, milk, tea, coffee and sugar.' These and more have furnished the table for some time and with all this less sickness than common. The above was noted by Sister Lucy Shannon. H. L. E.
