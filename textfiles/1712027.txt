The Amour mission in Chicago... The Amour mission in Chicago is a great religious and benevolent enterprise, conducted on a somewhat novel plan. The late Joseph Amour bequeathed $100,000 to establish it, and his brother Philip D. Amour, feeling that the amount was inadequate to the work which might be done, added $300,000 to it. - -Boston Journal.
