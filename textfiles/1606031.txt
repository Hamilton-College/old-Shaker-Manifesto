FAITH AND WORKS. No answer comes to those that pray, And idly stand And wait for stones to roll away At God's command. He will not break the binding cords Upon us laid If we depend on pleading words, And do not aid. When hands are idle, words are vain To move the stone ; An aiding angel would disdain To work alone. But he who prayeth, and is strong In faith and deed, And toileth earnestly, ere long He will succeed.ï¿½J. G- Rockwell. In San Franciscan.
