Sonyea, N. Y. Feb. 10, 1892. Winter at Sonyea is marching on, snow continues falling, and winds continue blowing, farmers are busy in the logging business, while the woodmen are active hewing forest trees for home repairs and home comfort. Our ice harvest was completed in good time and its quality quite satisfactory, as it measured eight inches in thickness; several tons have been secured from the pond, enough for practical purposes, which is sufficient for the coming days when the hot rays of the summer sun come to abide with us. The majority of La Grippe patients have lost their grippe, which we are thankful for, too much Grippe is worse than no grip; a few still hold to it or it holds to them, but they will recover in time (or eternity.) The Bible teaches us that sinners stand on slippery places. We find this is the season when saints as well as the former class stand on the same platform, that is, when the highways are covered with all that makes a path slippery. If caution is not exercised by the walking public, we daily hear of a great fall in dry goods. jSTow all beware and practice care, whereever you. may roam and with open eyes see the path that lies away and near at home.
