South Union, Ky. Aug. 11. 1892. Elder Hesby Blinn:Please accept this little contribution, which I want used for the distribution of the Manifesto, wherever you may think best. I think the Manifesto is the best exponent that we have through which to disseminate our doctrines, and I want to help you, as we help ourselves to do this very thing. I am interested that this gospel of salvation should be spread broadcast through our land of freedom. We have been greatly blest in the harvesting of our crops, for which I feel very thankful, and therefore send you a few dollars as a present to help us to be placed more fully before the world. Our hay crop was good. Wheat excellent. The East Family harvested 2200 bu. while the whole Society had 7500 bushels. This was an average of 20 bu. to the acre. Corn promises a fair yield. Fruit is plentiful, especially peaches and apples. Should we not be very thankful. With kindest love, and a hope that you may be blest in your efforts for good, I am your Brother. J. W. P.
