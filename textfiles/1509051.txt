You will not be sorry for hearing... 'You will not be sorry for hearing before judging, for thinking before speaking, for holding an angry tongue, for stopping the ears of a tale-bearer, for disbelieving most of the ill reports, for being kind to the distressed, for being patient toward everybody, for doing good to all men, for asking pardon for all wrong, for speaking evil of no one, for being courteous to all.''
