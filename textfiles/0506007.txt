THE WORLD ' Be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world,' was a saying of Jesus, to his disciples. John says, ' The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye and the pride of life are of the icorld.' All Christians may overcome the world, in the same way, and by the same spirit, in and by which Jesus overcame it — by the Christ Spirit. ' Ye are not of the world, even as I am not of the world, for I have chosen you out of the world; therefore, the world — they that are of the world — hateth you.' The hereditary passions and propensities of human beings, are evil treasures which all inherit from ancestry. To overcome them, is to lay up treasures in Heaven, where moth cannot corrupt, nor thieves steal. Generation, and Regeneration, are two distinct principles, which cannot be permanently mixed. One or the other will prevail. No man can serve both, and serve God, to his acceptance. The married man and woman care for the things of this world — how he and she may please wife and husband. The unmarried, for conscience sake, care for the Lord, to be holy, in body, as well aa in spirit. Such live a pure, holy life, for the kingdom of heaven's sake. Let all nominal Christians, who are blending flesh and spirit, examine themselves, and see whether they be in the faith, or no. If the Spirit of Christ be in them, they are not reprobate to the lives of the Apostles, nor to that of Jesus, their Lord and master. And how far will they then be from being Shakers ?
