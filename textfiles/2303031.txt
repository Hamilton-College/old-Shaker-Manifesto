In Memory of Brother JOHN ROSS. And when he had agreed with them for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.' Anna Dodgson. 'Go work in my vineyard' The call reached his ear. Why standest thou idle When I need thee here.' Our Brother obeyed, And that labor began, Which made him a laborer In our gospel plan. The Master in justice The penny hath given; Assurance of peace In the Kingdom of Heaven. An hundred-fold here Of earth blessing and love, And spiritual ties Our relation to prove. Our Brother; his mien Has been graceful and fine, With care he has trodden The straight marked out line. Submissive, obliging, Industrious and true, And honest in all He was given to do. We'll miss the 'Good Morning' So cheery and sweet, With which his kind friends He so often would greet, And also the knowledge Which he had acquired, While we from the morning Toiled since we were hired. For some in the morning And others at noon, And still some at even Are bidden to come. Still there is the Penny The certain reward For all who will toil, In the name of the Lord. So rest loving Brother In peace with thy God! 'Well done faithful servant'ï¿½ Thy welcomed reward. The sting which death brings Has no terror to thee, The grave cannot boast, Of its dark victory. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
