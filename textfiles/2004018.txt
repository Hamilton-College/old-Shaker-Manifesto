SOWING AND REAPING. D. W. Brownell. [Contributed by Lucy A. Miller.] ' Whatsoever a man soweih. that shall he also reap.' Gal. vi.. 7. is the field now waiting the sowers; Barren the ground till the seed shall be cast; Warmed by the sunshine and moistened by showers; Hasten, oh, sower, ere seed-time be past. What is the seed ye will plant in the furrow? What do ye think at the reaping to glean? Harvest can bring to your sickle but sorrow If at the sowing the s^ed be not clean. Winnowed of chaff and of grains that are withered; Sifted of tares that would choke out the wheat; Sow but the best if the best would be gathered, For as ye sow, of its yield must ye eat. Corn can come only from good seed provided ; Weeds can produce but of that which is sown; He who has cast, and the harvest abided, Whether of grain or of weeds, reaps his own. Sowing of truth will return to the reaper Harvest in kind, with a hundred fold gain ; Evils once sown, rooting deeper and deeper, Yield at the last a full harvest of pain.Fair Selected.
