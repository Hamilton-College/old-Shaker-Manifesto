For welding iron and steel... For welding iron and steel a composition has lately been patented in Europe, consisting of iron filings forty parts, borax twenty parts, balsam of copaiba or some other resinous oil two parts, and sal-ammoniac three parts. They are mixed, heated and pulverixed. The process of welding proceeds as usual, the surfaces to be welded are powdered with the composition, and then brought to a cherry-red heat, at which the powder melts, when the portions to be united are taken from the fire and joined.
