Meat Barrels We have found a new and good use for kerosene oil barrels. To make a cheap meat barrel, buy a coal oil barrel; knock one head in; take a bunch of old hay, set fire to it, and throw it in the barrel; let it burn until the staves begin to burn; put it out by turning the barrel upside down; scrape the coal off, and you have a|good, sweet barrel.
