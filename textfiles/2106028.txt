Pleasant Hill, Ky. May 1801. On the night of the 5th inst. quite a heavy frost fell, doing considerable damage in this section of country. Cherries and raspberries were greatly injured. Fortunately our gardeners prepared for Jack Frost, and had most, if not all early vegetables covered. Spring finally began to assert her right, and from the rapid advancement of vegetation we knew at last that, 'Spring had come bright and fair, With flowers blooming everywhere.' On the 8th inst. we had a swarm of bees. Our trustee, Br. Stephen Boisseau, has been seriously ill the past two weeks, and continues so at present writing, but we have strong hopes of his recovery. God grant that our hopes may be realized. Strawberry season is close at hand. The West Family are taking the lead with the early variety. The 10th inst. a dear Sister of said family brought the writer a saucer of fine, large berries, which were highly appreciated. This is one of the kind acts that will never fade away. House cleaning is proceeding rapidly and smoothly under the wise management of our deaconesses. Society in usual good health. M. J.
