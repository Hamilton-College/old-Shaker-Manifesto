The May Manifesto came in good time laden with articles most excellent; not a fault to find. We have had very little rain, and we farmers would be inclined to complain, but for the nice time we have had getting in crops. We have some twenty acres of rye, seven of wheat (which is badly winter killed;) some forty acres of oats, and are now planting corn, about sixteen acres, mostly for the silo. One very noticeable improvement on the public highway has been made between the Church and Center families; the ditch has been cleared and the road rounded up nicely. Let the good work go on till perfection is reached from north to south; till the rocks and stones, brush heaps and ash heaps, brambles and briers are all removed to their proper places, and we have a highway, and all our by-ways indicate holiness unto the Lord. Elder Frederick has so far recovered that he comes to the family table, and has moved up to his own room. Orchards are nearly in full bloom, and promise an abundant harvest. We are very much pleased to learn that six Sisters from Enfield, N. H., are going to make our and other Societies a visit this summer. Let the visiting go on; it keeps our union growing, without which we are poor creatures. In kindest love, D. O. Center Family. May 15, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry;�We thank you for unselfish serving, which brings to us every month a feast of good things�a feast that never cloys nor brings sluggishness to body or mind,, but always has a contrary effect, and is very moreish. Spring is here in her vestal robes. Though not complete, she is decked with abundance of cherry and pear blossoms, and apple blossoms just peeping forth, promise a prolonging of the gay show, and foretoken a plenteous harvest, when the round of the seasons have completed their work. Farm crops are all planted and gardening is well under way. Peas are up but we need rain. The first asparagus was cut about the second of May. Cattle were turned out to pasture in the latter part of April, but an observant brother remarked that they had to stand and wait for the grass to grow. Roads have been mended. As we travelled about, for a month past, the semiyearly rout of dirt and furniture, proved the interest of our Sisters in promoting cleanliness, one of the signs of true civilization. Cheeriest blessings, manifold, ever attend their patient labors. The meeting house seems customarily the last place to be visited with the purging and ablution, which is regarded as preliminary to the season's meetings. If it were only done earlier, what pleasant seasons we might have, that now slip by, without reaching unto our best, in one way, but perhaps in another we do. Let us� 'Live to some purpose; make thy life a gift of use to thee; A joy, a good, a golden hope, a heavenly argosy.' Love to all the workers on the Manifesto, Hancock, Mass. May 14, 1891. Dear Editor:�Since our last communication to you, sickness has invaded our home, and for a time the illness threatened to become epidemic. However, it soon grew beautifully less, and as all who were ailing are convalescing, nothing alarming is apprehended. The disease seemed to be closely allied to La Grippe, though it took a different form. Elder Louis was seriously ill for several days, and the doctor pronounced it a case of Grippe complicated with other difficulties. At this date he is slowly recovering. The recent cold wave passed over our section of country, but owing to the backwardness of the season, it is thought the fruit buds were but slightly injured. Weather is now warm and pleasant, but rain is needed for vegetation. Nature is most beautifully attired in a robe of pink, white and green. House cleaning is nearly completed and other duties demand our attention. On the 21st ult. the summer term of school commenced. J. L. S. Pleasant Hill, Ky. May 1801. On the night of the 5th inst. quite a heavy frost fell, doing considerable damage in this section of country. Cherries and raspberries were greatly injured. Fortunately our gardeners prepared for Jack Frost, and had most, if not all early vegetables covered. Spring finally began to assert her right, and from the rapid advancement of vegetation we knew at last that, 'Spring had come bright and fair, With flowers blooming everywhere.' On the 8th inst. we had a swarm of bees. Our trustee, Br. Stephen Boisseau, has been seriously ill the past two weeks, and continues so at present writing, but we have strong hopes of his recovery. God grant that our hopes may be realized. Strawberry season is close at hand. The West Family are taking the lead with the early variety. The 10th inst. a dear Sister of said family brought the writer a saucer of fine, large berries, which were highly appreciated. This is one of the kind acts that will never fade away. House cleaning is proceeding rapidly and smoothly under the wise management of our deaconesses. Society in usual good health. M. J.
