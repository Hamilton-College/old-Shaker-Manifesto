Notices ''Witch Poison,' being a severe, but merited rebuke to a discourse by one Dr. Baldwin, of Troy. The doctor's discourse is included; but there appears but little of it remaining after the review and re-review by Bro. J. M. Peebles. The pamphlet is worthy the perusal of the thoughtful investigator. Price 25 cents. B. C. Barto, Troy, N. Y. 'The 'Festal ' is a neat little quarto of prose and poetry by a Spiritualist â€” Mrs. J. M. Wilcoxson. Much good sense and spiritual light is imprinted oil its pages. As an evidence, we copy in present number of The Shaker a poem, by which the two great antipodes in humanity are fairly illustrated. ReligioPhilosophical Publishing Co., Chicago, 111.
