Pickling Tomatoes H. L. P. .— J. H. S. would like to know how to put up green tomatoes in brine. The way I do is to put them down with my cucumbers ; every time that I lay down a picking of cucumbers I throw in a lot of tomatoes, every size. When I want to use them, I take them out of the brine, cut them in two, and let them soak a, day or two; then I put them in more fresh water and boil until tender; then drain them and put in good vinegar same as cucumbers, with a few spices I also put ripe tomatoes down in vinegar. I put small red ones in a glass can, all that will go in and not break the skin, with a little brown sugar, a few cloves and cinnamon. I use the best cider vinegar — never acid vinegar, as it eats the fruit and makes it soft. Tioga, N. Y.
