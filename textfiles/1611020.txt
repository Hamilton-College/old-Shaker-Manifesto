From the Little Children. Dear Sister D.; Perhaps you would like... Shaker Village, Mer. Co., N. H. June 1886. Dear Sister D.�Perhaps you would like to know about our ramble in the woods. One evening some of us went out to see the apple blossoms. It was a pleasant evening and we all enjoyed the walk very much. The trees looked beautifully�some blossoms were entirely white and others were tinted with pink. They grow in little clusters five or six in one bunch. They all grow to be little tiny green apples, then drop leaving one, and that grows to a nice round apple which I am sure all like to taste. We found some very pretty violets in our walk also. We enjoyed the pleasant evening and the walk very much. I am very much pleased with my garden and will try to keep it from weeds, which grow up so fast. I have planted some Candy Tuft around the edge, and I think it will look very pretty. Once I found a piece of quitch-grass with a root twenty-six inches long. It is very troublesome because when you try to pull it up it sometimes breaks off in the centre and then it grows again. I am very much interested in Arithmetic. The class are to go from page 181 to 207, which takes us over to duodecimals. I will improve the time given to learn and in this way learn to become a good and useful sister. Your cliiid Lizzie.
