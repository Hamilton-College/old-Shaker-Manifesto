SPECULATION BARBAROUS. Tup; Iowa Homestead suggestively says, ' Speaking of speculation, why is it that the Jew does not speculate? He is the keenest, shrewdest trader in the world, but keeps off the Board of Trade. Is it because lie is a thorough-bred race? Speculation is the vice of barbarism. The Jew has been out of barbarism five hundred years, and there has been no breeding back. The Anglo Saxon is a mixed race, scarce a thousand years out of barbarism. Can this be the reason why his head is turned by the first winnings cf the wheel of fortune? Is this gambling mania like the black nose in the Shorthorn or bristles in the Poland Chi- ï¿½ na, an instance of breeding back? There is no question but what speculation is the vice of the age. It is the manifestation of the spirit of greed seeking to get something for nothing. It adds not an iota to the wealth of the world, while it robs the victim and demoralizes tile winner. It enters into all kinds of business and makes trade a very Babylon of iniquity instead of a system of equitable exchange. ' riSelected.
