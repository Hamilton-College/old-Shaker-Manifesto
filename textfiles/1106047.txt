Scratches or Cracked Heels in Horses .â€” A Canadian correspondent gives the following simple remedy for scratches in horses: ' Having tried many lotions, etc., only to obtain temporary relief for my horse, I concluded to try a mixture of flour of sulphur and glycerine, which I mixed into a paste, using sufficient glycerine to give it a glossy appearance; and the result I obtained in a short time were truly wonderful. I apply this paste at night, and in the morning before going out I apply plain glycerine.'
