SHAKERESS: MEED A. DOOLITTLE, EDITRESS 11 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh.' Generations that have passed, and are passing away, have made their records. Would that all might have as truthful testimonials of a virtuous and godly life — of strong faith in God — and of the increasing revelation of His will to humanity, as our aged friend and sister, to whom we gladly give space in our columns to speak for herself. Thus would Order and Justice be established in all things pertaining to body and soul. She has spent a long life of usefulness, in being good and doing good. Already she is reaping what she has sown ; peace and blessing is her just inheritance. When the lamp of life shall cease to burn, and she lies down upon her couch to the ' sleep that knows no waking ' here, we are confident she will be gathered to her fathers and mothers in the land of souls, there to continue the life which she commenced in the earth sphere. Such spirits never die.
