SPEAK KINDLY ALWAYS Justin F. McCarthy By the banks of the river I wandered alone, And into the pure depths I dropped a small stone; It sank from my sight ere I went on my way, As the eddying circles were fading away. I passed by that spot in a day or two more, And the waters flowed on as I saw them before ; But no ripple came over the surface so clear, To tell that the pebble was still lying there. So the harsh word from lips, p'rhaps unheeding, will fall And sink to some gay heart, tho' tender withal, And the pain of that heart seems to pass in a sigh â€” Yet the pang will remain, tho' unseen it may lie. Oh! pluck not one petal from out a gay flower, To leave it to wither and die in an hour ; Destroy not the bloom you ne'er can restore, But cherish it fondly, by day more and more. Rather speak the kind word to the nigh broken hearted. Shed light on the soul from which joy has departed ; Let the balm of sweet speech on the stricken heart fall, Speak kindly to each one, or speak not at hll.
