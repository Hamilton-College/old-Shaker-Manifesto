Shakers, N. Y. March, 1898. We fully endorse the hope that our beloved editor may not long remain under the bonds of physical affliction, and that the blessed angel that cometh with healing in his wings will be a constant attendant; for there are none to spare, especially in the editorial line, for those who are able to compile a magazine so replete with good things, beneficial to the soul life of earth's pilgrims toiling on their upward journey as was the March number of The Manifesto, must be sustained. This is not mere sentiment, but we believe the voicing of the honest feelings of its readers. One more royal soul has joined the triumphant band. The name of Frances E. Willard rests like a blessed benediction over the lives of those who are struggling to burst the fetters of that demoniac power,the liquor traffic. As President of the International Temperance Union she won immortal laurels. May the mantle of her zeal and consecration rest upon those who are left to continue the battle she so nobly led! March has commenct its record with a quiet demeanor that is not generally ascribed to its character. Hope it may continue, as we are ready to welcome the beautiful spring with its birds and flowers. Hot-beds are being prepared and the sowing of seed and its care will be the business to occupy the mind of your correspondent and his co-laborers. Hamilton DeGraw.
