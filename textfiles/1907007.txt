LIFE. Chancy Dibble. It has been said that life and its responsibilities are really more solemn than death. Life to answer its object must be a constant application to duty, watchfulness and care. Neit ler wealth nor luxury affords happiness. Those who keep nature's laws and live in compliance to their light are an honor to humanity, but a life conformable to the fashions of the world is full of selfishness. We are singular inasmuch as we follow him who was not selfish or worldly. To be a true Christian it requires a brave heart. Jesus has told us so. To overcome evil habits and be renewed to a perfect life is not attained by selfish indulgence. The allurements of a worldly life are treacherous. Passional excesses are constantly shortening the life of human beings. It is these excesses which Christianity has to contend against. Christianity follows to resurrect the spiritual part, to mature and consummate man and woman's glory and happiness. It is the harvest of the ripe fruits of humanity. Surely none will cast the arrows of malignant spite against those who are enlightened to live above the follies which are sinking the race below the animal. Watervliet, N. Y.
