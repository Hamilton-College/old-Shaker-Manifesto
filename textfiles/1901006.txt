RAMBLING THOUGHTS Abraham Perkins Happiness is the pursuit of all men. How singularly strange the course of many to find it! Unto this most valuable and inestimable prize, heaven opens the door. There only is to be found genuine peace and durable comfort. He who appeals to the natural instincts of his own unregenerated heart for happiness is sure to fail in the enterprise ; while he, who in his life is governed by the revelation of light and truth unto him manifested, putting his trust in God, is equally sure of success. No honest individual will be left in darkness. Though the struggle be long and the conflict severe, in his research for happiness supreme, a wise provision is made to accomplish the object sought; ultimately, man will be led to the knowledge of all truth. As true as there is a God, so sure is he to fulfill all his promises to man ; for he hath declared, that whosoever seeks him shall find him. Therefrom we are to learn, that such receive the baptism of the spirit of God and come into possession of the elements of eternal life. Such have found the Comforter, a balm for every wound and woe. He who fosters the spirit which courts mortal frailties, who dwells upon human weaknesses, whose strong sympathies are with the weak and faulty, is exposed to become blind to truth and a subject to the same spirit. Thus the miud becomes shrouded in darkness, the soul is led irresistibly into error and the affections are alienated ; all of which combined, culminate in ruin. The wise will beware of sympathizing with the murmurer, fault finder and complainer, and will shun the idler, the gossiper and the traducer of character. Their friendship is as deadly as the poison of asps or as microbes which cause the immense suf- fering and mortality to so many of our race. ( Enfield, N. H. *
