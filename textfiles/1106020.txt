FOUR GOOD RULES One is : always look at the person you speak to. When you are addressed, look straight at the person who speaks to you. Another is ; speak your words distinctly. Do not mutter or mumble. If your words are worth uttering, they are worth pronouncing clearly and distinctly. Another is • do not say disagreeable things. If you have nothing pleasant to say, keep silent. A fourth is — and, children, remember it all your lives — think three times before you speak once. Have you something to do that you find hard and would prefer not to do? Then listen : Do the hard things first, and get over with them.
