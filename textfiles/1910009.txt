Father Joseph Meacham gave the Believers very particular lessons... Father Joseph Meacham gave the Believers very particular lessons in regard to honest dealing. In the selling of horses or cattle or any live stock it was right to inform the purchaser of any fault or defect in the beast, which would not otherwise be known. If in a bargain both parties were ignorant of the value of the article in trade and if the Believers subsequently ascertained that the other party had been wronged, it was their duty to make it right. As an illustration, he spoke of some timber that the Believers bought and found it was worth more than the one who sold it had supposed it was worth. Father Joseph recommended the Brethren to make good to the man the present market price of the article. [The above by Father Joseph Meacham is an excellent lesson in practical righteousness. It is the gospel of 'glad tidings,' to teach humanity to man, and is also the fulfillment of that testimony through Jesus,ï¿½ 'Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.' Ed.]
