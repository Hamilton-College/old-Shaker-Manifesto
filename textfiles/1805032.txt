FROM NEWTON'S LETTERS. 'An humble and teachable disposition, a pious, upright, and benevolent temper of mind are incomparably of greater worth, than all the accomplishments and possessions of the world; and they are the only attainments which in all degrees of knowledge, and in every station and condition of life will procure the divine favor, and advance us to real honor and happiness.' The above sentence is a beautiful truth, and should be implanted in indelible characters on the mind. I love such sentiments. I will cultivate them to the utmost of my ability.North Union, 0.
