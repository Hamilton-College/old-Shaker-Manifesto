RELIGION and SCIENCE, No. 2. HARVEY L. EADS. God did not choose the learned to give the gospel to the world, but He ' hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them unto babes. ' These facts should be enough to satisfy every inquiring, and discerning mind that the ' grand departments' introduced to out notice have nothing at all to do with the ' basis of the temple of pure and undefiled religion.' But I would not disparage a literary, philological or other intellectual education, but again deny that they contain even the germ of pure religion. Pope said, ' A little learning is a dangerous thing, ' and so is much learning to the self conceited and aspiring mind, but no amount, be it little or much, is dangerous to the meek, modest and unobtrusive mind. But as nothing merely intellectual can benefit the spirit, the scientific study of music, poetry, analogy, psychometry, etc., must be ruled out. If they had been absolutely necessary to spirit culture Christ would not have neglected them, innocent and harmless though they be ; but devotion, revelation, contemplation and prajer Avere his constant companions and the very essence of* his God-serving life. While it is admitted that extreme and constant study in any direction may be injurious, I would say the spiritual was the least dangerous ; and I would by no means discourage spiritual study on account of its dangerous tendency. I doubt much if any person ever became a maniac by this study who maintained the Christ-like and child-like spirit. It 0$ only those who are puffed up with selfconceit snd aspire to be something more than mortal that are in danger of becoming maniacs ; but many have had their reason dethroned by undue excitement caused by the pictures given of a world of hell-fire with devils for firemen, and such like, by fanatical pulpiteers and others. All such things should be avoided and discountenanced. It is to be hoped that none will be afraid to let the mind run on spiritual things. We may do the best we can in this direction and still find it difficult to prevent worldly things from entering in at times and occupying a seat where they should not. Hence, says Christ, 'Watch ye therefore and pray always. '�[Luke xxi., 3(L] The more we study spiritual things and put them in practice the more happy, angelic and useful we will be. The maniac will not touch us while possessing the obedient, child-like spirit of Christ, who said: ' Whosoever shall cot receive the Kingdom of God as a lit6le child he shall not enter, therein.' ('Mark x., 15.] In order to succeed we are required to, give to God the ' whole mind, might and strength, ' without reserve, every moment of our existence. All such, God will direct, protect and prosper. Such one or ones can be relied on and followed with more safety than all the wise-acres of the earth blended together. 'But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, of a contrite spirit and trembleth at My word.' [Isaiah Ixvi., 2.] So God has always looked and blest, and ever will. Therefore would I say to all who enter His kingdom on earth cease to look after or covet the intellectual and mechanical greatness of the world, which is the Apocalyptic Beast whose tail of pictured pleasures have ' drawn down the stars of heaven,' and, alas ! is yet but too successful. The only safe and sure way for all is. to look to God in the order of His appointing. Any who reject the gift of God, there, because of a lack of scientific knowledge will find some day the great mistake they have made, and learn the fact that 'to be carnally-minded is death, but to be spiritually-minded is life and peace. ' Finally, let me add a last parting word, and tell, without the charge of egotism, vanity or dogmatism, what we, the followers of Christ, know, that others may be benefited by the same. We know that God has set up His kingdom on earth. We know that we and all who live the Christ-life are in it. We know (don't think us vain,) with the Apostle John, that ' we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. '� [1 John, v., 19.] We know this because we have consecrated soul and body to His service and are not moved by any selfish purpose. The unselfish is of God ; the selfish is of man. We know the world is diseased�' full of woundsT �and bruises and putrefying sores from its crown to the soles of its feet. ' We know there is a place where all can be healed and purified, aiid this is within God's kingdom, and we say, ' Ho ! every one that thirsteth, come,' but come not for a material but a spiritu-il union and joining with the body of Christ. Those who have a material joining only are in danger of falling away every day that this condition continues. There is no real safety for any until they become quickened into spiritual life. One more word in deep humility and I am done : To have God's blessing all must respect and give heed to his Order, for God, though of long forbearance, will not be trifled with. No branch, division or family can prosper and have God's blessing whose leaders possess not the childlike spirit of perfect dependence upon it, and keep a close union and connection with it. The taking our own judgment independently thereof, or concealing from it in auy way, presages decadence and makes prosperity impossible. ' By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life. ' [Prov. xxii., 4.] This being true makes the contrary poverty, dishonor and death. South, Union, Ky.
