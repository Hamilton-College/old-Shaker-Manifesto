East Canterbury, N. H. March, 1897. With the coming of spring, comes s.mie very pleasant anticipations. We are thinking of the maple syrup harvest, altho we may not be able as a Society to enter into its manufacture. We are thinking of the return of the singing birds, as their presence exerts a salutary influence upon a great many minds. We are thinking of milder weather, after a long, northern winter and of the flowers that will very soon bud and blossom to our very great pleasure. Already the days have increast in length (March 8,) two hours and thirtyone minutes, which blesses us with so much additional light; and light adds much to the life of the world. When this number of The Manifesto reaches its readers, the day's increase will have reacht not less than three hours and forty minutes and the sun will shine upon us so early as twenty-nine minutes past five, in the morning. Before that date reaches us, we are promist more snow-storms, more high winds and more rain, with an accompaniment of colds and coughs. As they can not all come on any one day, we must devise plans for our personal protection. We will think kindly of the winter that has given us a liberal supply of snow, and made many hearts glad, and has also frozen the water in our lakes some sixteen inches, so that our ice-houses have been filled with an article of the best quality. Henry C. Blinn.
