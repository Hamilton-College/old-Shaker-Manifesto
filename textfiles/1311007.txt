AUTUMN. MARY WHITCHER. The Autumn leaves are falling, My heart expands to sing This is a solemn warning To every earthly thing. We've had our day of Summer, And Spring-time in, its place, And soon must meet the Winter, In honor or disgrace. If we have stored our garner And precious wheat lies there, We have no fear of hunger Or feelings of despair. The God of justice ruleth, And giveth to each one According to their labor, Or timely service done. Canterbury, N. H.
