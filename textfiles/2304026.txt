Ayer, Mass. Mar. 1893. Once more the sun shines upon us. After the storm comes a calm. I sympathize with dear friends who have ex- 98 THE MANIFESTO.1 perienced for the last week what we have here in Massachusetts, in the line of snowstorms. For five days we have had two yoke of oxen and a pair of horses trying to make the roads passable again, and yet they are anything but good roads now. But perseverance, no doubt, will bring about good results. It has been quite different with us from what it was with Sambo. When his master was complaining of the rainy weather, he looked up into his master's face with his familiar smile and remarked:�'More rain, more rest, Massa.' With us it has been, more snow and wind, more hard work, Massa, But it is a long lane that has no turning. Our little boy after shoveling snow most of the day to make a path to draw his sled, exclaimed,�Well, it will be summer after awhile and then we wont have any snow to bother us. A good thought to look for the sunshine under every cloud, though the thought comes from a child. In our divine service on Sabbath morning, we sung the piece,� Joy and peace are my sunshine, And no day so overcast, But I catch the silver lining Shining through the stormy blast.' Could we think of this in the time of trial and look for the rift in the cloud where the sun is shining, I think we would many times, find joy in the trial instead of gloom and despondency. Trials grow by dwelling upon them, like the snow ball, the more you roll it, the larger it grows, and the more we carry trials in memory the less we have of the spirit of Christ. Dear Elder Henry, your last Editorial meets the feelings of our people, and the more we keep that spirit, the more growth we shall have temporally, as well as spiritually. In the world, but not of the world. Having so much of the spirit of our gospel that when duty calls for association, we carry our principles with us, and not come down from the cross. I admire true patriotism in any class, and especially among those who call themselves soldiers of Christ. A coward is one of the meanest things of God's creation. Out-door business is quite at a standstill, as we are trying to finish up with our woodpile. A. D. Barrett.
