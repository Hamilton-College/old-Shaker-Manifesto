THE CHRIST ' I will not ask my neighbor of his creed, Nor what he deems of doctrines old or new, Nor what rights his honest soul may need To worship God, the only wise and true; Nor what he thinks of the Anointed Christ, Nor with what baptism he has been baptized. ' I ask not what temptations have beset His human .heart, now self-debased and sore, Nor by what way-side well the Lord he met, Nor where was uttered,' Go, and sin no more.' Between his soul and God that business lies, Not mine to cavil, question or despise. ' I ask not by which name, among the rest That Christians go by, he is named or known; Whether his faith has ever been professed, Or whether proven by his deeds alone. So there be Christhood in him, all is well, He is my brother, in peace we dwell. ' If grace and patience in his actions speak, Or fall in words of kindness from his tongue, Which raise the fallen, fortify the weak, And heal the heart by sorrow rent and wrung. If he give good for ill, and love for hate, Friend of the friendless, poor and desolate, 'I find in him discipleship so true, So full that nothing further I demand. He may be bondman, freeman, gentile, Jew, But we are brothers, walking hand in hand. In his true life let me the Christhood see ; It is enough for him, enough for me.'
