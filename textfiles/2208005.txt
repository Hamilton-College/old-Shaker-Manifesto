William Wilson, Beloved Brother:--I hear of you a good report... Mount Lebanon, N. Y., June, 1892. William Wilson, Beloved Brother : I hear of you a good report from various quarters. It is said, that you have discontinued eating the corpses of your fellow creatures, whether they have four legs ol- only two, and that you have entered into a covenant of peace with all herbivorous animals. And that if the Egyptian craving for flesh meat should, for a short season, again assert itself, you will restrict the desire for 'evil things' to the carnivorawhich are evil. The lions, leopards, catamounts, hyenas, dogs, cats, bears, wolves, foxes with skunks and hogs. These animals being carnivorous, cannot justly complain if carnivorous men and women eat them. But when human beings, the heads and lords of creation imbue their hands in the blood of lambs who 'lick the hands just raised to shed their blood,' unsophisticated nature protests, revolts against it. The herbivorous cattle on a thousand hills look to man for protection against the ferocious cruelty of carnivorous animals. Many instances are on record of wild birds and helpless herbivorous anhiials fleeing to human beings when pursued by their natural enemiesthe carnivora. On one occasion, Mother Ann was brought into deep tribulation and realized her mission as being to all God's creation and said: 'O that the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air and all things that have life and breath, yea, all the trees of the forest and the grass of the fields would pray to God for me! ' In that spirit would she rise from her knees and kill to eat? I trow not. She was beingtaught of God, and was baptized as a Mother indeed to all the creation of God. As such, she would not 'hurt nor harm' any thing that she called upon to pray for her. Whence come wars and fightings, persecutions and inquisitions, come they not of lust the lust of eating and drinking and the sexual lusts ? War will not cease to the end of the earth until, 'Thou shalt not kill,' is recognized as the first and great command in place of 'multiply and replenish.' Non-resistant religious sects, as Mennonites, Moravians, Essenes and many other names, of. which Babylon is full, have always been a prey because they departed from fashionable iniquity. Would vegetarian celibates, communistic non-resistants, ever have had a 'Salem witchcraft,' or 'St. Bartholomew massacre' and have exhausted the national resources of all Christendom in raising armies and navies and building forts and barracks on land, and immense monitors and war ships on the ocean ? As a man eateth and drinketh so is he. The Jews, coming out of flesh eating Egypt, fasted forty years from flesh eating. They did this as a nation. Their food was purely vegetable. It changed the character of the people, and separated them from all the peoples on the face of the earth. They are like the Gulf stream, that runs through the ocean, warming and fructifying, but not mingling with its waters, Israel dwells alone and is persecuted by all nations and people. John, the forerunner of Jesus, ate the honey-locusts and wild honey; 'he came neither eating nor drinking' like other people. Jesus fasted forty days to cast out of himself the carnivorous appetites latent in him as a human being. He was an 'overcomer.' He ruled over all the elements of which he was constituted. Dear Brother, peace, the peace of God be with you and abide. Know that the power of changing old and perhaps inherited habits is of God. It should be highly prized by those who have it. How else can we become new creatures ? Conscientious consecration of doing right and 'swearing' to our own heart and changing not,' is an inestimable blessing. It brings the kingdom of heaven within our own souls. What is the increasing with the increase of God, but perpetual daily change from bad to good; from good to better? We have the whole human race to redeem and have eternity to do it in. F. W. Evans.
