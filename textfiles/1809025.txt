Editorial. CONFESSION. There must be more or less efficacy in an honest confession or the followers of Jesus would not have made it a subject of so much importance. So long as men trespass againsf the law of God, or against their fellow men, so long will there be need for confession of these faults. It is quite to the poir:t that the apostle James says, ''Confess your faults one to another, and pray for one another.' Some people talk very loud about confessing to God, whom they never knew, while they hesitate to make confession before a gospel brother. The entering into the secrecy of the closet would lose much of its value, if a listener was knewn to stand at the door. We well agree with the apostle, that confession and prayer are so closely conjoined that the one would seem quite unfinished without the other, as in humble, penitent confession we walk with God. And as 'every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess,' to God, it is wisdom to approach that pure spirit so near as we are able, and unburden the mind before the greater light, in the presence of a witness. Nothing will cure a fault so thoroughly as to make it a subject of confession to those before whom it was committed. Mother Ann Lee taught that the first step in obedience to spiritual light, was an honest confession of our sins to God, before a witness. The benefit to be derived from this form of active repentance has been well understood by those who have accepted a religious life. To some extent, it has been carefully guarded from age to age, ti'l it reached the time when men were taught to 'Do unto others what ye would that they should do unto you.' In this, the confession of our faults, one to another, became a Christian obligation, and no less, the praying of one for another. It is a matter of great importance that we take the first step in the gospel work aright, or we may fail to be successful in those which are to follow. According to the word of the New Testament, John the Baptist had his followers confess their sins at the time of thenbaptism, and this agrees in full with Acts, xix. ,18, when the people who would be Christians, confessed their sins and showed their deeds. An unconfessed Christian must be quite like the wicked city as seen by the Revelator:ï¿½'The hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean bird.' Rev. xviii., 2. In our gospel order, the confession of sin has been accepted as a revelation from the spirit of God, and those who were appointed as witnesses sought to impress this fact upon those who availed themselves of the privilege, that every confession must be made to God. The testimony of Jesus bears upon this point as he says, 'There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed : neither hid that shall not be known.' Whatever is revealed must be brought to the light, and the followers of Christ are the light of the world. To those who receive the gospel testimony, as in the advent of Jesus, an honest confession of all siu before God, is the 'door of hope' for salvation.
