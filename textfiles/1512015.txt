PRAYER. HANNAH E. WILSON. What devout mind does not love to commune with its Grod ? How sweet at twilight to steal softly away from all busy haunts and there with humbleness of heart, and contrition of soul, lay our needs before God, feeling that blessed assurance that his ear is ever open to tiear, bless and refresh the needy thirsty soul. O how sweet to come to him as a tender Father ; for, ' Like as a fathei pitieth his children so the Lord pitietl them that fear Him.' Sweet consolation for children of earth to feel the compassionate love of a tender Shepherc who carries the lambs in his bosom, as it were, and gently leads the flock to verdant pastures and living streams. 0 that I may so carefully walk, keeping so closely within his fold, as to hear his gentle voice directing my feet. Though storm-clouds may threaten they cannot destroy while under his Almighty protection. Canterbury, N. H.
