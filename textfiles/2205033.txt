Chief Points of Difference Detween Intelligent Hindoos and Orthodox Christians. They do not believe in the inspiration of the Bible above that of any other so- called sacred book. They say: ''The true scriptures are twothe volumes of nature, and the natural ideas implanted in the mind. The wisdom, power and mercy of the Creator are written on the universe. All ideas about immortality and morality are primitive convictions rooted in the constitution of man.' They do not believe in divinity of Christ. They say: 'God himself never becomes man by putting on a human body. His divinity dwells in every man, and is displayed more vividly in some. Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, and other great teachers appeared at special times and conferred vast benefits on the world. They are entitled to universal gratitude and love.' Indeed our doctrines of the Trinity and the divinity of Christ, are stumbling blocks to the native mind, and the Christian missionary often finds himself involved in unprofitable discussions as to the comparative merits of the Hindoo triad and the European Trinity, and the comparative evidence for the incarnation of Chrishna, and the incarnation of Christ. The uneducated native prefers, if he is to have a triad and incarnation, to keep his own. The educated native thinks that triads and incarnations, belong to a stage of mental development which he has passed. This is the testimony of scholars as well as missionaries who have lived longest in India.
