INVOCATION TO PURITY JANE CORNELL O heaven-born spirit on whose radiant brow, The impress of Gfod's very nature rests ; From whose clear eyes shines forth a holy light From which the demon vice draws back abashed ; Whose presence brings an atmosphere of heaven. To thee I longing, pleading cry, For thee my spirit yearneth ; To thee my whole heart turneth ; With answering grace draw nigh. Spirit of purity within my heart, Sacred to thee an altar wiJl I rear ; Where daily, willing sacrifice I make, Of passions that rebel against thy sway, And human loves that turn the heart from thee. And when before this shrine I bend, And up to thy bright spheres, Incense of prayers and tears From the soul's censor swung, ascend, Oh spirit come ! Accept the sacrifice, Consume the offering with celestial fire ; And with thy cleansing power my soul baptize, Free me from carnal passion's cruel strife; And from the wily tempter's snare, Purge me from stains of earth; And for the heavenly birth, My struggling, suppliant soul prepare.
