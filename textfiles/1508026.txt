THE FRIAR'S WARNING There was in olden times in Naples a convent of the Dominican Order, where the rule was but carelessly observed, and in which a spirit of pride and self-indulgence was creeping in among those who had promised themselves to the service of God. It was however the purpose of the Almighty to bring this community to a state of perfection, and thus a vision was granted them which aroused them to a spirit of greater fervor. One day when the brother whose duty was the care of the refectory, went to make ready for dinner he beheld, to his surprise, a number of religious sitting on the benches, perfectly motionless, but there was something so terrifying in their stillness that his very flesh seemed to creep with fear as he gazed on them. Then running to the Prior, the brother told him what he had seen, explaining that these strangers who were in the refectory gave him such awful sensations of fear that he suspected they must be demons from hell. The Prior was alarmed, and, after a moment's thought, he called the community together, and bidding them follow him to the church, he took out the Blessed Sacrament, that it might be carried in solemn procession to the refectory. He entered, followed by the brethren. Yes, it was indeed true, there sat the strange friars; but as the Prior advanced, bearing our Divine Lord in his hands, they rose and prostrated their forms to the ground, and again seated themselves as silently as before. Then said the Prior, ' In the name of God, who is here present, tell me who you are and from whence you come, and what you desire. ' The strange company immediately threw back their hoods and displayed countenance. )lackened as if by fire; then they opened heir habits, and the red flames were seen onsuming their very bodies, and one of them poke these terrible words :� 'We are all your brethren,' said the voice: 'behold us who were once priors, ub-priors, masters, and lpaders; and we are all eternally lost!�Lost for our contempt of poverty, for our neglect of rule, for our pride, our slothfulness, our self-indulgence ; and we have come here to warn you, lest by ike sins you come into like condemnation. ' Striking a blow upon the table, the strange company disappeared. But their visit of warning was not thrown away, for it sank so deeply into the hearts of the brethren that they became models of piety and perfection, and never afterwards gave way to the promptings of their lower nature.
