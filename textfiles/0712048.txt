'NOT IF IT WAS MY BOY!' Some years ago the late Horace Mann, the eminent educator, delivered an address at the opening of some reformatory institution for boys, during which he remarked that if only one boy was saved from ruin, it would pay for all the cost, and care, and labor of establishing such an institution as that. After the exercises had closed, in private conversation, a gentleman rallied Mr. Mann upon his statement, and said to him: ' Did you not color that a little, when you said that all that expense and labor would be repaid if it only saved one boy f' ' Not if it was MY boy,' was the solemn and convincing reply. Ah! there is a wonderful value about 'My boy.' Other boys may be rude and rough; other boys may be reckless and wild; other boys may seem to require more pains and labor than they ever will repay; other boys may be left to drift uncared for to the ruin which is so near at hand; but 'My boy,'—it were worth the toil of a lifetime and the lavish wealth of a world to save Mm from temporal and eternal ruin. We would go the world around to save him from peril, and would bless every hand that was stretched out to give him help or welcome. And yet every poor, wandering, outcast, homeless man, is one whom some fond mother called, ' My Boy.' Every lost woman, sunken in the depths of sin, was somebody's daughter, in her days of childish innocence. To-day somebody's son is a hungry outcast, pressed to the very verge of crime and sin. To-day some body's daughter is a weary, helpless wanderer, driven by necessity into the paths that lead to death. Shall we shrink from labor, shall we hesitate at cost when the work before us is the salvation of a soul t Not if it is 'My Boy;' not if we have the love o Him who gave His life to save the lost. —The Common People.
