THE SHEPHERD BOY MADE KING. 8eraion Ity llev. Julian ML. Mcu.vtli at 's CSti-iwtian Union. Eev. Julian K. Smyth of the Swedeuborgian Church, Roxbury, preached a sermon of impressive interest at the Young Men's Christian Union. The subject of the discourse was, 'The Shepherd Boy Made King,' 1 Samuel, xvi, 12. The anointing of David, said the speaker, in preference to his brethren who were only outwardly beautiful, represents the selection of a ruling principle of life which is spiritual. There comes a time when, having seen as it were our bodily nature fairly established and in the exercise of its powers, we must select a new king or ruling principle of life. It is a crisis in every man's history. It is the period when the Lord seems to say, 'You must be born again, ' that is from above. You have your education, you are fairly launched upon some occupation or business, and now7 if you are to be a true Christian man you must come wader the rule of some higher principle than you have followed before. You must struggle for something truer and grander than you have struggled for yet. We all know the tendency to shun this crisis, to go on in the old way as long as possible, to complain with Nicodemus that this new birth is impossible. And what we have to. complain of ourselves most of all is incompletenessï¿½never hearing the cry which issues from angel's lips through every rift in heaven, 'come up hither.' Young people, this lesson belongs to us. It appeals especially to us. We have all lived under Saul's dominion. We inow what it is to come under the control of the world and of the body. We have tasted, no doubt, something of the sweetness and the bitterness of this world's life. And now are wre not ready for something better? Have we not reached the point where we can take a distinctly higher view of life? Can we not work from a'higher motive than we have ever had before? Can we not deny ourselves for a higher purpose than ever before? Can we not bear temptation, and suffer, if need be, with a higher strength than ever before? If you believe that each day has its influence upon our life, then each day lived selfishly, each day lived carelessly, each day lived sinfully, is throwing us back in this tremendous race, and making the future full, full of difficulties. And if these days of ours which come and go so quickly have such a serious bearing upon our after life, is it not time we set before ourselves one holy aim and nerve ourselves to be true to it ? As the surest guide to all life's questions and as the truest inspiration to all willing hearts, I ask you to ponder the example of Him who deigned to enter into the perplexities of our youth. W hat was it broke from his lips when, at twelve years, Joseph and Mary found Him in the temple? 'Wist ye not that I must be about my father's business?' The divine purposes of His sinless life were already shining biightly in the mind of His humanity and leading Him into that perfect life which it is our highest glory to follow. And all through the after years this same devotion to one great end is always visible. In the example of our Savior, not less than in this story of David's anointing, we seem divinely urged to select a holy principle of lil'e and then to be constant to it, according to our Lord's injunction : 'Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.'
