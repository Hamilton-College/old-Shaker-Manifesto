Calais, Vermont, June 7, 1874 Dear Shaker and Shakeress : I have, at last, found a paper which teaches C%m£-religion. I have had the privilege of reading several numbers of your paper, of late, and am pleased with them. I am almost a Shaker. My Heavenly Father has given me light of what is to be in the future: THE FUTURE. There is a time, not far ahead, When all intemperance is dead, When holy angels will descend, and every knee to God will bend, His righteous judgment be confessed, And all true Christians will be blessed—The Lion, by the Wolf caressed, and with them, will the Lamb be blessed, And little children lead the throng, With Hallelujah their best song—Peace—sweet peace, to man be given, Withnever a war, in Earth, nor Heaven—A cleaned up Earth, unmarred by vice—With one new Church all sweet and nice —By Love to God, in man inspired. No man-made laws will be required —Behind old creeds, there'll be no hiding-^No need, when all are law abiding—When, in God's image, all complete, Is man—including Helper meet—Then all the Stars may skip and play, and spread the tidings far away.
