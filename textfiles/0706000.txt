The Virgin Character ELIZABETH MARTIN 'They who have kept their spirit's virgin whiteness Undimmed by folly, and unstained by sin, And made their foreheads radiant with the brightness Of the pure truth whose temple is within,â€” They shall see God.' 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.' This beautiful beatitude of our Savior contains an allimportant theme for contemplation by the true religionist; for as breath gives vitality to the whole body, so should purity of heart and life invigorate and vitalize the soul, the fountain from whence flows love to God, good-will and good deeds towards all mankind. It is the pure oil of religion, which, lighted by divine love, sheds perpetual light on the pathway of life. As the term virgin signifies pure, it may be applied to any perfectly pure substance as virgin gold, virgin soil, virgin snow, meaning pure gold, pure soil, pure snow; so the term virgin character, including both sexes, means pure men and pure women. The term celibate, as illustrative of the pure life of the Shaker, is not sufficiently broad to define the real basic principle of our institution ; for there are many celibates, while there are few virgins. The one prime element of the virgin character is love to God; this permeates the whole being ; the imaginations, thoughts, desires and aspirations are all heavenward. The virgin cannot deal falsely, for he loves his neighbor as himself, selfish, for he sees the He cannot be ima^e of God reflected on every object, and is only satisfied with pure, active benevolence, pure truth and pure love, as. the governing principles of a pure life throughout.
