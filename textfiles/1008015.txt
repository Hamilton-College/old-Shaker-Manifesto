I desire no display at my funeral... Ames Several days before his death, Bishop Ames said to Gen. John S. Berry,'' I desire no display at my funeral. I would have a plain coffin made of live oak and trimmed plainly with trimmings of galvanized iron. Let there be no flowers on it. The tendency to extravagant and useless parade at funerals in this country is getting to be a great and growing evil, and I wish by my example, as far as possible, to inaugurate a different state of things.'
