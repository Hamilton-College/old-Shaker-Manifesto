A TRUE MAN. Oh! for a man that will stand up and say, I want to be good, honest, virtuous and upright, loving my neighbor as myself, helping my fellow-man along the rugged road of life, simply frona a love of doing these things for their own sake, and not because he fears eternal torture in hell, and hopes for a reward of a golden crown in heaven !�Paine. The above are our sentiments exactly. How much the world needs more such men� and women too ; those who can be trusted, who, when they deal with us, will deal honorably, give us good weight and measure, fulfill their obligations, speak the truth; in short those who can be depended on, and show by their daily life that they possess a heart�and a conscience too. Such people are what this world needs, rather than those who spend so much of their time in professing to believe that they are to be rewarded in the next world for doing nothing worthy of reward in this world.
