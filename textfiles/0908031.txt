Mt. Lebanon, New York Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. â€” Improvement is the order of the day. The Church family have erected a barn 40 by 120 feet, located one mile west of their dwelling. Other new buildings are in course of completion here. Gravel roofs have had their day, and the North family are dismantling one on barn on Rice farm. The most convenient and perfect of laundries has lately been completed here. Very sorry to hear of dangerous illness of Brother Thos. Smith. Sister Dolly Saxton has completed her round of 104 years, and is happy and as ' lively as a cricket.' Her memory is good.
