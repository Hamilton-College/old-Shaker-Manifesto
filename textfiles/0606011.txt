LINES FROM ANNA WILLIAMS, AGED 93 Go, little messenger, carry the word — Proclaim the good news — the work of the Lord I Go, comfort poor souls, as monthly they read, How brightly and clearly, you Zion's cause pleacl. To us who are aged, you come with good cheer; By the young you are prized as a friend wise and dear; To all, may you be, a bright, shining light, An accepted guide to the true Christian life. My love and my blessing shall go where you go, To the rich and the poor, the high and the low; My prayers shall go with you, o'er land and o'er sea, As you carry the gospel of Mother Ann Lee. Thank you, Mother Anna, and accompanied by the precious anxiety you are feeling, The Shaker will bless many souls ; and while they read, may they realize the truth that ' the prayers of the righteous avail very much' for their success,
