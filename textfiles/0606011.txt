KINDLY REMEMBERED A few days since we received from an aged, gospel mother —Anna Williams —some lines expressive of her feelings concerning our little messenger—The Shaker. We give them below. While we call to mind many Sisters at Mt. Lebanon, who are more than 70 years of age, we are particularly reminded of Sister Sarah Bates, almost 90; Anna Williams, 93, and Dolly Saxton, who, ere these lines are printed, will celebrate her more than hundredth year! Not long since, Sister Abigail Munson did the same. It is very pleasant to know that these, and nearly all our aged, are especially attached to The Shaker. LINES FROM ANNA WILLIAMS, AGED 93 Go, little messenger, carry the word — Proclaim the good news — the work of the Lord I Go, comfort poor souls, as monthly they read, How brightly and clearly, you Zion's cause pleacl. To us who are aged, you come with good cheer; By the young you are prized as a friend wise and dear; To all, may you be, a bright, shining light, An accepted guide to the true Christian life. My love and my blessing shall go where you go, To the rich and the poor, the high and the low; My prayers shall go with you, o'er land and o'er sea, As you carry the gospel of Mother Ann Lee. Thank you, Mother Anna, and accompanied by the precious anxiety you are feeling, The Shaker will bless many souls ; and while they read, may they realize the truth that ' the prayers of the righteous avail very much' for their success,
