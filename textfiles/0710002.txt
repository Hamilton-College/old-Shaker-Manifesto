THE GREAT DELIVERANCE WATSON ANDREWS Deep gratitude fills my soul, all my days now, for the precious relationship [ hold with my dear brethren and sisters—whose hearts are warm to the core with a mighty love—filled with a pure, unselfish love, which time changes not, and the long, glad years of eternity can -&gt;ut make brighter and stronger. Unto my soul, in the soft, sweet hush of the morning, comes a thrill of joy at my great deliverance. Once, 'I was lost; now I am found ; was dead indeed, but am alive again !' Twenty years of dissipation had plunged me in the ' gulf of woe,' where I slept, but to dream of coiling serpents and frightful pitfalls; and awakening only to realize a deeper, sadder sense of what I had lost! Then came repentance, tears and cries to God for mercy. And mercy came. Not in that aid which crusaders against the wine-cup can give ; for the pit of my loss was deeper. Not in the solace which pecuniary success affords; for my want was not for gold ! Nor yet in the siren song of a vicarious atonement could I find rest; for it wanted the power to break my chains and to bine my enemy. But it did come in that small, still voice: 'Cease to do evil; learn to do well.' It came in a knowledge of the followers of Jesus, the Christ, and in a privilege to follow whom they followed. It came through the confession of my sins, accompanied by a power to forsake my sinful ways. By practicing, in a good degree, for many years, the pure life and habits of Christians, I have gained that peace and rest to ray soul which nothing earthly can give, and nothing—but sin—take away. Having neither gold nor silver to offer, I present this, my two-fold experience, to the needy ; hoping by these 'footprints on the sands of time,' they ' seeing, may take heart again,' and to realize my great deliverance, ' go and do likewise.'
