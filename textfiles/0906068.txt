Make Your Own Syrups To make a gallon of syrup of beautiful whiteness and crystal-like transparency, such as is known in our markets as silver drips, or rock candy drips, there are required eight pounds of refined sugar, such as is known by its various names and grades of A or B or extra C, and costing from 10 to 12 1-2 cents per lb., according to locality and distance from the sugar refinery. To this quantity should be added three pints of boiling water, and the whole subjected to slow boiling for a period of fifteen or twenty minutes, after which the solution, while warm, should be strained through a fabric of moderately close texture. This will produce a gallon of syrup, at much less cost than the price demanded in market for the grades of syrup named. For a light yellow or golden syrup, the same quantity of light brown sugar may be employed, and so on through the lower grades of sugar and syrup ; but no grade of sugar can be found which will produce so worthless an article as the Cuba molasses generally offered in our markets.
