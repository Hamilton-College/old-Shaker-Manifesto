Let us come down to the rock of utility... F. W. Evans Let us come down to the rock of utility, Standing most firm on the basis of truth, Manhood, henceforth, retain its virility, Woman enjoying perpetual youth. Shaving the face to disfigure the mien, Banding the feet to cripple the body, To fashion or habit, tho' right it may seem, Will bear not the test of wisdom or study. If four hundred millions, for ages and ages, Have failed to destroy the least vestige of truth, When left to herself, if nature produces Right beautiful feet at the moment of birth. Why is it that mortals continue to marry, Well knowing that nature they cannot deceive; The shape and the size are not 'golden lily,' But perfected pedals, like Adam and Eve. Tho' fig leaves may alter, or fashion may vary, From crinoline skirts to this or to that, Yet change not the model, if white, black or hairy, Of child, man or woman, to suit a fiat.
