Are you doing any thing to publish... Are you doing any thing to publish and scatter Gospel tracts ? A tract which costs a penny may save a soul. And tracts can be multiplied by millions if means are fur nished to pay their trifling cost. Some can write tracts, others can publish them economically, others can pay for them ; others still can distribute them judiciously, and so all can be helpers in the work, and sharers in the blessing.
