Duffey, after five years of close investigation of spiritualism writes as follows:ï¿½There are two phases of the so-called spiritual manifestations, which under my study, proved utterly abortive.

I only affirm that in my limited experience I found them plain, palpable, unvarnished frauds. Progressive Thinker.
