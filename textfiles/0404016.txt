It is argued that woman is not in servitude... It is argued that woman is not in servitude, because she voluntarily places herself in cer- tain positions, and chooses her own condition; therefore, to her it is not bondage, but freedom. We would ask, Are not the organic laws of the land, and the usages of society, such as compel some women to accept conditions that would otherwise be repugnant to their feelings ? Before American chattel slavery was abolished, its abettors claimed that thousands of the negro slaves did not desire emancipation; that they so loved their masters, under whom they served, that they could not be induced to leave them, and accept of freedom. Freedom for woman has a deeper and broader signification than is generally supposed. There are gleamings of light upon the subject; but as yet, many who think they have advanced ideas, and understand the matter well, will find, as light and truth increase, that their present views are undefined and chaotic. That woman is measurably a willing slave, while she panders to fashion, and yields herself, without constraint to libidinous desires, and seeks to satiate sensual passions in herself, or in others, we will not deny. We pray that a divine power may descend from the heavens, that will open the eyes of those who are spiritually blind, and shake both priests and people, and awaken them to a consciousness of the real conditions and needs of humanity at the present time.
