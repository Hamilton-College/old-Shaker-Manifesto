Beloved Ministry:--Sweet, balmy, beautiful spring has come... South Union, Ky., 1863. [The following letter will interest the readers of 'The Manifesto,' in that it was written in a time of deep anxiety, when the country was filled with war and the rumors of war. Ed.] Beloyed Ministry :ï¿½Sweet, balmy, beautiful spring has come. All the spring birds are here and make the air vocal with the music of grateful praises. We have kept the Blue Jay, the Wren, the Bluebird, the Crow, the Yellow-Hammer, the Buzzard, the Robin, the Mocking-bird, the Dove and some others, with us all winter, but their little pipes were occasionally frozen, or so chilled, that we had no music outside, only the howling winds through the tops of the pinetrees. Now mild spring is clothing nature in her vernal dress and outside of the doings of man, all is 'charming, sweet and lovely.' Happy birds, happy all things which violate not the laws of God. With these ideas floating through my mind, I try to poise myself sufficiently to answer your most beautiful, excellent and welcome letter which arrived safely. What a miracle it was that it got through so soon. We have had no mail for so long, some good spirit must have induced the Post-master at Bowling Green to send it down. It met both our wants and feelings, but you almost made us envy you in your quiet, happy retreat, blest with the spirit power and gift of God. We have no mails yet, from want of agreement between the P. O. Department and the agents of the railroad, but we can get a letter sent by taking it to Bowling Green a distance of fifteen miles. How I should be pleased if I could continue my letter t*ud wind up as you have done on some pleasing and encouraging theme; some pleasant edifyiug topic. Alas! this is denied me. The New Year has rolled in with the Western Hemisphere baptized in blood and the surging waves pass and repass alternately over our otherwise peaceful domain. Soldiers ^lad in the habiliments and paraphernalia of war, continually pass throng]) our streets in companips of from 5 to 500 at a time. Some exciting scene is continually transpiring in our immediate vicinity, as the familiar phrase goes, 'a little blood letting in a legal way,' or arson, robbery or murder. How would you feel, to have a company of soldiers quartered on your premises to protect you, and then say, you feel glad that they are with you? This nearly approaches our present case. About the time you would see the whirling, lurid flames licking up buildings and devouring property on your borders, it would almost cause some to pray, 'Lord send us protection by the hand of whomsoever thou wilt.' You have doubtless seen a notice in the papers of the burning of our depot three fourths of a mile south-west of our Village with its stores of grain. The corn burned brightly and cast a glare of light on our buildings for twenty four hours after the torch was applied. On being informed that the guerrillas had fired our depot, and not having, at this time, the fear of man before, my eyes, I with another brother hastened to the scene. We found two young men there who had been detained and sworn, at the peril of their lives, to do nothing towards extinguishing the flames. The young men were true to their oaths, and did nothing, though both were interested, as their fathers had property there. We found the depot in flames, and three government cars on the switch, loaded with stores also burning ; dry rails burning on the cow pit of the main track. Our first business was to destroy the fire here so the train could pass up to Bowling Green. This we soon succeeded in doing. Three large rail pens of corn, a few rods from the depot, we also saved by throwing water on them. By this time a good many neighbors had arrived and a few more Brethren ventured out. We pushed the burning cars apart and saved one of them with its cargo of wheat, and with considerable labor, saved the main track of the railroad. We have some buildings on the north of the railroad. The Confederates broke in one of the windows when the captain asked the young men, 'To whom do those buildings belong?' They said, ' The Shakers.' He remarked, 'I do not wish to destroy the Shakers' property,' and forbid their being burned. He and his company, leisurely rode away, and were just out of sight when we arrived at the fire. Since then, they have probably learned through the papers that the Shakers aided in saving government store and property. Since the burning of our djpot, the Confederates have burned twenty one cars freighted with mules, mostly, at Woodburn eight miles south-east from here, driving off a part of them and burning some in the cars. A short time since they robbed a near neighbor of ours of six hundred dollars. Some six or eight surrounded his house, two went in with a pistol in each hand and made Barnett, the neighbor, get out of bed and get the money for them. After they had got all they could, they asked Baruett if there was a rope about the house that would answer to hang him with? He said he thought there was one that would answer. They did not tarry for this purpose but made good their escape with their booty. One or two of the robbers were caught and one killed in trying to make his escape, but no money obtained from them. A sad casualty befell some scouting Federals, three or four miles south-west of us. Capt. Owen, with a small party, called at the house of a Confederate and while they were there, an unknown individual, informed Capt. Johnson, (also Federal) that there was a company of Confederates at the house aforesaid, whereupon, Johnson and party made a dash upon the house, shooting and killing Capt. Owen and wounding one of his men before the mistake was discovered. So you see we are surrounded, environed on all sides by blood and fire, as it were on the verge of a volcano, which may momentarily be expected to give way. To all human appearance, some future sufferings await us. What its shape may be, we can fear, but cannot conjecture. Trusting in God, we calmly wait its development, hoping, nay believing, that we shall not have to suffer more than we are able to bear, or than what will be for our ultimate good. As it is now some demoralization attends us, and as the prayers of the righteous avail much, we trust you will not fail to remember us when you make your offerings, sometimes, in the holy sanctuary. We thank you from our hearts for the prayers already offered in our behalf, and for your love and bless- ing. You have by inspiration, or otherwise got into the merits, or rather the comprehension of my case. You have depicted it truly. It is a wonder how you could do it so well without absolute experience. There is nothing that can break and obliterate the ties of early lite. Here were all my joys and sorrows until I reached the top of the hill of life or very nearly so. At the same time there is a tearing up and a planting process to pass through. Oue hardly knows, until they have the trial, that they could be in love with poor hills, knobs, stones, trees, broeks, ponds, and other natural things, let alone our own kind. Later things do not take quite so deep a hold ou the affections. The one is vernal, the other autumnal and last of all comes hoary winter. One is strawberry time with sweet singing birds, purling brooks, green fields, sweet-scented flowers, aud spicy groves ; the other L-&gt; nutting time, autumnal leaves, hallowed breezes, and lastly grave-yards. Then again a brighter era beyond, for all who are faithful, but a dismal region of woe for the unfaithful. It is some singular to hear of a mild winter with the mercury at fifteen degrees below zero. Our winter has not been so mild as the previous one. We have had two extraordinary snow storms. One fell to the depth of eleven inches and it was eight or nine days before it all disappeared. One very cold night the mercury fell to zero. So we were enabled to get some snow-ice nearly three inches thick. The other deep snow was about five inches. Otherwise we have had mild weather, and very bad, yea shockingly bad roads of slush and mud. How we all did wish Br. David Parker had made his way through the lines to this place. Could I only have known when he would reach Louisville I could have piloted him down here, aud back again. It seems his sainted presence at the city of Babel did not have the effect of preventing the passage (if the papers are to be credited) of a conscription act including Shakers aud Quakers. The New York Herald now calls upon the Shakers, to ' right about face.' Shoulder Arms ! or else pay three hundred dollars for substitute. I think some little difficulty will attend the carrying this into effective operation. You hope we have passed the liugeriug deatli to which we have been subjected. I have still thought our greatest trials and sufferings were yet future. The carrying out of what is termed the emancipation proclamation will create an effervescence in Ky., the like of which has not been seen, but we say, the Lord's will be done though the heavens fall. Your Brother, H. L. Eads.
