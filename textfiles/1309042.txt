'I expect to pass through this world once; if therefore there be any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do for any fellow human being, let me do it now, let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.' A good rule to live by, and if all should adopt this precept what a happy world this would beâ€”'A heaven here and now.'
