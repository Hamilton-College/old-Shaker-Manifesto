LAW The Law was holy, just and true. What Law? The Law of Physiology—through obedience to which, the God of Israel promised his people that he would take all sickness away from the midst of them. The Statutes and Ordinances of Moses were given, because of the hardness of men's hearts, being a compromise, between the primary Eternal Law of Eight, and the existing habits of the People called Jews — descendants of Abraham. If it be asked, How could God thus condescend to humanity ? — the answer is. Their God was a Tutelar Deity — was God, to them, as Moses was God to Pharaoh. He, it was, who gave the people their request, which sent leanness into their souls — who gave them laws that were not good, and statutes, whereby they should not forever live. ' Behold the day cometh that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, saith the Lord. Not according to the covenant I made with them when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.' There was a discrepancy between the primary law, and the law in use. It was the penal law that Jesus was the end of — not the original, everlasting Law of God, which is forever operative in the elements of which all human beings are composed. Of this Law, Jesus said, ' Think not that I am come to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it — for I say unto you, that Heaven and Earth shall pass away, before one jot or tittle of Law shall fail,' — the Law that was holy, just and true and good.
