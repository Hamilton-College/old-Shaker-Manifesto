THE SENSATION ABOUT HEBREWS ' Grod is no respecter of persons; ' but He is of characters, and in His dealings with humanity will make this thoroughly understood. For any human being in this intelligent age to attempt to stir up a spirit of caste, merely and solely upon the grounds of nationalities or religious persuasions, is worse than foolish, and very reasonably merits the censure, odium, and disgust, of all fair-minded humanity who have the least milk of human kindness yet remaining in their souls. Such was the opinion of the grand majority, when, last year, the very inferior, puerile Hilton refused human civilities to a noble Jew ; and now another miserable, rich man named Oorbin, is making a very disgusting historical record, by a similar persecution of those who, as a class, are very much better than he is. He will be severely punished by the good sense of a right-thinking humanity. Jesus, who became the Christ of His day, was a Jew; and yet we scarcely ever think of His Hebrew lineage in our extreme admiration of His beauti- ful character. Had he been an Irishman, or even an American, it certainly would make no difference to us, so that He was such an unequaled model of chastity and heavenly nobility.
