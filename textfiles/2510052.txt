The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health In The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for September a phrenograph of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, from a personal examination by the editor, occupies the first place, and explains the elements of character which have made her an eminent reformer. Several fine portraits accompany the description. 'How Three People Did Europe Afoot,' by George C. Bartlett, is the first of a series of letters from Europe which illustrate the possibilities of cheap living abroad, and promise to be exceptionally entertaining. 'The Scientific Relation, Past and Present,' by Dr. H. S. Drayton, will be especially acceptable to scholars. The Rev. Stanley Mercer Hunter argues eloquently and logically for phrenology as a definite science of character. Mrs. Charlotte Fowler Wells concludes her interesting sketch of the Rev. Joseph A. Warne. 'Proportional Brain Development,' by Albert Zimmerman, contains ideas of practical value to phrenologists. In the department of Child Culture Prof. Nelson Sizer gives bright descriptions and excellent advice concerning 'Pets of Several Homes.' 'Modern Education and Morality,' by Dr. Drayton, is timely and will appeal strongly to teachers. Under Science of Health several hygienic problems are discussed. In the editorial pages Doctor Beall introduces the subject of 'Fellowship Among Women' and quotes certain views likely to arouse controversy among the fair sex. 'Phrenology and Penology' are also considered, and a physiognomical study is given, with illustrations, of the mouths of Edwin Booth and Adelaide Neilson. $ 1.50 per year.
