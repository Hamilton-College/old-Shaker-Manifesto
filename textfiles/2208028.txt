Canaan, N. Y. The crops are promising even if rather late. Peas are doing quite well, while our cherries are a failure. And then our strawberries, well, I must say, we do not know how to raise them. Nature is attending to those that grow in the field, and the Sisters have gathered a good suppiyWe have commenced haying by cutting ' a field that has been fruitful in daisies. Probably we shall need an extra favoring this season, as we have fifty acres of grass to cut. Two and one half acres of buckwheat, seven acres of rye, six acres of wheat, fourteen acres of oats, seven acres of corn, three and one half acres of potatoes and two and one half acres in the garden, making in all ninety-two acres, and but a small company for such a large field of labor. The Sisters have had a busy time during the spring, and are now engaged in the painting of windows. They may get through bright and early about next ISTew Tear's day. June 30th. and we are having rain, rain, rain. I do not know but that we shall be swamped. We have put explicit confidence in Hicks, in 'Word and Works,' where he said that after June 25th., we should have a dry warm spell; so on to the 28th. we cut some grass and daisies, and sure enough before it was finished, it began to rain and we have not been able to do anything with it since, and have concluded to let it rain, so long as it will. July 2nd. was a pleasant day and we secured the hay that was in the field. We shall try to coax in a binder to help us through the rye and wheat harvesting, if we may be blest with some fair weather.
