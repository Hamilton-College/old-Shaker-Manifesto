AMENDE HONORABLE AND NOTICE Our excellent friend, Eld. John Whiteley, of Shirley Village, Mass., reminds us that he renewed his offer to send a copy of ' The Divine Afflatus ' — an excellent little book — to every one sending him sixty cents for a year's subscription to The Manifesto. In calling attention to this beautiful offer, we beg pardon for neglecting the same in our January issue. — Ed.
