THE BEST WE CAN When things don't go to suit us, Why should we fold our hands And say, 'No use in trying, Fate baffles all our plans.' Let not your courage falter, Keep faith in God and man, And to this thought be steadfast— 'I'll do the best I can.' If clouds blot out the sunshine Along the way you tread, Don't grieve in hopeless fashion And sigh for brightness fled. Beyond the clouds the sunlight Shines in the Eternal Plan; Trust that the way will brighten, And do the best you can. Away with vain repinings; Sing songs of hope and cheer, Till many a weary comrade Grows strong of heart to hear. He who sings over trouble Is aye the wisest man. He can't help what has happened, But—does the best he can. So, if things won't go to suit us, Let's never fume and fret, For finding fault with fortune Ne'er mended matters yet. Make the best of whate'er happens; Bear failure like a man; And in good or evil fortune Do just the best you can. New York Ledger
