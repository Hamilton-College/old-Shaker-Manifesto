MY BELIEF. LEOPOLD HOHMAN. An all embracing Mother heart and Father intellect Which permeating nature, universal, endless space Is ever conscious of the tiniest creature's ends and aims Providing gifts of love and wisdom with a lavish hand We're free to make or mar, to grovel, sit or soar Our characters to build, our now returns no more.
