Nails --Many persons are puzzled to understand what the terms ' fourpenny,' ' sixpenny,' and ' tenpenny ' mean, as applied to nails. 'Fourpenny' means four pounds to the thousand nails, and ' sixpenny ' means six pounds to the thousand, and so on. It is an English term, and meant at first ''tenpound' nails (the thousand being understood), but the English clipped it to ' tenpun,' and from that it degenerated until '' penny ' was substituted for pounds.' When a thousand nails weigh less than a pound they are called tacks, brads, etc., and reckoned by ounces.
