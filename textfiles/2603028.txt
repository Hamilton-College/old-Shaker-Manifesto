NINEVEH BROUGHT TO REPENTANCE. Clara Wilmarth. When Jonah came out of his dark, damp prison he must have felt humble and repentant; and when the Lord told Jonah to go and preach to the people of Nineveh a second time he did not run away, but set out on his journey at once. He entered the city crying, 'Yet forty days and Mneveh shall be overthrown.' This duty must have been very hard for Jonah, but the power of God was with him. It took him a long time to go through that large city. He felt repaid for his work however, for on the first day the people began to repent. The king himself was one of the first to repent and he sent a message throughout the kingdom for all people and cattle to eat no food and drink no water. The king took off his royal robes and put on sackcloth; instead of sitting on his throne he sat on the ground with ashes on his head and all around him. This was a sign of deepest grief; but God would not have pitied them if they had not repented. This lesson should teach us to repent of our wrong-doing. God will ever be with us if we ask him and give us strength to do right as he did to Jonah. Hancock, Mass.
