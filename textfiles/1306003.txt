Hope 'WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO. HOPE. I place my ruler where I wish to mark, It casts a heavy shadow there, so dark,â€” I cannot see, yet it will guide aright, If I but turn the work toward the light. I cannot see through all the clouds to-day, But if I turn and go the other way, Perhaps 'twill clearer be and God's sweet smile Will not be lost by shining through the mist, But beaming brightly o'er me all the while, My heart will be as flowers by sunlight kissed.
