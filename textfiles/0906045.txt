Please, Sir, Don't Step There A layer of snow was spread over the icy streets, and pedestrians, shod with India rubber, walked carefully toward the village â€¢church on a cold Sabbath morning in February. Walking somewhat hastily churchward for I was late, I noticed a bright looking little lad standing upon the pavement, with his cap in his hand and his eyes fixed upon one spot on the sidewalk. As I approached him he looked up to me, and, pointing to the place, said: ' Please, sir, don't step there. I slipped there and fell down.' I thanked the philanthropic little fellow, and passed round the dangerous spot. ' Don't step there ' was the theme of my meditations during the remainder of the walk. A thousand times since has the clear voice of that kind-hearted child rung in my ear, reminding me of my duty to those around me, and urging me to repeat it whenever it promises to be useful. ' Please, sir, don't step there.'
