CONDIMENTS The powerful inflaming influence of rich, highly-seasoned foods is well known as a fact of observation. It may be well, however, to consider briefly the physiological facts upon which this influence depends. The effects of mustard, pepper, and other condiments upon the sexual organs are so well recognized by physicians that they are always prescribed in all cases of acute disease of these organs, as in gonorrhea in men, and they enormously increase the flow of blood to these parts. The reason is very evident. The irritating oils to which the special properties of these condiments are due are eliminated by the kidneys, and hence, being concentrated in the urine, affect particularly the genito-urinary organs. In the case of capsicum, cayenne pepper, mustard, and similar condiments, the indigestable particles which contain the acrid oils are carried along down with the food and deposited in the rectum, where they produce congestion, irritation, and resulting catarrh and hemorrhoids, as well as increast sexual excitability.â€”Temple of Health.
