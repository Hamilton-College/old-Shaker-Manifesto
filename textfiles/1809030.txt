WOMAN VOTING. F. W. Evans. The Tribune says 'women do not want to vote, and therefore the woman suffrage bill should not pass.' What right, except that of power, have men to prevent woman voting? Is it not as much the right of women to decide who shall and who shall not vote as of men? If man arrogates to himself the decision it proves his egotism and ignorance of first principles, not his right. The present race of fishes in the Mammoth cave do not want the sunshine. They have no eyes. Unroof the cave and let in the sunshine ; it will create eyes in the next generation of fishes. Pass the woman suffrage bill arid women will soon see the duty and beauty of voting. Why does not the Tribune apply the same logic to non-voting women that it used to apply to the slave who did not want freedom, but hugged the chain that bound him? The inalienable rights of freedom and voting do not depend upon the will or the choice of the slave or the non-voting woman. Like life itself they inhere, as duties in human nature. Suicide is an indictable offence. 'Who would be free, himself must strike the blow.' The slave who spurns emancipation and the non-voting man or woman of the world, class themselves with infants and idiots whom the state should care for until the child is of age, and the man or woman becomes sane. If doctors would take enough of their own drugs it would soon stop their insane efforts to deprive citizens�free Americans�of the right to medicate either themselves or their friends. Let us all do as we would be done by. Let woman vote and every man and woman be their own physician.
