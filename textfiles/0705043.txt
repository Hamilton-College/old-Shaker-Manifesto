THE USEFUL GLEN An Invaluable Hint. Soon the farmers generally will be engaged in plowing. We wish, now, to inform farmers of a fact so simple that they will wonder why they had not thought of it before. A fact so useful to know, that it will, on trial, be considered invaluable. Believing that it belongs to farmers without the restriction of a patent, we first make it known. It is the discovery of R. M. Wagan, of Mt. Lebanon Shakers, N. Y. It wholly concerns the coulter. Invariably this has been applied obliquely, pointing away from the plow. Reverse this position of the coulter, give it a drawing instead of a pushing cut, and strange as will appear on trial, you save at least one horsepower ! We never use a knife in cutting as we apply and use the coulter. Run your knife through a bar of soap as the coulter is commonly used in the sod; then draw your knife through the soap, and some idea of this invaluable hint will be apparent. By making this public, we preclude the possibility of its being patented. Now, farmers, send our publisher a club of subscribers for The Shaker ; for, on trial of the above hint, you can well afford to do so. Stable Floors. The Scientific Farmer says of stable floors that it is common to pitch them back from one to four inches for purposes of drainage. This is all wrong. Any inclination to the rear is injurious, for the reason that the oes of the animals are thereby turned up, and the back sinews, especially of the foreegs, kept in a sort of unnatural tension. If here is any pitch at all in the floor, it should be to the front instead of the back. Weights and Measures. Number of founds to the bushel recognized by the United States.

The whole secret consists in steaming the leaf before steeping. By this process, it is said, fourteen pints of good quality may be brewed from one ounce of tea.' 'Delmonico uses one and a hali pounds of coffee to a gallon of water pouring the hot water upon the coffee which is placed in a strainer. The 1 coffee is never boiled.' N. Y. Herald.
