PURITY L. CLAPP '' Pure as the crystal waters, White as snow my soul shall be; When the struggle is completed, And from earthly troubles free.' This was the aspiration and happy thought that filled my mind while in sacred worship this morning; a cherished hope of freedom and releasement from sin ; a triumph over the earthly inheritance ; with a robe made beautiful and pure by an upright life, of honest endeavor to do my Christian duty before God. O, Purity ! in the depths of my soul thou hast an abode, the germ of a spiritual life imbedded in the heart's deep soil; beneath the light and brightness of heavenly beauty, mayst thou blossom as the beautiful rose of Sharon. As a star in the firmament, ever constant and enduring in its course, so would I have purity the all-controlling power of my life. I would be ever aspiring, through the sunshine and storm, up, up to the heights of virgin excellence ; to an atmosphere where the spiritual element matures into the loveliness of the angel life.
