HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 14. DRESS, Continued. As those who entered the Society wore high heeled shoes, the custom was continued for a great many years. The uppers were generally made of cloth, while the heels were formed from blocks of wood and neatly covered with leather. The shoes were secured to the feet by straps and shoebuckles. In 1787 a hat braided of straw and styled a 'Chip Hat' was generally worn by the women of the country and continued in use till 1805. It was covered, inside and out, with black silk. The crown was about one inch deep, covered with a band of silk of the same width, wThich was formed of fine plaits across the band. Silk ribbons were attached to the crown and brought down over the brim and tied in the rear of the neck. The brim of the hat was not less than six inches wide. From the Chip Hats, the change was made to simple bonnets, similar to those worn by the Friends or Quakers. These were made of pasteboard and covered with light colored silk. The crown was made wholly of cloth and fitted to the head by plaiting, but were made without capes. In 1827 the bonnets were made of palm leaf, and trimmed with a small silk cape and ribbons. There are many items of less importance about the fashions, forms and colors of dress, quite too numerous to mention. The subject of dress has always absorbed a great deal of attention, time and money. Our dress is of great expense to us and much more, no doubt, than real necessity demands. CLOCK MAKING. This occupation has been followed in the Church from its origin, sufficient for the use of Believers. At first the knowledge, as well as the machinery and tools were very limited. When the Society wras organized only three clocks were in use in the church family. In 1796 the number had increased to seven. The first alarm clock wTas made in 1812, in the Society at Watervliet, N. Y., and one was sent to New Lebanon as a present. There has been a gradual increase in the number of clocks till at this date, (1858) we have some eighty-five in the first family. As the manufacture of clocks increased in this country, the business became quite unprofitable, and the Believers chose rather to buy them and use their time on ï¿½ some other branch of business. Watches were not admitted into the Society for many years after its organization, but began to be introduced about the year 1835. In 1838 watches were wholly laid aside and for several years no covenantal member was known to have one in possession. One of the objections made to the use of watches, was on account of the great expense that would be brought upon the Society. As time moved on, however, there was an anxiety growing for a time-piece that could be carried from place to place. This was partly relieved in 1849 on the introduction of spring or balance clocks. As watches became more abundant in the country, and at prices more reasonable for the masses, the Believers again urged their introduction and in 1860, six were in use in the Church family. Branches of Business introduced at a later date. The preceding occupations went into operation at the time the Society was organized as indispensable for the support of the members. HAND CARDS. The making of hand cards, for the carding of wool was introduced in 1793. The business nourished for several years, but gave place to the introduction of machine cards at the close of the last century. During the continuation of the business, ali the available help of the first*family was secured. Even the farmers and teamsters would eagerly catch every spare opportunity to assist in the setting of the card teeth. All the family were very much interested in the work, and their mornings and evenings and even the few minutes while waiting for their meals were utilized in this employment. Through this means there was a surprising amount of labor performed and the return for this was so much needed in the Community home. In 1815 a man by the name of Whitmor3 invented a machine which made ti;e teeth all at one process, which soon rendered the hand work of the Believers quite unprofitable. Wire drawing for the use of the teeth of cards became a necessary branch of business. At this date there was a great scarcity of wire in this country, and most of it must be obtained from England. When the war broke out between England and the United States in 1812, the Society was induced again to manufacture their own wire, but the attending difficulties and the cheapness of the machine cards caused the business to be wholly laid aside.
