Alfred., Me. Apr. 1893. The days pass swiftly and each day brings its round of duties, still there seems to be little of interest to write about. The cold weather wore its welcome out long ago, but it lingers with us. Here and there can be seen snow, just enough to remind us of what has been. We would like some warm, pleasant weather after all the cold we have had. Brethren have finished sawing and splitting the wood, and will soon be busy on the farm. Strangers often inquire about our school, so think it would be well to copv from the Town Report, what it has to say about it. 'This school in its well furnished and neat room, thorough and experienced teachers, tidy and obedient pupils, maintains its well established reputation as an excellent school, and is a credit to the Society of Shakers as well as the town.' A few days since we bid farewell to our aged father, Merrill Bailey. Another noble soul has gone to meet the reward of a true and upright life. Blessed indeed are such souls, and well have they earned the joys that are theirs. But as the pillars of Zion one by one pass to the Better Land, we cry from the depths of our souls:ï¿½ 'Lord, send forth more laborers into the field, Sustain them with power from on high.'
