NOTES ABOUT HOME Mount Lebanon, N. Y. April, 1893. 'April now appears A child of smiles and tears.' So says the poet, and so we say, when realizing how little we know from hour to hour what weather to expect. Mark Twain in humorously describing New England weather, says he has counted one hundred and thirty-six kinds of weather inside of twenty-four hours. This can be literally true when we consider that all the weather we have is inside of some twenty-four hours; there is no other place to have it. Be that as it may we agree with Mark Twain when he says, that New England can not hold all her weather, it is bulging out on every side, and that is why we, who are so near the border line, are favored with such a variety. On the 4th inst. the mutterings of distant thunder were heard, and the air seemed sultry. On the morning of the 6th we awoke to find one of the most beautiful weather pictures of the year, spread out before us. The ground was covered with snow eight inches deep, which had fallen so lightly, that the most slender twig had its share, without disturbance. When the sun rose the clouds fled, and over all this whiteness, was the brightest blue dome of sky that ever bounded our vision. As we gazed about us with delight, we could easily imagine that we were in fairy land, or were looking at a panoramic picture, so perfectly calm were all the forces of Nature. But this part of the panorama was soon designed to move on, and at noon of the 7th we were wading knee deep in as severe and blinding snow storm as we cared to experience, over paths which an hour before were innocent of even moisture enough to call for rubber overshoes. This, too, soon passed away, and the 8th gave us a succession of electric storms with heavy rain, from 11 a. m. until 3-30 p. m. This is variety enough, we think, to suit even the most changeable, and we can all enjoy the part we like best. But what a commonplace subject for Home Notes. The weather�which all know so much about. What else can we write of? Spring? Every one knows about that also. Wood is being sawed and split? That part of the programme always comes with the bluebirds and robins. One special blessing is ours. Beautiful flowers in our dwelling house all winter, made a possibility by our steam heat. If steam heat does have its unpleasant feature, we forgive and forget it all, when we realize that no place is too cool for the growth of some plant. The best part of it all is the interest and care given them by some of the elderly people, who intend to live in the beautiful Now, ignoring the custom of frequent comparison between Now and Then. Those who live in Tuen, will never see the advantages of Now. Says the writer, 'We need not be prophets, or apostles. The commonest life may be full of perfection. The duties of home are a discipline for the ministries of heaven. Amelia ,/. Calrer. Shakers, N. Y.. North Family. April, 1893. One of the sure harbingers of spring that we have longed for has arrived, viz., the song birds. How pleasant it is to hear their sweet notes in the early morning. The robins and bluebirds are among the best of our native song birds. This must be classic ground if we are to judge by the number of crows that are congregated here. The author of 'A Plea for Purity of Language' has conferred a great benefit upon fellow mortals in the compilation and publication of that article. Wish it could find a place in the columns of every paper in the land. We feel rebuked and admonished to have our language more in accordance with the testimony there given. The old adage that 'persons are known by the company they keep,' can also be 120 THE MANIFESTO. applied, that persons are known by the language they use. Our beloved Elder Alexander is at Sonyea, settling up unfinished business. Left the 13th of March, but we have not been without a shepherd. The more we study the subject, the more convinced we are that psychological influences are a strong factor, and wield an important influence in human lives. Ever since our admittance into the Society, we have realized to a greater extent than ever before, the influence of the Mother spirit. Being the earthly home of our founder, her strong personality has impressed itself upon the place. May we that are young drink deep of that maternal inspiration to the uplifting and consecrating of our lives to this holy faith. How blessed it is that Brethren and Sisters can dwell together in the bonds of pure love, where the elements of the old creation never enter. May we walk with a humble and pure heart so as to be worthy of that relationship. Hamilton DeGraw. Canaan, N. Y. April, 1893. We venture, this month, to cast in our mite in all humility of spirit, small though it seemeth. The beautiful spring-time is approaching; the time to prepare the soil and sow seed. This we are actively engaged in. But not material seed in earthly soil alone would we sow, we have sowing and planting of a superior kind to attend to. We have an interesting company of young people in our family, who form what they call 'Our Educational, Ethical, Floral Circle.' Educational, because it afford; opportunities for education. Ethical, because good manners and morals, culture and refinement are included. Floral, because each member is designated by a flower name symbolic of brightness, cheerfulness and innocence. The circle denote equality as all have equal opportunities, equal advantages and are equally compensated by making equal exertions. They hold meetings bi-weekly in which very interesting original articles are read, poems and dialogues recited, and one subject discussed verbally at each meeting. Music vocal and instrumental is added. One of the members is chosen to preside over the neeting whose duty it is to make out a written programme which she gives out at each meeting assigning a task suited to the age and ability of each one. We feel anxious to sow this garden with good seed, to have the rain of heaven (spiritual baptism) descend thereon and the bright rays of God's sunshine (eternal truth) beam upon it, that beautiful plants may be brought forth of knowledge, wisdom, righteousness and peace; blessed fruits of the heavenly kingdom, and we therefore humbly and earnestly solicit the prayers and good feelings of our gospel relation in our and their behalf. We can not afford to give all our time and attention to the maintenance of these physical bodies. We feel pressing upon us the responsibility of transmitting the testimony of this beautiful gospel to other souls that they with us may help to carry on the grand work of human progress and redemption. We fully indorse the ideas of Elder O. C. Hampton and are ready and willing to curtail our wants to our necessities and thereby gain the much desired time for mental and spiritual development; but do not as yet see clearly how matters can be changed and satisfactorily adjusted, but hope the good time is not far off. Emily Offord. Shaker Station, Conn. April, 1893. The Apostle asks the question: 'What is your life?' He was speaking of the brevity of life; but the question may be asked in connection with our every day life. Does the life correspond with our profession? It certainly should. Christ tells his followers to let their light shine. If we are the salt of the earth let us show our preserving qualities. If we are the light of the world, let us shine. Let us attend to our duty; do the work THE MANIFESTO. 121 required of us, and we shall receive the 'well done' at last. Each day brings its duty, and if we do those things that should be done, we shall have no time to do that which is wrong. O the glorious victory that is sure to come, makes the burden lighter on our journey home. May is always a busy month and every day should be improved to the best advantage. Brain work tells better than muscle. We should not try to till too much land, to do less and do it better may be the wisest. When spring comes it does not last long, so we must spring to the work. Nothing is gained by planting too early. The secret of having eggs in winter is to have pullets hatched in March or April that they may be fully matured before cold weather. Leghorn pullets hatched in April should lay by the first of November. The profits in poultry as in everything else, depends on proper management. Hens pay cash for all labor bestowed on them. Good judgment in feeding hens will produce good results. Too many chickens should not be kept in one flock. Daniel Orcutt. April, 1893. We once more welcome the spring days with the merry voices of the buds, and gladly bid adieu to ice and snow, although the past week there has been a cold storm with three inches of snow which hastily disappeared being rather late for service. The roads are now passable. Spring work will doubtless come forward rapidly as ploughing has commenced. Our potatoes have sold readily the past month without any effort to dispose of them. Painting and repairing our dwelling hotise &amp; being pushed forward with rapidity, and the improvement of the heating apparatus is now considered a good labor saving improvement and gives perfect satisfaction. Health prevails, and this blessing with every other so bountifully bestowed, causes our hearts to overflow with thankfulness and gratitude to God for his love. Maria Witham. Ayer, Mass. Fight your own battles. Hoe your own row These words were spoken to me when I was quite young, and struggling under difficulties that seemed almost impossible to be removed. No one can so well help you as you can help yourself, unless they are equally interested in you. If you have a job of work in hand, put yourself into action and do it, and you will find much better results than to wait for some one to come along and do it for you. The man or woman that is to succeed in tliis life must be filled with push and principle. Be it spiritual, intellectual or physical gains,�they are as sure to succeed as night is to follow day. In a more worldly point of view, it is not the man nor woman who has had a thousand or thousands at the start of life, that has benefited mankind the most; but it is those who have worked their way to the top of the mountain. Who have had push and principle enough to go ahead, regardless of slander or ciiticisai from those less resolute. Life at best is a battle from the cradle to the grave and it is by decision, by character and by courage that the price is won. We must have decision and courage in a spiritual growth. Let us show our courage and our strength of character. We have placed before us principles far more precious than gold or silver. Let us contend for the imperishable treasures with the same zeal as did our forefathers, that we may inherit the legacy that they have left for us, as disciples of the Christ. We gladly welcome the merry songsters of the spring, after a long and severe winter. Our houses for wood are filled and our door yard put into order. The chips and rubbish from the wood pile are all carried into the house. Andrew Barrett. Enfield, N. H. April, 1893. With the assurance that a long and dreary winter has taken its flight, comes an added joy, that since our last contribu- 122 THE MANIFESTO. tion to the Manifesto, the harbinger of death has not invaded our home, to take from our midst either Brother or Sister; an experience unknown to us in the several months that have passed; and now we may speak only of the living whose presence we are blest daily to enjoy. Nothing of remarkable interest is moving at present date; each succeeding day brings its measure of care and burden with willing hands and hearts for needed service. We are now in the midst of the maple harvest anticipating everything sweet for a time at least. About seven hundred trees were tapped which, for the most part, have yielded quite abundantly. If the weather continues favorable we may derive some profit over and above the time and labor given. We are likewise having some repairing done incident to this season of the year. The bakers' oven is undergoing repairs; also masonry work at the laundry which required greater safety as well as convenience. Other improvements are under consideration and may receive attention in course of time adding beauty to our home and surroundings. Sisters are as ever engaged in their several occupations where duty calls, striving to keep the house in order as best they may. Health of our family quite good at present time; a blessing we know how to appreciate. Our kindest love and interest we would that all might share. Julia Russell. Canterbury, N. H.

April, 1893. I can not begin these Notes without referring in thankfulness to God for his �wonderful workings in the hearts of his people, which are abundantly manifested in our hours of worship. The sharp and powerfully inspired testimonies of consecrated souls must be of a cleansing character for the holy, living temple of God, whose temple we are. The world looking for something it can not find, must yet come to Zion to hear the living word of the Lord. As Brethren and Sisters in Clmst, O let us all be fully alert to duty's call and to our active possibilities, that we may be able, when souls flock to our open windows, to have suitable abodes of righteousness, where we can receive and successfully care for them. The little leaven possessed by the small band of Believers on earth is to be the redeeming substance of lost humanity. The pearl of great price has been entrusted to our keeping; let us make a wise disposition of its benefits. As the seasons revolve bringing us the anxious seedtime, let us as expert sowers, give due attention to the thorny and stony places as well as to the good ground, and we can come again with rejoicing from a plentiful harvest bringing our sheaves with us. Although we are emphatically told to put our hands to work, it is not in the faithful performance of the daily duties alone, but when that is supplemented by giving our hearts to God, then we secure the full results of our mission. Our dairy supply of milk, cream and butter has maintained a uniformly superior showing, all through the late severe winter, thanks to unusually good stock management. The dooryard is at present the scene of some degree of activity in sawing, splitting and housing about six hundred cords of fire wood, the work being done by the Brethren, with the help of several hired men. Spring being backward with us, ploughing will not commence for some time yet. Our water supply naturally gave us considerable anxiety during the intense cold weather of the past winter; but trouble was altogether averted by the adoption of timely preventive expedients. The water THE MANIFESTO. 123 used in all of our houses and barns is forced to a distance of fifty rods and a height of one hundred and ten feet by a six inch cylinder and twelve inch stroke, Douglas force pump, run by a ten foot overshot water wheel with a continuous speed night and day of fourteen strokes a minute. This supplies us with about thirty barrels an hour, which is deemed insufficient for our present needs. We contemplate making improvements in the near future. Albert Evans. Sabbathday Lake. April, 1893. To-day the weather seems a little flattering and we are too ready to believe that winter is over. Cold weather has continued up to this time with but few moderate days; and spring is surely a month later than it was last year. We have lived through a very cold winter. Is the earth approaching another great glacial period? It seems like it. The night of the (5th inst., about midnight, we had a storm of rain, then hail and snow, with heavy thunder and lightning. The barn of one of our near neighbors was struck and a cow killed, but the barn was not burned. On reading the notes of last month's Manifesto, we see that our Brethren and Sisters, generally, have experienced trying times with the freezing up of the water pipes. We have had the same trouble with ours. Pipes laid four feet under ground have frozen and it will be some weeks yet before they can be repaired. Our Brethren have lately purchased an eight H. P. portable engine to take the place of a smaller one, which was considered unsafe, from the throwing of sparks; and had to be forced to do the work required,�that of sawing wood and cutting ensilage. They would like to be running the sawmill, but the logs are encased in several feet of ice which has not even begun to break around the shores of the mill-pond. Last year they commenced sawing the fourth of April with no ice to be seen. We have lately received a large order for sweet corn seed, which we shall furnish at three dollars per bushel, and the Brethren are hastening to have it in readiness when called for. All are aware that the season is approaching when we shall be surrounded by people from every nation, and realize the importance of being armed with that spiritual strength which will administer to them instead of receiving of their spirits. Ada S. Cummings. Alfred., Me. Apr. 1893. The days pass swiftly and each day brings its round of duties, still there seems to be little of interest to write about. The cold weather wore its welcome out long ago, but it lingers with us. Here and there can be seen snow, just enough to remind us of what has been. We would like some warm, pleasant weather after all the cold we have had. Brethren have finished sawing and splitting the wood, and will soon be busy on the farm. Strangers often inquire about our school, so think it would be well to copv from the Town Report, what it has to say about it. 'This school in its well furnished and neat room, thorough and experienced teachers, tidy and obedient pupils, maintains its well established reputation as an excellent school, and is a credit to the Society of Shakers as well as the town.' A few days since we bid farewell to our aged father, Merrill Bailey. Another noble soul has gone to meet the reward of a true and upright life. Blessed indeed are such souls, and well have they earned the joys that are theirs. But as the pillars of Zion one by one pass to the Better Land, we cry from the depths of our souls:� 'Lord, send forth more laborers into the field, Sustain them with power from on high.'
