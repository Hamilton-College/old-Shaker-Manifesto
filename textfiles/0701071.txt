Plain Talks There is a loud call for a new edition of OUR little pamphlet-' PLAIN TALKS I' and just as soon as we can get sufficient encouragement from Novitiate Elders, we will issue a large edition. Elder H. L. Eades, South Union , Ky., says of this little work: 'In my judgement it is the best work to send to enquirers that we have yet published. It ought to be reprinted. Abundance of the should be kept in every Society-they would save their cost in writing, etc.' They will be issued, similar to first edition, and form one of the neatest pieces of printed work ever issued. The names af all Novitiate Elders and Eldresses will be printed on a page of the work, who render us any aid in the new edition, They will be sent to any address, at cost, to all ordering twenty-five copies or more, four and one-half cents each: or six cents per single copJ'.c Will be issued in February. Send orders, great or small \Ve would also recommend to any desirous of reading short. but brilliant pamphlets u!;on Shaker-ism. to send to Elders Daniel Fraser, nud joh n Whiteley, of Shirley Village, Ms.ifor 'The Shaker's Answer,' and' Divine Afflatus I' the first at $3.0::&gt; per hundred, the latter $05.0).
