REMINISCENSES OF MY SHAKER CHILDHOOD. SUMMER. 'How dear to my heart are the scenes of rny childhood When fond recollection presents them to view.' Mont than twenty five years have elapsed since I dwelt among the scenes of childhood which I shall now recall with such success as will hereafter appear. Childhood is with the majority of little folks the joyous season of life and Summer is the very time of delight for most children everywhere,�but in no place is it more thoroughly enjoyed than among those modest 'people termed Shakers, or it was thus in my experience and I presume it is the same with the children of to-day. First then among all pleasant memories I shall place our school time, where every day rain or shine we scholars wended our way to the little temple of learning. The path from our dwelling thereto, lay through high roadside grass, nodding buttercups and daisies, which was often rendered especially gay, with the music of the bobolinks that seemed to revel in the fragrant hay fields bordering the road on either side. Never, since then have I seen the Sun shine as brightly, or felt the breath of the meadows as balmy, nor have I ever listened to a bobolink since, though I have often longed for its song inexpressibly. I remember, that years after, when recovering from a severe illness on being asked, what I most wanted I replied most earnestly ; ' To hear a Shaker Bobolink sing. ' It really seemed to me that its song would restore me at once. The Summer School was my esppcial de~ light and my daily reward or penalty then was the approving smile or the rebuking ftown of the Teacher, and in fact, I sought only the former and dreaded only the latter in those thoughtless days. The lessons we learned, the songs we sang, the recitations, dialogues, &amp;c, in which I took part come back at my bidding now, seemingly like a cluster of precious memories, as also does the gentle tones of a voice long since silent on earth. To vary our exercises, our Teacher often selected appropriate dialogues from our School Readers for us to commit to memory and personate as well as we could, thinking thereby that a little exercise of muscle as well as of brain, would promote the health of both. One scene from the ancient drama of Pizarro and Gomez (by Kotzebue) interested me exceedingly for my part was to play sentinel and guard the unfortunate Peruvian Alonzo. Of course I tried to manifest great authority as I passed up and down the entry door guarding the imaginary captive. I dare say my classmates have not yet forgotten how they pleaded in Rolla's behalf,�but how long ago it all seems! So easy was it then to learn, so delightful to excel others too. When vacation came we went to gather berries of all kinds, and then it was that we were overjoyed to find that we were to belong to the favored berrying party. On a little range of low hills West of the Village we frequently spent the live-long day in plucking the juicy wild fruit, reaching home at early twilight, weary 'tis true, but happy and 0 so hungry ! How often I have looked from these hill tops to the lofty majestic old Kearsarge as it seemed to lean against the western sky, purpling in the oncoming darkness, or hiding its summit in a crown of fleecy clouds! Ah, those were useful happy days made hright with youth and hope and thus laying up in memory's storehouse a wealth of pleasant recollections, which the hand of Time only serves to endear as it turns our youth to middle age;� ' Aud now far removed from the loved situation The tears of regret will intrusively swell.' The crowning event of the whole year however was the scholars annual ride, so long anticipated, so heartily enjoyed. Who of us can forget the anxious suspense in which we waited for the dawn of that auspicious day?�the hurried breakfast, the joyful starting, the glorious sunrise and the endless conjecture as to our destination?�for that was generally kept as a surprise, and 0 how we would sing as blithely as the birds or chatter like squirrels and anon gaze in raptured silence at the ever changing scenery as we sped along. The road-side lunch under the spreading trees, the refreshing drink from the gushing spring, these combined, help to render the day so enjoyable, as never to be forgotten. The year that we went to Weir's Landing and took Steamer bound tor Centre Harbor was memorable indeed for it was then we felt we were travellers in a special sense. The modest Steamer to our unaccustomed gaze was a splendid reality as was also the rural hotel. I have since seen much more imposing ones than these, but have never been so impressed with grandeur as on that eventful day. All these delights dear reader made our Summer seem like one continuous day of recreation. The rest of the year was not all spent in play as I shall show you in future. Anna P. Carll.
