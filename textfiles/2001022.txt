Canterbury, N. H. Dec. 15. We find, very much to our pleasure, that several of the Brethren have been engaged in trimming and otherwise caring for the fruit trees, and from this we shall anticipate a more bountiful harvest for the incoming year. This season we have harvested about a thousand bushf Is of apples, and eight hundred bushels are secured for use during the winter. Having so valuable an article for food, and so easy of cul- tivation, it would seem that more direct care should be given to its cultivation. To this harvest we would also add the amount of some one hundred bushels of pears. Our farmers brought in seven hundred bushels of nice potatoes. The past season some 350 tons of hay were stored away in the barns. The Post Office address of this place having been changed, it is now ; East Canterbury, Mer. Co., N. H.
