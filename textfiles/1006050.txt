When a man is fortunate he boasts of his good management and shrewdness... When a man is fortunate he boasts of his good management and shrewdness ; when he is what is termed unfortunate, he complains of his ill-luck. It is said that Providence always smiles on the side of the best and most bayonets and the heaviest guns. Cannot the same principle be also applied to farming ? Success is the result of good management, of the possession of the best breeds of cattle, best tools, and the richest soils. Success springs from economy in saving and making manures, and in the judgment used in their application. It consists in the proper selection of seeds, the time of mowing the grass, the way and manner of tilling the ground, vigilance in destroying weeds, the care of cattle and the manner of feeding, in keeping the fences in order and the buildings in good repair. These are a few of the elements of good luck.
