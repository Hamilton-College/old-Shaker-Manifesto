Editorial. The mission of the Manifesto cannot be otherwise than Christian... The mission of the Manifesto cannot be otherwise than Christian,� on earth peace: and to men and women, good will. The gospel testimony, so opposed to the military spirit of the world, was preached in all its clearness, without fear at the time of the Revolutionary War, or during the contest between England and the United States, which subjected many of its advocates to a severe persecution. The revelation was from the God of Peace, and made through the Prince of Peace, harmonizing beautifully with the voice of that same God, as given in the ministration of the prophet, where he says ;�'God will teach us of his wrays, and we will walk in his paths, for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. The people shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks,�nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.' The glad tidings of the gospel of Christ, which has been brought from heaven to earth, cannot find a resting place among those who are contending with carnal weapons, for under the reign of the God of the New Testament,�'all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.' The children of God are peacemakers on the earth. The Manifesto must also have in its mission the fulness of the revelation of Christ;�The fatherhood and motherhood of God ; the divine parentage, whose fostering care shall extend with equal interest over every son and daughter. If this spirit grows into a living principle and inspires the soul to hunger and thirst after righteousness, then we may look with increasing confidence for a coming of the Christ, and no less for a dawning of the millennial age. Those who are anxious to � see the revelation of a more beautiful, spiritual day, in which righteousness shall stand in the advance, must purify their own hearts, 'even as He is pure,' that Christ may come and take up his abode in the living soul. I'SIfS.nSS. Right, in the life of man, must triumph over wrong. The spirit of Christ which is the light from God, must chase away all darkness, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit will then wash away every stain, that has defiled the mind. Where we have solaced ourselves by accepting a position as expedient under the circumstances, we must in a more thorough self-examination bring the question directly home ;�Is it right ? Our success on this pilgrimage to the city of God, demands that a standard be raised which shall fully demonstrate the faith we have adopted, and the' consecrated life we intend to lead. We have been most thoroughly assured, and that by good authority, that a man cannot serve two masters, as he would incline to love the one, and to hate the other. Our only hope, on the Christian's road to glory, is to be fully persuaded, beyond doubt, that we will walk in the light which so bountifully comes from God. Jesus in his lesson of prayer asked that God's kingdom might be established upon the earth, the same as it was known to be in the heavens, and that God might take up his abode among men. We ask the same, and in the fulfillment of this prayer are led to anticipate a growing interest in all that helps to make men more and more as brothers of our Lord. There is a vitalizing1 movement along this line that serves to rekindle an inspiration in the soul, that cannot . otherwise than ultimate in greater righteousness. Already a vast amount of good is being developed throughout the whole earth, so that every habitable place has felt the ameliorating influence of a more advanced civilization, and not less the ascendant moral tone, that is spreading like the morning light, for the peace, prosperity and comfort of all the sons and daughters of God. If faithfulness marks our path, and nothing less valuable ever should, we shall insure the coveted reward of 'Well done, good and faithful servant,' 'for it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.' We should know with a certainty the duty which God lias assigned to us, and knowing this duty, an answering righteousness and constancy is demanded at our hands. It is a nice thiug to be able to pass an opinion, aud to be assured in our own mind that our opinion is carried to the convincing point. The opponents to the use of instrumental music seem to have it all their own way, even though their experience in its use has been very limited. It is a pity that those who enjoy the harmony of instrumental music should be judged as having no 'real interest in our seasons of religious devotion.' This form of expression reminds us of the remark of a good brother :� 'An organ' said he, 'may assist those who sing, and we may be sure that it will not say any bad words, aud this is more than can be said of some who are good singers.' If the organist is so naughty as to be vain, it will be a wonder if some of those who have a fine bass or soprano voice will uot be found in the same company. It has been said that to sing in harmony has 'a decided tendency to a dead formality,' and possibly that may be the case, and yet some of us would walk sorrowfully over the road, if obliged to return to the manner of sinking of an earlier date.
