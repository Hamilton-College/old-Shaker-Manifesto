BYE WAYS. Chancy Dibble. It is well known that our Christian Cities are lined with dens of wickedness whose doors are open wide for the ruination of the innocent. These, say some, are necessary evils. As soon as youth enter active life they are met with all the corrupting influences which designing men can invent. If men lived pure these festering sores would not spue their poison to infect the unfortunate. They are legitimate consequences produced by the influence of so-called respectable men and women, even Christians, who are slaves to their passions, and have no confidence to testify against evils which so many love to be surrounded with. When men live above such indulgences those smoky hells of dissipation and prostitution will receive their doom. They cannot exist in virtuous society any more than humors can proceed from a pure state of the blood. No community can enjoy prosperity while brothels exist. These nuisances where evil spirits both in the body and out congregate, must be eradicated by weapons of truth through human instrumentalities. The prayers of the suffering, and the cries of the needy, call for the aid of noble reformers. God, Angels and spirits will sustain those who work for the cause of good. Watervliet, N. Y.
