RETURNING SPRING Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. The voice of the returning Spring Bids nature wake and rise ; And put her best new garments on, For she has fresh supplies. a. Then why should we, whose lines have fallen, In such a pleasant place, Be backward in the praise of Him, Or e'er fall short of grace? 3. We've all the eye of man could wish, And fruitful is the land; And greater than Assyrian hosts, The angels round us stand. How wond'rous are the ways of God! How bountiful His hand! We see His love in ev'ry tree, And broadcast o'er the land. 'We ought to leap,and shout,and sing, Till all the mountains round, Reverberate the joyful news, To earth's remotest bound. And yet, to many thousands more, We such a home could give; If they would leave a carnal world. And learn in Christ to live.
