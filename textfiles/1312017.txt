CONVICTION. NANCY G. DANFORTH. 'No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.' There were great multitudes who came to hear the teachings of Jesus and to witness the miracles performed by him ; therefore this coming to him must mean something more than to come as one man comes to, or meets another. The spirit of anointing rested upon Jesus thus constituting him the Christ, the Son of God, and it was the voice of the spirit that spake, saying, 'No man can come to me except the Father draw him.' The drawings of the Father are the whisperings of the spirit of God through the conscience, persuading us to leave all wrong and sinful habits, and live a holy, godly life. It is the spirit of long-suffering love, that constantly follows us, and pleads again and again to be heard, though often slighted and refused. Yet this voice can be hushed for a while by willful disobedience and continually slighting its monitions; still the time will come when it will awaken with redoubled condemnation to the evil-doer. Therefore it is a fearful thing to reject the drawings of the Father given for our salvation. Canterbury, N. H.
