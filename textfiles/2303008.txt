SHAKER HOMES. Sophia Wayne. Oh, happy homes like Eden-gardens fair, Whose inmates are contented, Whose lives are free from worldly strife and care, By love's pure bond cemented. The lust of power, and sordid greed of gain Rule not with sway of might, They seek not pleasures that are false and vain, But follow truth and right. While direful woes encompass land and sea, And trouble fills life's measure, A restful heaven in these homes I see When souls seek heavenly treasure. From whence comes bitter wail and sad unrest, The war of words and strike of hands? From sway of human passions all unblest, And sin's enthralling bands. This changeless law can never be repealed, 'Men reap just what they sow,' From tares and thistles sown, life's field Will tares and thistles grow. Crime stalks abroad, though churches raise Their steeples to the sky, And well paid preachers thank and praise The God who rules on high. They call Him Master, yet they follow not The staps of him who came 'To seek and save,' nor yet the poor forgot, Who called upon his name. His work was wrought through noble sacrifice, For love of truth and good, And on the basis of his life shall rise The human brotherhood. 64 THE MANIFESTO. Oh, sweet cortimunion of the pure and just, Who equal blessings share, [trust, Where love returns confiding love and And all life's burdens bear. Where those who occupy the highest place, God's precious gifts dispense, And gladly minister his saving grace, Nor seek a recompense. Such are my people, and their dwelling place Is an elysium blest, Where all who from their spirits sin efface Shall find sweet peace and rest. Ye witnesses of truth who wrong condemn And righteous laws obey, As prophets of the New Jerusalem Proclaim the living way. Ballston, Spa. N. Y.
