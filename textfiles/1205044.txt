Ashes as a Fertilizer .—Unleached wood ashes contain all the constituents of plant food that the ordinary or worn out soil needs except nitrogen. By their chemical action, they render much of the inert nitrogen in soils available, and in that way may be said to furnish nitrogen. This is true of lime, and on this power of making nitrogen available, the greatest value of lime, when applied as a fertilizer, depends. Ashes also have a good mechanical effect upon the soil, especially heavy clay soils, which are made lighter and more porous, so that air and water circulate more freely. Ashes do not suffer waste by being washed out to the extent that is true of the mare soluable and concentrated fertilizers sold in the markets their effects are therefore more lasting.'—American Agriculturist.
