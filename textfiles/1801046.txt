To me, God has promised... To me, God has promised, not the Heaven of the ascetic temper, or the dogmatic theo- logian, or of the subtle mystic, or of the stern martyr ready alike to inflict and bear; but a Heaven of purified and permanent affections ; of a book of knowledge with eter- nal leaves, and unbounded capacities to read it; of those we love ever around us, never misconceiving us or being harassed by us; of glorious work to do, and adequate facili- ities to do it; a world of solved problems, as well as of realized ideals. The many man- sions in my Father's House are many, not in number only, but in variety. â€”Greg.
