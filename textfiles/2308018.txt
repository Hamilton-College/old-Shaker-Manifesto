Enfield, N. H. July, 1893. We left our allotted space in June No. and as a reward, have received in July No. three pages of music, so. we shall do it again. If 'Brevity is the soul of wit,' why not as well applied, when we change the t into s and and add d-o-m? It certainly is in harmony with 'boil it down' which is the needful watchword of every editor, wherever located. We welcome our long-tried friend and counselor Elder Henry C. Blinn, to the vacancy made by the removal of Elder James S. Kaime, from the Ministry of our Bishopric ; two noble examples of consecration and true manhood; (we) say, the mould is broken, wherein such specimens of true worth were fashioned, and can hear the echo of expressions like these, 'hero worship, conservatism' ; not at all; those who come after, have yet to'prove their mettle, no words spoken or written, can give or take merit; we believe in the comrades of our own life battles, in the rising generation also, and are just as hopeful and prayerful, that a faithful few may sacrifice error to truth, maintain the vital principles of the Christ life, thus performing the duties of their day and time with equal honor to both God and man; speed the day. Strawberries have been abundant: 100 qts. of field berries canned for winter use. 10 bushels from the garden have graced the table in all their pristine beauty. Not a Shaker visitor booked for this season, how unneighborly! Mary Ella Briggs.
