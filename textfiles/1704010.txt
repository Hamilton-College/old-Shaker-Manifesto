A CHAPEL IN THE HEART Thrice blessed is the man who keeps From other things apart A secret-room- -a holy place- - A chapel in the heart. For there, when all the world without Grows dark unto his sight, He may retire and find within His chapel full of light. And there, when jangling sounds of earth Fall discord on the ear, He can return, and, undisturbed, The eternal music hear; And there he hastens when the world Loud praises to confess, With deep and true humility, His own unworthiness. Thither, when with a golden snare Temptation hems his way, He quickly turns, with trembling lip, And bated breath, to pray. Thrice blessed is the man who keeps, From other things apart, This secret-room, this holy place, This chapel in the heart. Messenger of Peace.
