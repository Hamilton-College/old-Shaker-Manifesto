GOLD IS GOLD. LIZZIE KIDD. ' Gold is universally worshiped without a single temple ; and by all classes, without a single hypocrite. ' Of all the metals which nature has so kindly provided for our use, gold seems most precious, yet gold in the quartz, in its crude natural state is good for naught, it must be dug from the mines, and cleansed, refined and separated from all the impurities connected with it, after being tried in �the furnace and going through the various processes of puiificatiou, lo ! it comes forth a pure solid mas-, bright, shining and valuable. On reflection the mind draws a comparison on this wise. Every human being endowed with an immortal soul is a lump of Gold. Not purified and cleansed, but gold in its native state ; in the rocks and mountains. Closely adhered to this human gold, are clumps of earth, pieces of rock and indeed it is so covered with other substances that it would require great care to ascertain if there were really any gold there at all. Consequently there is a great work to be done, much labor to be performed, for all the evils with which mankind are troubled and subjected too, are more or less like this earth, quartz, and unnecessary attachment to the bit of gold from which a separation must be made. Put the metal in the crucible of truth, over the furnace of affliction, and the work of regeneration, the cleansing and refining has begun. Realizing this, all who wish to beeome a lump of pure gold, why not begin at once? If evil habits have been formed, why not break them up and form those which are new. There has been counterfeit gold, and probably is some now, yet are there not counterfeit characters, alas how many ? But gold is gold, and in the end it will prove so. There are sound truth's in every religion, yet in how great a degree covered up and cloaked under a false theology. The simple Christianity taught by Jesus, and practiced by so few, was the pure gold. It did not pei'ish nor grow dim, for the work which Jesus proclaimed in his first appearing, was clearly elucidated, and gloriously revealed by Mother Ann Lee, in his second appearing, without sin unto salvation. Those who embrace her gospel and obey its teachings, are gradually becoming the choicest gold. Let the doubting come and see. Gold is gold, if will show for itself. Mystery, deceit and fraud, do � not constitute a Christian, but those who stand in the light, who speak truly, act nobly, and live godly. These are the best, the pure gold, whose value is not diminished, and whose lustre is forever untarnished. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
