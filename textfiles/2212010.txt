OBEDIENCE. Henry W. Fredrick. If you observe a young friend, or even a companion who strives to be obedient to his instructors and endeavors to please them,mark well that individual. Observe the love and good-will that are sure to flow toward him. As years carry him forward you will see in his course, much, very much that is calculated to make that person respected and happy. You will find no difficulty in determining what occasions the numerous troubles of the wilfull and disobedient. Observe closely these two causes and their effects, and you will never need a teacher to portray to you the satisfaction, comfort and good standing in society, which obedience to good government brings, or the trouble and dissatisfaction that invariably follows disobedience. As you grow older you can easily look, from the rules of men, up to the higher laws of God, and comprehend that if these smaller acts of insubordination, so seriously effect the young, greater acts of inattention and defiance to the laws of God will render those who are older, quite miserable, as they become hardened in their wicked course.
