RULES FOR GENERAL DEPORTMENT OF THE YOUNG ' 'Be kindly affeetioned one toward another.' Always give place to age. It should command respect at home and abroad. Use no language in conversation that yon would be unwilling to have reported before your friends. Always consider yourself in company that you may have but one set of manners to cultivate, and those should be, true politeness. Affectation arises from vanity, and should have no place in the deportment of those who wish to become honorable members of society. Cultivation of the mind is as essential as food for the body. Ignorance and sin are closely conjoined. Be as careful in your selection for reading as in the food you eat. Study to become a blessing to society. Be industrious. Be frugal. Be honest in all your dealings. Be neat. If you would be pure, first be chaste. As the character of every individual will be estimated by an observance of the daily life, rather than by the protestations of innocence, you should always walls circumspectly. A modest reserve in the company of either sex, will always command the respect of the virtuous. Accept with this, my young friends, the prayerful interest of your brother, H. C. Blinn
