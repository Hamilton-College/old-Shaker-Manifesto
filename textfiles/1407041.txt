Dr. Beecher's Idea of Heaven Excepting exemption from sin, intense vigorous, untiring action is the greatest pleasure of the mind. I could hardly wish to enter heaven did I believe its inhabitants were idly to sit by purling streams, fanned by balmy air. Heaven to be a place of happiness, must be a place of activity. lias the far reaching mind of Newton ceased its profound investigations? Has David hung up his harp as useless as the dusty arms in Westminster Abbey? Has Paul, glowing with God like enthusiasm ceased itinerating the universe of God? Are Peter and Cyprain and Edwards and Payson and Evarts idling away an eternity in mere psalm-singing? Heaven is a place of restless activity, the abode of nevertiring thought. David and Isaiah will sweep nobler and loftier strains in eternity, and the minds of saints, inclogged by cumbersome clay, will forever feast on the banquet of rich and glorious thought. My young friends, go on; you will never get through. An eternity of untiring action is before you, and the universe of thought is your field.
