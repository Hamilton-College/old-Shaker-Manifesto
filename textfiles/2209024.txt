Canaan, N. Y. Aug. 5., 1892. Hoav rapidly time speeds along. Here is at hand the ninth month of 1892. The seasons in their order come and go, bringing the duties and cares which must necessarily be attended to, each in its proper time, or we lose the blessing of the faithful laborer. Our Brethren finished haying July 21st. The rye and winter wheat also have been zealously and carefully stored awTay in the barn. The spring wheat was cut yesterday. Our two oldest boys have reaped the grain while our faithful aged Br. Andrew Wise, with the help of two or three little boys have followed the reaper and bound as fast as it was cut. We have not been fortunate enough, as yet, to have an attached reaper and binder, but hope we may in the near future. The Sisters have been striving to obey Mother's injunction to put their hands to work and give their hearts in prayer to God. True Brethren and Sisters are the life and light of Zion. Bless God for them. We have been engaged in painting 27% rods of picket fence in front of the buildings, also continue painting windows, besides attending to a great many other duties pertaining to the welfare of a home. On the 25th. of July we had the pleasure of enjoying a beautiful visit with our two gospel Sisters from Sonyea, Eldress Polly Lee and Sr. Lavina Dutcher. We highly appreciate such privileges, because they serve to strengthen the bonds of gospel love. On Aug. 1st. and 2nd. a company of twenty turned out to have a general merry berry bee; it being a very good year for whortleberries;we gathered nine'and one half bushels. Expect to enjoy some good whortleberry pies when the winds are blowing and the snow is falling. A. B.
