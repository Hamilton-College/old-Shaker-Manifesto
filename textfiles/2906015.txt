Shakers, N. Y. May, 18(19. The rhymster who undertook a transposition of Bryant's 'Autumn,' to the tune of 'The melancholy days have come, the saddest of the year,'' House-cleaning time is near; was certainly very wide of the mark in estimating what constituted melancholy days. House-cleaning time can not be classed in that category. Imagine the condition of our domiciles if it were not for that periodical renovation! As it is in the material life so it is in the moral and spiritual house. How refreshing it is to enter into a habitation that has been through the cleansing, the very atmosphere seems fraught with the suggestion; keep clean,keep clean. And how blessed it is to meet the individual life whose spiritual atmosphere reveals the condition of a house that is clean. At present some are turning things topsy-turvy and with paint and kalsomine, our old house begins to shine. And some are on the farm and in the garden preparing the soil and planting the seed, hoping for the blessing of a bountiful harvest. Each one in the task assigned faithfully performs his duty, and receives the reward of well done. At date of writing we have with us in the form only three of those veterans who united with the society at Port Bay, Wayne Co., N. Y. All the rest have passed over to the evergreen shores. Heavenly F.ither and Mother, we know that the ancients of the city are passing on; we miss them from our sight, but many times when walking in the shadow we feel their blessed presence, and we know they have laid up treasures where motli can not corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.
