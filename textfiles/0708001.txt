The fruition of hope. P. What was that hope ? C. That I might be rid of unwholesome desires. P. And you have become rid of them ? C. I have. P. By what means? C. By the power of God and the force of habit. P. How did you establish this habit? C. By the help of others who had gained the victory before me. P. And they ? C. By the aid of others before them. P. But there was some one who established this system ? C. Yea ; the genius of Christianity — the Christ. P. Then the genius set the example of self-denial. C. To the fullest extent. P. And is the force of habit, as practiced by this wonderful genius equal to the subjugation of human passions?—the silencing of illicit desires and does it bring that peace and rest 1 which Christians so much talk about? ] C. A thousand living witnesses make answer: Yea, verily. 1 P. Then will I become a Christian. North Union, O.
