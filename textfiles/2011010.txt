Correspondence. Dear Elder, F. W. Evans:--Your kind letter of 17th... Carlinville, Ill. Sep. 1890. Dear Elder, F. AV. Evans :�Your kind letter of 17th. inst. received. I have not given up the idea of going to Mt. Lebanon, by any means. I long to be there : I crave the spiritual food that can be obtained there only. Nay, Elder, please do not think that I love the world : I am sick of it. I have a partially invalid brother residing here, to whom, my mother at her death, requested me ever to be a friend; he it is that begs me not to leave him: my heart bleeds at the thought of leaving him. And may not the spirit of my mother hinder me ? Was it her that made me sick when I purposed leaving here for Lebanon ? You can now see the difficult situation that I am placed in. It keeps me in constant distress, not knowing what to do and do right. I have prayed often for spiritual guidance in this matter, that I may do what is pleasing to God: and any light or guidance that you may give me will be thankfully received. I somehow feel that there will be a wray opened before long, that I may go to Lebanon. Yours in love and respect J. W. REPLY. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Sep. 1890. Mistaken Friend :�Yours of 21st. inst. received. 'Without faith, it is impossible to please God.' Faith' in Jesus, meant, that God had delegated Jesus to act in his stead, in the work of human redemption : all power was given to him. And he said, 'As my Father hath sent me into the world, so send I you.' 'He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and him that sent me.' 'Whose-soever sins ye remit, they are remitted.' 'The Son of Man hath power on earth to remit sin.' In the Second Appearing, the same order obtains. When you say, that 'you have prayed for spiritual guidance,' you ignore the order of Christ's Second Appearing, just as any anti-christian would do: they go to God direct; and you do the same. You have no faith in the Elders as being able to furnish you with 'spiritual guidance.' 'They that are after the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh.' Those in the world, do mind the things of the world ; the natural man sees, feels, and reasons like a natural man. That is just what you are doing, and is just what you did when you were here; and it is just what you will do if you come back ; unless you receive more faith than you now show. One of our Brethren received a letter last night from the West, saying that his brother was likely to die, and wanting him to come there immediately ; the letter was written by his brother's wife. The brother answered that he should not come. That was faith. Your brother wanted nothing of you as a Shaker ; but he wants, as a natural man, of a natural man. And if your natural affection is stronger than your spiritual affection, and you love father, or mother, or brother or sister more than you love Christ in your Elders, then you have no Elders; but are joined to your idols ; and we can 'let you alone.' When Jesus said to his mother, 'Woman, what have I to do with thee?'�was it as a natural man? Your brother is a natural man ; he has brothers who are natural men; let them care for him : what have you, as a Believer, to do with any of them? You are sacrificing your spiritual relation for your natural; and your mother, as a natural woman, inspires you. And when some of your natural, fleshly relations receive faith that lifts them up, by a resurrection power, above the natural order; perhaps you will be ministered unto by them; and they will be your Elders. Another will take your crown�your bishopric. You count yourself unworthy of eternal life, because of the faith and the cross and the sacrifice and the suffering that it necessarily involves. When Agag came in before Samuel, walking delicately like a king, Samuel ordered him to be hewn in pieces. Agag typified the natural man ; Samuel the spiritual man. ''Can you drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?' Your spiritual friend and brother, Frederick W. Evans. Dear Elder Henry:--I have been reading 'Be Courteous'... Union Village, Sept. 25, 1890. Dear Elder Henry :�I have been reading ''Be Courteous' by Sister Annie R. Stephens in Sept. No. of the Manifesto 1890. I think it a very important subject and well handled. I write to show my appreciation of it and to thank her for writing it. I think if we all would take especial pains to put in practice her suggestions it would make us all happier, would help lift the burdens and improve the health. I have thought much on this subject and wondered that it is esteemed so lightly by some. We cannot overestimate the value and importance of cultivating this spirit of courtesy and kiudness and consideration one to another. I think it would be a stimulus with many who come in with us to remain. 'The Lord is full of pity and merciful.' James v., 11. See also 1 Peter III., -8. Hos. xi. ,4. 'Draw them with bands of love.' Mic. vi., 8. 'To do justly, and to love mercy.' We are often, very often exhorted by writers of the Holy Scriptures, and also well-bred, good principled and real Christian people to a fellow feeling for others ; and those who possess the most of it can do others the most good. 'By love serve one another.' Gal. v., 10. See Job vi., 14. 'To him that is afflicted pity should be shown from his friend.' xvi., 4. 'I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.' 'But I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.' 'Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity.' Heb. xiii., 3. Civility comes from the heart, and this being right, all will work together for good, peace, love, harmony, heaven. Good nature and intelligence suggests politeness. That which operates most against good manners is an insensibility to or want of regard for the happiness of others, and is not this an evil heart? 'Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.' Rom. xii., 16., also Prov, xi., 17. 'The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh,' Knowing how much a pleasing method may do to comfort and reconcile, I do not think I could impeach my worst foe if he treated me with consideration and courtesy. James ii., 13. 'For he shall have judgment without mercy, that showed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.' If all our study was to so conduct as to solace others nod voluntarily and constantly make the sacrifice needful to insure it we would need little or no disciplining in behavior more than a little trial. We would soon find out how this deed or that wounded or caused distress to our companion and while there was nothing wrong in the act would for the sake of our associate shun it in future. Eph. iv., 32. 'Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.' How sweet to feel the holy influences of the spirit of love and forgiveness. It is balm to the wounded soul which nothing else is equal to ; and we may all dwell in love if we will keep our souls pure and clean, and be humble looking to God for it we shall be filled to overflowing. The Manifesto is very interesting and profitable. I love and appreciate it very much. Your article on ''Gentle Manuers' in the April No. is excellent, also your Editorials. Your quotation from Lytton is true and beautiful. 'What a rare gift Is manners ! better for one to possess them than wealth beauty or talents ; they will more than supply all.' I love Alother Hannah Kendall's exhortation 'to be kind to each other and be very careful not to hurt the oil and the wine. We should reverence God in each other and respect our Brothers and Sisters and treat them with good manners. When we speak of our- Brethren and Sisters we should call them Brethren and Sisters. We should leave all profane language, all jesting and speaking unkindly of each other to the children of the world. Our words should be seasoned with grace, that we do not say that which is wrong.' Elder Win. Leonard's writings are beautiful ; also Br. D; Orcutt's, Str. Mary Whitcher's, Martha J. Anderson's, L. B. Settles on 'Little Kindnesses,' M. Witham's, Selections fr^m J. G. Whittier, Forgiveness, Maxims contributed by O. N. Haskins, ;;nd a great many others too numerous to mention. Yours Truly, Harriet Shepard. Beloved Elder Henry:--A narration of our visit... Shaker Station, Hartford Co., Ct. Oct. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�A narration of our visit (Eiders, Robert Aitken and John Whiteley) to England and Scotland, may be somewhat interesting to Believers, in general. It was quite a surprise to Elder John to see me on board the ship Servia, as he had not learned of my anticipated journey to England. We were fortunate in obtaining one room, and in eujoying the company of each other. We had a pleasant, smooth passage over, and both Elder John and myself vverj kept busy answering enquiries about our faith and order of religious life. We made the acquaintance of the President of the Tennessee Immigration aL d Laud Co.�C. D. Sherwood. Upon our arrival in Liverpool after a voyage of eight days, Elder John went to tluddersfield while 1 passed on to Manchester. I remaiued here about one week and then went on to Scotland with Elder John. While in Manchester I visited the Vegetarian Society whose headquarters are at 75 Princess street, and was kindly invited to take tea with the Society which I at once accepted, as I knew I should meet with a superior class of men and women. The meeting was of a very interesting character, if I am to judge from what was said upon the occasion. By invitation, I spoke of the history and experience of our religious order, and its progress in self-deniai, and also in the proper selection of food and drinks ; of the conditions most conducive to the development of a regenerative life, and the power to bear a full cross against every worldly lust. The Rev. James Clark, who preaches before the first vegetarian church on the earth, was present. His home is in Salforl, Manchester, England. He is also president of the society, which is evidently the only one left of the Concordium of which I was a member. Our object was to introduce the Law dispensation on earth, as prompted by the writings of J. P. Greaves. At Kingston I had the pleasure of seeing the widow of William Oldham who was second on the list of members in the present Vegetarian society in England. This society has produced a marked effect in London and has established no less than thirty-six vegetarian Restaurants in this city. I dined in some of them and found them well patronized. From Manchester I went to Leeds where I met Elder John. We next visit Scotland. We make a short stop at Penrith to visit some friends. I had a most interesting time at the hotel while in conversation with some of the boarders, and have reason to believe that some of the good seed of gospel truth was sown in willing hearts. On the day that we reached Edinburgh we visited the exhibition and saw many things of practical utility. On Saturday I went to Dunfermline, the home of my birth. I called at the Press Paper office, but unfortunately did not meet the editor. I next visited our very kind friend George L. an uncle of Andrew Carnegie, the great iron master of Pittsburg, Pa., in the United States. He accompanied us to the Library, the generous gift of friend Carnegie. I next visit the old Abbey, where 1 view the resting place of all that was mortal of King Robert Bruce, the liberator of Scotland. I dine with our good friend George and family, and then enjoy an interesting and profitable conversation on matters pertaining to a religious life. To-day, the Sabbath, I made a journey of about six miles. It was a long walk, but not wearisome. I attended church, after which I renewed my acquaintance with former friends. Here I may mention that I crossed the bridge Forth, a structure of vast proportions, and a wonderful victory to the science of bridge building. The Tay bridge is full as long but it could not have been so much ot au undertaking as the river was not so deep nor the spans so wide. The main incident of my visit to Dundee, was to hear the Hon. Andrew Carnegie speak on the superiority of Republican institutions over the Monarchical. His audience was composed of more than two thousand interested listeners. The eagerness with which these Republican ideas were received would indicate that the time was not far distant when England would accept this advanced form of government, and in this open the way for the gospel testimony. I tarried in Dundee only two days and then returned to Dunfermlinc. Here I was invited into the office of the Press, where my time in conversation passed very pleasantly. By solicitation I wrote an article, embodying, in brief, my life and experience, and sent the same to the office of the Press. In this place I had the pleasure of meeting the President of the Vegetarian Society, John Dava, a man of more than ninety years of age. lie was a marvel of activity and can look back on a life spent in great usefulness. He was the founder of the first '� Teetotal Society' in this world. My visit proved very interesting and very sati; factory. On Monday morning I took the cars for Edinburgh, but not finding Elder John I passed on to Huddersfield, and soon learned that he had gone on to London. After enjoying a brief visit with the brother of Elder John I took the cars for Manchester. At noon I left Manchester for London, and arrived tit the Eastern Station at 5 P. M. Here I took an omnibus for Waterloo Bridge, aud then walked to Essex Street Strand. Here I found myself again in the great city ; one in which my life was so wonderfully developed for good and evil, as to fin all &gt; laud me amon r God's people in America. I did not find Elder John till late in the evening, but took a walk along ihe embankment of the Thames as far as Black friar's Bridge. A great change has taken place since my last visit. At that date the houses were all filled with families, but these are now gone and their places occupied with offices for business purposes. One of the buildings is used as the headquarters of the Salvation Army. On returning to the house I found Elder John. We again crossed Blackfriar's Bridge, and saw much that was of interest to us. The next morning Elder John went in company with some of his relatives, while I visited the office of the London Vegetarian Society. I was cordially received by the Secretary, and proffered cards of admittance to the meetings of the International Vegetarian Congress, which was to assemble the next day. I was also invited to take breakfast at the Charing Cross Vegetarian restaurant with the delegates to the Congrvs*. I visited the Memorial Ila'l when the Congress was in session, and soon found myself among interested friends. Among the letters that were read, one was from our Beloved Elder Frederic W. Evans, aud one from the Rev. II. S. Clubb, President of the Vegetarian Society in America. I was introduced as a representative of the Shaker Society in America and requested to give information of the progress of vvgctariauisni in the United States. I told them ihaf the letters which they had heard, had already given a full statement of the progress of the work, and that our order were progressing more and more to adopt a pu'u diet, purity beiug that to which we aim in our lives. A vote of sympathy was passed For the vegetarians of the U. S. The meetings which I attended proved to be very interesting aud 1 considered my time very profitably spent. It wa~with a people who knew what it was to deny the appetite of gross, animal food ; and their countenances and actions bespoke the advanced course they had chosen to live. I visited the Kew Gardens, in company with the delegates to the Congress, aud although it was a beautiful place, I found increased enjoyment while in conversation on matters pertaining to the order of our gospel home. On Sabbath morning I took the boat for Kingston, to make a call on some vegetarian friends, whose parents were visitors to the Concordium. At this place I was introduced to the widow oi William Oldham. He was the founder of the above order. As I did not reach Kingston till 2-30 P. M., I failed to meet many of the friends who had extended invitations for me to call at their homes. On Monday I visited the Editor of the 'Medium and Day Break,' James Burns, and I will send you a statement of our meeting when published. Elder John returned to Huddersfield on the previous Friday and on the 20th. of Sept. we meet again in Liverpool and sail for home in the steamship Servia. A strong breeze was blowing as we left the port and in the night I was very sick, as were many of the other passengers. My illness continued during the whole voyage, while Elder John soon recovered and was very busily engaged in conversation. Through the kindness of our dear friend Carnegie I was provided with some choice fruit, which at this time seemed to be deeply appreciated. Our vessel reached New York on the 28th of Sept. where we were met by beloved Eldress Marion Patrick and Sister- Rhoda Strowbridge. We reached home the day following where we were received by a hearty and loving welcome, and Elder John passed on to his home in Shirley, Mass. Dear Editor:--I have thought many times I would contribute... White Water Village, O. Dear Editor :�I have thought many times I would contribute a few lines for the Manifesto, but have hesitated for fear there would not be room. But in looking over the Sept. number [ find therein a great deal of useful knowledge and instruction for which I wish to thank the dear Brethren and Sisters, who are so willing to give us those instructions which I know will be a benefit to each and every one of us who are willing to accept them. It is by accepting these good instructions and trying to live up to them to the best of our ability that we shall inherit that beautiful home which our heavenly Father has prepared for all his children. In looking over the items from the different Societies I find in the one from Harvard where our brother Andrew speaks of the Providence of God in sparing them from any calamity of any kind. We have great reason to be thankful to kind Providence in sparing us these many years from any disaster of any kind. I want to say to my dear Brethren and Sisters that I am thankful that I am classed among those who are trying to live consecrated lives and trying to do the will of their Heavenly Father ; and my prayer is that God will bless every soul that will put an effort forward to do his will and try to maintain the cause which our blessed Mother established on earth. I often repeat the beautiful words which sister Mary Hazard sung here while on a visit: Oh my Brethren, O my Sisters, Don't grow weary though the time seems long,� Pledge yourselves and stand together, And keep the bonds of union strong. L. Parker. To my gospel friends:--Will you please answer through the columns... Enfield, N. .H. Sept. 8, 1890. To MY GOSPEL FRIENDS :- - - -Will JOU please answer through the columns of the Manifesto the following questions ; Why should not House Keeping and Home Making, be considered occupations for Women and of no less account than Stock Raising or Farming aie for Men? Why should not the home duties usually assigned to Women, tend just as really toward the important duty of earning an honest livelihood, as do those assigned to Men? Why should a woman, who faithfully devotes herself for the comfort and well being of the home, feel that she is in any degree dependent on another for her support? Are not her brothers equally as dependent on her, as she is on them? . When there is a proper growth, and a better understanding of the ways of life throughout so-called Christendom, will there not be more enlightenment on the proper duties of both Man and Woman? Your Sister, M. M. Keniston.
