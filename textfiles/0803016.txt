'Speak Unto Me Excellent Things' Elder Otis Sawyer Speak not to me of sadness, Speak not to me of gloom, Speak not to me of darkness, Nor of the silent tomb ; But tell me of the beauties rare, That in the pure heart bloom— 0, tell me of the beauties rare, That in the pure heart bloom! Ah, tell me not of pleasures, A worldly life can give ; And tell me not of treasures, Which death cannot retrieve; Nor of the deep, heart-felt remorse, Of those who disbelieve— Alas, the deep, heart-felt remorse Of those who disbelieve ! 0, tell me of the brightness, Of heaven all aglow; Where love, in all its richness, From angel hearts o'erflow; And tell me of their golden crowns, And raiment white as snow— 0, tell me of their golden crowns And raiment white as snow. I would be like the Angels, Of purity and love; On earth I'd form a heaven, As formed in realms above; Where flowers bloom, and music sweet Floats on the balmy air; And shouts of praise from the redeemed, Proclaim the crowns they wear.
