Gifford, Kokomo, lud. In the 'Anti-Infidel Library' Xo 43, we have a very interesting Lecture by H. L. Hastings, that has been delivered in London, Eng. as well as in America. When a man gives his life to a worthy cause, with an unflinching purpose of doing good to humanity, he not only makes himself the friend of man, but also becomes the friend of God. The little work before me is illuminated by the genial spirit of the writer, ami he has no hesitancy in te 1ing how to meet the objections of the skeptics. Get the book and read it, and you will have learned many good and profitable lesson. Address H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
