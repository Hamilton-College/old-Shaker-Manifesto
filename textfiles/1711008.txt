FORGIVENESS. Forgiveness and love, go hand in hand. You do not love any one whom you cannot forgive, nor can you freely forgive any one you do not love. So the two are inseparable. We are commanded to 'Love our enemies;' we are also commanded to 'Forgive our enemies,' and if we love and forgive our enemies, God will love and forgive us our sins. If we do not, God will not love and forgive us. God has an altar in Zioa where He meets all who come confessing their evil doings, and there and then, forgives the penitent soul and extends his care and protection, that we may love an:l forgive our enemies. God first loved us, and this love causes our acknowledgement of our sins and He forgives us. Let us be godly and do likewise. N. Brown. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
