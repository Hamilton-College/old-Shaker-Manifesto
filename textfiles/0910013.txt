CHANGE OF HEART E. MYRICK Bro. H-----, of L-----, of untarnished character, esteemed for his impartial charities; loved and respected most by those who knew him best, was an infidel — made no creedal profession, belonged to no church, nor sect. He must be converted—must attach to some form—'belong to some meetinghouse.' All wanted such a member, he had money, was generous, kind, benevolent. Ministers in turns used their persuasions, pictured to him heaven and its antipode (with which they are so familiar). At length being so closely invested he surrendered. He joined the church; said he had experienced a 'change of heart.' He had faith. He ' believed.' He attended church, and bowed reverently to the parson, paid tithes; what lacked he then ? After the lapse of a few months, inquiry arose as to what change there was in Brother H. since he joined the church? None had been observed, except by one of his nearest neighbors, who, in answer to the inquiry, re. plied, 'I have observed a marked change.'' ' What may it be?' ' Well, before he joined the church, when he went to salt his cattle on the Sabbath, he used to carry his ax on his shoulder to repair the fence if need be. Since he experienced religion he conceals his ax under his overcoat.' Think of it, an honest man converted to a pious fraud! Joining the Shaker church is a conversion to confession of all sins and dishonesty ; restitution and repentance ; and thenceforth lead an honest, pure and divine life. This i: a ' change of heart ' to some good purpose.
