The following letter from the founder of... [The following letter from the founder of the Hopedale Community will, no doubt, interest the many readers of the Manifesto. It is the simple and earnest hope of a mind that was devoted to the good of humanity.] Milford, Hopedale, Mass., May 17, 1842. Henry Todd, Dear Friend and Brother :�Your inquiring letter of the 23rd. April came duly to hand, and found me so 'careful about many things,' and so 'cumbered with much serving' that I delayed much too long returning an answer. We have just made a very humble commencement of our grand experiment. About forty persons great and small have taken up their abode on an estate which we call Hopedale, in the town of Milford about two miles from my former residence iu Mendon. Fraternal Community No. 1 consists of about sixty members about equally male and female besides numerous children and dependents. We were barely able to purchase a run down farm with a mill power on it, one large old two story dwelling-house one hundred and live years old, two barns and other out buildings all on the decay. The farm contains 258 acres, mill power pretty good, considerable fruit, capabilities good. To purchase and1 stock this farm and make some little preparation for building has cost us from five to six thousand dollars. We begin at zero, and hope to rise by slow degrees. We are now all lodged under one roof and fed from one table in love and peace. Thus far we have realized less perplexity and more good than could have been reasonably expected. Our hearts are firm, our faith is strong, our hands are willing. We feel that our principles and plan are heavenly, and that our heavenly Father is with us to bless this work of our hands. We distrust nothing but the waywardness of our own souls. We are afraid of nothing but sin. If we adhere to our profession with a good purpose of mind, we are sure that the gates of hell can never prevail against us. We Hre digging, pruning, plowing, planting, gardening, repairing buildings, putting up or rather preparing to put up new ones a few, and doing what we can to iive out of the products of our hands. We have ten or twelve men and several boys, three carpenters, one printer, and the rest farmers and lazy reform ministers, a pretty happy company of working men, about the same number of the other sex. We are a plain sort of people determined to live out and realize practical Christianity. Come and see us, if you can. That will enable you to judge of us much more correctly than written communication. We read with interest the manful little two-edged sword, called the Herald of Freedom. Br. Pillsbury staid all nighi with us when on his way to New York. We hear of some of the pro-war, pro-slavery, pro-anti-christian doings, excommunications &amp;c. in New Hampshire. We rejoice to know that you and others are becoming free men. Now set up the true church� form a fraternal community, and you will frustrate the plans of the adversary. We are social beings, and we ought to be united in a practical Christian society, the principles and grounds well understood. If you can get no such community up there come and join ours till you can swarm off to a better location. It is true we are so poor at present and have so little accommodation that we ought not to ask you to come and reside with us at once. We can only ask you to be getting ready. I think you could be exceedingly useful to us and that we could be of some use to you so soon as we could come to a full understanding and get into co-operation. Our constitutions are all gone but one copy or two. We mean to print a new edition forthwith. There are several other things which we mean to print, that you should see. I will pick up what I can and send you. Would you like to receive our little semi-monthly sheet�The Practical Christian? I will send you a few numbers and also one of our blank applications for admission to membership. These may help you to some further information ; but if possible you had better call and see us for yourself as you propose. I write in haste with a thousand things to say and neither time nor [space to say them. Excuse all and believe us your brethren in Christ, and in the bonds of all good. Adin Ballou.
