FARM and GARDEN Keeping poultry Keeping Poultry.—Our domestic animals, derived as they are from wild ancestors, require a certain amount of exercise to keep them in vigorous health. Poultry cannot be kept in large numbers in confined areas without detriment to their constitution. Colonel Taggart, of Pennsylvania, provides food and exercise for fowls at the same time. In his poultry yard are several beds about thirty feet square each, in which Colonel Taggart buries oats, several bushels to the bed. The grains begin, of course, at once to swell and germinate, and the fowls have free access, scratching and eating the tender sprouts to their hearts' content. While the fowls are thus busy on one bed, a new one is prepared, which is in readiness for them by the time it is required. The idea is a good one. A single pound of bone-dust... A single pound of bone-dust contains, ac- cording to our illustrious chemist, Liebig, as much phosphoric acid as one hundred pounds of wheat. Hence the economy of utilizing every scrap of bone to be found on the farm. Root crops for cattle Root Crops for Cattle.—The value of roots as feed for cattle, particularly for those giving milk, is receiving large consideration by the agriculturists and stock men of all the more enlightened countries. Not only are they of more value as multiplying the lacteal fluid, but they are more nutritious than other feed, excepting grains, and their manurial value is a very important consideration, as being second only to grain-fed animals. We advise stock men to sow The Yellow Ovoid Beet, which though a recent importation, has the last season yielded under favorable conditions 5000 bushels on three acres ; and at another place more than fifty-nine tons were grown on an acre! We shall sow Ovoid extensively.
