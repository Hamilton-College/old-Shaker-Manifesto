Root crops for cattle Root Crops for Cattle.â€”The value of roots as feed for cattle, particularly for those giving milk, is receiving large consideration by the agriculturists and stock men of all the more enlightened countries. Not only are they of more value as multiplying the lacteal fluid, but they are more nutritious than other feed, excepting grains, and their manurial value is a very important consideration, as being second only to grain-fed animals. We advise stock men to sow The Yellow Ovoid Beet, which though a recent importation, has the last season yielded under favorable conditions 5000 bushels on three acres ; and at another place more than fifty-nine tons were grown on an acre! We shall sow Ovoid extensively.
