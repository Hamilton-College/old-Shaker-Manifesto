When professedly christian people do wrong... When professedly christian people do wrong, or that which Jesus never did, and which, 'to follow him' would forbid; they do not commonly presume they were not christians, but christian sinners for the time. It is far easier. quite popular, to be a christian simler; but truth demands that we say there are none such, and who sins is of the devil. and is not a follower of Jesus, is none of his.
