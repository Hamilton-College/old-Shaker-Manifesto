Ayer, Mass. Nov. 1893. 'There is a good time coming and it will soon be with us.' These were the words of a seer, spoken in our religious service, who with spirit sight looked through the mist into the future, for the prosperity of our Zion home. Let the weak take courage and let the strong rejoice. God, our Heavenly Father has us in his keeping and He will give the increase if we faithfully do our work. Of late being privileged to visit our Gospel relation in Canterbury and Enfield, we found the spirit alive to the ministering of our Gospel testimony. Not only by words of peace and love to one another, but a desire to see it on its mission, as a power to do good among the children of men. Would it not be well for us to give a little more attention to this work, 'Where there is a will there is a way.' How did our Mother and the Elders do when their little company consisted of only twelve witnesses? They made it their first business to herald the good news of free salvation. God gave them this mission. God gives us the same mission when he says, 'Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.' 'God helps those who help themselves' and all that we may do in his name, will never go unrewarded. Let us 'put on the whole armor of God' and make no compromise with the sins of the world. Among all our friends we felt an earnestness for the prosperity of the Gospel testimony, and it awakened a response in our own minds. Let us not delay to do the work, which God would have us to do. Our faithfulness in this all important work, will not go unrewarded. Saturday the 5th, we had quite a little flurry of snow, telling us what we may expect in the near future. The work for autumn is about finished and we are now engaged cutting fire wood. The Sisters are engaged in the duties of the home, a problem they have thoroughly solved. Andrew Barrett.
