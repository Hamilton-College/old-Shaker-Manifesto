Controlling Vicious Horses .—A new and very simple method of training vicious horses was exhibited in West Philadelphia recently, and the manner in which some of the wildest horses were subdued was astonishing. The first trial was that of a kicking or 'bucking' mare, which her owner said had allowed no rider on her back for a period of at least five years. She became tame and gentle in about as many minutes, and allowed herself to be ridden about without a sign of her former wildness. The means by which the result was accomplished was by a piece of light rope, which was passed around the front jaw of the mare just above the upper teeth, crossed in her mouth and thence secured back of her neck. It was claimed that no horse will kick or jump when thus secured, and that a 'bucking' horse, after receiving the treatment a few times, will abandon his vicious way forever. A very simple method was also shown by which a kicking horse could be shod. It consisted in connecting the animal's head and tail by means of a rope fastened to the tail and then to the bit, and drawn tightly enough to incline the horse's head to one side. This, it is claimed, makes it absolutely impossible for tlie horse to kick on the «ide of the rope. At the same exhibition, a horse which for many years had to be bound on the ground to be shod, suffered the blacksmith to operate on him without attempting to kick while secured in the manner described.— Lebanon Courier.
