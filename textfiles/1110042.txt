Tomato Catsup The Journal of Commerce gives the following directions as having been in use in the editor's family for fifty years â€” which is going back to quite an early period in the general introduction of the tomato for culinary purposes: 'Take a bushel of tomatoes: cut them in small pieces; boil until soft; then rub them through a wire sieve; add two quarts of the best cider vinegar, one pint of salt, onequarter pound of whole cloves, one-quarter pound of allspice, one tablespoonful of black pepper, one good-sized pod of red pepper (whole), and five heads of garlic. Mix together and boil until reduced to onehalf the quantity. When cold, strain through a colander, and bottle, sealing the corks. It will keep two or three years as fresh as when first made.'
