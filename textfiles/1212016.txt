SPIRITUALISM. JAMES S. PRESCOT. In writing on this subject I would like to say affew words, before I begin, and these few words are found in the May No. of the Manifesto, page 110, under the heading NOTES. I indorse the last eeven lines because they are the 'multum in pawn' of tl±e tiuth of God. I wish to bear witness to the truth. wherever found, 'on heathen or on Christian ground.' True spiritualism is of God, and cannot be over-thrown, and even the Bible itself was founded on ancient spiritualism, and was a fair sample and a faint reflection of the work of that day—the good and the bad, the true and the false, all mixed together; and he who indorses the plenary inspiration of the Bible, indorses ancient spiritual' ism.
