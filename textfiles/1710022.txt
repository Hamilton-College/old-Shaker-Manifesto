Come sweet peace and fill my bosom, Let all of eternal thou hast gained the humble meek and jarring sounds be rest, Bless thy children's habitation, Come and reign among the just, palm, Bitter envy, strife and railing, Flee before the peaceful Lamb, mild. Who can clearly show thy merit? Thou art Heaven's lovely child, mute, Let the 01 ive spread and blossom Fill us with the heav'nly fruit. Come sweet peace and march before us Bind us in thy golden chain Come sweet peace and take possession, Bear the sceptre in thy hand. Come sweet peace thou art the bearer Of pure love and charity Come sweet peace and banish ever, All contention, war and strife, While we join the heavenly chorus 'Peace on earth, good will to man.' Feast the nations with thy blessings Eide triumphant thro' the land. Every feature, every gesture, Shows that heaven's found in thee. Join us as a band forever To the blooming tree of life.
