EVOLUTION. Daniel Fraser. This word is now much used, and probably but few have any definite idea of it beyond Webster's definition. Now, it is mainly used to coverup materialistic outcomes. This being the case, it may be briefly noticed. Evolution is the act of 'unfolding.' Plants and animals under culture undergo great changes, and within certain limits, adapt themselves to human requirements, and to physical environments. For instance, there is the fleet Arabian horse, and the heavy slow Clydesdale. The latter, can plow day by day with the steady pull of the ox, and needs a heavy ration. The former, subsists on the scant herbage of the desert, and carries its owner from place to place swiftly. Within these extremes, there are many variations, yet, there is no specific change�no evolution of species. The humming-bird and the eagle, and intermediate forms, have throughout the ages maintained their distinctiveness. The public are not informed of the introduction of a single new species ; some have, however, become extinct, and no doubt, others will follow. In the Plant world, the Vitis Vinifera, though under culture for thousands of years, is the Vinifera still. Its richest varieties are today, specifically the Syrian grape the spies carried into the camp of Israel. Hence, modification is not a specific change. The creation, or the unfoldment, of a new species from an existing one, is an impossibility ; except, said species are dual, in the order of its creation. If any entity is dual, has a specifically distinct creation within a creation, the external, the manifest creation, cannot unfold any thing superior to itself. Nevertheless, it may serve as envelope, and in all respects be subservient to the inner, or latent creation. In the fitness of things, this will be so. Materialistic Evolutionists, seem to convey the impression, that if they could get far enough back into the past, it might be shown, that inferior entities, can evolute higher ones, that something, can come from nothing. Judging from what is known of existing organisms, the conclusion is, that the microscopic, infinitesimal, primordial germs of all organisms were as specifically distinct, then, as they now are. That the primordial germs of the apple, the pear, the cherry and the cocoanut, could not evolve the strawberry, nor it, the cocoanut. Even organisms of the same genus hold steadfastly to their own distinctive characteristics. Hybrids are mougreb. The unfolding to a limited extent of living organisms, indicates, that if man is the crowning work of creation, he must be capable of manifesting the highest form of evolution ; and if it can be established that he is dual in his emotional forces, then a new species of man may be evolved, and yet belong to the genus homo. Let us look in this direction for a few moments. Emotions, are the forces of animated beings. First, man has an emotional life, represented by the propensities. Second, he. has also an emotional life, represented by manifestations of Justice, Mercy, and Benevolence; and by aspirations after, and by a growth into these divine attributes. It is worthy of note, that the higher attributes, have opposite results, to those of the action of the propensities. Paul said of them; ' they are contrary, the one to the other.' Showing, that they are specifically distinct. The characteristics of the divine attributes in humanity, are in the direction ' of the love of others, at the expense of self.' In contradistinction to the prevailing proclivities of our lower self-hoods. The evolution of the divine man, would illustrate the possibility of being ' born again ;' and of, ' Behold I create all things anew ;' and of a Millennial period. Again it would illustrate the great fact that individualized living organisms, are essentially spiritual creations. Perhaps it would also illustrate a certain remarkable statement, ' that every plan% before it was in the earth�before it was manifested ; was created ;' and so of all organisms. Certainly it would be desirable, that the Evolutionists would unfold in themselves the higher attributes inhering in humanity, to the full exclusion of their lower self-hoods. Society today needs the services of a few millions of divine men and women, who will care for others more than for self. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
