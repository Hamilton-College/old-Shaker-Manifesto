THE SPIRITUAL TEACHER. Why the Shakers are Entitled to a Candid Hearing. Thomas Stroud. Because :ï¿½While they are a religious body, they value the good in all other religious and secular people; they respect the religious opinions of all men, while claiming their own as highest and best; they respect the sincere unbeliever, atheist, infidel, or heathen, while they abhor profanity and foolish levity; they are a selfsupporting community, those highest in trust among them performing daily manual labor; by their economy, frugality and industry they tend in many ways to increase the material prosperity of the country, and must therefore meet the approval of political economists ; because, while taking no part in politics, they sympathize with every moral, social, and political progressive movement; rejoice to see the governments of the earth tending to the freedom of the people, and to their releasement from oppression. The}' recommend moderation and temperance in food and drink, and would be glad to see the manufacture of all intoxiicating drinks prohibited; they are fast tending to vegetarianism; they will not follow the fashions of the world in apparel and conversation, but s ek oniy for cleanliness and comfort ; they rejoice to see old credent forms breaking away in the minds of men, and to see a growth into more of the simplicity and life of Christ which consists in repentance for wrong, Matt. xxi., 31, 32, that leads to amendment of the life. They think that man should bear the moral consequences of sin equally with woman ; being the originators of the sublime idea, that God is as much Mother as Father: justice is at once established in the mind, and equality of the sexes accorded. The founder of their institution was a woman, and their sisters are equal in rights and authority with the brethren, and have been for one hundred and twenty years, since the founding of the community ; they sympathize with every effort to place woman on a legal equality with man, believing primarily in the justice of such equality, and as a consequence that much moral im- provement would follow in the world's social structure, consequently they are spontaneous and unpartisan democrats, believing that the enlightened conscience of the people should be the ruling factor of governments; necessarily, they are among the most patriotic of the people, having faith that the government of this country was founded under Divine influence, by human instruments, for the preservation of the liberties of man. They give their testimony not to oppress the conscience, but in love for the benefit of their fellow men, and are thankful if their influence can lead any to amend their lives in any degree. (Rev. xxii., 2, 'The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations;') they think there are very few who possess no redeeming qualities, and none can be entirely lost as long as they possess one good trait. (Matt, xviii., 14.) They are the foster parents of modern spiritualism. The nation cannot afford to lose the pure spiritual ministrations of the Shakers, unless it would be willing to sink into gross materialism and mere intellectualism; because the time will come when the people will regard the Shakers with affection and veneration. We would respectfully ask the professed believers in the authority of the Christian scriptures, whether the immediate followers of Christ did not form a community (Acts ii., 44-47 ; iv., 32-35;) whether Christ's own words do not invite all who would be his followers to forsake their selfish possessions and family relations, and seek with him to form a new relationship, and share with him their communal property. (Matt, x., 16, 22; x., 34, 39 ; xii., 49, 50.) Christ himself said, all could not receive the full cross (Matt, xix., 11, 12,) but he taught them as they could bear it. (Mark iv., 33.) He was wise as well as peaceable and pure; if he could lead any souls one step higher he rejoiced in that, and prayed that they might be able to go on to greater degrees of self-denial and goodness. He chose a few, who were most ripened up, to whom he could administer deeper spiritual teaching, and of whom he required a severer cross than he did of others (Matt, xiii., 10-16.) His purpose was to induce this little company to forsake all carnal pleasures, selfish possessions, (Matt, xix., 24; xi., 25, 26,) and family ties (xix., 27, 28,) to form this new relation, founded on purity, unselfishness and peace. (Matt, xxvi., 52.) But none understood him (Matt, xv., 16,) until the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost partly enlightened them. We would ask whether to govern the lives of professing Christians there are not three principles laid down by Christ, namely, purity, peace and unselfishness, to be cemented by the power of pure love; and whether if this be admitted that would not be an admission of the Shaker principles. We would ask whether the principle of community and celibacy preserved by the church of Rome, now become formal, and the influence for peace that she has exercised in past ages, in the dark period of mediaeval times, were not derived from the traditions handed down from the immediate followers of Christ; and whether the writings of Count Tolstoi are not remarkable confirmation of the Shaker testimony. We would ask this suggestive question of the honest Unbeliever, Atheist, Infidel or Heathen, whether the Shaker does not freely accord to him a privilege to live as his convictions lead him, in the words of the poet: Is not an honest doubt worth full as much to the elevation of mankind as blind devotion to religious creeds? Of the professed believer we would ask : Does not the voice of the spirit (Rev. xxii., 11, 12, 17; xx., 13) as well as the enlightened conscience of humanity, proclaim that all, who do no moral wrong, should have a privilege to live as their own conscience and understanding lead them ? In my references to the Bible I mainly quote from Matthew. All the other Gospels contain passages equally confirmatory of the propositions stated. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life. Would you have a spiritual feast, examine all the passages I have quoted. Enfield, Conn.
