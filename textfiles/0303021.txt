RELIGION By Alice Grey Religion is the only true basis of happiness. 'Pure and undefiled religion,' outflowing from Wisdom and Love, is soul-purifying and exalting. We may be intellectually wise, and may possess great scientific knowledge and be morally correct in our habits of life ; but we cannot form 'perfect characters without religion. A mere profession, or belief in some theo- logical creed, will prove ineffectual, unless we live out the law of Love; and we shall be left in the cold, barren region of selfishness, toiling for, and feeding the animal part of our natures, instead of the higher spiritual faculties of our souls, which would lead us to condemn error in our own lives, and to look charitably upon the faults of others. 21 8HAKEE A.ISTD True religion will teach us to be tender and compassionate ; to be as ministering angels of love and mercy to the fallen and lowly, and to take them by the hand, and walk with them in the path of virtue. Thus shall we help to lift them up to better conditions, by practically showing the power of love, and the worth of that kind of religion, which will not allow us to stand with folded hands, and see a brother or sister in need or distress, and coldly say, ' Be ye warmed and clothed; ' neither in a Pharisaical manner boastingly say —' I thank God that my condition is otherwise ; ' for ' He knoweth the proud afar off.' Pride is incompatible with true Christian religion, which fills its subjects with humility and love. —Whitewater, Ohio.
