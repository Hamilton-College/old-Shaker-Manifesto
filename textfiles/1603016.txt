In Memory of our departed Father and Friend, Elder Peter Long. GENEVEVE DE GRAW. Sad is the thought our father's gone, Leaving his flock to mourn alone. To brighter orbs his spirit's flown, Where death and parting are not known. How rapid seemed his earthly flight, Life's setting sun soon changed to night! Some had not heard that he was ill Before his mortal form was still. We'll see no more his smiling face, A vacancy now fills its place. Where oft his busy feet have trod His form will rest beneath the sod. 'Tis well with him, life's storms are o'er, Earth's tempests cannot harm him more. 'Tis well with him, life's race is run, The battle's fought, the victory's won. Bright angels beckoned him away To dwell where all is constant day. Though from our sight his spirit's fled And earth's cold clay is counted dead. Yet still we know he lingers near To bless and comfort, love and cheer. To all he was a faithful friend, To all his willing aid would lend, And ever some kind word would speak To guide the strong and help the weak. Yet while our father we shall miss, One happy thought we have�'tis this,� That we shall meet him ' over there' Where all is joyous, bright and fair. We trust he's gone where angels dwell, The tones of the ' Golden Harp ' to swell. We trust he's found a home above Where reigns supreme the Father's love. And now farewell our father kind, A stricken flock yoa've left behind, The loss we feel no tongue can tell, Yet this we know, with you 'tis well. Groveland, N. Y.
