A CHAPTER ON LIFE-BOATS By George Baxter UPON the intellectual sea of life, there floats more than three hundred and fifty life-boats, or in other words, denominations of religionists, each claiming to be able to 'rescue the perishing.' To go aboard each craft, and learn the means by which they expect to reach their highest ideal of righteousness, would be extremely interesting to the seeker after knowledge. By a close inspection of one of these Life-boats we find the inscription, 'The Mormon Boat of Safety.' Studying its theology, we learn that one Joseph Smith unearthed golden tablets, upon which he claimed were written the 'Laws of God.' Many accepted these as their guide upon the sea of life. With 'church before state,' and 'extreme exclusiveness from the world,' for several years the Mormon Life-boat floated along serenely. Accumulating wealth and many members, these were added to its goodly crew, but after a season, a whirlpool of moral indignation swept over it, and cleansed it from the mire of greed and sensuality, with which it had become tarnished. Mormonism, to-day, floats a more respectable boat, by having come in collision with purer forces. So much for the 'oars of endeavor,' the moral energy, which remains active, until the cargo of error, of injustice and inequality is thrown overboard. Many of these life-boats are of magnificent structure, inviting the respect and admiration of both he old and the young. Among these we find the 'Spiritualist's Boat,' made of the strong timbers of truth. Intercommunion of the two worlds, which interlacement of union has helped to lessen the power of creeds and dogmas of the dark ages. This enlightenment, descended upon the Spiritualists, by means of an older life-boat, known as the 'Shaker-order.' This boat was nearly eighteen hundred years in being constructed, so vast was the bulk of truth with which it was freighted; It now floats upon the ocean of life, casting out its lines of salvation to all souls tossing upon the crest of the sea, while the Captain joyously sings,— 'When God is for us, what the storm! What power his law withstands? It is trusting in these laws that inspires the soul with courage to toil on, and weary not in well-doing. Many of us know what it has cost us to become, and remain, what we are. Yet a little while, and through the mists of enshrouding darkness has gleamed the stars of bright promise and waking gladness, thus anchoring our faith still firmer in the grand truth,— 'Tho frail the barque, and fierce the gale, Unseen, the Pilot's hand, Yet, as thy day, so comes thy strength To reach the promised land.' THE MANIFESTO. . 9 Well may every soul who has reached this 'promised land' of spiritual and moral development testify of the blessedness and soul fullness realized by coming into harmony with the Captain of the life-boat, whose compass points on war i and upward toward that realm where purity, love and justice rule, an I where righteousness abounds.
