THE SAVIOUR NEAR ROSETTA CUMINGS Enfield, N. H. feel my Saviour's presence nigh, His spirit seems to say 'And will ye now for sake me. Oh will ye turn away? Oh will ye turn away.' In quick response my heart replies â€” Lord whither shall I turn? Thou givest to me eternal life. Thy saving power I've known, Oh thy saving power I've known.
