OUR FATHER IS DEAD O. L. WHITCOMB [In common with a united, sorrowing nation, our people felt the dreadful shock occasioned by the transfer of our noble President from shores terrestrial to those celestial. We copy from one beautiful season of respect, two tributes; one of these, from the peculiar condition of its authoress, is, indeed, touching.— Ed.] Silent and deep at our common loss, The tears of our common sorrow fall. He, high throned in our hearts, and crowned with our love, Lies tranquil and cold beneath the dark pall. Over the land the flood of our grief Wipes out the fire of our party strifes ; And prayerful and peaceful our hearts only beat, To the muffled drums, and the whisp'ring fifes. Over the sea, in lands far away, There's tolling of bells, and crape-hung doors, And the widowed Queen's hand in her widowed friend's heart The solace divine sweet sympathy pours. Once before we have drained this cup's deep draught — Once before, oh, our Father above, We have given to Thee at the lightning's flash The first of our land, the first of our love Is there no strength in Thy hand to stay The power of might over truth and right? Forgive us our murmurs, we are blinded in pain, And our questioning eyes would be grateful for light. Peace to the name —the well-beloved name, Though our heart's every fibre protests Against the dark deed that robbed us of him, Ever and aye shall his memory be blest. Down 'neath the so'd we lay him to rest — He, who so bravely battled above; His name on history's page will be bright, On our hearts, in letters of love. God, take him home, but leave herewith us His mantle of courage and trust; Leave us his patience, his meekness, to say 'Ashes to ashes, dust unto dust! ' Canaan, Sept. 26, 1381.
