I wish with you to ever keep the gospel principles alive and growing. How can we hope to reap an easy harvest on the fields where our ancestors felled the forests and drove the wild beasts away? Shall we not grow good, and spend our strength in diffusing good under friendly and favorable condition*? Or is the lash of persecution necessary to stimulate zeal and heroism? If permit- ted, we might diffuse and influence, for good in the open fields near at hand. Clean, white napkins are in order at a refreshment; but not in order to lay away our food in, that we should eat, or give to the needy. Be assured that Eld. Frederick and yourself, and all who attended the Liberal League Convention were inspired by those bold thinkers who have advanced the world. 'The demons of our lives become the saints* that we adore.' Thanking you for your kindness, pleases ever think of me as one with you in faith. and good, works. Yours, Elijah Myrick
