NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. April 6, 1890. Had the 'Notes about Home' been introduced to the Manifesto a few months earlier, we too might have reported at that time, present home repair; of debris removed, roads straightened, and other improvements about our Dwelling, made by young and interested hands. But the end is not yet, and when proposed equal improvements are made about our Office and its environs, we shall be happy to report. We look at the notes carefully wishing to add a new item, but in vain. Our experiences are common to all with the exception of no La Grippe. The physicians of Europe say it was hard to tell where La Grippe ended, and where panic began. If the disease visited us it was contemporaneous with its appearance in Europe, and before we knew enough to dread it. Our neat wire street fence, with its black and white gates, has been standing eighteen years. The maple shade trees by the roadside were set, from fifteen to thirty years ago ; but the telephone poles on both sides of the street, (more useful than ornamental) are of recent date. We are patiently waiting for the 'Village Improvement Board' to organize and run a good foot path through our beautiful village. We are fortunate in being connected with the family on each side by such, but further than this we cannot report; and the children coming to school must �'traipse through mud,' and then lose several days during a term, for the want of a decent path. The anxiety for an ice harvest has been a matter of interest the winter past, but nothing has been said of the harvest of pleasure anxiously waited for by the 'wee small folk,' who thought snow and ice came because they 'prayed for sliding;' and like the ice gatherers they laid aside all duties possible, to attend to it as long as a slide was to be had; and were rewarded with robust health and rosy cheeks. In the middle of January one of the Brethren gathered some trailing arbutus, and after keeping it in water for a few days, the buds opened as fresh as in May and brought happy thoughts of an eternal bloom, to the bedside of a dying Sister. Branches from a deciduous flowering shrub were also broken off in mid-winter, which have not only grown leaves in water, but produced a perfect bloom. When reading of 'the bees in the chimney,' we are reminded how necessary it is, that to carry out the full purpose of our religious Community life we must 'Make home a hive where all beautiful feelings Shall cluster like bees and their honey-dew bring, Make it a temple of holy revealings And love its bright angel with shadowy wing.' We are glad to see an increasing interest in the Bible questions. The number of answers has increased from sixty to ninety. One important selected promise in the last number we find omitted. It is indeed pleasant when the labor of life has been arduous yet satisfactory, to think of rest; but if we are living, active workers spiritually, we do not seek this. All we ask is a privilege to work, while so much labor is needed; and imbued with this thought, six of us choose as the most comforting of our Savior's promises 'Ask and ye shall receive; seek and ye shall find ; knock and it shall be opened unto you. * Center Famliy. We Closed our school on the 22nd inst. The teacher, Elder Calvin Reed has been unwell recently from indigestion and heart difficulty. We hope for his speedy recovery. Have finished our wood business it being all split, housed and piled in good shape. We are now awaiting the spring season in which plowing and sowing the garden and field seeds will be in order, so that we may have something by and by to nourish these bodies of ours and make them strong to enable us to do good to the household of faith. March No., of Manifesto contains some excellent articles, among which I wish to name, Sister Anna B. Goepper's and Mary L. Wilson's, bearing on subjects of vital interest to the young and rising generation, and all concerned in the well-being of Society. Our young people are much interested in Sabbath day bible lessons and Monday evening Lyceum. We think and hope both may be productive of good and prove a blessing to all concerned. T. Kayson. April, 11. We have for several weeks been preparing for spring. Have filled our woodhouse and are anxious for the weather to enable us to put in crops. The roads and foot-paths through our Village have been, and are in a very bad condition. We certainly should do something to make them better. We have recently taken two boys from near Fortress Monroe Va., this adds a treasure of life to the external and enables us to keep in a training condition. One thing I am quite satisfied about; that fine houses with all modern conveniences do not make people any more contented, or more willing to bear the cross. I sometimes think they may incline us to be more at ease in Zion. : In passing through New York city recently, it was distressing to witness the great gulf between the high and the low, the rich and the poor. There must be something radically wrong in the laws and system of government that permits of such extremes between man and his fellows all claiming to be the children of the one Heavenly Father. Until this system is changed I have very little hope of a religious revival that will fill our homes with earnest, unselfish, truthloving souls. In kindest love, Daniel Offord. Hancock, Mass. The mild winter sent the ice hunters into this section. Some of them located their works about a mile from us on the shores of the Richmond Lake and the good Sisters provided them with food. At one time we had. thirty men and ten horses as boarders. We fed and lodged them as best we could. Your Sisters in Canterbury would hardly been able to have kept those tubs of bntter if they had a four weeks call from such a company. The company makes a liberal conpensation for all favors, and the ice busiuess it is thought, will bring an increase into this section of $500 000 and the laboring class get a good share of it. The company at Richmond Lake cut some one hundred thousand tons. For six weeks there has been two and three North Family. hundred teams drawing ice from the Onota and Pontookuc Lakes which are six miles from our Village. I. Lawson. Enfield, Conn. 'We feel the balmy breeze of May, Soft blowing down the grassy way.' We should fill the hours with some worthy object in view, for they seem to fly as if on the wings of the wind. Mental, physical and spiritual activity is the source of happiness. Duty is the watchword. Farm and garden work begins to press. A good garden is the gem of the faim. The more it is cultivated the better. We should have good seed to plant. Good seed is the basis of success, and we cannot afford to'j have any but the best. There is more than one way of doing things, and it may be that there is a better one than ours. If so, it is right to learn it. We should aim to make lets acres produce more, and with less work. Wood ashes are excellent for all soils deficient in potash. The difficulty is to get enough of them. No matter about the fine points of hens if the egg basket shows that they are all right. Good care is the best hen-doctor. Put sitting hens in quiet, dark places, away from disturbance. D. Orcutt. Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Elder Henry:�We greet you with 'How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.' We open with this most appropriate of texts, in noting items about home, present month, in reference to the call upon our Society of Beloved Elder Giles B. Avery and Eldress Harriet Bullard, so widely known as members of the Order of the Central Ministry of Mt. Lebanon. They came to us the 4th. inst. via. Harvard and left for Enfield, N. H., the 10th. It hardly seems good taste to eulogize these special God-sent messengers, and surely no better taste to be silent over this season of blessing. Other persons and events are eulogized and pass into history. Not so this occasion, the pure presence and soulcheering ministrations of spiritual love and confidence in God through these loved ones will live forever in the hearts of those who have 'ears to hear' and hearts to retain the seed sown. We saw and felt that their staff was the rod and their crown the cross, yet we were blest and reconciled to take our portion of both the rod and the cross. As a result of their co-operation, Elder H. C. Blinn resigns the office of minister over the Societies of Canterbury and Enfield and assumes the Eldership of our Church Family, William Briggs associate. Br. J. S. Kaime succeeds Elder Henry in the Ministry. The Brethren who have carried burdens as Elders in the Church, Benjamin H. Smith and Alexander Y. Cochran are appointed as Trustees of the Church retaining Elder J. S. Kaime as special counselor. How satisfactory, when, at the call of the 'Good Shepherds,' hearts and hands are for better, purer and more acceptable service. In this spirit we find our faithful Brethren assuming new duties, in which they are sustained and blessed* by those who have witnessed and appreciated past consecrated. May our messenger, beloved Ministry, convey to you the thanks of a grateful people. Our table is still spread with the choice fruits of the spirit from Brethren and Sisters of Enfield, N. H., as represented by beloved Elder Abraham Perkins and Br. John Bradford. Surely the Lord hath remembered us and his comfort is round about us. More than welcome are such angel visitants and we trust other Gospel friends tnay come and 'do likewise.' We thought to speak of a devotional religious service held during your absence of more than usual interest, but lest we call forth the whispered reminder 'Be brief' will simply add that the maple harvest closed with the satisfactory result of over five hundred gallons prepared syrup. Spring advances timidly. We would suggest that she be allowed a free, liberal reign, for we covet the re-appearance of early vegetables as potatoes were taken from our garden the first week in June, 1889. God bless our gardeners and farmers, and hasten our crops. We prefer them ere they are made into flesh, as we do the water into wine. Enfield, N. H. The robins are selecting their homes among the maple trees in the old church lane just opposite our windows, which presages, that before many weeks elapse, the goddess of Spring shall bestow her mantle of green, on mountain and valley, making our home a veritable paradise, in-as-much as local scenery is requisite in accomplishing this end. Surely, with the revivifying of all external things, every active soul, will make new resolves, 'to be good and do good,' thus forming for the mind also a fresh adorning. (We sisters) from East to West, from North to South, know that with this season of the year, comes the much needed, much dreaded, (by some) house-cleaning, and right here, let me whisper a word of caution to my companions, whom I might presume to teach in this line. Have we learned a wiser, safer way to house-clean than that practised by our sainted predecessors, of turning everything up side down at the outset, taking out windows when the weather is unsuitable, and thus inviting the grim angel by taking sudden colds? Let us, judiciously, care for the degree of health we are blessed with, and add to our stock if possible, for health is a priceless treasure. Our sugar harvest was rather above the average, not more barrels of sap, butagreater percentage of the sugar producing element in a given quantity of liquid, if any one wishes to study cause and effect, this is a practical question ; what causes this difference? We are pleased to say that we have been blessed with a visit from the Central Ministry. They were to us angel Ministers of the good things of God's Kingdom. In mental vision, we could see, Beloved Elder Daniel, and Eldress Ann, so well do we know their parental anxiety for every branch of the household. May they be comfortable in health, for a long time yet, to bless those who come under their influence is our prayer, which is not a selfish one. E. B. Alfred, Me. Beloved Eldee Henry :�We 'Down Easters' could but commiserate our Brethren in New York, in their scramble for ice. While reading their pitiful story a company from New York were housing from our pond, blocks of crystal coldness eighteen to twenty inches thick. They finished cutting the 2nd. inst., having housed, altogether, over 40,000 tons. In answer to Br. Daniel's Sabbath query, we would say: If only those who have so far consecrated soul and body as to be able to make their 'labor worship,' go beyond the bounds prescribed by Moses, there would be but little danger of desecrating the Sabbath. But I fear the 'unprogressed humanity,' who need the Sabbath to aid in curbing the selfishness of their natures, would include the larger number among Believers, as well as among the children of this world. Then comes the query, How far Br. Daniel and the minority are obligated to set us an example of Sabbath keeping that will be safe for us to follow. Winter continues to 'linger in the lap of Spring.' The ground this 10th. of April is white with snow, which suits us no better than it does the robins. The young Brethren have finished sawing the wood, notwithstanding, every other day was stormy, and are now busy splitting the same. 'Hands at work, and hearts to God,' �I hope may ever be their motto. From our past Winter's experience, we would pray to be delivered from any more 'open winters.' The old-fashioned kind with its there or four feet of snow, and plenty of Zero weather is so much more healthy. J. B. V. Groveland, N. Y. When all other subjects fail, 'We're sure the weather will prevail; There is of it a boundless source To live we must have it, of course. For thirty-one days March has followed in the ways and by-ways of its three distinguished predecessors. December, January and February, distinguished for what? Not for ice and not for snow, Not for wint'ry storms we know, But for absence of Jack Frost, March has many a rough road crossed. Through the timely suggestion of Elder Alexander, several barrels of water were poured on the pond during the ice formation, which resulted in the yielding of ice to the thickness of three and one-half to four inches. The morning of the tenth ult. was the most fortunate for harvesting it. We secured at that time nearly twenty tons of clear solid ice; the work had to be performed rapidly, for as the sun rose higher its rays grew hotter, diminishing perceptibly the work of previous days. So ended at noon (of the same day) our ice harvest for this Spring. Could we have looked into the future far enough to have seen what the weather for at day would have bgen, we should have made wiser calculations, and dedicated Sunday for one of the days for gathering ice, bu* we did not foresee, so instead of gathering ice, we gathered together and went to meeting, and ever since have been lamenting over 'spilled milk,' or rather we should have said lamenting over thawed ice. If the Summer's cold equals the Winter's heat we may find sufficient opportunity during the coming season to furnish ice for another winter. While many of our neighbors and friends far and near have been harboring 'Russian Grippe'' for the past three months, we at Groveland Liv. Co., N. Y., have escaped it in every form. Not one case of the despised Grippe has been known in our Society. Here is one of the wonderful advantages Groveland climate has over many other portions of this vast planet. Let all who value good health locate in this town. For of all the climates man may test Groveland atmosphere's the best, From East to West, from North to South, In time of flood, or time of drouth 'Tis ever healthful, restful here. For that Elixir called Good Cheer Drives in the distance ills and woes, And in its stead good health it shows. 'Twill mind and body and spirits renew, Dear Editor, please just try it, will you? With our newly authorized gardener Br. Jerome Garvey we have no fears of going hungry for the delicious fruits and vegetables he is now arranging and devising to raise for home disposal. Old Egypt can never boast of such perfect leeks and onions as our young resolute garden manager will produce. With Excelsior for his motto we shall look for unheard of wonders to be developed from the 'Vegetable Kingdom' sometime in the far away, or near at hand future. Our School closed its Winter term on the 27th. ult. No. of scholars recorded, 13. Punctuality, regular attendance, good order, and thoroughness in all lessons have been the leading characteristics of the school. Wishing all the readers and non-readers of the Manifesto, and readers of every other good and perfect work a ''Happy April first,' we will closte our talks with you for this month and next May we will tell you more about home surroundings, more about what we have left untold this time. In the intervene we shall think of you all, and wish for you all much health and happiness. G. D. G. Union Village, Ohio. Dear Elder Henry;�On Friday night April 11th, our wood-house containing an oil room and two other rooms for agricultural instruments was burned, together with a garden house standing about a rod south of it and separated by a wagon road. The wood-house was 90 feet long by 22;W&gt;' wide. The garden-house was 18 by 18, and two stories; both frame buildings. The woodliouse stood 54 feet south of, and parallel with our dwelling-house and the miracle of all miracles is, how we saved our dwelling. The whole roof seemed covered with blazing cinders, and the belfry burned, and cinders flew over to our Brickshop 8 rods to the North and set the roof on fire, and yet we saved both buildings. The Center and North Brethren and Sisters, Ministry and all were soon on the ground and for three or four hours we fought the ghastly foe and finally arrested his ravages. The fire commenced about two o'clock in the morning and was subdued about five A. M. Our good Brethren and Sisters from tin; Center and North, remained with us, drying up inundated rooms and halls carrying in the furniture, bedding &amp;c, which was carried into the street until we were all tidied up once more and for their love and sympathy so practically demonstrated we say God bless them all. Also, it would be wrong to fail in giving just and righteous credit to our hired friends for their almost super-human exertions in saving us from temporal ruin. I can say in truth if it had not been for the assistance of the hired help from our own, and Center and North families our whole premises would have gone down before the devouring element. If the property had been their own they could not have exerted themselves more to save it. Finally, as Eldr'ess Adaline said to me, the next morning, 'We still have a beautiful' home' and that is so many fold better than it might have been, that we feel able 'to raise a tax on our calamity' and feel thankful for this sweet Home and the blessings left to us. The damage done to our Dwelling House will amount perhaps to fifty dollars fully covered by insurance. Happening to be flush of water, the wet winter and spring which we complained of so much, was the very thing that saved us, for all our exertions would have been futile without an immense amount of that grateful element. The fire is a profound and inscrutable mystery. No one can tell how it came. We planted a patch of early potatoes last Friday. The Center family are planting four or five hundred young apple trees and some cherry and plum trees, to make up the deficit, caused by the Cyclone. We are about to plant some cherry trees ; and already have several hundred apple trees. Now dear Elder Henry this is about the best we can do in the way of tidings this time. Love to all. Pray for us. O. C H. April 2. South Union, Ky, I am happy in saying, the fruit was not all killed on the sixth ult., when the mercury dropped to 12 degrees. It so happened that some of the peach trees were not in full bloom. If Jack Frost will keep away, we may have some peaches. The apples and small fruit had but little injury. Wheat badly killed, but may sprout from the roots and give a half crop. The most astonishing thing in this neck, of the woods, is the large number of birds, of various kinds, that seek repose at night in our evergreens, especially in the yard occupied by the dwelling of the Ministry. Not only hundreds but thousands have made a business of retiring here through the month of March. Black birds out-number the others, and I was surprised to see some six or eight varieties of birds enter the same trees. The mocking birds were obliged to leave, and go to the hedges, to a more retired place, where no one would disturb them; They all seemed to enjoy their berths in quietness and friendship, April 5. I have just been mowing the Meeting House yard. [Pretty good for a man that is 82 years of age. Ed.�] I now hasten to my writing desk to say that 'the Farmers were more scared than hurt.' They now inform me that the wheat is but little injured and promises an average crop. H. L. E.
