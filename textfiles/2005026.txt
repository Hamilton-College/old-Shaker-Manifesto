South Union, Ky, I am happy in saying, the fruit was not all killed on the sixth ult., when the mercury dropped to 12 degrees. It so happened that some of the peach trees were not in full bloom. If Jack Frost will keep away, we may have some peaches. The apples and small fruit had but little injury. Wheat badly killed, but may sprout from the roots and give a half crop. The most astonishing thing in this neck, of the woods, is the large number of birds, of various kinds, that seek repose at night in our evergreens, especially in the yard occupied by the dwelling of the Ministry. Not only hundreds but thousands have made a business of retiring here through the month of March. Black birds out-number the others, and I was surprised to see some six or eight varieties of birds enter the same trees. The mocking birds were obliged to leave, and go to the hedges, to a more retired place, where no one would disturb them; They all seemed to enjoy their berths in quietness and friendship, April 5. I have just been mowing the Meeting House yard. [Pretty good for a man that is 82 years of age. Ed.ï¿½] I now hasten to my writing desk to say that 'the Farmers were more scared than hurt.' They now inform me that the wheat is but little injured and promises an average crop. H. L. E.
