Agricultural NOTS OF THE HORSE:. Going up hill, whip me not; Going down hill, hurry me not; On level road, spare me not; Loose in stable, forget me not; Of hay and corn rob me not; Of clean water stint me not; Of soft, dry bed deprive me not; Tired and hot, wash me not; If sick or cold, chill me not; With sponge and brush neglect me not; With bits and reins, oh, jerk me not; And when you are angry, strike me not.
