NEVER MIND WHAT 'THEY' SAY Don't worry nor fret About what people think, Of your ways or your means, Of your food or your drink. If you know you are doing Your best every day, With the right on your side, Never mind what 'they' say. Lay out in the mmorning Your plans for each hour, And never forget That old time is a power. This also remember, 'Mong truths old and new, The world is too busy To think much of you. Then garner the minutes That make up the hours, And pluck in your pilgrimage Honor's bright flowers. Should grumblers assure you Your course will not pay, With conscience at rest, Never mind what 'they' say. Then let us, forgetting The insensate throng That jostles us daily, While marching along, Press onward and upward, And make no delay, And though people talk Never mind what 'they' say.
