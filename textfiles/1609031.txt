From the Little Children. RASPBERRIES. There are three kinds of raspberries. The Black, the White and the Red. The fruit was so named from the roughness of the berry. The wild raspberries are ever so much sweeter than the cultivated ones, but not so large. The bushes on which they grow are very prickly. The black raspberry is not very sweet but some of them are quite large. I like raspberries very much. It is not quite time for them to ripen yet, but when they do I shall notice to see if I can find any thing else about them. L. H. WHERE GOLD IS FOUND, HOW QUARRIED. Gold is a metal. It is found in mines, and men dig it out from the earth and it is hoisted up from the deep pits by strong ropes or chains. There are different qualities of gold some is pure, and some is mixed with other minerals or metals and has to be cleansed and refined. A great deal of gold is melted and made into jewelry and other things. Sadie.
