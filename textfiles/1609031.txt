WHERE GOLD IS FOUND, HOW QUARRIED. Gold is a metal. It is found in mines, and men dig it out from the earth and it is hoisted up from the deep pits by strong ropes or chains. There are different qualities of gold some is pure, and some is mixed with other minerals or metals and has to be cleansed and refined. A great deal of gold is melted and made into jewelry and other things. Sadie.
