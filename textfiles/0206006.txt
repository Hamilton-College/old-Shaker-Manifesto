'Reform.'—The Motion Seconded BY SnUBABL PRENTISS, SHAKERS, K. T. On reading 0. C. Hampton's article on Reform, n\y mind was very agreeably impressad, and I wish to express to him my approval of it. I would say to Bro. Oliver and others, go ahead. It is time that all loathsome habits, such as smoking, chewing and snuffing tobacco, and all excesses of eating and drinking should find no place among us as believers in all true reforms. There is also a fashionable custom of using alcoholic drinks as medicine, in cordials, bitters, etc. Whether the drug steeped in the alcohol is most desired, or the same swallowed as a cover for the alcohol without it, I leave each to determine. I hold an opinion. I have seen bad habits formed from this fashionable practice. Medicine can be prepared without alcohol, but would it then be as desirable ? How much would then be used? Very little, I think. Doctors would starve for want of business; and they ought to starve if they could not find better employ. I long for the day when humanity will be represented by ' sound minds in healthy bodies,'—bodies equally sound 'as the beasts that perish.' Would not it be as profitable business for the generative world to take as much pains in the production of humanity as is now exercised for quadrupeds ? I second the motion for ' reform ' on humanity's account, and in contemplation of Zion's needs.
