Alfred, Me. Feb. 1803. I wonder if you have had as much cold weather in New Hampshire as we have in Maine. When I read in the last Manifesto that you were harvesting ice fifteen inches thick, I thought that yours must be a milder climate than ours. Our Brethren commenced cutting ice for ourselves and townsmen in December and before they had finished the blocks of crystal THE MANIFESTO. coldness were about eighteen inches thick. It has been cold, colder and coldest, and not having had the protection of the snow one of our aqueducts has suspended operations until sometime next June, the frost having penetrated down to and below it. Old Boreas has driven the same into houses and cellars making the building of fires necessary to save our vegetables. The bursting of water pipes has tried the patience of our Brethren not a little, and still they have maintained a Christian spirit. We thank God for our Brethren. Notwithstanding all this cold weather there is still a complaint of too little snow to haul wood and lumber. However, we all live and have had much less sickness than last winter with its mild weather. How happy the thought that this cold world is not our abiding place or continuing city, but if we are faithful to let the fire of the gospel do its perfect work we shall have a home in that Sweet Summer Land where Jesus Christ and Mother Ann with all the purified ones dwell. Let us strive more earnestly to prepare ourselves for this home. Fannie Casey.
