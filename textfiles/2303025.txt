How lonely we should feel if on the first of every month, we could not anticipate the arrival of our neat little Monthly. Coming as it does laden with items from the North, South, East and West, it is really a Carrier Dove, and has at least scored one point, toward a concentration of our forces. We have just received from the hands of the binders, the latest volumes of the 'Manifesto' and now having the set entire in our Church Library, we feel it to be a valuable acquisition thereto. No more worthy volume is found in our entire list (which is no meager collection) and why should it not be so. Turning its pages, we find the contributions of so many of our worthies, now passed to spirit life; and still many more living representatives, of the faith, who write of what they know, because experience has taught them. When we read something particularly good, how it enhances its value to know that the author's thoughts are the outgrowth of life principles, and if 'Thoughts are Things,' are we not ennobled by the reading of a book, directed entire, to a life of virtue, and an unselfish devotion to its cause. But these Notes are of the 'Manifesto' not of Home. The severe weather here as elsewhere in our latitude closes us in. But the spiritual life like the roots beneath the ice, is vigorous, which is manifest, by the spiritual communion we enjoy when the Church and Center Families, meet alternately in our places of worship, through the winter. Though nominally two Families, still we are of one interest, both spiritual and temporal, and our joys and sorrows are mutual. February thus far has given us wide extremes of weather, and we hardly know from hour to hour, whether we need umbrellas or furs. The Brethren are out one day chopping away the ice to let the surplus flood of water down into the proper drain, and perhaps in twenty-four hours are chopping again to find some water. Our water privileges are great, and our water excellent, but this we are too unmindful of, until some little disturbance in the channels, causes a halt in the usual abundant flow. It is then that we are reminded of the maxim: 'Pleasures and privileges, like birds of gay plumage, are better seen when on the wing.' Amelia J. Calver. Shakers, N.Y. North. Family. Feb. 1893. The last of January brought the much wished for snow, not so much as we would like, but enough so that we can haul our fire wood on runners which is easier for man and beast. It may not be possible for the lesser to bless the better but we can pray for them. And at the present time our prayer is, Heavenly Father, and Mother, may thy angels of power and comfort strengthen and bless those who are walking in tribulation to uphold the standard of the higher life and maintain in its integrity, our virgin Communal relation. My dear, young, gospel companions, let us hold up their hands and without fear nor doubting believe that the cause for which we have given our lives will not be suffered to fall to the ground. Jack Frost has been doing quite effective work, from the number of water-pipes upon which he has laid his icy grip. The ground is frozen over three feet. Those THE MANIFESTO. 71 who have resided here many years, tell us that they have not for some years seen the springs and streams so low as at present and so closely ice-bound; but it will be spring by and by and the birds and flowers will compensate for it all. We will patiently wait. Hamilton DeGraw. Shaker Station., Conn. Feb. 7, 1893. Fresh cabbage is an excellent food for hens in winter, it stimulates and gives exercise that healthy layers must have. This is worthy of trial. Cabbage should be kept in a cool place, handy to the poultry house, a supply of it should be stored in November. The lime and soda phosphate contained in the cabbage is essentially valuable to laying hens when out-door exercise is out of the question While chickens are young and growing, the albuminoids and nitrogenous foods should be fed largely to promote the growth of flesh, muscle, bone and feathers. Two weeks before marketing, cracked corn and corn meal are best. We tried this plan last season with marked success. Daniel Orcutt. Feb. 6, 18!tt. The weather at present is clear and very cold, as has been the case with but little change for the past six weeks. It has been a remarkably dry season, and to be deprived of water almost entirely in such a cold time adds much to the burdens of the day. We are drawing water in barrels for the Laundry and Dairy use, but with care we have water for cooking purposes from the spring which is very low. The stock are all driven to the meadow some distance from the barn, where by use of a pump they are supplied. About a week since thei'e was a nice shower which lasted two hours and every pailful was caught which it was possible to obtain. We have an excellent supply of ice, 1500 cakes. We are now making preparations for putting new heating aparatus into our dwelling house, as the intense cold weather necessitates something more desirable than our present mode and also to save expense and labor. We have a fine springin the meadow west of the house which could be utilized whenever desired to a good purpose by means of a wind engine. Health of all good. At this date the icy traveling is severe on both man and beast, and endangers the limbs of those who are not as sure-footed as they once were. The thermometer was two degrees below zero on the fifth inst. A high wind with this cold wave is now experienced. Maria Witlunn. Union Village, O. Feb. 3, 1893. We had quite a bleak cold winter for Southern Ohio, up to about the 2(&gt;th of January. Since then the regulation 'January thaw' has been on, and now the weather is about at the usual standard for our section of Country. The mercury reached 14 degrees below zero in our Village and 20 degrees below in Lebanon four miles distant. We are thankful to say we are in good general health. We are passing along quietly through the usual routine of duties common to a Union Village winterï¿½(viz.) feeding stock, sawing wood, hauling out manure, preparing medicines and running the school. I want to thank all the dear Eastern Brethi'en and Sisters who signed their full names to their contributions in the very interesting number of the Manifesto for February. It seemed to warm up the articles with a nearer feeling of love, friendship and good neighborhood. Now Elder Henry, let me ask in all solemnity and sincerity, what Society or even individual family of Believers is going to pioneer us into the Promised land of a more rational plan of eating and drinking, a land flowing with, not the luxury of animal food and foreign narcotic poisons, but the milk and honey of intellectual and spiritual enjoyment? It is a solemn fact, that the expense of living on animal food over that of food at first hand (fruits, cereals, vegetables) is in the surprising ratio of 40 tol! Just think of it! Howl wish 72 THE MANIFESTO. some enterprising family or Society would resolve to cease making grave-yards of their stomachs and undertake the sublime etherializing experiment of Daniel and his three Colleagues in Babylon. I should want to belong to that band of reformers if there should be but three of them. I don't mean that such should merely cease eating flesh, fish or fowl, but I mean that they should take all their diet at first hand and abjure the use of flesh, fish, fowl, milk, cream, eggs, butter, tea, coffee, whiskey, wine and tobacco; allowing however unfermented or sweet cider and the unfermented juice of any fruits or berries if desired. We should not only save the direct expense of the old kinds of food but the indirect expense of the wear and tear of the human machine in producing it, and the still greater one of Doctors' bills and the waste of time and toil of both nurses and sick patients. 'Hands at work and hearts to God' is a most excellent precept and its benefits cannot be too highly estimated. But my common sense teaches me that Mother never meant by that, that any man, much less any woman should be employed in physical drudgery from nine to sixteen hours a day and even at that never catch any nearer up with his or her work after all. This state of .things however we have brought upon ourselves. We are almost perfectly absorbed, engulfed, swamped so to speak, in temporal subjects and interests, to the exclusion of intellectual and spiritual thoughts, conversation and elevation of mind into the higher and holier regions of spiritual existence. Any one attempting to converse freely on these higher themes, is supposed to be 'getting good too fast' or going crazy. Why not, as you proposed years ago, all meet together somewhere and talk about these matters and see if some better status of physical, mental and above all, spiritual progress cannot be developed? For my part I am tired of wallowing around in a luxurious, almost voluptuous sink of expensive and hurtful 'riotous living,' with its attendant sickness, blasting and spiritual death. Now I guess I'll stop after that explosion of my true inwardness, and try to think about something more cheering. Oliver C. Hampton. Watervliet, Ohio. Feb. 1893. It has been some time since our Society has appeared in 'Home Notes.' We will try and be more prompt in the future. Have had an extremely cold winter thus far; 14 degrees below Zero. Had good sleighing for nearly two weeks but the snow is all gone and rain has taken its place, which we need very much to fill the cisterns. The weather was so severe that we could not do more than the needful chores. We had a very nice Christmas. Santa Claus came in grand style. We received some presents, and withal a couple of nice fat turkeys for dinner. The dining room was decorated with evergreens, and light, ed candles were placed around the room. Some of the Brethren arose early on Christmas morning and greeted the family with a beautiful song entitled, 'Christmas Greeting.' We are now hauling our wheat to market for which we are receiving 70 cts., per bushel. This Community owns a flock of 83 sheep, and 15 lambs. //. W. Fredrick. Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1893. It was well said 'that the Feb. No. of our Manifesto would be of interest to its many readers,' so rich in endearing testimonials of filial regard for our beloved Elder Daniel now arisen in the triumph of 'victory over death and the grave.' We bless every voice raised to portray the crowning virtues of the departed, while we congratulate the living privileged to enjoy that blessed reunion of saints upon earth met for such an occasion. It must have been a season of rejoicing, bringing heaven very near. We likewise say in the words of our good Elder Nicholas, 'that the many left at home on the hills of Canterbury, (and no less in the valley at Enfield,) would have enjoyed very much being present at such a heavenly communion.' We do not hesitate to say that the clerk of the weather has been THE MANIFESTO. 73 pleased to visit us in a manner not to be forgotten for many a day. Snow and hail have fallen, alternating with wind and rain, which have played in fantastic gales, covering side-walks with a sheet of ice, giving possible delight to the little folks not appreciated by pedestrians of larger growth. We are engaged ^at the present time in our various occupations. Brethren's work at the mill in full operation. Farmers drawing wood; have secured nearly 300 cords, and are sawing it into shape for fuel. Sisters not in the rear. Some four weeks since an order for twenty dozen sweaters was sent in, which are well under way, though the business has not been pushed as it might have been, had not a cold wave blocked the streams with ice so there was not running water sufficient to run all the machinery. Our business with the firm of Hewins and Hollis has awakened of late. Since Jan. 1st eight dozen shirts have been made, keeping all hands busy. Beloved Elder Abraham has been to spend a few days with friends in Canterbury. His health has been and now is quite good for one so advanced in years. Hope the pale boatman will not come for him for a long time yet. Love to all our kindred East and West. Julia Russell. North Family. Feb., 1803. How time sweeps on, carrying in its course the completed and unperfected soul to its final home; its ever changing seasons giving to mankind, opportunities to sow and reap the products of good or ill, as dictated by the cravings of the moral and mental faculties. Before many days a new season will be ushered in by the immutable laws governing the universe; wise are they who take father time in season, accept and utilize the valuable life lesson contained in the couplet,ï¿½ 'Honor and fume from no condition rise, Act well your part, there all the honor lies.' An honorable life calls into action, every function of the mind which harmonizes with God's great plan of soul evolution; in unflinching hostility to sin, making war for the inexorable truths of God, as against licentiousness, avarice and every other species of moral turpitude. Its subjects vaunteth not themselves unseemly, but with humility do good and thus grow good; the noble hearted, sounding the glad news of salvation, being living' epistles of righteousness, 'the Saviors of to-day.' Christ said, unless ye take my yoke upon youï¿½ meaning true celibacyï¿½ye are not my disciples. Such is our high calling, gospel kindred everywhere; as Society conditions cry aloud for constant congregated zeal in furthering' its welfare, let us not abate our energy in doing the duties requisite to soul and mind improvement; thinking less of the non-essentials of life, and giving more weight to the principles embodying our Church, which add solidity and true culture to the character; those traits which gather, hold and guide aright souls yearning for purity of life. We report the coldest winter here for many years. Notwithstanding all this, we are remarkably free from colds and epidemics of every nature, and are able to hold regularly our devotional, social and reading services, which are sources of profit and pleasure. We extend best wishes to all, and especial sympathy for those who have sustained the loss of valued friends. 'If thou art blest, Tlion let the sunshine of thy garden rest On the dark edges of each cloud that lies Black in thy brother's skies. If thou art sad, Still be thou in thy brother's gladness glad.' George H. Baxter. Alfred, Me. Feb. 1803. I wonder if you have had as much cold weather in New Hampshire as we have in Maine. When I read in the last Manifesto that you were harvesting ice fifteen inches thick, I thought that yours must be a milder climate than ours. Our Brethren commenced cutting ice for ourselves and townsmen in December and before they had finished the blocks of crystal THE MANIFESTO. coldness were about eighteen inches thick. It has been cold, colder and coldest, and not having had the protection of the snow one of our aqueducts has suspended operations until sometime next June, the frost having penetrated down to and below it. Old Boreas has driven the same into houses and cellars making the building of fires necessary to save our vegetables. The bursting of water pipes has tried the patience of our Brethren not a little, and still they have maintained a Christian spirit. We thank God for our Brethren. Notwithstanding all this cold weather there is still a complaint of too little snow to haul wood and lumber. However, we all live and have had much less sickness than last winter with its mild weather. How happy the thought that this cold world is not our abiding place or continuing city, but if we are faithful to let the fire of the gospel do its perfect work we shall have a home in that Sweet Summer Land where Jesus Christ and Mother Ann with all the purified ones dwell. Let us strive more earnestly to prepare ourselves for this home. Fannie Casey.
