Juvenile. IMPURE STORIES The New York Tribune, under the head of 'Talks with Correspondents,' prints the following: The White Cross.�For the benefit of W. L., who wears a White Cross badge, and who complains of offensive stories and badinage he is compelled to listen 10, we relate the following which occurred in an office, in this city last week : ' Among those who occupy this office, consisting of a suite of fine rooms, are two high-toned Christian gentlemen. Some of them have held positions of eminence. To their office came a man who claimed a club acquaintance with one of them, and who, finding two or thre'3 of them together in the reception-room, began to tell an offensive story, illustrating it as .he went on by reference to a map hanging on the wall, and standing necessarily with his back to the auditors. When he got through his story and turned to receive applause, no one was in the room but the type writer boy, who had been busily at work all the time. The auditors had quietly taken themselves to their respective rooms, and the visitor had nothing to do but take his hat, and retire. That is a good way to listen to a vile story.'

If we truly love the Master And his sacred precepts heed; We shall never be forgetful Of an erring brother's need. If we really trust the Savior That his promises are sure; Then the Christian's daily trial, Patiently we shall endure. A. E. N. ST. PETER AND THE BASKETS St. Peter, from the door of Heaven one day Sped two young angels on their happy way, For the first time to see the world in May� Both bearing baskets. They were to bring back flowers more fragrant far, Than budding rose and blooming hawthorn are; They were to bring the praise of all the star Back in their baskets. The angel of thanksgiving, full of glee, Donned a big hamper, half as large as he; But the collector of petitions, see, With a small basket. When they returned, St. Peter, as before, Sat with his golden keys before the door; But each appeared to be in trouble sore, About his basket. The angel of petitions bore a sack Cram full, and bound uncouthly on his back; Yet even then it seemed that he did lack Of bag and basket. The angel of thanksgiving blushed to feel, The empty lightness of his mighty creel. 'But three,' he muttered, turning on his heel, To hide his basket. Then spoke St. Peter: ' When again you go On a prayer-gathering, you will better know That men's petitions in the world below, Fill a big basket. But when you gather up your thanks For prayers well answered and forgiven pranks, For health restored and disentangled hanks, Your smallest basket.' Good Words.
