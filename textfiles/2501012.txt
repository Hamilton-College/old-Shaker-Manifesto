CENTER OF LIGHT uBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God'â€”Matt, v., 8. Enfieild, N. H. The pure in heart shall see God; Shall know of his goodness and share in his mercies, Be filled to a ful-ness, with his boundless love. Their light shall shine as the sun; Its bright rays of glad-ness, Shall banish all sadness, And un to its cen-ter all souls yet shall come.
