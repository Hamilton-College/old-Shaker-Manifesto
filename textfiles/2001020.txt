Enfield, Connecticut We do not need to go to Egypt to buy corn. Our Cooley Creamer, with submerged cans is a success. Sixtj'-five hundred pounds of butter were made the past year. It is the amount of butter which a herd of cows produces in a year that determines their value, not what they have done in a week or a month. Corn alone, in any of its forms, is not a fit, exclusive food for cows. It is too heating, and lacks in milk-making material, which should be supplied in the form of wheat, bran, shorts, screenings or the like. When hens are exposed to cold storms, rovp is apt to put in an appearance suddenly. To prevent this, close the doors and ventilators, as a sufficient amount o.f cold air will enter from other sources to afford a supply for the fowls. Belmont and May King strawberry plants are large and vigorous, and give promise of plenty of fruit next season. Young currant bushes are looking well. Plenty of potash is needed by most fruits. Fall manuring is good for all small fruits. D. Orcutt
