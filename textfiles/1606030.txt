WORDS OF CHEER. JESSIE S. WHITE. fiiST the purpose of thy life Speak in all thy words and deeds; Be thou foremost in the place Where men strike for human needs; Love thou truth with all thy might, It will set thy footsteps right. When thou seest fetter marks ; Where sin's iron bands have been, Be thou first to oil the wounds Of thy suffering fellow-men ; Pass not on the other side In thy scornful human pride. Oh, be first to strike down wrong When k lifts its serpent tongue; Oh, be first with healing words For the heart with anguish wrung; Always brave to do and dare� Never slow to soothe despair ! Be thou last to leave the scene, Ere the battle field is won; Though thine armor may be scarred, Valiant deeds may yet be done� While there's life to do and dare, Never yield thee to despair. Truth.
