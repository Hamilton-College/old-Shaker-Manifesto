SCHOOL. This subject is of great importance. That we come to school to learn and to study hard. School days will not always last; if we strive to improve every moment, and learn all that we can, we will have all of that knowledge for ourselves and after our school days are over we shall feel satisfied with our conduct that is in regard toward the way in which we have spent our time. But if we go to school and do not improve our time there will be a great many regrets, for then we will realize more than we do now what we might have gained by diligence and what we have lost. In order to learn anything we have got to put our minds to it and learn what we do learn thoroughly. If it was not for Education we could neither write, read nor use any correct language.
