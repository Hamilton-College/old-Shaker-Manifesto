What a beautiful exhortation of our Savior... Take ye heed watch and pray.' Mark, xiii., 33. What a beautiful exhortation of our Savior, and Avhat could better apply to the life of any one who is trying to follow Christ's example in thought, word and deed. Christ said, ' If any man take up his cross and follow me he shall have everlasting life.'' Which means life eternal in the spirit and what could we wish more than this ? and how can we live the spiritual life without watching and praying? If we do not watch we shall fall into temptation. In every act of our lives we should watch with care, that the little vices of ingratitude and disobedience may not drive from the heart of any one that which is pure and true. We do not need to wait till some great wrong has been done to feel that we should watch and pray. It is over the little acts of life, that we should set a careful guard. We cannot do a great wrong until we have first slipped in little places. Let us guard the steps of life as a good shepherd would guard his flock that none should go astray. ' Watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight or in the morning, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.' Mark, xiii., 35, 36. We who are young must not be so careless that when the master cometh or even our friends, that they shall find us spending our time improperly but rather let us be ready and willing to be found watching and praying.
