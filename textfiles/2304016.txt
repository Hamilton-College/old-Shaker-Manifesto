Editorial. In the early history of our Church... In the early history of our Church, while our gospel fathers and mothers were battling against the elements of the world, and learning through these important lessons of the cross of Christ what they must do to be saved from the sins of the old inheritance; while they were battling against the elements in which they had been educated from childhood, they, at times, found the bars and bands so strong that it required a heroic effort to force a passage through, and allow them to rejoice as the conquerors of a subtle enemy. Shouting and shaking are tame expressions by which to represent the work of their religious battle, fields. It required the whole man, body, soul and spirit, in the fulness of his powers to contend earnestly and successfully 'against the spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.' And yet at other times, while under an influence of divine blessing and the assurance of victory they would unite in a 'union gift' and sing these simple words. 'The gospel is a pretty, little lesson to learn.' The very simplicity that was manifested in this peculiar gift, was in itself a valuable sermon and one that inspired the soul with a zeal to do right. This lesson so easy to be learned and so valuable to its possessor was the gift of obedience. Obedience to the light that was manifested in the soul, and obedience to God's word and work. There was nothing mysterious in the lesson, to be learned, nothing complicated and difficult of solution. It was an appeal to the conscience and was found to be the wonderful hope of salvation, and the power of the gospel testimony, through which they were to conquer the whole world. Many of these men were soldiers of the Revolution and as they had fought without reserve for the salvation of their homes and their country, they were now fighting the batTERMS. THE MANIFESTO. 93 ties of the Lord with equal zeal for a victory over the world. There was no spirit of compromise in this warfare. It was yea and amen. It was the voice of God that was leading them on to victory, and they pressed on with an assurance that they must receive the promised reward ; the salvation of their souls. They zealously learned the lesson and obtained the victory. The same pretty lesson is now presented to us and the same results that were wrought out in their lives will be made sure to us if we are ready to accept the precious gift. Not a word, not a note has been changed. It is the same warfare, the same zealous testimony and the same faithful observance of gospel principles that will secure a victory. Nothing that is obscure or undefined has any place in this manifestation of the gospel of Christ. It is in the light and where the light of God shines there can be no darkness nor mystery. When our good Elder H. L. Eads wrote, from the scriptures, 'Other foundations can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ,' he had reference to just this very thing; obedience was his watchword. Obedience to the truth ; obedience to that spiritual light which directs the soul to the cross of Christ. Jesus in speaking of his gospel ministry has emphatically given this a prominent place, as he says. 'Not my will, but thine be done.' It was the willing obedience of an enlightened soul. It was a foundation of righteousness upon which one could stand and feel secure from all harm. It was a little simple lesson which every one could learn and which would assure them as Jesus himself had said, an hundred fold in this time and in the world to come eternal life. An article in memory of our Sister, Asenath Russell, was received too late for publication in this number. Br. Arthur Dowe of Cal., writes on Feb. 24th;ï¿½'Our winter is over, and we are having lovely, almost tropical weather. Fruit trees are blooming and the hills around us are carpeted with a lovely green, soon to be changed into a beautiful, many colored mantle of flowers.'
