He discovered, it appears, that some tea on sale in Mincing lane required looking after, and he succeeded in getting authentic samples from the bonded warehouses in which the article was stored. On examination it was found that this so-called tea contained from forty to forty-three per cent of iron filings and nineteen per cent of silica, in the form of fine sand, which had been cleverly mixed with and added to the leaves before curling, with a view to increase their weight and bulk. After the leaves were curled they had been thickly covered with green pigment. When it was infused in boiling water it produced a very turbid solution, offensive to the smell and nauseous to the taste.
