SELECT READINGS The Bishop of Manchester said the other ' day that it was not merely by reading ] prayers, or preaching-sermons, nor even administering sacraments, that the work of winning souls would be accomplished. One i of the most urgent needs of the present i day was ministers of the Gospel who were not afraid to live among their people, who were not afraid of contact with the poor and outcast, and who had the courage to speak plainly to the rich and high born. As long as there was in their parishes drunkenness, licentiousness, profane swearing, dishonesty, or any of those thousand sins which disfigured life in the midst of all our proudly boasted civilization, there was need for ministers to be imbued with as much prophetic power and evangelizing grace as in the days of the Apostle Paul, in order to do the work that was to be done effectively. Bishop Foster is reported as saying: ' Three out of every four Methodists give nothing to the cause of Christian missions.' An exchange tells the story of a man who said, ' I've been a Methodist 20 years, and it hasn't cost me a cent.' We fear that others outside that church could make the same ingenuous statement. A Silent Eloquence.—Remember that by living a pure and holy life you are increasing the general atmosphere of purity. There is a silent eloquence in a moral and religious existence, which acts upon society with irresistible force. It is not confined to the family or social circle, but spreads on every side, like the undulations of the smitten water. ' Persecution produces no sincere conviction, nor any real change of opinion.—On the contrary, it vitiates the public morals by driving men to prevarication, and commonly ends in a general, though secret, infidelity, by imposing under the name of revealed religion, systems of doctrine which men cannot believe and dare not examine.'—Archdeacon Paley.
