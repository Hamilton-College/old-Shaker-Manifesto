Ipomoea Minuata (SJew Morning1 Crlory). A vine growing from seed that will cover a fence in no time, a rampant grower, and then it is a beautiful vine, with its huge leaves, dark prickly stems and immense rose-colored flowers from three to four inches across, and costs only 20 cents per packet. Every one interested in climbers or new and good things for the garden should send 10 cents to James Vick's Sons, Rochester, N. Y., for Vick's Floral Guide, 1894, which is a perfect beauty in its gold cover. As the 10 cents may be deducted from first order it really costs nothing. 75
