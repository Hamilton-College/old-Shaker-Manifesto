The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 5. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Rewritten by Henry C. Blinn. Mother Ann and the Elders would occasiona'ly relate to the Brethren and Sisters some of their own experience and the sufferings through which they passed in the earlier part of their faith. Mother Ann's experience in particular, as it evidenced her indefatigable zeal and invincible fortitude of soul was very instructive and interesting. To those who accepted the faith it had a great effect in stimulating them to faithfulness in the way of God. Just previous to the imprisonment of the Believers, in Albany, they were all under much tribulation, as they expected that Mother Ann and the Elders would be driven from their home. Their meetings were seasons of prayer and sadness. At this time Mother Ann entered the room, and said to the Brethren and Sisters, ' The wicked men of Albany are plotting against us ; they are making an effort to drive us from our home, and it is unknown to me whether I shall ever see you again in this world. ' To a company that visited Watervliet in 1780, she said, u I love the day when I first received the gospel, I call it my spiritual birth day. At that time I prayed earnestly to God, day and night. I was, at times, under great tribulation, so that I could not rest. I prayed to feel a sense of the sufferings of those who were in distress that I might keep my soul awake to God. ' '' I made a confession of all sin to my Elders, one by one, and repented of them in the same manner. I then labored to overcome the nature of sin for myself. It was made known to me by the revelation of God, that he would support me through all trials, find establish me an Elder in the Church. ' 'When I set out to serve God, I served him day and night, and prayed for deliverance from everything that was offensive in his sight. Many times when I was about my work, I felt the blessed gifts of sorrow. If I was weary and in need of rest, I labored for the spirit of God to aid me, that I might feel refreshed. ' ' I strove to be temperate in all that I ate and drank, that my soul might hunger for nothing but God. The Lord revealed to me the depth of man's loss, what it was and the way of redemption. Then I was able to bear an open testimony against all sin, and I felt the love of God flow into my soul like a fountain of living water. ' Before I found Christ, I found that I had a deceitful heart and was very wicked, so that I could not trust to my own soul, and I made this promise to my God. ' I will not allow my soul to rest till I have received a baptism into the spirit of Christ Jesus. ' ' I cannot deny this manifestation of the goodness of God, but I must dwell in the light forever more. ' Persecutions that fell to the lot of Mother Ann and the Elders, while they resided in England. The apostle has very kindly left us this assurance, ' All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. ' Mother Ann and the Elders learned by a long and painful experience, the truthfulness of this apostolic assertion. So soon as they left the ordinary course of the world and gave their souls in prayer to God, that they might become purified temples for the holy spirit to dwell in, the enemies of the cross of Christ began to annoy them and finally to persecute them in a malicious and savage spirit. Some of these instances that occurred while they lived in England, were related by the Elders to the Believers in this country. They are striking evidences of the inveterate hatred of a lost world, against every increasing manifestation of Divine Light. An attempt was made upon the life of Mother Ann, but it does not appear that this was done by any legal process. It is supposed that it was stimulated by the connivance of .some of the officers of the stone prison, with the designs of her enemies. Mother Ann was confined in a small cell of the prison with the evident intention of starving her to death, as none of the officers of the prison visited her during this time. Here she was kept fourteen days without any kind of sustenance, except what was conveyed to her, privately, through the key-hole of the door, after the first two days, once in twenty-four hours. This act of great kindness' was done by one of the Believers, who found access to the door of her prison, and inserted the stem of a pipe through the key-hole. Into the bowl of this pipe he poured a small quantity of milk, mixed with a little wine, which was her only temporal support during the whole time of the imprisonment. At the end of fourteen days the door was unlocked and to the great surprise of her enemies, she was not only alive, but as well as when she entered the prison. Some who were present and saw Mother Ann in such perfect health, said that a supernatural power attended her and declared that it was wrong to imprison or to oppress such persons. Speaking of this instance Mother Ann remarked, ' Because I bore a testimony against their sins, and told them of their wicked lives, they hated me. ' ' You must all be faithful and they will hate you as they have hated me, for wicked men and women will always hate those who take up their crosses against the sins of the world. ' Elder John Hocknell remarked that the people were astonished, when they saw Mother Ann walk so actively, after such an imprisonment. Elder James Whittaker speaking of this persecution, said;ï¿½'I was young at that time, and had but little acquaintance with Mother Ann, but I could not rest as I wanted to do something for her. At length I thought what I might do, and bought a bottle which I could carry in my pocket. I then bought some wine and some milk, and a pipe with a long stem. At night I waited till all were asleep ; then went to the prison and accomplished my mission of mercy as God had led me. This I did several times and I know I received a blessing of God.' Mother Ann relates that one of her brothers was very much opposed to her religious teaching. He spoke in very rough terms to her about it, and she said, '* I felt no liberty to answer him.' 'Will you not answer me,' said he. ' At this he became so angry that he obtained a staff and abusively used it upon my person, but I sensibly saw the bright rays of the glory of God which shielded me from harm ; I cried to God for his healing power and it came like balsam to my soul. ' A mob arose at one time and seemed determined to put an end to my existence. They carried me into the highway, and ordered me to advance. I made the attempt but was thrown to the ground. When I arose and began to walk they struck and kicked me every few steps for more than a mile. I was so faint that I thought they would take my life.' ' While I was suffering from this merciless mob, not one friend was allowed to be with me ; but God, in his mercy remembered me, and sent a man who was instrumental in my deliverance. This man was impressed to go somewhere, but he could not tell where, nor for what purpose. Having ordered his horse he rode hastily, as for the saving of his own life, and soon came to a large concourse of people. He then enquired about their business. On being informed he rode to the place where I was and commanding the mob to desist, reproved them for their cruel conduct, and ordered them to disperse immediately. He then inquired if I had any friends present, if not he would care for me himself. ' 'Elder John Hocknell soon arrived and stated that he was my friend. Thus God made use of this noble man to do his will. 'And the earth opened her mouth and helped the woman.' ' Elder John Hocknell remai'ked, ' I followed closely in the rear of the mob, through the hope of rendering some assistance to Mother Ann. I had not proceeded far when I was seize/1 by several persons and rudely thrown into the vault of a privy. It was with much difficulty that I escaped from this unpleasant place. On obtaining my freedom I went immediately into a bath and then secured a change of garments. In a short time I was again on the road and soon overtook the mob. They had supposed that I should not be seen again and my presence aroused their savage natures, so that they beat and abused me severely, then threw me into a slough.' 'Although I was in pain and my head and face much bruised and bloody, I prayed to bear it all, with patience. After these inhuman creatures left me, a poor woman came and bound up my head. I took another bath and again changed my garments, and once more went in search of Mother Ann. When I came to the place where she was, the nobleman was reproving and dispersing the mob. Agreeably to his orders I took good care of Mother Ann. We went and obtained some food and then returned home in peace.' Other instances of persecution were related by Mother Ann. ' Once, ' said she, 'I hid myself from a mob, in a large quantity of wool that was in the attic of a house. I heard the mob enquire for me, and then threatened to search the place. The man gave them liberty and they came into the loft where I had made my hiding place. I heard them say. She is not here. There is nothing here but wool! 80 they left the house and I went down and rested in peace that night. ' L' At one time I was accused of blasphemy. My accusers told me that my tougue must be bored through with a hot iron and that I must be branded on the cheek. ' I was then arraigned before the ministers of the church. They wanted me to talk to them as I had talked to others. I told them that they must wait for it was the operation of the spirit of God. After a consultation among themselves they warned the people not to hurt me. A mob, however, is never satisfied and some of them said that the Shakers should be stoned to death.' ' Father William, Father James, Daniel Whittaker, James Shepard and myself were then led into a valley .to be stoned. Daniel Whittaker receiving a wound on the head, threw the mob into a contention aud through fear of the civil law they soon dispersed. ' ' While they were throwing the stones I felt myself surrounded by the spirit of God and my soul was filled with love, I knew that they could not kill me because my work upon the earth was not done.
