Mr. Evans Geo. H. Philips —I wish to obtain a knowledge of your hygiene and cookery. Shall I trespass too far on your patience if I ask what roots and grains, and meats, if any, are used in your community 1 Do you use pork, or beef, or mutton, or any fine flour, or cider, or tobacco^or spices, saleratus, tea, coffee ? and do your cooks make any pastry ? I would be especially pleased to know just how you prepare for food that great cereal that feeds humanity — wheat. One of the Shaker women stated, from the platform at Lake Pleasant, last August, that she was iinable to procure a proper ~'meal of victuals on the grounds — and I am ready to believe it. Will you, or some Shaker, tell me what a wholesome meal should be composed of, and how to cook it? Respectfully,
