LIFE RENEWED. Mary Whitcher. Be care and kindness to my fellow-man Deeply inwoven in each future plan, Be trust in God with hands intent to do Their part my theme with heart sincere and true. Much care to live correctly every day Must mark the prospect of the 'Better way.' Let life at morn, at noon and even's close Alike be heeded for the soul's repose. Canterbury, N. H.
