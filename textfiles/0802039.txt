It is simply to put some pure tar on a plate and apply hot coals to it, not hot enough, however, to create a blaze. Then place a funnel upside down over the tar and let the patient inhale the fumes arising from the burning tar through the spout of the funnel. It will give instant relief, and may be repeated as often as may be necessary. Tar spread on a piece of cloth and applied to the throat in connection with the inhaling process is also good, much better than old flitch and liniments. It should not be removed until the the throat is relieved of all soreness.' The Huntingdon Monitor
