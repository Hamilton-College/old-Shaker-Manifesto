SELECT READINGS ' Dying in poverty/' says a modern moralist, ' is nothing. It is living in poverty that comes hard on a fellow.' A religion that never suffices to govern man, will never suffice to save him. That which does not distinguish him from that sinful world, will never distinguish him from a perishing world .—John Howe. There is this difference between happiness and wisdom: he that thinks himself the happiest man, really is good ; but he who thinks himself the wisest man, is generally the greatest fool. Blessed be he who gives to the poor, albeit only a penny ; doubly blessed be he who adds kind words to his gift. Say not, because thou canst not do every thing, ' I will do nothing.'— Jewish Sayinys. Money, unsanctified, makes nobody happy, neither do big houses, big barns, large acquaintances, power, fame, but he only is happy that enjoys religion — he that knows his sins are forgiven, he and he alone is at peace. The perfect man is the one who has a deliberate purpose to do the will of God in all things, under all circumstances, and at all times, never resting in this or that point of obedience, but going on, fixing Ms eyes on his high calling.
