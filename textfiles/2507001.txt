ADDRESS TO OLD AGE. By Hannah Bronson. (Age 74 Trs.) Age, what art thou doing? why art thou so bold, To rob us of reason and sense, when we're old? Oh, spare us our senses, our ears and our eyz, And pray, let some smaller privations suffice. THE MANIFESTO. 153 Is not this sufficient to shackl the frame, And make us decrepit and feebl and lame? And cause all our hairs to be frosted and white? Oh, spare us our sensez, our hearing and sight. But if 'tis our lot to be lame, def or blind Pray have sum compassion at least on the mind; And altho the system may lose all its tone, Pray don't touch the intellect,let that alone. 'Old Age' comes along with his stamping machine, And sets on his marks, unperceivd and unseen, And altho unheeded we scarcely know how, Is stamping the wrinkls of age on our brow. All this we can bear and feel fully resignd; But pray do not fetter and hamper the mind! With many privations we'll cheerfully bear, But don't take our sensezwe hav none to spare. East Canterbury, N.
