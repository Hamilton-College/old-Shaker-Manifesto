SPIRITUAL ASPIRATION Our Zion home is lovely, secluded, and secure, And precious our relations, so peaceful, and so pure; Not all earth's fading pleasures, or wealth it has to give, Shall lure me from these treasures, for these alone I live. More fervently 111 labor to make the gospel mine, That all its ties more firmly around my heart may twine; Be mine the true affections, which from the earth are riven, Which cling to Saints and Angels, to Christ and God, in heaven. Be mine the Christian crosses, the sorrow and the love, The daily prayers and watchings, that lift the soul above, And lead the spirit onward, to seek the higher life, Away from earth's corruption, confusion, care and strife. Be mine to hold communion with mortals robed in white, To rise with them in triumph to realms of endless light; Where Jesus and blest Mother, receive their faithful band Of souls, who braved all trial to gain the summer land. With searching beams unclouded, roll on thou perfect day, When shade, and storm, and tempest, shall all have passed away. Flow on thou crystal river, thy broad and swelling tide Will bear the weary pilgrim, to life's immortal side. With heart attuned to gladness, I hear the chants above, And feel the Angels wafting their sweet redeeming love; And well I know my Saviors, will pilot me safe o'er, To rest in peaceful triumph, and glory evermore.
