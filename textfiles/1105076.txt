No woman knows until she has worn it out No woman knows until she has worn it out what a convenience a sewing apron is. Cut a small, round apron of calico, or any other material which you choose, make a deep pocket across the bottom, in which you may carry work, and into which your scissors, thimble, and thread may slip when you are obliged to rise and leave your sewing for a short time. The large pocket may be divided by stitching it through the center, and smaller pockets may be added at the top. N. Y. Post
