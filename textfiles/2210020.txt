Enfield, N. H. r Sept. 1892. In our communal relations when sustained upon honor to the best and highest interests thereof, we feel that paramount to all other considerations, is the one grand service of doing good to our Brethren and Sisters, combined with consecrated efforts to make our homes more and more like the habitations of saints whose lives are given to the glory of God. So while we prepare a few items for the coming month, we are pleased to note that much care and labor has been expended in this direction during the present season. Added to the painting of our laundry and dairy, there is painting and repairing being clone upon our stone dwelling, changing its former aspect very perceptibly, besides minor improvements elsewhere. We spent a very pleasant season with our Sisters from Harvard, Mass. Our sympathy, love and interest in their behalf, was broadened and strengthened by the visit. Summer boarders who have thronged our village in quest of pleasure at the expense of time and labor given to entertain them, have now gone to their homes, and we are at liberty to gather the fruits of our fields and gardens, which, by the way, have yielded us a good supply. Plums of all kinds are quite abundant. Tomatoes a good yield also. Our apple and potato crop will be far less than in former seasons; supposed to have been injured by heavy rains in the early summer. Two of our Sisters, Isabella Russell and Henrietta Spooner were away the past week attending a Fair held some twelve miles from our village. They carried with them small articles made chiefly by the Sisters, which found ready sale; so they felt amply, paid for the time and labor spent. Health in our Society about as usual; no calamity to bring distress upon our family and friends. With such blessings to crown our daily toil we can not fail to give thanks to the Giver of all good.
