MY HEART'S DESIRE FOR THEE. [Contributed by Harriet Sliepard.] Colossians i., 9ï¿½11. a. m. taylor. Oh the dower of heavenly treasure I would wish for thee to-day ! Oh the endless, countless blessings I would strew upon thy way! Not the world with all its glories Nor the wealth that it can bring, But the truer, lasting riches From the hand of Heaven's King. There are depths of bliss unfathomed, There are heights of joy unknown. There are pleasures unexhausted That may yet be all thine own. I will lift my heart with longing To the Golden Throne above.. I will seek for thee from JesusAll the fullness of his love. So thy life shall pass in gladness. And thy daily path shall be One of brighter, clearer shining. As the Lord reveals to thee All the secret of his presence, &gt; With its wondrous light and love. Precious foretaste of the rapture, In the blessed life above.
