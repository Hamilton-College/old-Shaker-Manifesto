Very pleasantly remembered, Elder Henry : I send you... Canaan, Four Corners, N. Y. June 3, 1882. Very pleasantly remembered, Elder Henry : I send you, according to request, an article relating to life and adventures among the Indians of the Xorth West. I often go back in memory to the days spent among them. I expect the memory will follow me to the end of my life. Most of those have passed away with whom I spent my twelve years of early manhood; those who were children then, are only left to remember, me now. I hope it is to them a grateful remembrance. I know it is so to me ; for very pleasant were the days I spent among them. I still cherish for them the deepest affection, and their wrongs have grieved me to the heart. I hope to meet them in a world better and happier than this—free from the many wrongs and miseries which they have had to oaidure from merciless and rapacious white'men ; for which I consider our Government in a measure, answerable. I have known butfew good Indian Agent*. The majority of them have been a disgrace to the race, men who could practice, with impunity, every kind of iniquity. The liquor wliich they have introduced among the Indians has slain its thousands. The Indians knew nothing of 'fire water' till the whites introduced it. With drunkenness, came every other vice. Hear what Ke-che Be-zhe-ka (Big Buffalo.) of the Lakes, once said to me on this subject;— 'When the Pale Faces came across the Big Waters. {Ke-che Gah*me,~) there were straight paths running through all our forests. One warrior walked in them. They were very narrow. But one warrior's feet went straight forward. It did not hurt them to walk in straight, narrow paths. But the Pale Face could not walk in them. His toes turned out. He was trying to walk two ways at once. He could not walk straight. His ways were crooked. He taught our people to drink 'Fire Water.' He taught them to steal. He came creeping into our wigwams, at night. He crept in like a mouse, that nibbles the children's corn- He had long fingers—so long that they would reach to the bottom of the mo-koks (birch bark boxes.) He stole all the women's sugar out of them, made of the juice of the maple-tree. And when our people told him of this, and he 210 SHAKER MANIFESTO. opened his mouth to speak, we saw that he had two tongues. One tongue laid very still, the other moved very fast. The lying tongue walked, ike fastest. It is like the brook that runs over the stones. None can stop its babblings.' We are all well and feel thankful for your pleasant visit among us. Love to Eldress Joanna, and the other sisters—your associates. Yours with much love GRANVILLE T. SPROAT
