ETERNAL BEAUTIES CATHERINE ALLEN The orb of day is rising in its glorious light; It sends its golden shafts o'er mountain top and dale. And nature's beauties, bathed in crystal dews of night, Inhale the breath of life from morning's gentle gale. I gaze upon the towering trees and verdant meads ; Upon the many ripening fruits and blossoming flowers, And think how God brings forth this wealth from little seeds, Beneath the sunbeam's rays and summer's genial showers. And then I think of treasures found within the earth ; Of diamonds bright, and gems, and glittering mineral ore ; And wealth the ocean bears—her shining pearls of worth— That slumber while they grow beneath the billows' roar. While calmly contemplating all these beauteous things, I feel my being thrilled with wonderment and joy ; But, suddenly, a hand, a shadowy darkness brings— It is the hand of death that surely will destroy. And must their beauty fade? 'All fade,' a voice returnsA cloud of disappointment o'er me now doth lower ; A moment's pause, and then my longing spirit turns To seek the Fountain Source of all-creative power : On aspiration's wings my soul is upward borne, Beyond the shades of earth and elements that blight ; Rich beauties I behold in light of endless morn ; For now the veil is drawn that dimmed my inner sight. I see the treasures there that earnest souls may gain, Who seek their wealth and joy in the immortal life; And I feel my soul inspired, their substance to attain, Which shall be the sweet reward of all my toil and strife.
