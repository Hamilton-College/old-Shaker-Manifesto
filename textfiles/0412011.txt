Philadelphia, Oct. 20th, 1874 Elder Frederick Evans : Dear Friend and Brother : â€” I have been thinking of writing to thee, for some time past. When thee was here we had some con- versation about the peculiar views and testi- monies of the Shaker fraternity. I have been for a long time satisfied that there is great need of reform in regard to the sexual rela- tions among mankind. Personally, I think the highest condition is that in which a man and woman can live together in all the free- dom and purity of a true marriage, and be entirely above, not only sexual intercourse. but all desire for it. I have been aiming for this, and am conscious of approaching such a state. I fully accept the truth of the declara- tion of Jesus, ' That he who looks upon a woman, to lust after her, hath already com- mitted adultery in his heart.' I am well aware that there are persons whose presence produces more or less sexual excitement, and as a sensitive person I have learned that it is better to avoid such persons. I was much attracted to thee while thee was here, and am much interested in thy writings. Thy letter in the Journal last week was gratifying to me. I wish there were more who could appre- ciate the high standard of your people. My position as a physician with considerable practice, and as a prominent spiritualist, occu- pies all my time, and yet I am glad to know of your movements. My position is that sex- ual intercourse for the propagation of the species is justifiable for those who are upon the proper plane to carry it out; but for mere gratification, and especially after the time for that function to be carried on, I have no doubt it is a very great injury to man and woman, and that the powers wasted in that direction would, if preserved and turned in the right direction, give to the world many more beau- tiful, intellectual and spiritual truths. Wishing thee and thy friends all success, I am very truly thy friend and brother, Henry T. Child, M. D., 634 Race Street
