Do Good There are many societies established for the improvement and happiness of humanity. We wish in these few words to give a hearty ' God bless' to the 'Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.' They are doing a noble work, and are worthy the sympathy and active aid of every humane member of society, capable of feeling sympathy and able to lend a helping hand. Our Bro. R. M. Wagan, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., has some beautifully printed cards, with border, which aim to aid the good work. The cards contain a poem, beginning with, ' The man of kindness to his beast is kind.' Send for a dozen, fifty cents. *
