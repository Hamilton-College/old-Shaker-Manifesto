SOLEMN THOUGHTS. By Sophia Wayne. How lengthened seems each passing year A memory spreads her pictures clear, And brings again our loved ones near From the celestial shore. We would not wish them to remain To undergo earth's grief and pain, Yet joy to know they come again To greet us as T)efore. Our mortal life is fleeting fast. Time's pilgrimage will soon be pastr Will we regret to leave at last This tenement of clay? Tet some at thought of death have fear, They dread its presence drawing near. Terrestrial joys to them seem dear, No future hope have they. Those who have comforts shared below., And felt not pangs of want and woey Care not another state to know, Nor seek for purer blissYet when the final change they meet, They find their heaven is incomplete, For barren paths await their feet, As they have walked amiss. The poor, the lowly and despised, Who selfish loves have sacrificed, Rejoice in bowers emparadised And virtue's ways pursue. Adorned with flowers that bloom thro' prayer, The fruits of blessing grown by care, These shall the upright ever share,. Whose souls are pure and true. . The Master, by love's impulse led, The naked clothed, the hungry fed, Yet had not where to lay his head In Palestine's fair land. THE MANIFESTO, 255 The mount he sought to pray and fast, Till, trials and temptations past Truth's golden hights he gained at last, The home where victors stand. Though low is brought our nature proud, And deepest griefs our way enshroud, A silver lining hath the cloud That ofttimes veils the goal. We shrink because of little faith, The change to life we think is death, Yet, know the grave no triumph hath, O'er the immortal soul. BaUston N. F.
