CHRIST NOT DIVIDED. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. Half truths told in the form of propositions, to sustain a theory, are sometimes more deceptive and misleading to the uncritical mind, than absolute falsehood. Because the moiety of trutli they contain, like the stamp on counterfeit coin, enables them to pass unchallenged where unmixed falsehood would be rejected. The saying that ' a sect looks back to its founders, while a church looks forward, ' is an example of this kind. For while,this is true as matter of fact, the implied inference, that one is the exclusive mark of a sect, and the other of a church, is untrue. In the ordinary application of these terms among people professing Christianity, each sect is a church, and a church may be a sect. Even if it were not so, sects adopting the Christian name, though chiefly stationary, do look forward, and a true church, if it remain true, must look to its founders, and bear them often in mind, for no one can be a member, who is not actuated by the spirit of its founders. Hence the aforesaid saying has no value as a test of truth. We read in ' Tests of Divine Inspiration ' p. 21. Every dispensation of the work of God, commenced in divine revelation, by which its foundations were laid. To support and perfect the work of each dispensation, a continued revelation was also indispensable. And whenever the gifts of the Divine Spirit ceased, a ' falling away, ' from foundation principles, among the professors of that order, was the inevitable result. ' Where there is no vision, the people perish.' Prov. But although a continued revelation was always necessary, by which to know the present will of God (to the living,) yet an all important principle has ever been paramount to all others, in every age of the world. And that is, an unerring rule, by which to judge, distinguish and know divinely inspired revelations from those which are spurious, and false. Page, 23. 'ï¿½ The rudimental laws of each dispensation, were the rules ( r tests by which to judge all spiritual com- mnnicatious' given in their respective eras. An unerring test being an acknowledged necessity in a church which is continually advancing into the ever increasing light of truth, where can we find it more surely than in the lives and testimony of its founders and perpetuators ? A pure stream never came from a corrupt fountain, neither a pure stock from hybrid seed. The first, universally recognized criterion of truth, is its perfect oneness, from whence arises harmony, consistency and agreement. This fact lies at the basis of all true reason, and sound understanding. The gospel itself must agree with certain concepts of truth in tbe mind to which it is addressed, or it will not be received. It was the work of Moses and the prophets, and of Christ in his first appearing, to form a foundation in the human mind for a class of concepts that do not spring up spontaneously, nor originate in natural causes, but in revelation, and are communicated from mind to mind by spirit intelligence, or the holy spirit of Divine wisdom, whether by the agency of spirits in the body or spirits out of the body. It is the work of Christ's second appearing to build upon and increase those concepts. Hence we cannot ignore the past altogether, without severing the trunk from the roots which nourish and keep it alive, without ignoring the wisdom, strength, and growth of the past, so far as that was growth in light and right, it forms the basis of present attainments. May those who view the past, as a limit to all increase, or as sanctioning acknowledged error, reject with discrimination lest their lijrht become extinguished. Increase, on a true foundation, will not conflict with, but confirm and strengthen the foundation. Sect, from Latin seco, to cut oft', to separate, means a party, or division^ whether in philosqphy or religion. It therefore implies a plurality of bodies or parties in religion, etc., separated from each other by conflicting opinions and usages, but classified under one name. Hence the so called Christian sects, Jewish sects, Mohammedan sect*, are so many independent heads or parties, professedly Christian, Jewish, or Mohammedan, divided in particulars, but ^agreeing m some generalities. The church or congregation of Christ, is his visible body, which, as it is raised up and sustained by Divine Power and Wisdom, can never have but one head, and is therefore indivisible. As it embraces all the interests of man in his redeemed and complete state, including aH truth necessary to raise, endow, and perfect mankind iu that state, it is not, and never can be a sect. For as the Apostle declares, Eph. i., 10. It is the Divine purpose in the fullness of times5 to gather all things into one Christ, both the things in heaven and the things on earth, it must draw all that is salvable from every sect, being as superior to all sects, as the heavens are superior to earth. Some twelve years ago, E. Amos Parkhurst, queried in himself. What is the body of Christ? There opened to his view, a great multitude of Shakers, disciples, perhaps a million of them together, and all were actuated and moved' by the-one spirit of Christ. That was the body of Christ. Well, how do they get this one spirit? How does it operate? It seemed to operate through ttie nerve fluid, or nerve spirit, so that what one knows, they all know. Again, electricity was presented as another medium of operation, for the influence proceeding from the fountain head, which must be an individual intelligence of course. This spirit began to be manifested in Jesus Christ, and can never come only through him. The work has been increasing since, and when it is perfected, such will be the body of Christ. ' For though it is one body, it hath many members. ' This view was not to represent what is now, but what is to be when the church is perfected. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
