HOE YOUR OWN ROW BY ALICE CART I think there are some maxims Under the sun, Scarce worth preservation; But here, boys, is one So sound and so simple 'Tis worth while to know ; And all in the single line, Hoe your own row ! If you want to have riches And want to have friends, Don't trample the means down And look for the ends ; But always remember Wherever you go, The wisdom of practicing, Hoe your own row ! Don't just sit and pray For increase of your store, But work, who will help himself, Heaven helps more. The weeds while you're sleeping Will come up and grow, But if you would have the Full ear, you must hoe ! Nor will it do only To hoe out the weeds, You must make your ground mellow And put in the seeds, And when the young blade Pushes through you must know There is nothing will strengthen Its growth like the hoe! There is no use of saying What will be, will be; Once try it my lack-brain, And see what you'll see ! Why, just small potatoes, And few in a row, You'd better take hold then, And honestly hoe! A good many workers I've known in my time Some builders of houses, Some builders of rhyme, And they that were prospered, Were prospered, I know, By the intent and meaning of Hoe your own row ! I've known too, a good many Idlers, who said, I've right to my living, The world owes me bread ; A right! lazy lubber ! A thousand times No ! 'Tis his, and his only Who hoes his own row. Selected,
