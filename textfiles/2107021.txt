Alfred, Me. June 12, 1891. Beloved Eldeb Henry:ï¿½It has been a long time since 'Home Notes' included Alfred. The only excuse I can make is in distributing 'Pencils' you left out Alfred. However I have borrowed one of Beloved Elder John and Avill try to bring our little Society into union. If: I were a poet I would tell you how beautiful is Mother Earth, clothed in her mantle of green, and how joyfully the feathered songsters fill the air Avith musical sounds. But not being a poet I Avill report that the grass is rather thin because of the cold weather through May. The Brethren planted live acres of potatoes in April, earlier than ever before known in this Society. In May, thirteen acres of corn were planted besides beans, cucumbers &amp;c, which the Brethren are now hoeing with the help of one hired man. Fruit trees blossomed out fairly well. We hope the promise thus given may ultimate in AATell grown fruit next Autumn. The green pastures increased the floAV of milk making the amount of cream sold in May 4253 spaces according to Br. Daniel's definition. 275 feet of pipes have been laid from dairy to cowbarn to convey the milk after it has passed through the Separator, back to the barn, while it is still warm just right for the calves. A now walk has just been laid from Ministry's Shop to DAvelling House. Health of our little Society physically and spiritually good; 'Hands at work and hearts to God' still our motto. If I am taking too much of your valuable space, remember we were away behind; can be more brief next time. F. C.
