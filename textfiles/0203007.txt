'I want to be forgiving, and to be forgiven.' When we sing these beautiful words, do they find a response within our hearts ? and do we practically carry this out in our daily intercourse with our fellow-beings ? Are we not all God's creatures ? and have we not oftentimes felt the need of forgiveness ? 'To err is human, to forgive divine,' is one of the truest of maxims. How soothing were the sweet words of forgiveness, that fell on the ear of the erring one, who in bitterness of spirit cried, ' Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son !' What were those words ? ' Bring for+h the best robe, and p\it it on him; put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet,' etc. Again, we pray : ' Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.' The question arises, How can our trespasses be forgiven, if we withhold this boon from others ? How touching the words of our Saviour, when, in sorest agony, he cried: ' Father, forgive them, they know not what they do !' Let us not only sing, ' I want to be forgiving,' but cultivate a spirit of forgiveness. Mary C. Settles, Pleasant Hill, Ky.
