Jesus taught his disciples to pray... Jesus taught his disciples to pray, 'Give us this [each] day our daily bread. ' Hence this should be our daily prayer. ' The bread of God is he that cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. ' Surely, no rational person believes that the physical body of Jesus ever came down from heaven. It is mind and spirit that constitutes the real man. Jesus, identifying himself with the quickening spirit, or 'Lord of Heaven,' said, 'I am the bread of life; whoso eateth of this bread shall live forever. My flesh [body and substance,] is meat indeed, and my blood [life] is drink indeed. It is my meat and drink to do the will of Him that sent me.' Therefore the food of the true followers of Christ, is to do the will of God, made manifest in His order, and implies a daily, or continuous revelation, producing a oneness of spirit in all the members of his body, the Church. John, xvii., 21, 22.- A. G. H.
