The Influence of Education on our Religious Life. GRANVILLE TEMPLE SPROAT. The question has lately been asked, ' What influence has education on our religious life? or, is there any connection between what we call education, and what we define as religion? In reflecting on this subject my mind has been directed to an article lately published in a religious paper written by one of our clearest thinkers, in which he says :� So far as we can judge by a large induction of facts, there is no action ot the Divine Mind upon the human, except in the line of already established powers and faculties. There is no result produced, except such as can be produced by arousing the faculties already there to extraordinary power and efficiency. So that the Divine Mind is not attempting to make up something lacking in the structure of the human mind; but simply seeking to develop latent energy in powers that are already provided. It amounts to giving man the benefit of the whole power of his own mind, in a sublime way, to be sure; but somewhat after the manner that a teacher helps his pupil. How? Not by thinking for him, nor, in a literal sense, thinking in him ; but by bringing the stimulating power of his thinking part to bear upon the child's, and waking up its dormant capacity, and making the child think; not dispossessing the child's intellectual nature; but simply making the child use its nature to accomplish the things desired There are many persons Mrho seem to think that the human soul is like a stereoscopic box and that the Divine Spirit takes truths which have been framed outside of the box, and slides into the soul those pictures of truth which it had no hand in making, and which it only sees when put into it. There is no evidence of any such results framed by the Divine Mind. In other words, there is no evidence that God dispossesses the mind, or considers it incompetent for the results which it was designed to produce. In speaking of the Bible heroes, particularly of Moses, this same writer says, ' Could any one but Moses have done the works of Moses ? He was organized and educated to be Moses, and no one else; He was educated in ' all the wisdom of the Egyptians. ' And when the spirit of God rested upon him, his wonderful administrative power, (covering a breadth perhaps never equalled, certainly never surpassed) it was the Divine Spirit simply acting upon an organization already prepared and educated for the work. Massive browed was he Large universality was he. The comprehensiveness, the foresight, the complexity and wisdom of his mind, the whole knowledge of life, and society, and of men, manifested by the great law-giver of the desert�these were brought forth, and developed by the Spirit of God in him. They were not created without regard to his education and his organization. It was so with Paul. He was trained and educated in the school of Gamaliel, one of the most learned and scholastic of the Jewish liabbi?. When he said that he counted all his intellectual attainments but dross that he might win Christ, did he mean to say that they had no influence in enabling him to perform his great mission among the Gentiles? that Paul would have been the same Paul still, although all his previous years had been spent as a humble fisherman, on the sea of Galilee? We think not; and believe, could he now speak from what he has since learned, he would say so. To come down to our times. If we look at the history of those who have been the most useful to men, and the most devoted to God, shall we not find that by a providential training and education they have been prepared for the work that was before them ; and have they not always been ready to acknowledge the Divine hand in thus training them for thevrork they had to do? Among the noble men and women who went forth in the cause of the abolition of slavery, can we not see tliat a previous training and education had prepared them for the work, or it would not have been accomplished? Mrs. Stowe, in speaking of her book, ' Uncle Tom's Cabin, ' said, ' I could not rest day nor night while that work was on my hands. It seemed as if I was awakened by a voice in the dead hours of the night, saying, 'Get up ! work for the slaves. It is the God of those who are groaning in bondage who is calling you. Get up, and do your work ! I will help you ! ' And how had she been prepared and educated for that work? Accustomed from a child to read of the sufferings of the slaves, with the blood of the Puritans in her veins, and their fire in her heart, she was always planning some means to eifect their liberation. She developed under the highest culture, and ripened, in mind when the times were ripest for action. She emigrated early to the west, where she had opportunity to see all that her pen afterward portrayed in cuch glowing colors; ard was enabled to indite the work that was to thrill the nation's heart to its core, and was translated into nearly all the languages of Europe. Who shall say that she was not thus providentially prepared and educated for the great and momentous mission before her? But, perhaps, it will be asked, ' Is not anti-slavery and abolitionism one thing, and religion another? And here I am reminded of a question asked by an eminent Boston clergyman, directed to the Rev. Theodore Parker. ' Do you think that Benjamin Franklin was a Christian? I do not; lean find no evidence in all his writings that he was a converted man, or that he believed in Christ and him crucified to the saving of his soul. ' Parker replied, 'If to go to meeting on Sunday, and to make long prayers to atone for the sins of the week, if to eat sacramental bread in the meeting house, and to be baptized with holy water, and to sing pious psalms through your nose, for your own edification; then to go home and whip your children for laughing on Sunday, as I was whipped; if all this is religion, then Franklin had none. He was worse than an infidel. But if religion be to do justly, love mercy, and to walk humbly with God; if it be to love God with all the mind, and heart, and soul, and one's neighbor as one's self; if it be to forgive injuries, to do good to all men, to protect the needy, clothe the naked, instruct the ignorant, feed the hungry, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, to lift up the fallen, to break the rod of the'oppressor, and let the oppressed go free, and at heart endeavor to keep one's self unspotted from the world; if such things as these, practiced, make a man a Christian ; then Franklin must stand high on the list. If they do not, then it is of no consequence who is called Christian, or Pagan, or Turk.' Canaan, N. Y.
