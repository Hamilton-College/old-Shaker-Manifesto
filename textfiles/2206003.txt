EVOLUTION. Martha J. Anderson. Oh, bright and fair is this world of ours! If we dwell on the sunny side of earth We shall see that the thorns are crowned with flowers, That plants through the darkness come to birth. The snow-white lily, with heart of gold, Comes forth from the ooze of the shallow river And speaks as its petals pure unfold Of the wondrous work of the Great LifeGiver. All things struggle from low conditions, The germ of the beautiful dormant lies, Till nature reaches a glad fruition, Through painful process of sacrifice. The potent rays of the sun, magnetic, Work with a destined end and aim, Till the diamond gleams with a light prophetic, Which shows God's laws to perfection tend. Out from chaos and revolution, Up through the elemental wars, Comes life's glorious evolution, All things thrilling from sands to stars. And through the throbbing pulse of nature Sentient beings a kinship feel, Union with every living creature Sets on the soul of man its seal. From innermost heart of the microcosm, To outermost bound of the rolling sphere, Rock, plant and insect from protoplasm Progressed, through higher types appear. When we behold the divine relation Wrought through creation's wondrous plan, We know that the steps of each g .'adation Are the connecting links to man. Crowning glory of things terrestrial, Two-fold being of earth and skies, Spark of the Infinite Soul Celestial, Heir of unfading paradise. Buried in matter for high tuition, Wrought by earnest and ceaseless strife, Growing brighter through time's attrition, Reaching Nirvana, the goal of life. Blest inheritance! through the portal Of earth-existence we come to thee, To drink ambrosia of life immortal In blissful realms of eternity. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
