SOURCE OF HAPPINESS. Catherine Allen. Whes nobly striving to serve and worship God in all the acts of life, our reward is with us,ï¿½our souls are continually 'refreshed from the presence of the Lord' in the hallowed influences of attending ministers, and in the substance of good which we ourselves attain. The love of the Being whose glory and honor we seek, prompts to an earnest devotion in his service, and thus uplifts from the narrowing sphere of self-pleasing aims, into the realm of those soul-expanding ideals which are crystalized in a life of holy deeds. The spirit thus removed from earthly conditions, is supplied from the unfailing Source of Life ; and happiness, independent of all external circumstances and surroundings, is the inevitable result.
