THE DEAR BLESSED NOW C. M. OVERTON There's a land that is fairer than day, Nor by faith do we see it afar, For the Father has shown us the way, To prepare us a dwelling place here. Cuo.: In the dear blessed now, We have met on the beautiful shore. Let us drink of the sweetness that's here, Let us bask in the warmth of to-day ; Let us joy in the heaven that's near, Nor sigh for a heaven far away. To live with the friends that we love, From sorrow and sin set apart, 0, what could we ask from above, To add to this heaven of the heart! Let us cherish our friends on the earth, Nor wait till they vanish away ; For how shall we measure the worth Of the angels enveloped in clay. N. Union, 0.
