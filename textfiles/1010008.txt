PRENTISSIANA: HISTORY AND PROPHECY, WITHOUT HYPERBOLE 'Fall.' — Prostitution of man's most sacred prerogative to gratification purposes. ' First Resurrection.' — One man and one woman coming together, in pursuance of congeniality's unerring law, making the heaven-appointed use — nothing beyond — of their reproductive powers, imbuing the dear little ones with the affectional and the religious. These are the 'New Earth.' ' Second Resurrection' — Of the children THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 227 of the new earth, begotten, brought forth and nurtured above common humanity's plane, some will aspire to the purity of the ' angels of God in heaven ' — will preserve their virginity unmarred. Such are the 'New Heavens' — 'first fruits unto God and the Lamb.' Now, as never before, are minds of the better classes reaching forth, some to the new earth, some for the new heavens. In the Fine Arts Academy in Buffalo, N. Y., 'The Captive Soul,' a fair damsel in a halo of glory, is reaching up to higer planes of being, an iron clasp around her left wrist is chained to the cragged rock, and holds her in bondage. Could I change places with that fair damsel, I'd burst that rock in flinders.
