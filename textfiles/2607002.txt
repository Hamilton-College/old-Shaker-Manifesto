ANGELS OF THE NEW DISPENSATION. By Aurelia G. Mace. (Read in our meeting for Soul Communion.) BEHOLD we come !Wafted upon the zephyrs from the Elysian fields we come unto you. Glory and brightness are in our wake and the beautiful rivers of heavenly love are rolling onward, deluging the land from shore to shore. Home of the favored and the blest! Home of the pure and the true! We came unto you first,we came unto you in the early dawn, when the birds sang of this New Hope from the tree tops of your lovely groves; the Hope that is now being established as a reality by the scientific researches of the day. Search your records, for laid away in your archives are thousands of messages, words of prophecy, of love and of comfort, which we brought unto you, before we went abroad to do our work with the nations of the earth. We will come unto you again. In God's good time we will come. Hush! Breathe not a thought of doubt while undergoing the throes of this mighty change. Not one jot nor one tittle of all that we have said unto you shall fail. Your banner shall be raised on high;higher than ever before shall be thy standard, and thy victory shall be acknowledged by the nations of the earth. Children of the New Hope, look well to the path in which your feet are found to be walking, for on the plain of nature is the home of discord and strife. We can never walk with you there. But in the bower of purity and spiritual lifeyou will find us. Here we will walk with you and talk with you and sing unto you the beautiful songs of the Redeemed among men. Listen and you shall hear our voices. Come near unto us, and we will draw near unto you. We will feed you from our ambrosial stores and clothe you in fine linen, clean and white. Come unto us all ye that labor and are heavy laden and we will give you rest. Amen and amen. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
