TEMPERANCE SPEECH John Mitchell [Contributed by G. B. Ayery.] TEMPERANCE SPEECH. BY JOHN MITCHELL. 'My father,' said John, 'used both Rum and Tobacco, and I took to his example as a duck to the water. I smoked young, and it created a fiery appetite for alcholic drinks, which resulted in making me a drunkard. When twenty years old, my case was alarming, and my friends took unbounded pains to pluck me from destruction. 'About this time, I was induced by a young friend to attend a Temperance lecture, by Dr. Jewett. The doctor's wit fascinated me, and his logic impelled me to sign the Pledge that night. The Pledge, however, was but a partial thing. It prohibited Strong Drink in all forms, but not Tobacco. I soon found that in renouncing one stimulant, I used a double quantity of another or, in the words of Theodore D. Weld, I had 'Swapped Brandy for Tobacco !' In fact, I ate Tobacco as an ox eats green clover; and this terrible appetite created a thirst for Rum more fierce than I had ever experienced. My Throat was parchedâ€”my chest was a furnace; and I said, 'drink I must, and drink I will!' and like a dog to his vomit, I went back to my cups. 'In two years from this time, by a happy Providence, I heard a lecture on Tobacco, which showed me my mistake, and snatched me from perdition. The lecturer maintained that nine drunkards to ten, probably ninetynine to a hundred, were Tobacco users ; that the Tobacco habit was a boyish one, early formed, and laid the foundations of the gloomy structure of a drunkard; the Washingtonians, who apostatized, were Tobacco sots, almost to a man; that the Pledge, to be safe, must go against Drug and Drink; and that thousands of drunkards; by giving up Tobacco first, had soon given up Rum with comparative ease. Tobacco feeds a fire which no Temperance efforts can quench. I followed the lecturer's advice, and that night threw away my Tobacco forever. 'Now came the tug of war, not with my bottle, but with my PIPE. I was unnerved, my nerves were like the sails of a ship dismantled by the storm. I felt nothing, thought nothing, did nothing, and, like the poor college student, I cried, 'I need* Tobacco to give me Resolution to give up Tobacco !' But God was on my side. I avoided old scenes and associates; I avoided gluttony, and sparingly used nutritious food. I used cold water freely, inside and outside. To raise my prostrate nerves and banish my 'awful goneness,' I used the Fitchburg Antidote a few days; and with gratitude to God I can say, I then conquered both Tobacco and Rum and for seven years have trampled both demons under foot. 'Hence, I would say to every Temperance Lodge and Temperance Society and Temperance Man, the world over, You Can't Curb a Drunkard whilst a slave to his Pipe.' From Anti- Tobacco Tract. The Day Star.
