Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Center Family. March, 1893. The seasons come and the seasons go, thus have we passed through as severe a winter as one could imagine it possible for slender constitutions to endure, in the vicinity of Mount Lebanon. The weather prophets say it is not all over with yet, that the spring season will be cold enough at times, to test severely the buds on the trees and the roots in the ground. We hope for a fruitful harvest. When summer cometh, shall we behold the trees laden with luscious fruit adapted to the health of our frail bodies which are so easily effected by the changes of climate? Some have been severely afflicted with colds and we can but hope that the worst in this respect has passed off. Snow has been so deep and drifted in our dooryard, for some days, as to make it difficult to move around where paths had not been made with plow or shovel. But the rain has carried the drifts away with a witness. Their disappearance forms water to fill the streams that flow through the valley below us, to the discomfort of the inhabitants there. We are striving to live by the rule of right in all things, doing unto others as we wish to have done unto us in all the vicissitudes of life, in this our sweet Shaker home. We have but little here to mar our happiness, in comparison with those who have suffered to establish freedom of conscience. We can take all the comfort that is vouchsafed to us by the cross of Christ, whereby we are crucified to the world and the world to us. The elements of the world we are leaving behind, and are looking forward to the prize of our high calling which is in Christ; to the power that saves from sin and a sinful nature in all its forms.
