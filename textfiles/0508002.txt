PUBLIC MATERIALIZATION Mount Lebanon, June 15,1875. Horatio Eddy &amp; Co. — Esteemed Friends : I have been impressed that the time has arrived when Spiritualism should begin to do to Humanity the good designed by the Powers Above. Materialization is the second step in Spiritualism— the second Degree. There will be seven Degrees. A public meeting, in some great city, where the speakers — part of them — were materialized, would begin a Religious Revival as much exceeding that got up by Moody and Sankey, in England, as Truth exceeds Error, or substance its shadow. Will you co-operate with me to bring this about? If so, on what terms, and under what conditions 1 Please confer together, and, if at all disposed to entertain my proposition, consult the Ruling Spirits. As educational preparation for the great undertaking of meeting the American Public, how would you feel about coming to M't Lebanon and holding some seances here, in conjunction with our people ? Would not the influences here be in every respect favorable ? Could we not form a battery, composed of your natural Mediumship, the Shakers' acquired practical Spirituality, and those controlling Spirits, in the other world, who have the whole movement in charge ? In this work, should you, as Media, the Ruling Spirits, as Motors, and the Shakers, as Substrata, or working force, all concur and agree 'to confer together, and work together, ] suggest that we invite some of the leading minds, in the Spiritual movement, to join with us in the public meeting. I address you first, upon the subject, as 3eing, in my estimation, the first Media in the known world. You may lay this letter before such of the Spirits as you recognize as the highest — most divine — authority, with whom you associate. In kind, respectful regard to yourself and Spiritual household, I am your friend, F. W. Evans
