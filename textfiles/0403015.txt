FROM MEXICO Reforms Inaugurated — Church and State to be Separate—jESUfTS Banished—Monastic Orders Not Recognized — Matrimony a Civil, Contract. Congress has decreed the following: The Church and State are to be separate. Congress cannot make laws establishing or prohibiting any religion. Matrimony is to be a civil contract. Religious institutions cannot possess property. A simple promise to speak the truth, complying with obligations contracted, with penalties in case of violation, is substituted for the religious oath. Nobody is obliged to give his or her services without just compensation. No contract is to be permitted which aims at the sacrifice of the liberty of man in the matter of work, education, and religious vows. The laws consequently, do not recognize Monastic Orders, nor permit their establishment by any denomination, or under any pretense. And no contract will be allowed to be made among persons consenting to their own proscription or banishment.
