BIBLICAL. NO. 4. CURIOSITIES BY H. C. BLINN. We take from Webster's Unabridged a specimen of the early English, as found in the translation of a chapter of the New Testament. Matthew, viii., 1,�10. [From the AngloSaxon version. Words wanting in the original are in Italics; explanations or kindred words are in brackets.] Soothly when the Savior from the mountain came-down, there followed him a great multitude [mickle, many.] Then came-near a leper to him, and him (self) to him humbled, and thus said [quoth:] Lord, if thou wilt, thou mayst m.e cleanse. Then stretchedout the Savior his hand, and touched him, and thus said : I will, be cleansed, and his leprosy was quickly cleansed. Then said the Savior to him : Beware [warn thee] that thou it to no man say; but go, show thee to-the priest and bring them the gift that Moses bade, for their information. Soothly when the Savior went-in to Capernaum, there came-near him an hundred's chief [elder,] him begging [bidding,] and thus saying: Lord, my boy [knave] lieth in my house lame [paralytic,] and with evil afflicted. Then said the Savior to him : I will come and him heal. Then answered the hundred's chief and thus said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou go-in under my roof [thatch;] but say thy one word, and my boy will-be healed. Soothly I am a man under authority set, and I have servants [thanes] under me : and I say to this, Go, and he goeth; and I say to an other, Come, and he cometh; to my servant. Work this, and he worketh it. Indeed when the Savior this heard, then wondered he, and said to those that followed him : Sooth I say to-you, I have not met [ne met I] sc much faith [belief] in Israel. Matt, viii., 1,�10.
