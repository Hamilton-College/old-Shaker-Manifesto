PREACHING AND PRACTICING ' Forgive, forget,' with fond regret We say to one another ; The words we speak, and yet we wreak Our vengeance t'ward a brother. Vain is our speech, if each to each The practice shames the preaching ; And toward our kind our hearts are blind, No friendly hand outreaching. So easy 'tis to utter this, So hard to practice, uttered ; The angel kind that moves the mind His snowy wings has fluttered, With grieving eyes has sought the skies While yet our hearts are waiting, And all our chance of good is lost While we are hesitating. Oh gentle Leech ! the what you preach Yourself must practice kindly, Nor point the way and lead astray Your weaker brother blindly. By loving deeds our human needs Are filled direct from heaven ; And every heart should share a part Of this most precious leaven. Forgive ! forget ! if the regret Follow the harsh word spoken, Nor with a sneer receive the tear Which tells the spirit broken. Our God is love, and from above He shall look down benignly. To err is humanly to do, And to forgive, divinely.
