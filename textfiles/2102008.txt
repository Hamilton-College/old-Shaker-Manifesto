Beloved Elder Henry:--Please send me some four or five more... Enfield, N. H., Jan. 5, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½Please send me some four or five more of the January Manifestos containing the obituary notice of Elder Giles. I am pleased to learn that the 'Kentucky Revival' is to be reprinted in the Manifesto. It must be very interesting to many of its readers. I enjoy with much interest the reading of the Manifesto. It contains some excellent articles, full of meaning and instruction to those in and out of our order. I was particularly interested in the article written by Eldress Anna White in the January number, and also in the article written by Elder Henry. I would not be without the Manifesto if we had to part with some of our earthly comforts which we now enjoy, and have had this same mind from the beginning, and hope we may be blessed to continue it for many years. With kindest wishes, Your Sister, Caroline Whitcher.
