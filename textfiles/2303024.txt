Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1893. It was well said 'that the Feb. No. of our Manifesto would be of interest to its many readers,' so rich in endearing testimonials of filial regard for our beloved Elder Daniel now arisen in the triumph of 'victory over death and the grave.' We bless every voice raised to portray the crowning virtues of the departed, while we congratulate the living privileged to enjoy that blessed reunion of saints upon earth met for such an occasion. It must have been a season of rejoicing, bringing heaven very near. We likewise say in the words of our good Elder Nicholas, 'that the many left at home on the hills of Canterbury, (and no less in the valley at Enfield,) would have enjoyed very much being present at such a heavenly communion.' We do not hesitate to say that the clerk of the weather has been THE MANIFESTO. 73 pleased to visit us in a manner not to be forgotten for many a day. Snow and hail have fallen, alternating with wind and rain, which have played in fantastic gales, covering side-walks with a sheet of ice, giving possible delight to the little folks not appreciated by pedestrians of larger growth. We are engaged ^at the present time in our various occupations. Brethren's work at the mill in full operation. Farmers drawing wood; have secured nearly 300 cords, and are sawing it into shape for fuel. Sisters not in the rear. Some four weeks since an order for twenty dozen sweaters was sent in, which are well under way, though the business has not been pushed as it might have been, had not a cold wave blocked the streams with ice so there was not running water sufficient to run all the machinery. Our business with the firm of Hewins and Hollis has awakened of late. Since Jan. 1st eight dozen shirts have been made, keeping all hands busy. Beloved Elder Abraham has been to spend a few days with friends in Canterbury. His health has been and now is quite good for one so advanced in years. Hope the pale boatman will not come for him for a long time yet. Love to all our kindred East and West. Julia Russell. North Family. Feb., 1803. How time sweeps on, carrying in its course the completed and unperfected soul to its final home; its ever changing seasons giving to mankind, opportunities to sow and reap the products of good or ill, as dictated by the cravings of the moral and mental faculties. Before many days a new season will be ushered in by the immutable laws governing the universe; wise are they who take father time in season, accept and utilize the valuable life lesson contained in the couplet,� 'Honor and fume from no condition rise, Act well your part, there all the honor lies.' An honorable life calls into action, every function of the mind which harmonizes with God's great plan of soul evolution; in unflinching hostility to sin, making war for the inexorable truths of God, as against licentiousness, avarice and every other species of moral turpitude. Its subjects vaunteth not themselves unseemly, but with humility do good and thus grow good; the noble hearted, sounding the glad news of salvation, being living' epistles of righteousness, 'the Saviors of to-day.' Christ said, unless ye take my yoke upon you� meaning true celibacy�ye are not my disciples. Such is our high calling, gospel kindred everywhere; as Society conditions cry aloud for constant congregated zeal in furthering' its welfare, let us not abate our energy in doing the duties requisite to soul and mind improvement; thinking less of the non-essentials of life, and giving more weight to the principles embodying our Church, which add solidity and true culture to the character; those traits which gather, hold and guide aright souls yearning for purity of life. We report the coldest winter here for many years. Notwithstanding all this, we are remarkably free from colds and epidemics of every nature, and are able to hold regularly our devotional, social and reading services, which are sources of profit and pleasure. We extend best wishes to all, and especial sympathy for those who have sustained the loss of valued friends. 'If thou art blest, Tlion let the sunshine of thy garden rest On the dark edges of each cloud that lies Black in thy brother's skies. If thou art sad, Still be thou in thy brother's gladness glad.' George H. Baxter.
