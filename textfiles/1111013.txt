Ayer, Mass., Oct. 16, '81 Elijah Myrick Ayer, Mass., Oct. 16, '81 Dear Bro. Albert : — As to the editor for which you advertise, I vote with Elder J. B. V., and agree with him that such valuable 'acquirements' should still continue as in the past to be public property. The October Shaker Manifesto is par excellent. I need not name contributors, who never fail to interest and instruct; but permit a word of commendation of Bro. Thomas Smith's article, than which no sounder sentiments have graced the columns of the Shaker Manifesto. And also Elder J. B. V-'s article, I am with him and the writer to whom he refers as relates to worldliness and fashion. The subject might receive much more attention with profit. A clean separation from the world and its fashions is of more importance than all the theological controversies that ever spoiled white paper or made brethren less brothers. * * * Dear Albert: — Persevere in well doing. Please accept my love, and the love of all in our humble home.
