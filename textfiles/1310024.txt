CYCLOPEDIA OF SCIENCE The publication of the World's Cyclopedia of Science is an event of remarkable interest to many. For the first time, it brings the scholarly productions of the masters in modern science within the reach of students and all readers who most need, and most highly appreciate, their work. The plan of the Cyclopedia differs from any previously published, in that, instead of being a mere alphabetical list of briefly treated topics, including a mass of unimportant subjects, it will include, complete, the most important works of leading scientific writers upon subjects of the highest value and interest. Each volume will be complete in itself. Volume one, just issued, a large 'model octavo' of nearly 700 pages is sold at the price of$1.50 for the cloth, and $1 75 for the half Russia binding, and contains what has heretofore appeared in numerous volumes obtainable only at many times the cost; the works of such authors as T. H. Huxley, R. A. Proctor, Herbert Spencer, Andrew Wilson, R. C. Trench, Alexander Bain, George Rawlinson, and others. This volume will be followed soon by volumes two and three, the contents of which are said to be of even greater popular interest and scientific value than the present. It is almott superfluous to name the publisher of this grand contribution to the intellectual progress of the masses, for who else would furni=h so .nuch that is excellent for so little cost as John B. Alden, New York? For sale by booksellers and club agents.
