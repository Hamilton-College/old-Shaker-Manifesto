Voice of Peace. Most of our Indian wars have had their origin in broken promises upon our part. Their advances in civilization have been slow because the treatment they received did not permit it to be faster. We cannot expect them to fol- low our guidance unless we keep faith with them and respect their rights. President Hayes' Message
