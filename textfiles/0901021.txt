The Rev. J. B. Gross... The Albany Morning Express says : 'The Rev. J. B. Gross, of Wilkesbarre, Pa., in a book upon ' The Parson on Dancing,' treats of it as an excellent means of praising God, as it enlists the feet in the service rendered by the tongue, hands and looks, and ought to be introduced into worship. Mr. Gross here stands on the Shaker platform.'' The attempted agreement of Protestants and Roman Catholics again to introduce religious services into secular schools in New Haven, ought (as it has) to prove a failure. It is a Church and State wedge.
