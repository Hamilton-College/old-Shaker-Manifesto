Alfred, Me. Oct. 1892. Beloved Elder Henry;Seed time and harvest, that were promised so many years ago, continue to come to us. If we are faithful in the one, we are sure to be blessed with a good result whether in temporal or spiritual things. Elder John Vance tells us that we must add another hundred bushels to the account of our potato crop, so will try and report more correctly. If all the little potatoes had been large ones, there would have been 1,000 bushels instead of seven hundred- However, we have enough and some to spare. That tall ensilage corn filled the silos rapidly. The 1*75 tons will help to make up for the shortness of the hay crop. The apple harvest is hardly commenced. It will not be an abundant one. The first heavy frost of the season came Oct. 2nd., too late to do any harm to the garden. Our dairy Sister thinks the 35 gal. Stoddard churn recently put into the dairy cannot be excelled. Our beloved Ministry returned to us on the 11th. inst. We are always thankful for their presence which adds love and strength to the store we possess. Let us love and bless each other and the blessing will return to us four-fold. t
