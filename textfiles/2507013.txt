Pleasant Hill, Ky. May, 1895. Eldeb Henry;I am interested to inform you that Eldress Betsey Spalding, Br. J. Brown and the writer made a visit to Union Village. We left home one lovely morning and had a most pleasant journey to the beautiful City of Cincinnati, thence to the village of Lebanon, about four miles from the home of the Believers. Elder Joseph Slingerland, and Eldress Elizabeth were waiting with horses and carriage to receive us. We shared bountifully in the love and good will of all. Our own home in Kentucky is a beautiful place, and doubly dear to all who hold it as a consecrated home for Believers. We are having a nice crop of strawberries, and the farm and other business is in a prosperous condition. With kind thoughts for all the readers of The Manifesto. Mary J. Settles.
