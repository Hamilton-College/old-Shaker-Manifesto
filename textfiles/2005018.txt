Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. April 6, 1890. Had the 'Notes about Home' been introduced to the Manifesto a few months earlier, we too might have reported at that time, present home repair; of debris removed, roads straightened, and other improvements about our Dwelling, made by young and interested hands. But the end is not yet, and when proposed equal improvements are made about our Office and its environs, we shall be happy to report. We look at the notes carefully wishing to add a new item, but in vain. Our experiences are common to all with the exception of no La Grippe. The physicians of Europe say it was hard to tell where La Grippe ended, and where panic began. If the disease visited us it was contemporaneous with its appearance in Europe, and before we knew enough to dread it. Our neat wire street fence, with its black and white gates, has been standing eighteen years. The maple shade trees by the roadside were set, from fifteen to thirty years ago ; but the telephone poles on both sides of the street, (more useful than ornamental) are of recent date. We are patiently waiting for the 'Village Improvement Board' to organize and run a good foot path through our beautiful village. We are fortunate in being connected with the family on each side by such, but further than this we cannot report; and the children coming to school must ï¿½'traipse through mud,' and then lose several days during a term, for the want of a decent path. The anxiety for an ice harvest has been a matter of interest the winter past, but nothing has been said of the harvest of pleasure anxiously waited for by the 'wee small folk,' who thought snow and ice came because they 'prayed for sliding;' and like the ice gatherers they laid aside all duties possible, to attend to it as long as a slide was to be had; and were rewarded with robust health and rosy cheeks. In the middle of January one of the Brethren gathered some trailing arbutus, and after keeping it in water for a few days, the buds opened as fresh as in May and brought happy thoughts of an eternal bloom, to the bedside of a dying Sister. Branches from a deciduous flowering shrub were also broken off in mid-winter, which have not only grown leaves in water, but produced a perfect bloom. When reading of 'the bees in the chimney,' we are reminded how necessary it is, that to carry out the full purpose of our religious Community life we must 'Make home a hive where all beautiful feelings Shall cluster like bees and their honey-dew bring, Make it a temple of holy revealings And love its bright angel with shadowy wing.' We are glad to see an increasing interest in the Bible questions. The number of answers has increased from sixty to ninety. One important selected promise in the last number we find omitted. It is indeed pleasant when the labor of life has been arduous yet satisfactory, to think of rest; but if we are living, active workers spiritually, we do not seek this. All we ask is a privilege to work, while so much labor is needed; and imbued with this thought, six of us choose as the most comforting of our Savior's promises 'Ask and ye shall receive; seek and ye shall find ; knock and it shall be opened unto you. * Center Famliy. We Closed our school on the 22nd inst. The teacher, Elder Calvin Reed has been unwell recently from indigestion and heart difficulty. We hope for his speedy recovery. Have finished our wood business it being all split, housed and piled in good shape. We are now awaiting the spring season in which plowing and sowing the garden and field seeds will be in order, so that we may have something by and by to nourish these bodies of ours and make them strong to enable us to do good to the household of faith. March No., of Manifesto contains some excellent articles, among which I wish to name, Sister Anna B. Goepper's and Mary L. Wilson's, bearing on subjects of vital interest to the young and rising generation, and all concerned in the well-being of Society. Our young people are much interested in Sabbath day bible lessons and Monday evening Lyceum. We think and hope both may be productive of good and prove a blessing to all concerned. T. Kayson. April, 11. We have for several weeks been preparing for spring. Have filled our woodhouse and are anxious for the weather to enable us to put in crops. The roads and foot-paths through our Village have been, and are in a very bad condition. We certainly should do something to make them better. We have recently taken two boys from near Fortress Monroe Va., this adds a treasure of life to the external and enables us to keep in a training condition. One thing I am quite satisfied about; that fine houses with all modern conveniences do not make people any more contented, or more willing to bear the cross. I sometimes think they may incline us to be more at ease in Zion. : In passing through New York city recently, it was distressing to witness the great gulf between the high and the low, the rich and the poor. There must be something radically wrong in the laws and system of government that permits of such extremes between man and his fellows all claiming to be the children of the one Heavenly Father. Until this system is changed I have very little hope of a religious revival that will fill our homes with earnest, unselfish, truthloving souls. In kindest love, Daniel Offord.
