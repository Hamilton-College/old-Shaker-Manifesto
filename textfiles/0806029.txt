A POWERFUL COMPLIMENT The Boston and Albany R. R. Co. has recently placed on the road, a new, beautiful, powerful and speedy locomotive, giving it the name of 'The Shaker !' Alive to such a compliment, we hope 'The Shaker^ may be worthy of its name, profitable to the company, meeting with no mishaps, and alway carrying with it a reminder of the prin- ciples of the people whose name it bears. Thus will it be an active, rushing missionary.
