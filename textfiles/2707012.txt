Narcoossee, Fla. June, 1897. If we are poor because we stand true to life and duty, we are poor only as the sower is poor because he has cast his seed into the furrow, and then waits for the fully ripened sheaves in the harvest. We are not realizing the full blessing as yet, and do not expect it for some time to come. The pioneer who takes his ax upon his shoulder and enters the wild woods, soon rinds unseen difficulties in his way, as to working a home of wealth and comfort. His motto is�'Nothing venture, nothing have,' and he enters upon his allctted work, when by continued perseverance he begins to see that all his efforts are not a failure. The truly courageous man or woman is the one who is going to succeed, and he must apply intelligence, thought and his best judgment to the question in hand. He must abide by the results, till new light brings something better to view. Our cool, invigorating weather has now changed to the severity of summer heat, and for a few days old Sol has sent out his rays with the greatest intensity. The nier cury stands at 90 deg. and we shall in all probability have settled weather for the next four months,�and this will be the rainy season. The heat will be somewhat modified by frequent showers, and the farmer will have a good chance to plant his sweet potatoes. We are having a few visitors from the surrounding towns to investigate our material success. We hold very closely to the testimony of Mother Ann Lee,�'Hands at work and hearts to God.' All success in a life of virtue is gained by a willing heart with willing hands. Our crop of rice is beginning to put on new life, and our peach trees are springing forward as by magic. The pine-apples are ripening and everything is saying,� 'With a little patience you will build up a good home in Florida.' The happiness of life depends largely on little things and we will have a contented mind by doing a little good every day. We are building a spiritual home for the soul as well as a home for the body. Andrew Barrett.
