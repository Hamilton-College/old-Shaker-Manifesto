We have had an unpleasantly cool chilly vernal season. Spring has been a week or more later than last year. Altho it has continued cold until the close of May, yet we have not had vegetation nor fruit injured by frost; for this we are thankful. Our crops, except fodder corn are planted. This has been done by the Brethren, with cheerfulness and pleasure. We have releast our hired help with the exception of two. This reduces our expenses from last year $2000 for hired help This is so much gain temporally and spiritually. The sooner Believers depend upon themselves without hiring, the better off they will be. We have planted six and one half acres of potatoes, two and one half acres of sweet corn, eight acres of oats and several acres of fodder corn. We are also able to do our own mechanical work. On May 8, Elder Wm. Wilson and Frank Theobald of Enfield, N. H., arrived here and we spent a week with them very pleasantly and profitably. May 14, they went to Hancock. With but few exceptions the family and Community are in usual health. May 11, we were startled by a telephone announcement of the death of Elder D. C. Brainard. The funeral of the deceased was held at 2 o'clock, May 13th, in the Meeting Hall of the Church family. Several friends not of our Society were in attendance. Such is life! to-day, apparently, we are full of life and vigor; to-morrow we sleep the sleep eternal. Calvin G. Heed. North Family. June, 1897. The rare quality of June weather is better exprest in poetry than in experience in this latitude. Mitchell came nearer the truth than did Lowell when he wrote that 'June usually came in with a cold in her head and a shawl wrapt closely around her,' but in the 'Vision of Sir Launful,' Lowell struck the key-note of a happier thought, and while human hearts admire the beautiful, his wonderful picture poem will be repeated. So much for an introduction to the far weightier items of interest. Eldress Anna White and Sisters Lydia Staples, Julia Lincoln and May Kullhausen have painted three hundred and twenty-five windows twice over. This represents an amount of labor and patience which it is difficult for some of us to realize. The dining-room of which we wrote as undergoing repairs two months ago, is finisht and is very handsome in its rich coverings of wood and varnish. Seven varieties of timber were used and we will promise to see any number of our Brethren and Sisters out of the woods who choose to meet us there. S'ster Maria Blow who has been quite sick for some weeks has recovered and is as ready as ever to help and bless. We have just received a box of pond lily roots from Enfield, N. H. They bring to mind the recent visit of Elder William Wilson and Br. Frank Theobald, the only fault to be found with their visit was that they brought no Sisters with them. In our family meetings we have adopted the plan of having the Sisters conduct the services alternately with the Brethren and think it both wise and just and in accoi'dance with the principles of our Order. Cora C. Vinneo. Shakers, N. Y. June, 1897. If the poetical aphorism is true that 'A colcl and wet May, Fills) the barn with grain and hay,' we may expect a bountiful supply of these products the present season. In this section of the state the spring rains have more than equalled that of the two preceding seasons. As we reviewed the list recorded in the June Manifesto of,those who had past over the mystic river a feeling of sadness came over our spirit as we realized that our friends are passing one by one from our mortal sight. But why should we be sad? Steadily the procession moves on and we lose sight of the head of the column,� but only for a little while and then the joy of our heavenly reunion. Since our last communication we have witnessed the translation of one of the veteran souls who gave all they had to the cause. On the 17th of May our gospel Mother Lydia Dole was received into that mansion not made with hands. Over sixty years had been spent in the Community and many of them, years of heavy burden and care for the people. Such are numbered with those that the Revelator saw 'who had come up out of great tribulation and made their garments clean and white.' Heavenly Father and Mother we thank thee for the inspiration and blessing that comes from such as these, for in their presence there is no darkness nor death but all is light and life. Hamilton DeGraw. Whitewater, Ohio. June, 1897. The wheels of time have brought us around to June,�the month of roses. Our crops are in good condition altho we have had a cold, late spring which has retarded the growth of corn. Wheat and clover are doing well. We have removed the hot air furnace, that was in our family Dwelling and now use steam and hot water heaters. The Trustees' Office is f urnisht with a hot water apparatus. These changes we think will bu a great improvement. Some painting has been done in the family Dwelling which will improve the general appearance very much. Alexander Smith. Enfield, N. H. Jane, 1897. The June Manifesto containing sentiments fragrant with 'Love of Nature,' with counsels to 'Have Justice,' and the cheery song, 'Darkest before the Dawn,' like all preceding ones is welcomed at our home. Credit to whom it is due, is a law of justice. The essay I%A Review' in the last Manifesto credited to me, (and which I should feel honored to claim) belongs to Sister Isabella Russell. Elder Calvin's query, as stated in his last Note, brings to mind the text, 'First that which is natural then that which is spiritual.' The outgrowth of the law of evolution; from earth life developt and spiritualized as intelligence masters all forces and habits that are akin to animal life. To affirm that there were individualized spirits without first being vested in materiality, not only explodes the immutability of nature's Laws, which throughout all ages have ever chimed out the fact, first the seed, then the blade, after which the fruit; typical of progressive human life, but also heralds the fact that God's work was a failure; for degeneration began after his construction of the Adam's family. Reason can not view the Infinite, individualized with characteristics of a butcher and a sensualist. Therefore, the honored, dearly cherisht poem of mythology, 'God made man in his own image,' should become as obsolete as monarchal government in America. Mere tradition that conflicts with scientific facts as regards human creation, is as unsatisfactory to the light of reason, as must have been the results to our young kindred of Sabbathday Lake, who 'fisht all day and caught none.' In the valley of meditation I culled a flower of soliloquy; its petals of thought, questioning, 'Is it possible for any class of people to deal with each other as they would be done by, under the pressure of such vastly different ideas of things essential and non-essential?' The glorious failure of the Greeks in behalf of the opprest Cretans, the lamentable, cruel conditions of the Cubans and home affairs, all present many answers, but the bell of brevity rings down the curtain of silence for this time. George It. Baxter. West Pittsfield, Mass. June, 1897. June,�the month whose praises poets have sung, whose bright days are so joyfully anticipated through the cold season preceding them, is with us. But how different is the reality from the picture. Since her entrance not a cloudless day have we seen, but steadily night and day, with only slight pauses, in which to gain renewed force, the rain has descended. Some few days ago a slight tremor of the earth was telt by several members of our family, but as it ocurred at night and was of short duration it was attributed to a strong imagination. But upon reading of the earthquake shocks felt in different parts of the country, our belief was confirmed, that we also had received a slight touch of the shock. A company of Sisters attended a meeting held in the Baptist Church of Pittsfield for the purpose of listening to a sermon delivered by the Eev. John McNeill, the Scotch evangelist who has conducted revivals in many countries, and received a hearty welcome in our own. His address was plain, pointed, pleasant, practical and interesting to all. We would encourage all such workers, for like the forerunner, who so many years ago taught the necessity of repentance, they are preparing the hearts of men for the reception of divine truth,� opening the field of the world to receive the seeds of spiritual life. We, who claim a wider knowledge, who by divine mercy, have been given a clearer light, should welcome all such evidences of the world's advancement. Grateful for our light realizing the responsibility of extending it to others, applying our faith to daily life, thus proving its practical value. Not echoing the Pharisaical prayer 'God, I thank thee, I am not as other men are,' but 'I am thankful I am not tempted as they.' We received a very pleasant call from Elder William Wilson and Frank Theobald of Enfield, N. H. and we hope the visit will be renewed at some future time. Fidelia Estabrook. Narcoossee, Fla. June, 1897. If we are poor because we stand true to life and duty, we are poor only as the sower is poor because he has cast his seed into the furrow, and then waits for the fully ripened sheaves in the harvest. We are not realizing the full blessing as yet, and do not expect it for some time to come. The pioneer who takes his ax upon his shoulder and enters the wild woods, soon rinds unseen difficulties in his way, as to working a home of wealth and comfort. His motto is�'Nothing venture, nothing have,' and he enters upon his allctted work, when by continued perseverance he begins to see that all his efforts are not a failure. The truly courageous man or woman is the one who is going to succeed, and he must apply intelligence, thought and his best judgment to the question in hand. He must abide by the results, till new light brings something better to view. Our cool, invigorating weather has now changed to the severity of summer heat, and for a few days old Sol has sent out his rays with the greatest intensity. The nier cury stands at 90 deg. and we shall in all probability have settled weather for the next four months,�and this will be the rainy season. The heat will be somewhat modified by frequent showers, and the farmer will have a good chance to plant his sweet potatoes. We are having a few visitors from the surrounding towns to investigate our material success. We hold very closely to the testimony of Mother Ann Lee,�'Hands at work and hearts to God.' All success in a life of virtue is gained by a willing heart with willing hands. Our crop of rice is beginning to put on new life, and our peach trees are springing forward as by magic. The pine-apples are ripening and everything is saying,� 'With a little patience you will build up a good home in Florida.' The happiness of life depends largely on little things and we will have a contented mind by doing a little good every day. We are building a spiritual home for the soul as well as a home for the body. Andrew Barrett.
