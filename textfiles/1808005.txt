REFLECTIONS AND MEDITATIONS. Chancy Dibble. We often hear from good Brethren and Sisters, repining words and sentiments of regret, on account of the few faithful souls who compose our number. Temporal business is suspended, and places of care vacated, for want of mumbers to bear burdens ; and even spiritual and Divine worship, sometimes goes lame, dry, insipid, barren of inspiration, and flat, because of the few who are able to meet and take active part in the worshipful exercises. But, is this state of feeling proper and wise ? Is it not greatly erroneous relative to the real work which we are in? 'Tis true, however, that Christ, when on earth, seemed to lament over the same afflicting view, particularly when he said, 'The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few.' Also when he mourned over Jerusalem, saying ' Oh Jerusalem, how oft would I have gathered thee' &amp;c. But what do we perceive in his motives, save a spirit of sympathy and yearning for the souls of his mistaken and self-righteous kindred�the Jews ? If he was possessed of auy other motive, surely he never manifested it, or seemed to feel auy uncommon desire to increase the number of his followers. He knew that the light, power and testimony of salvation was embodied in himself, and his few disciples ; and that this light must inevitably, illumine all honest, candid souls, in the progress of its increase, from time to time, as stuls obey the measure of truth, and walk in the light to them revealed. Apparently, his disciples had better success in obtaining proselytes, but, they soon found that the purity, virtue, and godly examples of a few, was of more consequence and advantage to the Christian cause, than great numbers, with very limited obedience to its precepts. God designs to have a pure people on the earth, patterns of righteousness; and, through the instrumentality of such, to enlighten the world of mankind relative to the true Order of Christ. But the salvation of the human race in great numbers, appears yet to be far distant, yet as certain as day follows night. God will accomplish that in his own time. Yet this must greatly depend upon Zion's travel, and the purity of souls therein. Through the telescope of prophecy, and spiritual discernment, we can plainly perceive the light of Zion spreading, not only in spiritual views and doctrines, but in real gospel principles, which constitute the foundation of Christ's true kingdom. These are being perceived and believed by thousands of candid, sincere souls. This, I think, will not be disputed by any true Believer who has watched the moving of the spirit upon the ocean of society's troubled waters. In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted of Him, not only as his peculiar people, to whom He has, for a peculiar purpose, made manifest a glorious light, by which they know and understand the whole mystery, root and foundation of sin, and the requirements of a full cross against it; but such are dwellers about Jerusalem, who hold a kind of spiritual union through the connection or instrumentality of invisible spirits from whom they derive a measure of light and comfort, in living up to the dictates of their best faith ; they pray with their faces towards Zion, and their course is thitherward. Now the temporal glory and beauty of Zion however important it may be ; her natural improvements, and outward order; her spiritual wrorship, her divine gifts and sacred melody, all sink into insignificance in the scale of importance when compared with that pure love and charity for lost souls which the true gospel children, who have suffered in tribulation for their own purification, are alone able to feel. This disinterested and yearning spirit for the salvation and happiness of all souls, our Savior and blessed Mother possessed, in a superlative degree. All our first spiritual parents, according to their measure of baptismal anointing into this parental spirit, also consecrated their lives, through sufferings, for the birth of precious souls into the kingdom of God. Our Savior vehemently reproached the Pharisees of his day, on account of their bigoted zeal relative to outward sanctity, and the over zealous observance of traditions, rites and ceremonies, even those given by Moses, while at the same time they passed over justice, mercy, truth, and the love of God, and bound others with heavy burdens which they would not even so much as touch with their fingers. And St. James declares, 'Pure religion and undefiled before God the Father' to consist in sympathizing relief to the fatherless and widows, who were in poverty and affliction, and to 'keep unspotted from the world.'' Jas. i., 27. Also Ezekiel, 34th. chap. 'Woe to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves ; Should not the shepherd feed the flock r Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe ye with the wool, but ye feed not the flock ! The diseased have ye not strengthened, and neither have ye healed that which was sick.' Therefore, must we not conclude that the real and true work of God is not so much in outward form, grace or beauty, not in mere words or sounds, but in charity, mercy, love and forbearance towards lost and repenting souls. Brotherly and sisterly love, gospel friendship, a meek and humble deportment before all men ; a harmless, loving spirit and a godly example, are virtues of most value, and of greatest consequence, as evidences of the genuineness of the Christian profession, and from these qualifications, weak and hungering souls may reap durable strength, courage and sustenance. It is written that God's people should be ' a peculiar people,' and, it would almost seem that each individual child of God, or, in other words, such as are truly called to Zion in this day, are very peculiarly endowed, if not in their natural creation and organization, at least, they (each one) appear to have been rather peculiarly prepared, through some ordeal or process of light and conviction, at, or previous to entering the gospel field, or door of confession end repentance. Now this peculiarity or eccentricity, whatever it may be called, may in some cases perhaps, be necessary qualifications to fit them for the station they were designed to fill; for such persons are frequently found to possess some rare, remarkable, and choice virtues, which perhaps, we freely ascribe to them, yet they are sometimes so curious, so strange, so peculiarly gifted with some peculiar impressiou spiritually, and operations so zealous in some particular respects that to some they appear abnormal, and a pharisaical spirit would feel like shutting them out of union and fellowship. But such an unbrotherly, unchristianlike, uucharitable spirit and feeling is a stumbling-block to inexperienced souls, and debars from that enjoyment of sweet social communion which is of greatest importance, and productive of greatest evidences of our discipleship ; for, 'by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another.' 'Charity suffereth long and is kind, seeketh no*: its own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth in the truth.' &amp;c.�1 Cor. xiii. May God be merciful to his Zion, and so prepare her inmates, that when honest, seeking souls come to her courts under true conviction, they may find her sons and daughters clothed with this gospel spirit of our Heavenly Parentage that they may behold no stumblingblocks. And whatever may be the outward adorning and temporal prosperities of Zion, above all let the spirit of our Savior and blessed Mother Wisdom govern the movements of all of Zion's children and a lamblike, meek and loving spirit be visible in all their intercourse and dealings with each other, both in private and public. 'Comfort, comfort ye my people.' 'Lovest thou me? Feed my lambs.' Watervliet, N. Y.
