New England Magazine Rev. Philip S. Moxom is an interesting figure at present in our religious world. He is one of the battle grounds where the disciples of the old and of the new contend. His religious position has been the occasion of no more controversy at this time than his radical position upon social and industrial questions. His strong ai'ticle on Christian Socialism in the March number of the New England Magazine will attract the earnest attention of very many. It is not onl5' a comprehensive and striking presentation of the subject, but is one of Dr. Moxom's most energetic and characteristic utterances. It is accompanied by a line portrait of the courageous preacher who is just leaving Boston for his new Spring field church.-Warren F. Kellogg, 5 Park Square Boston.
