WOMEN TO THE FRONT Not long ago, while traveling in New England, we noticed a strong, high gate standing alone by the way-side. There was no wall nor fence near it, but still, well-bolted and barred, it stood up strong and straight as though it was doing guard duty. There was no need now to draw out the rusty bolts to admit the passer-by, as it was just as convenient to go around as to pass through it. This reminded us of the ecclesiastical gate which has been so long closed against women. It stands bolted and barred ; but the ecclesiastical fence is nearly all down, and, at the command of the Master, Christian women may march into life's great harvest-fields to work without disturbing the gate or the gate disturbing them. With an open vineyard before them, the women of all denominations are marching out for Christian effort as never before.â€” The Christian Woman.
