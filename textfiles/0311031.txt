SHAKER HOME Sweet my home, with its attractions From the sphere of spirit life, Where the pow'r of love is ruling, And where never enters strife. Quiet, safe, and ever pleasant, Lighted by contentment deep ; Sacred influence, ever present In true hearts that prayerful keep. Guardian friends, like angels holy. Sainted friends, who 've left the form, Bless the dwellings of the lowly, And protect from every storm. Here is Freedom's banner gleaming, Joy and love its folds display ; And the star of Truth is beaming On my Shaker home to-day. Phebe A. Jones, Mt. Lebanon
