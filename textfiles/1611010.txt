Simplicity and purity are the two wings... Simplicity and purity are the two wings by which a man is lifted above all earthly things. Simplicity is in the intention; purity in the affections. Simplicity of thought and deed tends toward Godliness. Purity of life and principle brings the soul nearer to God, for, it is the pure in heart alone who see God. M. J. T.
