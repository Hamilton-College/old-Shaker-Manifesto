BIBLE TEACHINGS. LEWIS HORTON. There should be something of a dividing line between the Old and New Testament, not necessarily to ignore the Old, but to more fully accept the New. The Old contains many good things, but the New is divine. The Old is replete with prophecies, the New records their grand fulfillment. The Old is fruitful of historical events ; descriptions of war, strife and bloodshed intermingred with flashes of spiritual light warning a barbarous people to refrain from cruelty and oppression. The New is adorned with the good news and glad tidings of oeace, and advancing civilization. Out of the Old is drawn material for sectarianism, polygamy, slavery and re- ligious contention. From the New comes the complete assurance of immortality and eternal happiness, proclaiming the Christ that was, and is to be. Jesus of Nazareth was a student of the old scriptures, yet so divine was his character, that he chose only the purest and best. Shakspeare, the immortal bard of Avon was a diligent reader of the Old, but was not so choice in his quotations. As among the springs of earth we choose the purest water, so should it be with what we read. Millions are spent to flood the world with bibles yet what portion of its readers consider that 'the letter killetb, but the spirit giveth life' and light and knowledge. Will the time come when we shall have a spiritual version Bible? let us hope so at least. A time when right o'er wrong prevails, A time when none the truth assails, A time when all the old is gone, A time when all things new are born. Canterbury, N. H.
