Beautiful marble slabs are being placed at the heads of all the graves. Each stone has the full name and age of the individual occupying the grave, with date of death. The stones, with one exception, are of one size, the exception being that of Mother Ann Lee, which is considerably larger, and has inscribed on its surface her name, date and place of birth, also same of death. We are sorry more pains were not taken to have the orthography of the given names engraved correctly; as it is a matter now difficult to correct. There is a feature, however that can be corrected with much improvement â€” the restoration of the symmetry of the yard. On enlarging the cemetery some years since the enlargement was made on one side only, thus leaving the grave of our founder very far from the center. But it stands improved by what is being done, and to our credit greatly. The neatest, prettiest grave-yard among the Shakers which we have seen is at Union Village, O.
