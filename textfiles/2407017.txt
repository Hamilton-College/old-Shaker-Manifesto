Alfred., Me. June, 1894. We have had sunshine for nearly two days, the first for a long, long time. The robins still cry rain, rain, but the farmers' cry is 'warm days and plenty of sunshine.' The peas that were in blossom three weeks ago, are still in bloom but the pods fail to materialize. The sweet corn planted the first of May, has now to be replanted and the potatoes are just coming into sight and the potato bugs are six to the leaf. If an abundance of rain is productive of a large hay crop we ought to have an abundance of that blessing this season. During the month of May, 18034 spaces of cream were sold. Much credit is due Br. Franklin Butler who cares for the herd and also carries on the vegetable garden, which is looking finely regardless of the wet weather we have experienced. To our library of more than five hundred books has been added the two valuable volumes of the 'World's Parliament of Religions' which will afford to all many hours of pleasant and useful study. What could be of more importance than the study of religion? Is it not well for us to think often of the great profession we are making and closely question 'How near are we living to the wonderful profession that we make? Fannie Casey.
