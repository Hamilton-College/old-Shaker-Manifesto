Books and Papers. The Phrenological Journal The Phrenological Journal for Jan. has a portrait of the Rev. W. G. Puddefoot, the Western Home Missionary, � followed by an excellent article, illustrative of the character of the man. It is pleasant to read of those who act as teachers of righteousness, as being good and honorable men and worthy of their high calling. Among the Notable people of the day we find a portrait of Dom Pedro II, which is said to represent him as he appeared while on his visit, to the U. S. He alfeo has the credit of being a good, kind-hearted man. A portrait of Princess Isabella, accompanies the same sketch. An almost universal interest centers upon thepresent movement of these two persons, w,ho so recently commanded'the homage of thousands of subjects, and to-day are wanderers in Europe. Many other interesting articles may be found in the same number. Fowler &amp; Wells Co., 775 Broadway, N. Y. Hall's Journal of Health Hall's Journal of Health for January has an excellent article on 'looking forward,' by H. S. Preston and thoughtful minds will peruse it with interest. 'Exercise and cleanliness' by Emma H. Wight, is another valuable study. It is generally admitted that cleanliness comes very near to godliness, and this being the case, some out of the Church may have an advantage over some who a: e in the Church. � A dirty Christie n mu st be a sorry-looking creature. The article on ventilation fills an important place, as one wants pure air as much as he wants wholesome food. Office 206 Broadway, N. Y.

Among the many valuable exchanges that visit our office, we find that the R. P. Journal occupies a very appreciative pla,ce in the mind. Spiritualism seems to be so thoroughly interwoven into the life of man that we should find it extremely difficult to separate the one from the other. It becomes a subject of such universal interest that every class is absorbed in its beautiful revelations, its mysteries, and may be in its puerile manifestations. To be able to encourage that which develops goodness of heart and manliness of character, and with equal firmness to expose the work of charlatans and knaves, requires a high sense of duty, both to God and man. We appreciate, most emphatically, the straight forward and open manner in which the Editor deals with all the exhibitions, and exhibitors of spiritualism while affording them every privilege to establish their own claim. � � Among Philadelphia Musical Journal America's ILeatliiig' musical lonrual.
