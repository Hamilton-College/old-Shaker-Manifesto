How not to write for the Press, by H. L. Hastings in 'Family Circle.'1 'Do not say, 'I write in a hurry, please correct all mistakes.' You have ten times the opportunity to do this that the editor has. He will be likely to correct your errors by THE MANIFESTO. 79 fire, and then they will never trouble any one any more. You must do your own work if you want it done. It is said that Newton wrote his chronology over fifteen times before he was satisfied with it, and Gibbon wrote out his memoir nine times before sending it to the press. No beginners ought to expect better success or less labor than such learned men. Do not write poetry. Most who try do not know what poetry is, and they can not be told till they have learned a great deal more than they know now. Ninetynine one hundredths of the rhyme written is good for three things. 1stTo give to friends who prize it for the giver's sake: 2ndIt makes passable kindlings. 3rdIt will bring a few cents a pound at the paper-mill, to work up with old rags. Write prose;poetic prose is far better than prosaic poetry. Do not write long articles, or long sentences. Write as you would a telegram, where each word costs a dime, or an advertisement, which costs a dollar a line. Do not ask an editor to return your manuscript. Keep a copy. With scores of letters to read daily, he has something to do besides hunting up last year's manuscripts, received, rejected, and buried or burned up long ago. Do not get angry because your first article is rejected. Quite likely if it is printed, you will live to wish it had been burned up, or sent to the paper-mill. The first pair of shoes a cobbler makes are not likely to sell very readily and it takes more skill, and longer practice to write good articles than to make good shoes.Publisht by H. L. Hastings.
