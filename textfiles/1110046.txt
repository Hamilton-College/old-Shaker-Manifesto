WE'VE ALL OUR ANGEL SIDE The huge rough stones from out the mine, Unsightly and unfair, Have veins of purest metal hid Beneath the surface there. Few rocks so bare but to their heights Some tiny moss-plant clings ; And round the peaks so desolate, The sea-bird sits and sings. Believe me, too, that rugged souls, Beneath their rudeness hide Much that is beautiful and good — We've all our angel side. In all there is an inner depth, A far off secret way, Where, through the windows of the soul, God sends His smiling ray. In every human heart there is A faithful, sounding chord That may be struck, unknown to us, By some sweet, loving word. The wayward will in man may try Its softer thoughts to hide — Some unexpected tone reveals It has an angel side. Despised, and lone, and trodden down, Dark with the shades of sin, Deciphering not those halo lights Which God has lit within ; Groping about in endless night, Poor, poisoned souls they are, Who guess not what life's meaning is, Nor dream of heaven afar. Oh, that some gentle hand of love Their gentle steps would guide, And show them that, amidst itall, Life has its angel side ! Brutal, and mean, and dark enough, God knows some natures are; But He, compassionate, comes near, And shall we stand afar ? Our cruse of oil will not grow less If shared with hearty hand ; For words of peace and looks of love Few natures can withstand. Love is the mighty conqueror, Love is the beauteous guide, Love, with her beaming eyes, can see We've all our angel side. ' Selected
