TOBACCO I advise you to quit.—Gentlemen I advise you to clean yourselves and quit. You will smell better, and that will be a relief to the noses of your intimate friends. It is a nasty, ruinous habit. Some one will say, ' I can't give it up; I have tried, and can't do it. ' If you are so enslaved that you can't break your chains, I will help you a little. Stop at oner. Don't use any to-morrow. The first day is not very hard, but the second day is pretty tough. Along in the evening of the second day your memory is a little doubtful. You can't say exactly whether it was one brother or three brothers that came over. Things are a little mixed. Be patient. The third morning brings the tug. Now go and take an old-fashioned sweat. Place an alcohol-lamp under your chair, three or four blankets round your shoulders, letting the other ends rest on the floor, and sweat until the skin is fairly parboiled. You will be iust as comfortable for one day as you could wish. There will be no dryness of the mouth, no nervousness. You are perfectly comfortable for one day. The next day you will be in trouble again. Take another Sweat; take even a third or a fourth one. Sweating does not hurt people, sometimes it is good for them. Take three or four thorough sweats, and you will go off under easy sail and have no further trouble from your enemy. This narcotic, a native of America, now cultivated extensively in many parts of the world, is a powerful poison. It is used by man in many different ways;—chewing, smoking, snuffing, snuff'-rubbing, smoke- swallowing and plugging — Dio. Lewis, M. D.
