FRANKLIN'S PRACTICALITY. In his new discovery, Franklin immediately saw the means for producing something 'of use to mankind,'' which, as he had written to Collinson in April, 1740, he was 'chagrined a little'' that he had hitherto been unable to do. His speedy invention of the lightning-rod gave to the world the only apparatus directly applicable to the service of man that has ever yet been devised for utilizing or control ling any of the forms of electricity known to Franklin and his contemporaries. In this haste of the philosopher to make his j discovery serve a practical end, we recogI nize the man, Franklin,�the man who exhibited in so many ways the characteristics of a later time.�the nineteenth century American. Scientist and engineer, literary man and journalist, philosopher and man of affairs, Franklin was by nature what society and the growth of the great newspapers, and the stimulating rewards of the patent system make so many of his successors. Franklin's discussions of the single fluid theory of electricity and his whole writing upon the subject of his electrical labors show that he possessed in a, large degree the scientific mind. But he also had the inventive faculty and the will to exercise it. The natural union of these attributes is not so common as might seem to one of our generation. The modern way of life tempts every scientific searcher to turn his laboratory into a workshop, just as the allurements of journalism tempt the majority of the poets and historians away from their natural callings.
