LIFE AS A RIVER ANNA ERVIN Nothing presents a more striking emblem of life, than a silent, smooth flowing river. To the careless and inattentive eye it seems always the same, but the various portions of which it is composed are gliding imperceptibly away. This is its common situation ; but at the equinox how are the scenes frequently changed ! Swollen by torrents, the usually placid stream bursts its bounds. Dark, troubled, and impetuous, it rolls along, involving in its wasteful progress, every herb and floAver, which it before had nourished!
