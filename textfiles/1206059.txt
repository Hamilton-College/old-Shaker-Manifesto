RECOMPENSE Canterbury, N. H. 1. The beautiful gifts of the spirit Are treasures I 2. I'm finding these treasures iminortal. And sing in the 8. I on]y surrender the worldly, And joys of the I covet as mine; I'll earnestly seek to inherit The wealth of the joy of my soul; Their glory in creasing forever, New powers, new spirit abound; I only pray earnestly, humbly, And angels are kingdom divine. This earth hath no textlire, no visions un fold. I banish a . thought that is hovring around. I know that the channels are tinting, Which hastre or beauty afford, Like that of the ovil, And purity reigns in my heart; Its sweetness is Open, From earth to the heavenly land; For while the true spiritual graces We fashion in serving the Lord, cheering and precious, I pray that it ne'er may depart, kingdom we're gaining, Supplies amply meet the demand.
