THE POOR BELIEVER. Mary Whitcher. No habits formed for Higher Life, With all the labor and the strife That's been ior many years. Does not arise at sound of bell,ï¿½ For breakfast is not fitted well, Beginning day thus slack. The things begun, not time to end, The spirit that would not contend Is tried and fretted sore. And will give way to troubles small, While many an unexpected call Brings vent to fret and moan. Look back and see the start was wrong, And time is short that would been long And equal to our need. How wisely then, that those begin Who have not found this life of sin, To start aright at morn. Let such take heed and live to God, For order is his safe abode And ours may be the same. Canterbury, N. H.
