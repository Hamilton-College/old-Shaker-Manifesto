CONSIDERATION. Mary Whitcher. God of love and mercy too, By thy love and care for me Great the kindness I should do, Great the love for all I see. Gently bind the broken heart, Walk in friendship with the poor; Knowing not an ill or smart But to lay it at my door. With the aged and infirm Place myself as needy there; With the young who need to learn, Patient with their lacks to bear. Christ the Savior left his charge With his followers for care, Nothing bounded, but at large, Doing good e'en everywhere. Who are we who speak his name? Who but follow his advice? Shall we bring our Master shame By withholding half the price? Canterbury, N. H.
