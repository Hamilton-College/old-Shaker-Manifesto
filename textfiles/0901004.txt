James S. Prescott—Dear Sir:... James S. Prescott—Dear Sir: I am in receipt of yours of the 25th ult., and am truly glad to receive the Manifesto. I read both copies you sent me, and am more thaii pleased to see the principles inculcated in its pages. You say you would hardly take me to be an Indian from my picture sent you. Very few can detect any trace in me of my Indian parentage, excepting by my actions ; in my every-day life I am perfectly sound, stand over six feet in my stockings, and pull the scales at 185 pounds. I am 27 years of age and considered a fair specimen of the Ghickasaw nation. I am of a wandering disposition and have traveled over every State east of the Mississippi, and nearly all west of here. I send you a sample copy of our Choctaw Indian spelling book, used in our schools. You cannot find an Indian here, no matter how ignorant he may appear, who cannot read and write positively well in our own language. We have spelling books, bibles, testaments, hymn-books, catechisms, and various other works in our own tongue. You have the idea just right in your article on the Indian. You say in The Shaker Manifesto he is not benefited ' by associating with bad white men ; but rather made worse.' Could you go with me and see the shame children (as we call them) at every military post, you could then form an idea why we do not want the War Department over us, for it means demoralization, and finally extermination. Give us the Peace policy and we can ere long become an honor to the IT. S. But turn us over to the War Department, and you set us back forty years on the road to civilization. PJead for us, my friend; cry to your God that this great injustice may not be done us. We are all children of the great Gitchee Manito — ' Great Spirit ' — and he will hold the white people responsible for the way they treat us. Trusting his blessing may rest upon you, I have the pleasure to sign myself, Respectfully yours, James H. Guy
