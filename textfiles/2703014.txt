Whitewater, Ohio. Feb. 1897. Editor Manifesto;ï¿½In looking over this (Jan.) and previous numbers of The, Manifesto, I fail to see any letter from Whitewater in the Home Notes, which I think an oversight. We have had a mild winter, with the exception of about two weeks of severe weather during the latter part of January. During the cold weather, we put up a supply of five inch ice for the summer. Since last spring we have put a line of two and a half inch pipe from the tank by the windmill to the Dwelling House. As the tank is forty feet high it gives a good pressure, so we have a plenty of water for house use as-well as a good protection from fire. We were blest with large crops of peaches, corn, oats and potatoes. The wheat crop was a failure in this section on account of the wet weather during harvest. The Sisters sold poultry and eggs last summer to the amount of $297. (two hundred and ninety-seven dollars.) Alexander Smith.
