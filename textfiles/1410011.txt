LIFE A SERMON. ' Our every life is a sermon.'' ' Life's a sermon ! ' Let us preach it, Preach it ere this hour is past; Up and preach it, do not waste it, Perhaps this day may be your last. ' Life's a sermon ' ' How, then, live ye? Is it full of lies or love? Is its logic clear and truthful? Does it point the heart above? ' Life's a sermon !' What, then, saith it? Does it onward, upward move? Is it written clearly, plainly, Every deed a word of love? ' Life's a sermon ! ' What's its substance? Is it woven from thyself? Does it only prate of pleasure, Pride and ease, and love of pelf? ' Life's a sermon ! ' Ever preaching, Vast its influence hereï¿½above ; All its notes a tinkling cymbal, Should the heart be dead to love? ' Life's a sermon! ' All must preach it, Battling oft with many a foe; Oh that God may see Christ's beauty Gleaming through its tears and woe ! ' Life's a sermon ! ' 0 great Master ! Make it pure, and true, and free, And its weft, though tangled, broken, Yet may guide some soul to thee! W. Poole Balfern.
