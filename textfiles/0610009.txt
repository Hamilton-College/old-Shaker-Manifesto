Ayer, Mass., Sept. 3d, 1876 Dear Brother Nicholas: Your ' Circular ' is received. Thanks for it and also for all the burdens you bear to keep alive our little bark; with its white sail of peace it is yet destined to go higher up the stream of human possibilities than any of the many-colored sails that float on the great sea of time's waters. What if there is a little 'friction,' is it not much better than a dead calm — sleeping upon our oars — a dead level of thought and feeling? You, dear brother, draw largely on our gratitude and sympathy for the interest you take in our general enterprise. It is an age of thought and investigation which we can no more escape than we can the atmosphere around us. It is in the atmosphere. If we ever become proficient scholars in the school of Christ, it will be when we learn to love one another, even if our opinions do not all take form alike, and at the same time. If our lives are pure and unselfish, honest, and separated from the world, the virtues of charity and forbearance will follow as the flow of water or the ascent of flame. The new bottle for the new wine was not peculiar, and only adapted to the time of Jesus. Every new revolution will need its new garment and new bottles. I believe the increase will come, if we first become so weak we cannot resist it. If all labor for the growth of their own souls, it will add to the increase of the Christ kingdom. The Shaker, Long may it wave O'er the world be free, With its power to save. Our public meetings are well attended. We tell the people how we live (or are trying to live), and advise them to come up to the natural and moral law, preparatory to Christianity. Please accept of my best love and the love of all in our humble home, and give of the same to all dear friends in your beautiful abode. Yours, in love, N. A. Briggs, Pub. Elijah Myrick
