To my gospel friends:--Will you please answer through the columns... Enfield, N. .H. Sept. 8, 1890. To MY GOSPEL FRIENDS :- - - -Will JOU please answer through the columns of the Manifesto the following questions ; Why should not House Keeping and Home Making, be considered occupations for Women and of no less account than Stock Raising or Farming aie for Men? Why should not the home duties usually assigned to Women, tend just as really toward the important duty of earning an honest livelihood, as do those assigned to Men? Why should a woman, who faithfully devotes herself for the comfort and well being of the home, feel that she is in any degree dependent on another for her support? Are not her brothers equally as dependent on her, as she is on them? . When there is a proper growth, and a better understanding of the ways of life throughout so-called Christendom, will there not be more enlightenment on the proper duties of both Man and Woman?
