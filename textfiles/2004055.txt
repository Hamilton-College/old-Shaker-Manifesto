Book and Papers. New England Magazine It is no small honor to be the oldest literary society for women in America. This honor is claimed by the Ladies' Library Association of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Thirty-seven years ago, in January 1852, when the commonwealth of Michigan was in its teens, and the beautiful little city of Kalamazoo barely able to stand alone,� when men's hands were full with dealing lands and building homes and finding bread for their families,� a number of earnest women in the little village met one day to solve the problem: How can we furnish intellectual food for ourselves and our children in this new land? It was a, vital question. They had come, many of them, from New England homes; and inherited tastes are not easily laid aside. They wanted books and lectures ; but books were scarce, and lectures scarcer, and money, alas! scarcest of all. It was clearly a case for organized effort. What one could not do, many might; and when earnest women organize to help themselves and their children, who will predict failure? The immediate result of that afternoon's work was the organization of a society whose avowed objects were the establishment and maintenance of a circulating library,%,nd the promotion of literary culture in the town. From that day to this, a period of nearly forty years, the Association has been in active operation, and has. deviated not one hair's-breadth from the original objects. The means have varied with the growth and literary advancement of the town and the requirements of the age; the end has been the same.�From 'A Successful Woman's Club,' by Caroline H.
