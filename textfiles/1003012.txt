What Profiteth Celibacy? Elsewhere, our Brother D. Fraser gives answers to a candid inquirer upon the subject of Celibacy. The answers will be found to be profitable reading. We opine, however, there are vastly stronger reasons for living virgin, celibate lives, than because it tends to better health, freedom from sexual diseases, and greatly to longevity. Our brother gives the true ring at every inference that it is the 64 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. condition necessary to grow successfully into the Divine life. Celibacy per se—of itself merely—is unworthy of much commendation; and only as it is used for, and becomes, the means or even one of the means by which the Divine life, the Christ life is approached and attained unto, but little can be said in its 'favor, but rather savors of constrained selfishness. In the progress of individual Christianity it becomes and is simply and positively a necessity. None is so Christian without it, not only, but is so far from Christ practice, so far from being a Christian in this respect. We acknowledge, all cannot be christians after this manner of Christ's example, so Jesus said, and so our experience with some individuals proves. We are only sorry that this is so—that indulgencies which ruin the chasteness of the Christ life are a necessity with some, otherwise ardent strugglers after the Divine pattern. Yea, sorry are we, that the lower, animal propensities should overcome the superior elements of the angel in humanity, causing so many to be thus dissimilar to Christ. Connected with this subject, is the fact that all religious denominations, those which marry, and those which do not, pay the highest tributes of praise,singling out for especial worship and admiration, those who have lived and died 'celibates for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake.' The lip service of such praise is like very thin air; but the love of such a life, which leads individuals to live it, because it was more like Christ's life, and because this life was most like God's life, this is true praise—a genuine, worshipful adoration of God—in our lives.
