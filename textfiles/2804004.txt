IN THOUGHT OF MARCH. From Mary to Fannie. By Mary Whitcher. And who can help welcoming Spring with its cheer ? The thought of a spring month, Brings gladness more near. And tho the rough winter Holds light in its grasp Every spring like appearance, We see 'neath the mask A beauty unfolding 'Twill be ours in its day. Its breath may be March, But 'tis spring, same as May. 0 how we love beauty, And pleasure and joy, Then why not let duty Grasp all in employ ? It need not be March, Or April or June, But just as well winter, December as soon. If spring hath a place In the heart and the mind, The months need not vary Our spring life to find. We'll ever keep youthful And pleasant and gay, For nothing that's truthful Has blight or decay. 'Tis roses in winter, All sunshine and noon, For nothing can hinder Uprightness to bloom.
