Shaker Station, Conn. April, 1897. The Brethren and Sisters once forming Mount Lebanon family, near Mt. Lebanon, have all reacht this place and are comfortably situated in their new home. We are busily engaged in laying the foundation for our new barn, which will take the place of the one that was burned last January. The oversight of the work is quite a burden on Elder George Wilcox, and yet he carries it quietly and patiently, for the good of the Community. Spring time has returned to us, and is spreading for us a lovely carpet of green, and also sending to us the many little birds of song. Sophia Gopley.
