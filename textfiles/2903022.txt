BRUTALIZING AND INFAMOUS. Massachusetts has the first law prohibiting vivisection in the schools, and in defence of it W. W. Niles, the Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire, says: 'The torturing of dumb animals in the presence of a class of young people for the purpose of instruction is inhuman, brutalizing and infamous. Far better is it for both society and the individual that the scholar should know nothing that is taught in the schools than that he or she should be thus degraded and turned into a brute. The monster in human form who could give such an exhibition to young persons or defend it in another ought not one hour longer to be tolerated for a teacher of youth. He ought to be dismist instantly, and a superintendant of a school board who could tolerate such a wickedness ought not longer to be suffered to misrepresent a community of menand women. Words fail me to express the horror with which doings of this kind fill my soul.' Journal Transcript.
