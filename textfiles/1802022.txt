KEEP THE BODY ERECT An erect bodily attitude is of vastly more importance to health than most people generally imagine. Crooked bodily positions, maintained for any length of time, are always injurious, whether in the sitting, standing or lying posture, whether sleeping or waking. To sit with the body leaning forward on the stomach, or to one side,with the heels elevated on a level with the hands, is not only in bad taste, but exceedingly detrimental to health. It cramps the stomach, presses the vital organs, interrupts the free motions of the chest, and enfeebles the functions of the abdominal and thoracic organs, and, in fact, unbalances the whole muscular system. Many children become slightly humpbacked or severely round shouldered by sleeping with the head raised on a high pillow. When any person finds it easier to sit or stand or walk or sleep in a crooked position than a straight one, such person may be sure his muscular system is badly deranged, and the more careful he is to preserve a straight or upright position, and get back again, the better.
