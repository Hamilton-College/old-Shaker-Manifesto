THE ART OF THINKING. [Contributed by G. B. Avery. ] One of the best ways of improving the art of thinking, is 1o think on some subject before you read upon it, and so observe after what manner it lias occurred to the mind of some great master ; you will then observe whether you have been too rash, or too timid, what you have omitted, and, in what you have succeeded ; and, by this process you will insensibly obtain a great manner of viewing a question. It is right, in study, not only to think when some great opportunity provokes you to think, but, from time to time to review what has passed ; to dwell upon it, and, to see what trains of thought voluntarily present themselves to your mind. It is a most superior habit of some minds, to refer all the particular truths which strike them, to other truths more general, so that their knowledge is beautifully methodized, and, the general truth, at any time, suggests all the particular exemplifications which at once leads to the general truth. This kind of understanding has an immense and decided superiority over those confused heads in which one fact is piled upon another, with the least attempt at classification and arrangement. Some men generally read with a pen in their hand, and commit to paper any new thought which strikes them ; others trust to chance for its re-appearance. Which of these is the best method to the conduction of understanding, must, I siippose, depend a great deal upon the understanding in question. Some men can do nothing without preparation ; others, little with it; some are fountains, others, reservoirs.
