With hearts sincere and true... With hearts sincere and true, let us draw nigh, With faith's assurance, which will never die, Having a conscience chaste and pure within, The inward body wash'd from stains of sin. In our profession, let us e'er endure ; For God is faithful, and his promise sure, Let us consider one another's needs, Provoking unto love, good works, and deeds. O Time ! Time, where dost thou take thy flight? Where thoughtless mortals to me have no right. A. Calver, Mt. Lebanon
