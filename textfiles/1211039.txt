Dear Editor;—I thought as you told me one day... Shaker Village, N. H. Dear Editor;—I thought as you told me one day, that you liked pictures of roses better than you did lillies, I would give you one, because I had a pretty rose, if you will look at the top of this letter you will find one. One Friday afternoon there was no school, so the little girls with Nellie, Bertha, Laura and Mary went out into the woods to pick strawberries and checkerberries, we had a good little ride, and a good little walk; while we were riding, we had a peppermint as large as three inches long and three wide, it tasted very sweet, and I felt as if I could eat ten more. Nellie found a little toad, she gave it to me and I carried it home. I gave all my checkerberries and strawberries to sister J, she ate the checkerberries and gave me back the strawberries. I will close. Your little girl L. D.
