Correspondence. Dear Friends:--Will you be so kind as to answer a few questions... Wilton Junction, Iowa, Mar. 24, 1888. Dear Friends :ï¿½Will you be so kind as to answer a few questions I wish to ask you ? I saw a little pamphlet giving some history of the Shakers. It says that the Shakers believe that the second coming of Christ was made manifest in the person of Ann Lee, their founder, more than a hundred years ago, when she came from England and settled near Al- bany, New York. Have you a book that describes the life of Ann Lee ? Please let me know the price of it. Have you a book describing all about your religion, your belief and church doctrine! Let me know the price of your catechisms &amp;c. Do your people diet auy, or are you particular what you eat and drink ? Do you take medicines when sick ; or are you like our Water-cure people, that do not believe in taking medicines when sick? Some water-cure people believe we should not use the flesh of animals : they think we ought to live on bread, milk, cream, butter, eggs, fruits and vegetables. You have probably heard of Emanuel Swedenborg ; he started the denomination of Christians called Sweden borgians. Swedenborg was a vegetarian ; so says White's Life of Swedenborg ; neither was he ever married. I think he was a great and wonderful man. You can get ' Life of Swedenborg' for 25 cts ; send 25 cts. to J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., book publishers, Phil., and they will send you the book free of postage. Did Ann Lee recommend your people what to eat and drink, or did she tell what was best for mankind to eat and drink in this world ? Did she receive her religious doctrine from the Lord, or from angels ? Please give short answers to my questions, or part of them, as you think proper. Please write soon. Yours truly, Jas. R. Keefover.
