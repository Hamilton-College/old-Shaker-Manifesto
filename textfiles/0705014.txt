My dear Editor: Had a soldier returned from an engagement in the late war as badly crippled as my manuscript from its engagement with the compositors of your February number, he would have been entitled to universal sympathy. Their first shot put a. period to the existence of a poor, little, innocent comma, at the end of the twelfth line; their second transformed lore into love, in the fourteenth line ; and their third gave the coup de grace, by distorting¦ haste into hosts, in the eighteenth line. How would it do for you to employ a professor of Chinese literature as proof-reader? Or better still, perhaps, engage the grand high commission at Washington, who have solved the presidential conundrum, to sit permanently a«^a board for determining the true intent and meaning of manuscript contributions to The Shaker [bv E. T. L. Ed.], with full power to go behinc the retuVns ? Most truly, as ever, yours, E. T. Leggett
