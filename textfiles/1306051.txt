Shall wish for the same no. of copies of... Alfred, Me. Dec. 1882. Shall wish for the same No. of copies of 'The Manifesto' as last year. We feel very grateful to the Editor and Publisher for being willing to assume the burden of our little monthly, and think you do credit to yourselves and to society. Your brother, J. B. Vance.
