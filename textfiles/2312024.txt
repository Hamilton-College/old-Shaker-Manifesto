Alfred., Maine. Nov. 1893. The beautiful Indian summer is still with us. What a pity it could not continue till the other summer came to take its place. But perhaps we should not prize it as much as we do now, so prone is human nature to forget to be thankful for common blessings. No frost to injure the tenderest plant till the 17th. of Oct., and yet we live away down in the state of Maine. The short crops were the sooner har- THE MANIFESTO. 289 vested, leaving more time for the farmers to remove the boulders that have vexed the plow these many years, such improvements are for all time, and will bless the generations yet to come, when the places that have known us shall know us no more forever. Twenty-five acres plowed this fall which would be but a small piece for our western Brethren, whose cultivated acres are numbered by hundreds. All in our home are enjoying that greatest of blessings, good health, and using the strength thus given to serve the Lord our God, with singleness of heart. We extend our kindest love to all our Gospel relation far and near. An earnest prayer to God for Zion's prosperity is the Christmas gift we give to all. Fannie Casey.
