CLOSE OF VOL. 7.—OUR VOL. 8 In closing, with this number, Vol. 7 of The Shaker, we want to add ' God speed' to the thousands of readers who olessed our labors, and comforted our spirit, by their active prayers and contributions. If any have aught but blessing and encouragement for the circulation of God's Word and Shaker testimony by The Shaker—and there may be such—we have only kindness in our hearts for them ; they know not what they do ; they cannot, at the proper time, refuse their reward. We have given to it our best life and endeavors, however imperfect these have been. We feel satisfied with the comfortable reward of this consciousness : and the best of courage for the work of the future. We are unsalaried, but feel well paid. We beg, however, for the immediate settlement of past subscriptions, and instant renewal, with an increase. Give the cause a dime, a day, or a dollar! Take notice : We mean to pleasantly surprise all who subscribe for Vol. 8, by additional improvements and attractions. The testimony will be the same ; but there will be a change of form, more space, more departments, more desirable information, more of everything that is good. Times s.re improving financially ; do not fail to devote sixty cents for Vol. S of The Shaker. Show the first illustrated number to your neighbors and friends. Send us an advertisement, no matter how small nor for how short a period. We will make yearly visitsyr to every one sending us an advertisement. So confident are we of being called to the good work of circulating The Shaker, that we believe every subscriber will feel especial blessings from the heavens for their interests in its behalf. Remember, the music alone will be worth more than the subscription price !
