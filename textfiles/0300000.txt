LISTENING A good listener is a choice rarity. To listen like an Indian is an attainment — a perfection — which but few of the talking AngloSaxons ever reach. Stock-still is the position of a good listener — an attitude of humble, respectful attention. As a subsoiled soil will draw moisture from the atmosphere, so does a good listener, who is drained of the element of self, absorb knowledge, and learn wisdom, from men, women, and children, in whom the egotist would be unaware of its existence. COMMUNITY OF IDEAS. Why not have community of ideas, as well as community of goods, or a republic of letters ? What have we in the realm of thought that we are certain is original ? When I was young, I used to think there was much in my mental treasury that I could justly call my own — the result of my own labor. But, now that I am older, I am inclined to the opinion (which is knowledge in process of formation), that what I have is not my own, but ours—the result of community of thought. We hear, and read, and think, and are subject to intuition and inspiration — the influx of ideas from other minds in the spirit land; how then can we say, this, and this, is mine! Is it not safer to assume that all ideas, every thought we possess, is not mine, but ours; and that we have nothing but what we have received ? This would leave us untrammeled, and free to appropriate every truth, and all the beautiful conceptions with which we may be favored to meet. My conclusion is, that in the Christ heavens self is not; that all thought is common property ; and individual identity, the degree and quality of Love seeking to confer the greatest possible amount of unalloyed happiness upon the greatest number.
