THOUGHTS FOR THINKERS We do not believe immortality because we have proved it... We do not believe immortality because we have proved it, but we forever try to prove it because we believe it. — Martineau Good thoughts (though God accept them)... Good thoughts (though God accept them) yet toward men are little better than good dreams, except they be put in act. — Bacon None are too wise to be mistaken... None are too wise to be mistaken, but few are so wisely just as to acknowledge and correct their mistakes ; and especially the mistakes of prejudice. — Barrow Faith may sometimes exceed reason... Faith may sometimes exceed reason, but not oppose it; and belief may be often above sense, though not against it. Beware therefore, not only of an implicit faith, but of being too closely tied up to reason, where faith is required. Do little helpful things and speak helpful words whenever you can. They are better than pearls or diamonds to strew along the roadside of life. They will yield a far more valuable harvest, as you will find after many days. An unsuspecting, unquestioning, unhesitating spirit... An unsuspecting, unquestioning, unhesitating spirit, God delights to honor. He does not delight in a credulous, weak, unstable mind. He gives us full evidence when He calls and leads; but He expects to find in us what He Himself bestows—an open ear and a disposed heart. — Cecil
