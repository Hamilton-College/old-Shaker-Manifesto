The story of Lot's wife, whether we accept it literally or allegorically... The story of Lot's wife, whether we accept it literally or allegorically, suggests a wholesome truth. We might as well be pillars of salt, or something far less valuable, as to be forever looking backward with regrets. Continual right-doing in the present is the best reparation for an unsatisfactory past. The angular duties of to-day may be ripened and rounded into pleasures if we put the wine of loving hearts and the strength of willing hands into them. And the wayside pleasures, so insignificant of themselves, sometimes, that we fail to notice them, often assume the dignity of duties when relatively considered. And when the busy day has given place to the leisure of twilight, instead of groping among the yesterdays for the wan face of a dead or dying sorrow, or gazing with horror upon the hateful features of some sin committed in the fever of passion or the blindness of ignorance, were it not better to take kindly thought for the morrows? Whose sorrows shall we soothe ? Whose heavy weight uplift ? Whose bitter cup sweeten? Ah! time has healing and wondrous compensations for the brave and faithful who journey on unmindful of their own heart-aches and wounds without cause.â€”A. A. W. in New Age. New Age
