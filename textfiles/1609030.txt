RASPBERRIES. There are three kinds of raspberries. The Black, the White and the Red. The fruit was so named from the roughness of the berry. The wild raspberries are ever so much sweeter than the cultivated ones, but not so large. The bushes on which they grow are very prickly. The black raspberry is not very sweet but some of them are quite large. I like raspberries very much. It is not quite time for them to ripen yet, but when they do I shall notice to see if I can find any thing else about them. L. H.
