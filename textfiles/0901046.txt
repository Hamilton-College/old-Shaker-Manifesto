WINTER REFLECTIONS It is difficult to make people understand that food in animals, as well as in plants, is largely derived from the air, and that good pure air can only supply what nature demands from the atmosphere. Muddy and filthy barns turn out lean cattle. Farmers should remember that we keep cows for their milk particularly. The warmer they are kept, the more milk they will give, and with much less feed. Keep them warm. Socrates wrote: 'Agriculture is an employment the most worthy the application of man, the most ancient and the most suit- able to his nature. It is the common nurse of persons in every age and condition in life ; it is the source of health, strength, plenty, and riches, and of a thousand sober delights and honest pleasures. It is the mistress and school of sobriety, temperance, justice, religion and, in short, of all virtues.'
