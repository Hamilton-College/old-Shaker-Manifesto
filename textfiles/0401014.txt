Worcester, Mass. Oct. 6,1873 Elder F. Evans. Dear Sir : You will perceive by this, that I have settled down here in Worcester, and shall be obliged, if you will change my address on your books, as I am seldom at Fitchburg. I was up there last week, and found two Nos. of the ' Shaker and Shakeress.' In the multitude of cares, in establishing our office, advertising, mailing circulars, etc., I quite forgot to order my paper sent here. I take great pleasure in perusing the contents of the ' Monthly,' and perhaps may find much profit. It is a spicy, earnest, readable sheet, attacking boldly, and with a trenchant blade, some of the worst plague spots that are festering and corrupting the morals of the nation. We need just such a fearless exponent of truth and purity in every family in the land. May its influence extend, and take deep hold, until the people in and out of the churches shall see and feel how far short the present teachings of so-called Christian ministers are of the Christ model, as exemplified by him they profess to represent; and until they realize how imChristlike is much that is called Christianity. With earnest wishes for your success in your reformatory efforts, I am, sir, respectfully yours, B. G. Barto
