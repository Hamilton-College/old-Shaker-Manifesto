New Hampshire Register New Hampshire Register, which has come to be an indispensible hand-book for business and professional men, has appeared for 1898. The book was never so complete as this year, and we note that it has beenincreast by over forty pages not counting advertisments. The greater part of this increase represents added names, so that the Directory is as nearly complete as such a book is ever likely to be. A careful estimate of the added names makes the net increase over 5000 names, Many names of dead men have been dropped so that the Register is up to date this year. The calendar, pages for daily memoranda, lists of United States and State officials, officers of various State associations and societies and all the other information about New Hampshire which has made the Register such a handy book of reference for so many years will be found brought fully up to date. The price remains at 25 cents and the book may be procured of local dealers or will be sent, post paid on receipt of price, by Wm. J. Drew, Concord, N. H.
