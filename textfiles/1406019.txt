At the last supper, eleven disciples partook of one loaf of bread, and one cup, which Jesus said typically, was his body and bloodï¿½meaning to represent the unity of his spiritual substance, and circulating life. As each of these were alike in kind and quality, though distributed to many parts, so is the spirit and body of Christ, though distributed to many members. Hence his spirit must produce the same kind of fruit in every soul that lives by it. Consequently, those who partake of the real body and blood of Christ cannot walk contrary to each other without departing from Christ, in whom is no contradiction. A. G. H.
