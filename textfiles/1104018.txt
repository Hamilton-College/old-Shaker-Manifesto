Is Christianity a Questionable Assertion ? We wish it distinctly understood that we do not enter Shakerism upon the attention of the people as an aggression of their rights to think and live other than it inculcates; but we simply hold it up as radical, unperverted 'Christianity, which every one has the right to choose or refuse. We claim Celibacy as most Christian; We claim iMarriage as not Christian. We assert Community of Interests to be the bounden duty of all professing Christianity ; that they fare and share alike. We hold the opposite personal, private interest to be unchristian- We hold Peace, and nonresistance, and charity to be very Christian, while their opposites cannot be so. We hold abstinence from sensual pleasures; temperance, in all that Christ was temperate ; and freedom from worldly ambitions to be very Christian, while their opposites never were nor can be. Is it a question in any one's mind which are the Christian features in the above assertions ? Is it questionable how any Christian should live ?
