EFFECTS OF BAD HABITS We have the fullest assurances from our spirit friends that the effects of bad habits in life, and of some diseases, linger on the spirit after the body dies in which they were engendered. The burning hankering after liquor, that is the effect of drunkenness, we are assured, does not stop suddenly at death, but, for a time, torments the spirit as it did while in the body ; and we are also assured that it is the same with a love of tobacco, and that it is as easy to break off and conquer these habits here as in the spirit-world. Whenever any effect is wrought into the mind, as a consequence of indulgence in any inj urious, pernicious, or wicked habit in life, that effect has to be outgrown, even after the cause that first produced it has ceased, as in the case of drinking or chewing tobacco. Profane swearing, also, which unfits a person for refined society, does not always stop at death, and the spirit is thereby left out of that refined society which rises and lives above its use. If all people could fully realize the necessity of fitting here for the society they would choose in the next life, we feel sure more would reform and refine themselves, and more would cure themselves of the injurious effects on the mind, arising from the teachings of a false theology, that has taught us that it is not that which enters in at the mouth that defileth the man, and that death would wholly and totally change us from our earthly wants and habits, etc.
