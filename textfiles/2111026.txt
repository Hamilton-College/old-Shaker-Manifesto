Alfred, Me. Oct. 1891. After an exceptionally mild autumn, we are reminded by a little freeze that summer is past and winter will soon be here. Our sweet corn did better than anticipated, averaging a little more than ï¿½55.00 to the acre. Harvesting is nearly completed. Apples a light crop and potatoes not as plentiful as last year. The Brethren have taken advantage of the very dry time to replace the old wooden tubing that conveyed the water to our mill, with an iron one, believing that the best is the cheapest. The liens at each family are having some new houses built for their accommodation, and I doubt not will show more gratitude for their increased comfort than some bipeds without feathers. Who knows but they may do nearly as well as Br. Daniel's. 23158 spaces of cream were sold in September. The Sisters are busy preparing for cold winter which is rapidly approaching. Truly time waits for no man. How important then, it is for us to improve our moments as they fly. Seed-time and harvest will eome to every soul. Let us carefully select the seed we sow that a beautiful harvest of peace, love and truth may be ours to reap. 'I am sowiug seeds for future days Though oft unconsciously. A harvest grown from seeds now sown Will ^oon my portion be.' F. C.
