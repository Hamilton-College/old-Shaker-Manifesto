East Canterbury, N. H. April, 1897. What wonderful changes have taken place within the space of a few weeks. At the time of our last writing, snowstorms and snow-drifts were the order of the day. Now, the snow-storms have given place to April showers, the grass is springing up in all favored places, the birds are singing, and really it is like stepping into a new world. The good Book says, 'First that which is natural, and afterwards that which is spiritual,' and the natural is sure to be on hand. The changes that take place in our lives are, no doubt, as wonderful as are those in nature, and then being so closely conjoined to them that many times they run along on parallel lines. New thoughts, new aspirations and new revelations are constantly unfolding to those who are looking toward a better order of life, in anything that may elevate the standard of humanity. No useful life can run wholly on one line. St. Paul says,ï¿½the body, soul and spirit; each must have its special care under the laws which come from God. On this subject it does no harm to take thought. While we say that with the spring comes the return of the little birds, we must not forget the little chattering English sparrows, that have maintained the most friendly relations all winter. Up to date, we have not seen cause to wish them out of mind or even out of sight. Their song is not as melodious as some birds, and yet it may b^ an improvement on the crow and possibly on that of the blue jay. Certainly it can do no harm to stimulate the mind a little more in favor of lovingkindness toward all useful birds and beasts. The maple sugar makers have been happy this spring, as their sweet harvest has been more abundant than what had been anticipated. Henry C. Blinn.
