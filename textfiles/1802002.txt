A SECRET. Mary Whitcher. My soul hath a secret, I'll hold it secure, [Have been treated unkindly,] Which I will endure I'll never repeat it In no mortal ear. With God I will leave it Who only shall hear. No coolness shall cover My look to that one, No sadness shall hover My brow or my home, Straight onward in duty My steps shall proceed, Beholding but beauty, And working for need. Canterbury, N. H.
