Enfield, N. H. July, 1897. We are pleased to report visits from gospel kindred. For a short season we enjoyed the presence of the first ordMount Lebanonstry of Mt. Lebanon, and whose ministrations we trust will add to the spirit of concord and fellowship so essential to make home a 'sweet home,' especially important to keep the torch of truth burning, so that others seeing its beams of goodness may safely follow its onward and upward wake, from all that defileth or maketh a lie. A company of six Sisters from East Canterbury, hav9 spent a few days with us, adding to our lives good cheer, for soul communion and interchange of thought, giveth new inspirations, not only to abhor evil and cleave to the good, but inspireth new zeal to do greater good for others, practical righteousness the true spirit of Christianity. What exalted thoughts flash upon the mind at the name of home. Well may the children of God sing, ' 'Be it ever so humble there is no place like home.' When we think of the homes under the thraldom of the demon of licentiousness, stricken with soul-blighting diseases, tinctured with the curse of intemperance, fettered in the chains of tyranny, homes wherein the angel of purity never enters and the song of gladness never sounds, how our hearts ought to throb with sympathy for the unfortunate, and with gratitude for our own blessing. Is not home life made harmonious and prosperous by the congregated efforts of her inmates to establish justice, morality and integrity of the highest order? and should not home be of such worth to us that we exert our abilities to get rid of all that is disagreeable and debasing? thus adorning home with virtues and joys of more value than the costliest gem we could possess, or the finest works of art we could hang upon the walls. True,. Home's not mere roof and room, It needs something to endear it; Home is where the heart can bloom, Where there's some kind lip to cheer it. George H. Baxter.
