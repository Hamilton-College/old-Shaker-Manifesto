Editorial. This month we publish, among other good things... This month we publish, among other good things, a very interesting communication, 'How I came to be a Shaker,' from one of the Brethren who has had a long experience in the Community. A life devoted to the cause of Christ has blessed him with knowledge of intrinsic value, which the world could not give, neither can the world take it away. When the heart responds to the inspiration that has been awakened by present needs and carefully and pleasantly traces the pathway over which it has been guided, it may be through this medium that we shall find the fulfillment of the divine word,ï¿½Let thy light so shine, that others may be led to glorify God. While it is a matter of interest to learn of the pilgrimage of those who have been called into a higher life, to accept the cross of Christ and to become as children of God, there are many reasons to believe that it will redound to profit in those who read 'with the spirit and with the understanding.' The life of the Christ is being placed before all people, and an invitation is extended for them to receive it into honest hearts and be made able to grow up in 'the nurture and admonition of the Lord.' There is also a strong, counter influence outflowing from low and disreputable sources which lead into darkness and on to death. To be able to accept the one as the precious gift of God, as the waters that are welling up unto everlasting life, and to close the avenues of the mind to the other, is a victory in which there is much reason for rejoicing. When Jesus extends the invitation for others to come and share with him in the blessings of the new kingdom of God, it is to those who are weary of walking in paths that do not afford rest to the soul; those who are in sorrow, and over-taxed with the selfish relations of this world : to those who are sick and in need of a physician, and indeed to all who would- wish to change from their present position to one higher and 'Nearer, my God, to Thee.' The voice reaches a James, a John, a Matthew, a Peter and many others while they are busily engaged in their personal interests and in building up the kingdoms of this world. They listen, accept and are baptized into the life-element of the new spiritual work and then, in turn, they begin the work of evangelization. How differently must have been the ministration of John from that of Peter, or the ministration of James from that of Matthew, as they passed from house to house with their simple story of being in the world and yet not of the world ; of being raised from the dead and yet never having passed from life. Their mission was to save souls for the happiness and prosperity of humanity and the success of that mission, must be found in the records on high. Called by the same spirit of God to give our lives, a free-will offering for the peace and happiness of humanity, we must fulfill our sacred mission to the extent of our ability or be counted as unprofitable servants in the kingdom of our God. How much more commendable it would be for the Christian, and no less for all by whom he may be surrounded, that he should talk and write of God's call to his soul, of his resurrection into life and his growing interest in the coming of Christ's Kingdom among men, than it is for him to profess the acceptance of Christ while he still lives in the old inheritance and talks and writes of the carnal relations by which he was surrounded. Better think more and write more of our mission to humanity even though it may never grace the columns of a publication. Keep it, re-read it and re-write it and hold it for the inspection of our guardian angels and for those with whom we may reside.
