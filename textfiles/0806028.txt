INCONSISTENCY England is now roused by the spirit of war ; the people demanding of the government an opportunity to kill and be killed. Very probably their request will be granted; and after the fullest gratification of their godless, savage, blood thirsty feelings, then will come the strongest appeals for, and jubilation over a peace that should never have been broken. Now, the wildest enthusiasm is for war ; assassination staring him in the face, who being prominent as an official, dares plead for peace. By and by, the same punishment will be meted out to those who would prolong the war ; while rejoicings will be the order of the day, that the butchery, privations and worse than death are brought to a close. Our testimony is for Peace, now and alway. No Christian can use carnal weapons nor fight; never did so. We oppose wars of households, and wars of nations. All wars are the results of lusts for lands and women. Elder Evans says: 'Those who marry, will fight.' As we claim that Marriage, as well as War, is without the pale of Christianity, the proper parties do the fightingâ€”but these are not Christians. ''Else would my servants fight.'
