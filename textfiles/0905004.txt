ACTIVE FAITH ANNA ERVIN The Apostle James tells us that faith without works is dead; but by works is faith made perfect. Jesus taught a system of salvation from all sins. This was his mission; he had no other; and the question that arises now in my mind is this: Are his teachings as important at the present time as when he first expressed them ? I think they are; and though aware that this subject might be treated elaborately, I think the few remarks which I shall offer will be sufficient to show that activity of the faith of Christ is requisite to our final salvation. ' For what doth it profit though we say we have faith and have not works' correspondingly ? That faith which saves, prompts us to holy action; and through the activity of the Christian faith only, is our salvation wrought. The Apostles taught the necessity of an individual activity of faith ; not a simple reliance on the love and goodness of another, without entering into the spirit thereof, and practically imitating such goodness. Faith is not the wind which makes the wave ; it is the swelling, moving, onrolling undulation itselfâ€”a heavenly force prompting the soul to a righteous activity. This germ is planted in the soul by a divine hand and having been fostered by understanding, fed by experience, nourished by knowledge, out- of this germ comes faith, strong, succulent, constantly filled with the sap of divine revelation. And out of faith like true children from holy parentage is born, Love, Peace, Joy, and Trust.
