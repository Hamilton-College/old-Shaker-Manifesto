HOW TO BE MISERABLE [Contributed by G. B. Avery.] Sit at the window, and look over the way at your neighbor's excellent mansion which he has recently built, and paid for, and sigh out, 'Oh that I were a rich man.' Get angry with your neighbor, and think that you have not a friend in the world. Shed a tear or two ; take a walk in the burial ground, continually saying to yourself 'when shall I be buried here?' Sign a note with a friend, and never forget your kindness ; and, every hour in the day whisper to yourself, '' I wonder if he will pay that note !' Think everybody means to cheat you. Closely scrutinize every bill you take, and doubt its being genuine till you have put the owner to a great deal of trouble. Believe every dime passed on you is but a sixpence, crossed and express your doubts about getting rid of it, if you take it. Never accommodate, ifyou can help it. Never visit the sick and afflicted, and never give a farthing to the poor. Grind the faces of the poor and unfortunate. Brood over your misfortunes, your lack of talent, and believe, that at no distant day, you will come to want. Let the poor house ever be in your mind, with all the horrors of poverty and distress ; then you will be miserable, if we may so speak, to your heart's content; sick at heart, and, at variance with all the world.
