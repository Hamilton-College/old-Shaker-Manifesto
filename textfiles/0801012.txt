LIBERAL LEAGUE CONVENTION F. W. Evans Ed. Shaker: As you are aware, I attended, with Bro. Emil Bretzner, the convention at Rochester. It was a very interesting assembly. It was composed of representations of all parties, sects and creeds, religious and anti-religious—yet, in reality, it was religion, goodness and truth that brought them together and rendered the Convention a truly harmonious Congress of Liberals. And the greatest variety and contrariety of theological and antitheological views and feelings—the most extreme presentations of opposite and antagonistic problems and propositions—Infidel, Spiritualistic, Orthodox and Christian. In one thing all were united—that all theology, in the Civil Government, is a violation of true, pure Americanism. All agreed that the founders of our Government intended to form a constitution that was not Church and State Christianity, nor Church and State antichristianity, but simply Humanitarian, as free from any thing offensive to a Jew, Mohometan, Materialist, Atheist, Hindoo, or Chinese Pagan, as to a spurious, or real Christian. P. S. On Saturday, a Spiritual Medium (female) spoke in a trance state for an hour and a quarter. Good, sound, Shaker theology. Does not this show that Spiritualism and Orthodox Infidelity are one and the same ? Babylon is fallen. The Rochester Rappings have done good service in the course of human progress.
