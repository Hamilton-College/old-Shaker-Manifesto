More offend from want of thought than from any want of feeling... Time to me this truth hath taught— 'T is a truth that's worth revealing— More offend from want of thought Than from any want of feeling. If advice we would convey, There's a time we should convey it; If we 've but a word to say, There's a time in which to say it. — Charles Swan
