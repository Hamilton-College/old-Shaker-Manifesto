Watervliet, N. Y. South Family. We send you an article from the pen of our Beloved Br. Chancy, and it is the last contribution he will write for you. He has passed on to his rest. He has left with us an influence of peace, such as the angels, alone, can bestow. We shall miss his words of comfort and his life example of holiness. It is pleasant to report that we are making some improvements at our own gospel home. Some of the foundation of the building in which the Sisters work, is being relaid. These repairs interest us very much. The porches to our family dwelling have been reconstructed, and the building painted. Even the little girls are made glad, in having a new roof placed upon their house, while the body of the building is being treated to a new coat of paint. The building where we do our Canning is to have a new roof, and next week we expect to move our boiler and engine to an adjoining room, for the better accommodaengaged tion of this work and that at the laundry. I enclose a label which will inform you of our new enterprise, and from which we may hope to reap some benefit. [Copy of the label ] Codfish and Potatoes. Prepared by Shaker Sisters. S. H. Shakers.
