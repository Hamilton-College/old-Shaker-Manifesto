Zion's glory and advancement... Zion's glory and advancement, depend on the advocacy and maintenance of heavenly principles and beatitudes, that shall be an out-growth from within, of true spirituality and soul travel. All the outward adornment and beautifying of her courts, cannot compensate for the lack of redeeming and resurrecting power, that binds souls together in the unity of the spirit of Christ, and makes them strong pillars in her temple, to go no more out. â€” M. J. A.
