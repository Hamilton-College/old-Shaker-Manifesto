Enfield, N. H. Aug. 1894. HAYING on our ahome farm finished July 30th about an average crop, and good weather to cure it. Every day two of our Sisters leave home early in the morning fOr the Canaan farm to take care of the I house where the men lodge who are haying THE MANIFESTO. 215 on the meadows. Harvesting has commenced in the oat fields, a good crop though a little rusty. On the 5th ult. a company of Brethren and Sisters from the Church and North families held a meeting, by request, in the chapel at East Lebanon, we had a very attentive audience from the villages round about us; many of whom did not know in what we believed, so little do we let our light shine. We are happy to record a short visit from Elder Nicholas Briggs of Canterbury. G. H. Kirkley. Aug. 1894. North Family. The periodicals which come to our home daily, contain an abundance of useful knowledge and much matter that saddens; yet all, stores the reflecting mind with valuable lessons; even the most horrifying news has its moral picture, informing us that virtue pays and 'the way of the transgressor is hard.' I am led to muse, should not literature, like the churcheswhich have a stronger hold upon the minds of menbe, not only the strongest, but as true and pure sounding organs, caroling life's ennobling lessons, through its steel lips, unsparingly denounce the evils in high and low life, that peace and plenty, love and equality may triumph over sin and woe. May our Manifesto, with its unalloyed pages, ever stand as a fit publication of what home literature should be and spread abroad the glad tidings of God's love to mankind and of Christ's redeeming virtues to those who 'Awake the powers of mind, of soul attuned, To all the grand sublimities of life.' We have harvested seventy-five tons of hay and twenty tons of oats and barley. Having had a few lowery days, the plough made furrows through some of the worn out land near our home, which means a fuller and more productive hay crop in the future: and the question is, would not the cultivation of the land near us be a good idea, while that afar off be sold? The general health of our family is good, and as health strengthens virtue, the most valuable gem mankind can possess. We are still cheered with bright hope that leads away from sorrow and strengthened by pure love that points toward the hights of a better self-hood. George H. Baxter.
