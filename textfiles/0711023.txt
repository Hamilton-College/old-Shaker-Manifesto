WAIT A WHILE First, there are the poor, mark of every slaughter, Cesspools at their door, sewage in their water; In each crowded dwelling poisoned air and vile, So you'll hear them telling, if you'll only wait a while. Next, there is the drink, licensed source of ruin ; For magistrates must wink at what their friends are brewing; Madness, murder, riot—on it all they smile; But tho' men keep quiet, yet it's only for a while. ?hen, too, there's the land; poor folk cannot get it; landlords understand too well how to let it; ?armers, once contented, now begin to rile; Swear they're over-rented, and they'll show it in a while. And is there no cure for wealth's distribution ? iere great riches, lucre! there great destitution ! Can these camps divided nothing reconcile? So it seems decided, but it's only for a while. Dnce I saw a ship on a calm sea swaying, The least finger-tip at its helm obeying; n the distance heaving rose a cloudy pile, 3ut men unbelieving mocked it for awhile,— 3ut 'twas only for a little, for a very little while.
