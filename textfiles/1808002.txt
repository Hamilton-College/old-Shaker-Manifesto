HEAVENLY LIGHT. Martha M. Burger. The shafts of the morning�bright sunbeams of day� Too soon from the sky fade like visions away, And fair sunset glories melt in the twilight While softly drops o'er us the curtains of night. The star-lighted heaven's expanse we behold Like a vast scene in grandeur and beauty unrolled, Thus are we surrounded by day and by night With blessings unfolding, to gladden our sight. And while thus enveloped in sunshine and shade, With glory reflecting from hill-top and glade, We'll look to the fountain whence light has its birth, And gather the rays that illume the new ea th. Our souls shall rejoice in a heavenly light, And stand in its brightness redeemed from all Wight, No longer enshrouded by darkness within, We'll rest in the joy of a life free from &gt;in. Mt.
