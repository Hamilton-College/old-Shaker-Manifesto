Our Universal Parent— FATHER AND MOTHER GOD CHAUNCY DIBBLE Why do men ransack the whole realm of language for words to describe Deity ? Does not the term Parent convey the simple idea of the relation which God sustains to his creatures ? And while we stretch our senses aloft to scan his attributes, should we overlook the divinity in the innumerable grades of intelligences through whose instrumentality is imparted light and life from superiors to inferiors ? While omnipotence, omnipresence and infinity are incomprehensible terms when applied to one personal being, yet through the agency of myriads of beings endowed with divine attributes, qualified and authorized to supervise the great arena of material things in their construction and moral government is not the Divine Parent ever present with them, all powerful; infinite in wisdom and full of tender mercies? In this innumerable family of the beneficent Father and Mother—this immense chain of countless agencies, endowed from the source of Wisdom, is not man included ? With that parental authority which prevails through all the descending grades from the fountain of love to the lowest germ of humanity, will any form of political government compare ? Can we contract our ideas to a sectarian God? Do we prefer to believe that the Author of all things is such an exclusive, passionate, partial egotist as some have described? Think you that eternity past wa blank, until this orb was formed from nothing ? Were not Angels without number, old in existence before this Earth grew ? Did not the Universe teem with life and intelligence, time past inconceivable? May we not look up through these intelligences to an intelligent God? In those who are clothed with Godlike virtues can we not behold a portion of this image? Shakers, N. Y.
