Recipe for Curing Meat .â€”In his last issue, Maj. Freas, the long-time editor of the Germantown Telegraph, says: 'As the season has arrived when curing meat is in order, we republish as of old our famous recipe for curing beef, pork, mutton, hams, etc., as follows: To one gallon of water take 1 1-2 lbs. of salt, 1-2 lb. of sugar, 1-2 oz. of saltpetre, 1-2 oz. of potash. (Omit the potash unless you can get the pure article. Druggists usually keep it.) In this ratio the pickle can be increased to any quantity desired. Let these be boiled together until all the dirt from the sugar rises to the top and is skimmed off. Then throw it into a tub to cool, and when cold, pour it over your beef or pork. The meat must be well covered with pickle, and should not be put down for at least two days after killing, during which time it should be slightly sprinkled with powdered saltpeter, which removes all the surface-blood, etc., leaving the meat fresh and clean. Some omit boiling the pickle, and find it to answer well, though the operation of boiling purifies the pickle by throwing off the dirt always to be found in salt and sugar. If this recipe is strictly followed it will require only a single trial to prove its superiority over the common way, or most ways of putting down meat, and will not soon be abondoned for any other. The meat is unsurpassed for sweetness, delicacy, and freshness of color.
