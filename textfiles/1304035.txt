MILK. The article contains all of the elements needed to sustain life, in the young, and is one of the simplest in use—wholesome, if it is pure. Its purity depends vipon the health of the producer, and that largely on the quality of the food eaten. If at first pure, it may become otherwise by carelessness. To keep it in tins, made of lead and arsenic, if it becomes sour, especially, is to endanger the life of the family. If uncovered or in any way exposed to fresh paint, or to filth or poison in any form, it soon becomes affected by absorption, since water and all liquids containing it are grand purifiers of the air, these impurities being retained in the liquids. Never keep milk in a newly painted pantry—only water, and that to be thrown out.
