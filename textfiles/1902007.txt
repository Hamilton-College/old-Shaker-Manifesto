Correspondence. To Frederic Evans:--For many years, I have know of... Lodi, Cal.. Nov. 1888. To Frederic Evans :�For many years, 1 have kuown of your order and its good work in behalf of the needy human family, and have had a personal acquaintance with a number of most estimable men and women both, who at some time in their lives were members of your society Prior to my coming to California, about twenty two years ago, 1 met some of your New Lebanon family, and somehow have the impression that you were one of the number. But, be that as it may, I was deeply interested in your society, and particularly because its founder was a woman ; and earnestly wished for an opportunity to visit your place and become better acquainted with the practical application of its principles, which I understood somewhat. But the opportunity never came, and I drifted off thousands of miles away from any organized body of your people. But in all these years, T have never relinquished the hope entertained of visiting your family some day, and the intimate acquaintance of one of your family at Watervliet has perhaps tended to keep alive that early desire. She was then known as Cornelia Rogers, now Mrs. Powers, a widow, and her visit to my home at this time is the immediate cause of my sending you this letter. We have been, for some days, engaged in earnest conversation regarding your people, and the beautiful work of love and charity which you have been doing, in your own quiet way ; and it has led me to address this appeal to you to make an effort to establish one of your families on the Pacific coast; and why not in California? I have been, since a mere child, a school-girl in my teens, working for the betterment of society, for the emancipation of women, for the redemption of mankind from the fruits of sin, and the servitude and degradation resulting from false teachings, ignorance and superstition. During all this struggle, I have ever felt that your order, and similar associative efforts, have been potent factors in accomplishing much of the results of liberalism which have come to the world the past thirty years. And nowT I think your work should take a wider range, and the influence for good which I know has radiated from the several families you have founded in the Atlantic states, should be exerted in this new and prolific field of the Pacific. So forcibly am I impressed with this idea, that I would even undertake a journey to New Lebanon to confer with the Ministry upon the proposition, if desired ; or�what is better still�I would take great pleasure in extending most heartily to you and as many of your people as you might send out here to California, my humble hospitality, and such knowledge as I have of this wonderful state and its unparalleled resources should be cheerfully imparted to you. I will be very glad to hear from you in regard to this matter, and to know if my impressions meet with any response from you. There is a vast field in California for just such kind of work as your self-sacrificing people can do ; particularly amongst the young; and, as there is not now, to my knowledge�and 1 doubt if there ever has been�one of your order west of the Rocky Mountains, it would be a great satisfaction if I should be one of the humble instruments to induce you to establish a family on this coast. You will confer a favor upon me by sending me a copy of the Life or history of Mother Ann, and I will remit the amount for the same, when I write again. Hoping to hear from you soon, I am, very truly yours, Laura de Force Gordon. REPLY. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Dec. 10, Laura de Force Gordon, Attorney at Law, Lodi, Cal. Respected Friend :�Yours of the 28th. ult. is at hand. We are very much pleased with the tone of your letter ; it touches a chord in our hearts that vibrates in harmony with our own enthusiastic de1888. sires, that the truths revealed in our Society may at no distant day extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast. 'For this Gospel must be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, then shall the end come.' The end of what? Of wars, civil, political and religious, of social strifes and contentions ; of pestilence and famine ; of inequality and monopoly ; of poverty and crime ; of intemperance and sensuality ; of slavery and generation. It has come to us ; and we rejoice with an exceeding great joy, that 'the lines have fallen to us in such pleasant places.' While we recognize a great army of truth-loving souls, like yourself, who are working so persistently for the advancement of the race, advocating peace principles, temperance, equality, women's rights &amp;c, &amp;c, we are not without hope that eventually a new earthly order will arise, wherein use and not abuse of the procreative faculties in man and woman will be observed, and wherein right makes might; even as now exists a heavenly order of peace and righteousness, revealed and established by divine wisdom and love. It needs the one to sustain the other ; and we confidently look to this class as being forerunners of the all important work of redemption in which we are engaged. Are we looking iu vain? Is our purblind vision obscured that hides the cloud fringed with the silver lining? 'Where there is no vision the people perish.' Nay, our sight is clear : The vision shows us wheels revolving in the right direction- �wheels within wheels� all moving toward the One Great Center. A tangible proof of such advance is seen, when in a comparatively new state like California, women are filling offices of trust, becoming lawyers, doctors &amp;c, &amp;c. Woman is beginning to rise in the dignity of her calling to assei t her Godgiven rights. And that right does not call her from her owu sphere that she is destined to fill either, indeed, if she work successfully, she must keep within it. The Maternal Spirit in Deity is 'brooding upon the face of the waters'� r, spiritual Mother. It is this beautiful spirit that calleth aloud from the citadel of truth to the daughters of earth in tones of love and tenderness ; angels catch the sound and reverberate it from hill-top to valley, and from ocean to ocoau. As many sin-sick, sorrowful hearts have been made glad thereby, and filled with her love to-day, so will many more rejoice iu the emancipation and liberty she giveth from the terrible yoke of bondage to man's lust, and his power to oppress ; as well as from her own corrupt nature, that makes her worse than a slave to his baser passions. The leaven is working. But, my dear friend, until it works a little more we cannot warrant the establishment of a Shaker Society in California, or in any other place at present. We very much doubt of finding faith among the people, even in the Golden State, to practically carry out in their every day lives the principles embodied in the everlasting Gospel that we preach�the final test in the judgment to which all souls must be brought either in time or eternity. In the meantime we bless you in your efforts, and appreciate the liberal offer you extend. It is not an impossible thing, if it is an impracticable one : the future must decide. If you could so arrange as to place in the public libraries our books and pamphlets, and thus lay before the people the great truths therein contained, we will agree to furnish a sufficient amount. We herewith enclose a few slips for your own perusal ; and will send as you request, the 'Precepts of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders.' It is a new edition just issued. The letter written by your friend is forwarded to its rightful destination. Elder F. W. Evans whom you address is now in his 81st. year and as you will see is still hard at work in the missionary field. He may write you. As you are striving to be a Redeemer in the generative order, toe , are aiming to be Saviors in the resurrection. Let us clasp hands. Hoping to hear from you again, I remain your friend in the cause of human redemption,, Anna White. Mr. Robert Aitken, Dear Sir:--A letter of yours... New Bedford, Mass., Dec. 3, 1888. Mr. Robert Aitken, Dear Sir :�A letter of yours in the November No. of the 'Shaker's Manifesto' to Henry S. Glubb attracted my attention. It gave the best and fullest exposition of the Creed of Shakerism I have ever yet seen. After pondering over its contents in my own mind, I thought that I had seen the name before, then I recollected that in 1882 I had received a letter from you to be given to Mr. Holyoake when he visited this country that he would pay your Community a personal visit; and that it contained the information you knew of him in England. That letter was delivered personally according to your request. Mr. Holyoake's time and business here was too limited to visit any of the Shaker Communities though urged by me to do so. The means at his command were not enough to fulfill his mission, which was to write a book on 'Emigration to the United States ;' it fell through for want of means. He is yet laboring in the cause of Cooperation at the age of 70 years with all the zeal of a young enthusiast, and his letters to the 'Cooperator's News' are the most brilliant of any that appear in that journal. He is gifted with a fund of descriptive perceptibility, endowed by few men as a writer which always make his letters the most desirable of all others in the News. A testimonial is being raised for him by friends and admirers in England and America to place him beyond the reach of want when no longer enabled to earn his bread by tongue or pen. The English people, as ever accord but scant justice to their best and truest friends ; but the admirers of his consistent course amongst the upper classes have giveu liberally to the fund. The Rev. William I. Potter of New Bedford, Mass., is the American Treasurer. Mrs. Thompson has given $100, and some other friends smaller donations. Fifty-four thousand copies of Mr. Holyoake's portrait were struck off for the readers of the News some mouths ago. I secured two copies, one of which I enclosed to you which I hope you have received, your name being remembered by me on seeing it in the 'Manifesto.' Hoping I may soon hear from you again. Thanking you for your very able article in the 'Manifesto,' I remain yours, Peter Sidebotham.
