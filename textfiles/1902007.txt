Mr. Robert Aitken, Dear Sir:--A letter of yours... New Bedford, Mass., Dec. 3, 1888. Mr. Robert Aitken, Dear Sir :ï¿½A letter of yours in the November No. of the 'Shaker's Manifesto' to Henry S. Glubb attracted my attention. It gave the best and fullest exposition of the Creed of Shakerism I have ever yet seen. After pondering over its contents in my own mind, I thought that I had seen the name before, then I recollected that in 1882 I had received a letter from you to be given to Mr. Holyoake when he visited this country that he would pay your Community a personal visit; and that it contained the information you knew of him in England. That letter was delivered personally according to your request. Mr. Holyoake's time and business here was too limited to visit any of the Shaker Communities though urged by me to do so. The means at his command were not enough to fulfill his mission, which was to write a book on 'Emigration to the United States ;' it fell through for want of means. He is yet laboring in the cause of Cooperation at the age of 70 years with all the zeal of a young enthusiast, and his letters to the 'Cooperator's News' are the most brilliant of any that appear in that journal. He is gifted with a fund of descriptive perceptibility, endowed by few men as a writer which always make his letters the most desirable of all others in the News. A testimonial is being raised for him by friends and admirers in England and America to place him beyond the reach of want when no longer enabled to earn his bread by tongue or pen. The English people, as ever accord but scant justice to their best and truest friends ; but the admirers of his consistent course amongst the upper classes have giveu liberally to the fund. The Rev. William I. Potter of New Bedford, Mass., is the American Treasurer. Mrs. Thompson has given $100, and some other friends smaller donations. Fifty-four thousand copies of Mr. Holyoake's portrait were struck off for the readers of the News some mouths ago. I secured two copies, one of which I enclosed to you which I hope you have received, your name being remembered by me on seeing it in the 'Manifesto.' Hoping I may soon hear from you again. Thanking you for your very able article in the 'Manifesto,' I remain yours, Peter Sidebotham.
