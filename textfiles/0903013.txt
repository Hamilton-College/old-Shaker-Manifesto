Celibacy—Chastity—Sacraments It should be known, that Shaker principles demand of their adherents, not only a virgin celibacy in life, but a chastity of thought and behavior, that makes rigid watchfulness and self-denial ever active among them. No half-way working—living in alternate purity and corruption—will ever answer, and who should attempt so to live, would be in hell among the Shakers. The chastest virgin celibacy is our first sacrament —no dabbling with the flesh. 'Entire consecration of self,'' in communal relations, is another sacrament. Peace, with all the additions which that word means, and whatever eradication is necessary thereunto, is another. flighting of our wrongs, and living as brethren and sisters in Christ should live, separate from the world, rounds up the sum of our faith. Amid this public confession of faith, we would ask of our Roman Catholic priesthood, who are sworn to celibacy, whether they are also sworn to virgin chastity ?
