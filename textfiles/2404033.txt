Books and Papers. WHERE SNOW IS RED WHERE SNOW IS RED. Snow is sometimes found in Polar and Alpine regions, whereitliesunmelted from year to year, smd the annual fall is small, colored red by the presence of innumerable small red plants. In its native state the plant consists of brilliant red globules on a gelatinous mass. Red snow was observed by the ancients, a passage in Aristotle referring to it, but it attracted little or no attention until 1760, when Sanssure observed it in the Alps, and concluded that it was due to the pollen of a plant. It was also noticed by the Arctic Expedition under Captain Ross on Bafflns Bay shore on a range of cliffs, the red color penetrating to a depth of twelve feet. Less frequent is a green growth on snow.�March Ladies' Home Journal. New England Magazine Rev. Philip S. Moxom is an interesting figure at present in our religious world. He is one of the battle grounds where the disciples of the old and of the new contend. His religious position has been the occasion of no more controversy at this time than his radical position upon social and industrial questions. His strong ai'ticle on Christian Socialism in the March number of the New England Magazine will attract the earnest attention of very many. It is not onl5' a comprehensive and striking presentation of the subject, but is one of Dr. Moxom's most energetic and characteristic utterances. It is accompanied by a line portrait of the courageous preacher who is just leaving Boston for his new Spring field church.-Warren F. Kellogg, 5 Park Square Boston.

A phrenological love story is another new feature which will attract many readers. The Rev. Joseph Cook is the subject of a finely written phrenograph from a personal examination, by Dr. Edgar C. Beall. The series, 'How to Study Strangers,' by Prof. Nelson Sizer, contains in this installment appreciative sketches of several great inventors and other eminently successful men. The high opinions Horace Mann held of phrenology and his personal intimacy with George Combe are brought out in an enter taining manner by Mrs. Charlotte Fowler Wells. The departments of Health, Child Culture and Notes in Anthropology, show the usual variety of matter. The editor comprehensively reviews the career and character of George W. Childs, and in the Personal column character sketches are given of the Hon. W. L. Wilson, Sanford B. Dole, Jas. S. Blount, Minister A. S. Willis, Miss Elizabeth Peabody and Queen Liliuokalani.

A work that is really new, and unlike any other, is The Nutshell Cyclopedia. It is not intended to take the place of any other general cyclopedia, but to supplement every other, and whatever you have you will probably want the Nutshell, and if you have no other you will surely want it. It treats only live subjects, the facts concerning which are constantly changing, and the latest information concerning which is important. Probably threefourths of its contents will be found in no other cyclopedia, because the occurrences, and the facts, described are of later date than the publication of any other cyclopedia. Though the entire work will comprise probably 2,500 pages, it is sold at a price so low that any one can afford it, ranging from $1.75 for the complete work in Monthly Parts, to $3.20 for the same in four volumes, half morocco binding. The issue before us covers such important subjects as Coinage, Colorado, Columbian Celebration and Expositions, Commerce and Crops, bringing statistics down to 1894 (mostly a year later than to be found in any of the annuals) Congress, with list of the members, Connecticut, and so on. For sample Monthly Part send 4 cents postage to John B. Alden, Publisher, 57 Rose St., New York. THE MANIFESTO. tongue. And so this 'residue of the tenth' receives a tacit promise of literary life for a future generation. Thus rises slowly, our dear mother tongue from her original sin of slang to a sort of 'ticket of leave' existence until, perhaps by some imperceptible evolution, such elements are borne upward to comparative popularity. Such is the record of usage, and thus a dictionary becomes the language builder of the world. We do not regard the work so much as the sum total of four years labor, with its consequent speculative outlay of a million dollars, as that it is really the epitome of the world's scholarship, an encyclopedic microcosm, and as the practical development of the science of analysis, illustration and investigation, focussed and brought into line by the skill, experience and wonderful intuition of that modern personality, the Managing Editor. We believe every man of letters will give the work a hearty approval and 'honorable mention,' for The Standard Dictionary of Funk &amp; Wagnall may be regarded as the literary Pyramid of the world.
