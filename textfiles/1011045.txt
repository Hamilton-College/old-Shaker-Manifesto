Pasturing Fall Grain If the fall grain is in danger of jointing, it should be pastured without delay. It is often a great help to the wheat or rye, to turn sheep or calves upon it. These eat down luxuriant growth, and tread the soil firmly about the roots. If no other stock are available for this purpose cows may be led into winter grain fields.
