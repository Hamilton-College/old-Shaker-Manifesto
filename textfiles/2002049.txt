Elder Henry:--The Manifesto is ever a welcome messenger... Pleasant Hill, Ky. Elder Henry :ï¿½The Manifesto is ever a welcome messenger, gladly read by all. It is like the mile-stone at the wayside, pointing out the way we should go. I love the missionary spirit and pray that we may be better able, in the near future, to do more for the circulation of the glad tidings of salvation. Mary Johnston.
