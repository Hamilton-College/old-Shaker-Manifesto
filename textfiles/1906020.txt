IN-AS-MUCH. Nancy G. Danforth. When we see it announced by the public press, as we often do, that some one has donated thousand of dollars to this or that charity, usually stipulating that his name be in some way attached to the funds, we are lead to ask the question, 'Did that man acquire his wealth by dishonest means, and is he now seeking to ease a guilty conscience, and buy a place in heaven ? Or is love of fame the impelling motive?' Does it seem compatible with the injunction, 'ï¿½Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.' In the parable of the sheep and goats, we do not find any mention made of such high-sounding benevolence, as influencing the balance of a just reward. But the simple duties of life faithfully performed or otherwise guide the decision. The word is, 'In-as-much as ye have or have not done unto the least of these my brethren.' Who are these brethren? Not the self-exalted, with many, high-sounding titles which please the ear. They are the 'Last.' Their names may not be registered on any church book, because the Master lieholds the heart. Every deed of kindness done to the suffering poor of earth, however obscurely performed, will be sure to bring its own reward to the soul. How many have passed through life with scarcely a recognition ! They are so quiet and unobtrusive in their mauuers, neither looking nor asking for any other reward, than the pleasure of bestowing comfort and happiness upon others. We think there will be two disappointed classes ; the one, those who have lauded their own merits, and recieved the applause of mortals. These will expect a joyful greeting on the other shore. Jesus says, 'Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.' The other class are those who, as we have said before, pass unnoticed through life and expect nothing hereafter but the quiet and peace in their own souls resulting from 'Little acts of kindness and little deeds of love.' These will hear the welcome sound of 'In-as-much as ye have done it unto these ye have done it unto me.' Which shall we choose? Canterbury, N. H
