OUR GLORIOUS FAITH. Sophia Wayne. A century and some fifteen years have sped Since our first Elders trod The glorious path, in which our Mother led The way as taught by God. And we who have the faith they strove to gain, May hold that faith in peace. 0 noble souls ! ye did not strive in vain : We view the rich increase. But they who mocked in persecution's hour With angry word and frown, And tri�d to crush us by Satanic power And put our Order down, They failed to prosper in their base intent And strife for our downfall, But learned to feel contending power was sent From Him�the All in All. Then let us give all glory unto God Who brought ouj Leaders through Their heavy trials�2nd the scourging rod� To hold the doctrine true. And we will always keep this glorious faith Of those who've gone before, It is our joy in life, our hope in death, And will be evermore. The Ballston Shaker.
