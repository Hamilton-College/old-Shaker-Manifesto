ONLY A DREAM. SARAH A. COLLINS. We read that old men shall dream dreams and young men shall see visions, but we do not read any thing about the dreams of little girls. I am about to tell a dream I had when I was about ten years of age. Formerly, there used to be a great deal said of a certain bad place,—What shall I call it—Hades ! Generally I went to bed quite early. This time I retired feeling rather uneasy, but soon fell asleep, and found myself in that place that is thought to be uncomfortably warm. Tt appeared to me like a very large basement room, and in the center of this fearful place I saw a large furnace; the mouth was kept wide open ready for the cremating of wicked people. It was larger than any furnace I had ever seen. What an impression it made on my mind! Not very far from this furnace sat the engineer. I pitied him, but perhaps he did not realize the heat as much as I did. Not far distant I saw a friend and making my way thither I soon fell into conversation. On asking my friend who that man was, that was tending that large furnace, he said, he is a relative of the wicked one. All! indeed, so then he has relatives to attend to his business. He must be greatly patronized. I told my friend that I had heard a great deal about such a place but I never once expected to go there thus early, if ever. I said, I am afraid to move for fear the man will come after me ! 'O nay,' my friend said, 'never. They never go after any one. If you get burned it is because you go too near them and are caught in the trap. To sum it all up, if you keep away from them, they will keep away from you.' Very well, then, I think I can easily do that if I can only get a little farther off now, I think I can keep off. Presently I awoke finding myself safe, but very much frightened and soon began to rejoice, knowing my experience was only a dream. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
