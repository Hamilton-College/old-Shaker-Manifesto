THE POWER OF WORDS By Lucy S. Bowers They flash like stars that light the frosty sky, Like rich imperial diadems they shine. And like forge fire are mighty to refine. Like serpents' fangs they sting, like weights they lie, They soothe most tenderly and never die. They can unveil the depths where wrongs combine, Or point out heavenly heights of truth divine; Yea crush like battle-axes, or like sorrow sigh. The happy impulse of the mind they thrill; They captivate, enrich, control and guide; With dignity and power the soul they fill, Sing like a stream, shout like the sea full tide. To speak good words should be in human will, And perfect utterance be the true heart's pride. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
