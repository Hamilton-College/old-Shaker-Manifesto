FELONS AND RUSTY NAILS For the past ten years, we have treated cases of Felons with hot water, and with unerring success. No cutting, no blistering, no any thing, but immersing the finger, hand, or even the whole arm if necessary, in water as hot as can be borne, until the pain is gone and the core is loosened and drawn from the bone. When rusty nails have produced wounds, the same course has been pursued. If on the hand or foot, keep it in hot water. If elsewhere, apply hot cloths with dregs of No. 6 on them.
