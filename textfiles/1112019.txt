EMULATION It is not because we would restrain any from emulating and exceeding the characteristics of Jesus, that we call so much attention to his life as a pattern, and condemn the theory of his death as an atonement. But we find such an almost universal passing by, or passing over Jesus' example, to get into heaven byan easier road than through the same acts of self-denial endured by him, that we feel called upon to continue the clarion cry of Follow Christ.' Not simply believe in some creed which Jesus never uttered nor thought of, but to do something â€” live the same spiritual, self-denying life; the same unworldly, unfleshly, simply Christian life, from which so many world-loving individuals flee.
