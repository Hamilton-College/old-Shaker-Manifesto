Alfred., Maine. Sept. 1893. Beloved Elder Henry;ï¿½Your correspondent, like Martha of old has been busied with much serving, so before she was aware of it the time for Home Notes had passed. However, a wise Mother in Israel said, that a person good for making excuses was seldom good for anything else, and as I would not be so classed, I will say no more but try to do better next time. Our Notes would have been much as others have written, of the bountiful hay crop, and of the hot, dry weather that was so nice for making hay, but bad for the uncovered grass roots and for the pastures that let the cows come home hungry. The drought continued so long that we are getting but two thirds of a crop of sweet corn and some of our neighbors fare not so well as we. A little more than half the potatoes are dug. We use a Potato Digger which.our Brethren think well of but would like it better could it pick up the potatoes. Two thirds of a crop of potatoes is all we hope for but with carefulness that will suffice. We were made glad by a short call from Elder John Whiteley. Was sorry he could not stop over the Sabbath. Elder John remarked that apples in our section of the country seemed more abundant than in any other locality he had seen. Unless his eyes magnified a little we pity the rest of the country for ours will be a very small harvest. We shall have to do with less pie, which may be good for health. A Enfield, 242 THE MANIFESTO. lady Reformer from Portland seemed surprised that we ate pie. The small crop may help us reform in this matter of pieeating. We assured the lady that our pies were very different from the greasy pastry found in the city. We are striving daily to live as Jesus taught his disciples to live. If we have been faithful to sow the good seed, in due season we shall reap the harvest. Fannie Casey.
