TRUE GREATNESS. Helena Sarle. When we read of Jesus and of his blessing for little children, of healing the sick, curing lepers, opening the eyes of the blind, making the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, the tongue of the dumb to speak, receiving sinners, and preaching the Gospel to the poor, we have a most beautiful picture of true greatness. The selfish man sees greatness only in high places, and he seeks high places as the way to greatness. He has the idea that to be chief among his brethren, they must wait upon him; to be exalted he must be haughty and proud and look with scorn upon those who are just as good, but whose rank, of talent and natural acquirements place them below him in name, but who practice more rigid self-denial than their exalted brother. But all this is clearly reversed in the kingdom of God. Here the prince is he who serves, the exalted, he who humbles himself ; the chief est of all is the servant of all. Jesus said, 'Whosoever will be great among you shall be jour minister, and whosoever will be chief est, shall be servant of all.' From the many lessons given by the humble Savior we find that he who wishes to be Christ-like, may always find occasion and opportunity to increase his humility; he can always find some one whom he can serve by a kind deed, a timely word or a sympathizing prayer, and in so doing he finds that humility leads to honor, and that service is the sure door to the throne of true greatness.
