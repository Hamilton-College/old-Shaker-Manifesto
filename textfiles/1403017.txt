[Contributed by Daniel Frazer.] EVOLUTION. At the recent meeting of the association for the advancement of Science, Dr. Dawson of Montreal, (the retiring president,) in reference to evolution said, ' In geology nothing perishes. Heat may change clays into slates, and lime stones into marbles. And that the sudden incoming of life in varied forms baffled Biologists. And that the theories of evolution do not account for it. Suppose we start evolution with a number of organisms ready made; I ask, how can these have varied so as to give new species and genera? It is a singular illusion, that development should arise from spontaneous selection. One consideration stands in the way of the theories of Evolution. It is the remarkable fixity of leading types. Trace certain forms of life along their own line through stupendous vicissitudes and across geologic periods, and we find them substantially unchanged. The origin of whales, affords an example of the difficulties arising from referring existing forms to imaginary ancestors. A strong evolutionist candidly says, ' I have questioned these gigantic sovereigns of the Tertiary oceans, and they leave us without a reply.' The Dr. adds, ' the periods of rapid introduction of new forms of life, were not periods of struggle for existence, but of expansion ; while the periods of struggle, were marked by extinction.' Another difficulty, is the inability of evolutionists to fill the gaps in the chain of being. Many lines of being, present a continuous chain. On the other hand, the abrupt and simultaneous appearance of new types in many specific and generic forms over wide eras, obliges Evolutions to assumptions that Agassiz states, as being a mire of confusion.
