We hear the angel music... We hear the angel music within these peaceful bowers, When all is hushed in calm repose and thoughts of heaven are ours. Then softly, sweetly stealing, the echo floats around, Near, and still nearer pealing, we catch the joyous sound. The burden of their song is love, progression and increase. Oh, may this song of echoes forever whisper peace, peace.
