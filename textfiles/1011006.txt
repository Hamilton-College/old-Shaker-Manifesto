OUR DAILY RECKONING If we sit down at set of sun, And count the things that we have done And counting find One self-denying act, one word That eased the heart of him who heard, One glance most kind That fell like sunshine where it went, Then we may count the day well spent. But if through all the live-long day We've eased no heart by yea or nay ; If through it all We've nothing done that we can trace, That brought the sunshine to a face ; No act, most small, That helped some soul, and noting cost, Then count the day as worse than lost. fellow traveler a few steps behind him : ' Stand thou there, for I am holier than thou.' Here his lower lusts are being right away transmuted to selfrigMeousness; a thing he might never 'have suspected himself of, while estimating himself as little better than an animal from the prevalence and immanence of ;his baser proclivities.
