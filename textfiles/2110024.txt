Union Village, Ohio. Aug. 1891. Dear Elder Henry :�As harvest is about to close, 1 will give some details of the crops. 'Wheat averaged about 20 bu. to the acre and we have raised about 10,600 bu. on our farm. We have cut 625 tons of hay. Oats amount to about 6000 bu. averaging 30 and 35 bu. to the acre. Corn never looked better for this time of year, and we have some 675 acres planted, quite a considerable part of which is on virgin soil, and if no untimely frosts come we shall have a large crop of corn Potatoes and other vegetables and fruits are quite plentiful. For all these blessings we are under obligations to the benevolent giver of all good things�obligations of deep gratitude and also great responsibility as to what use we shall make of such unmerited munificence on the part of the great Father and Mother who inhabiteth Eternity, even the eternal God who is our refuge and the Everlasting Arms which are underneath all. Let us seek the Christ of the universe, 'who maketh the stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning; that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out on the face of the earth, the Lord is his name.' We are razing to the ground some useless and unsightly buildings and trying to get things in better shape but it is slow work. Yet what will not patience and perseverance accomplish in time? We consider a spelling school for our young folks to be in order at this time, and are looking with considerable solicitude toward a Bible Class in the near future. We must keep spiritually alive and try to rise more and more into purity, love, self-abnegation &amp;c. or our highest temporal blessings may become more a curse than a blessing. Our health is quite good, and if we could only persuade those from outside to come in and help us enjoy the peace and purity, the contentment and elevating influences of this blessed gospel our joy would be full. Elder Joseph lately made us a present of almost unspeakable value (viz) Fifty volumes of the 'Encyclopedia Britannica'�One entire set with American supplement for the Office and one for the Family. Union Village never had so rich and valuable a gift before and we hope we shall be duly thankful and appreciative for so splendid a memento of Elder Joseph's kindness amid such adverse times as the present. Few seem, as yet, ready to cast their lot in with us and join the 'hundred and forty and four thousand;' but we try to abide in faith and courage the dayspring from on high to descend from the presence of the Lord and inspire many who now sit in the darkness of sin and the shadow of death to come in and help us perpetuate the best Institution on earth.
