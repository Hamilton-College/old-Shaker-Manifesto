THE BRIGHT SIDE. Lookin' on the bright side That's the way to go; All the time the right side, Summer time or snow! Clouds is got a light side All the bells will chime! Lookin' on the bright side Gits there every time! W'hen the weather's hazy Light the lamps an' still Think you see a daisy Hear a whippoorwill! When you're out o' money, Smile an' take your ease! Think about the honey That's a-comin, with the bees! Atlanta Constitution.
