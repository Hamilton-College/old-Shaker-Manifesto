The London Medical Journal insists that Bright's disease is the result of the immoderate use of iced drinks, and seeks to prove this with figures showing that the disease prevails in any country in proportion with the amount of ice consumed there. We of the United States use 90 per cent more ice than any European country, and the disease is 75 per cent worse than in Europe. England comes next, while in the wine-drinking countries the disease is very seldom seen, and in semi-civilized nations, where ice is not used, it is wholly unknown.
