In Memory of our Loved Sister, PHEBE VAN HOUTEN. By Sarah E. Cutler. O! patient toiler thou hast reached the goal, Hast found the river, and hast crossed it o'er Hast joined the loved ones in that better land From whence the traveler doth return no more. Loved Sister, thou hast borne the cross for many years, Hast been a noble veteran in the cause. Thy character so firm, would never swerve But bravely vindicate Mt. Zion's laws. A braver soldier never scored the field; Heroic warrior 'gainst the powers of sin; For thou hast turned the battle to the gate And fought most valiantly the foes within. Thy loyalty and interest in the cause were ever true; Thou counted all as dross, if Christ to win, Thy soul a willing sacrifice was made Thy heart's desire was,to gain the victory's over sin. Devotion to the blessed gospel work Seemed truly all thy inner powers to claim, And sweet to thee was sacred worship's hour Where thOu couldst praise thy heavenly Father's name. Thy early youth wis given unto God ; The first ripe fruits were sacrifices free Those solemn vows of consecration offered then Were landmarks on life's journey, unto thee. O! Sister dear! thy life was spent in truly praising G )d; To serve thy gospel kindred was thy only jo j ; To consecrate thy labors for the good of all Has been thy greatest treasure and thy sweet employ. We'll miss the many favors from thy hands, . We'll miss thy pleasant spirit from our home; We fain would hold thee here for it is hard to part But thou must go with friends beyond to roam To meet thy sure reward so justly thine A recompense well merited in time The promised blessing to the faithful soul A crown of glory and a robe divine, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
