HOME. ELLA TURNER. What a great meaning there is contained in this small word ( Our Home. ) And what is it that makes homeï¿½Is it not true contentment of spirit? Unselfish devotion of our services to the good of our brothers and sisters? Were it not for home how could we enjoy each others associations? I often think of those who are homeless and know not the joys of home. How often do I compare their life with mine. Here I am surrounded with every blessing tor my physical comfort; and above all I am taught how to become a true Christian. I am making my home by kind words and acts. I am going to be a minister of love and kindness to all my companions and in this way I nm going to make a happy home here and a happy one in the heavens that I may enjoy when I am called to go there. To have a pleasant and agreeable home we need not look to- some gorgeous mansion whose exterior attracts the passer-by with many longing desires. We can have it right here in our beautiful Shaker dwelling, if we strive to live up to the best knowledge of right that we have received. But in order to make this a happy home in the life of -Christ, we must renounce the carnal worldly life that centers in the life of generation. Harvard., Mass.
