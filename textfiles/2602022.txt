STRIKES. Strikes are quite proper, only strike right; Strike to so7ne purpose, but not for a fight; Strike for your manhood, for honor and fame; Strike right and left till you win a good name; Strike for your freedom from all that is vile; Strike off companions who seek to beguile; Strike with the hammer, the sledge and the ax; Strike off bad habits, with troublesome tax; Strike out unaided, depend on no other; Strike without gloves and your foolishness smother; Strike off the fetters of fashion and pride; Strike where 'tis best, but let wisdom decide: Strike a good blow while the iron is hot; Strike and keep striking till you hit the right spot. ï¿½Selected.
