Harvard, Mass. Harvard has had too much of that evenly dispensed blessing which is shared alike by the just and the unjust; spoiling potatoes and beans ; hindering the harvest and injuring much of the forage crops. Sept. 4. Ensilage corn is being cut and stored, and estimated to be about one hundred tons. The experience of one year with ensilage of an inferior quality, (damaged by frost,) induces the belief that a good quality will give satisfactory results. The Silo is twelve by fourteen feet, and twenty-eight feet deep. When filled it was covered with hay, and overlaid with boards,�then thick sheathing paper,�then boards ; and where there was any indications of excessive fermentation, bran was used to prevent it. The gospel,�the religion of this world, is to know how to extract the most and the best from the elements,�the blind forces of nature, and to keep abreast of the moving, living, progressive world in all things. This is laudable. Avoiding alike, antiquity and the fashionable idiocy of the times. To make this world a little more of a paradise,�better for those who follow. To elevate the soc;al line and heighten the joys of those around us, and make acquaintance with the other angels when we meet them. E. M.
