CITY OF LIGHT. 'Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.'ï¿½Matt, v., 10. Canterbury, N. H. 1893. Lo! ye are the light of the world, A city that cannot be hid; My law, on thy banner unfurled, Shall in every kingdom be read. 'So let your light shine before men,' That they see your good works and proclaim, The Lord in his temple to come His Church is a praise to his came.
