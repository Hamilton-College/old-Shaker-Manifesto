Ministering Pure religion and undefiled is 'ministering'â€”not that other thing, 'being ministered unto.' It is handing over the morning paper to another for first perusal. It is vacating a pleasant seat by the fire for one who comes in chilled. It is giving up the most restful armchair or sofa, for one who is weary. It is moving up in a pew to let a new-comer sit down by the entrance. It is rising from your place to lower a curtain or close a blind when the sun's ray streams in too brightly upon some face in the circle. It is giving your own time and convenience every time, for the comfort and convenience of another. This is at once true courtesy and genuine Christianity. If we mean to copy the spirit of the Savior, we must be ready in every hour of the day, to give up being waited upon, and to practice this self-sacrificing beneficent and 'ministering' graciousness of spirit and coniduct. Rev. A. L. Stone, in Pacific Methodist
