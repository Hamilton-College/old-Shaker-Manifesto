THE CHRISTIAN'S REWARD. 'Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you.'� John xiv., 27. Enfield, N. H. 1892. My Peace be with you always, The reward of toil and strife, Is the hundred fold relation, The end,� Eternal life. Then onward, still onward, The way shall brighter grow, As you near the heav'nly fountain, Whence living waters flow.
