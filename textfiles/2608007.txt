July, 1896. In reviewing the past month we recall much of interest, and of pleasure. An eminent Russian writer, Nicholas Maxinoff, who has been in this country three years, and given much thought to communism' is greatly interested in the Shaker Church. He has been with us a week, investigating and writing up Shakerism for a periodical in his own country. Friday evening the 26th lie gave the family a reading in his native tongue interpreting as he read. He is much interested in the great Russian reformer Tolstoi. We have also had with us a niece of Sister Ada Brown, Nellie A. Brown, who is a musical composer and fine pianist. One evening was given to a musical entertainment from her with recitations by members of the family. Spiritual pleasure and enjoyment was found with dear Sisters from Enfield, N. H., not only did we have the satisfaction of a social visit, but added to our treasure of good and our souls were lifted through trusting hope and prayer to realms of eternal riches. May such opportunities be many that we may feel the strength that comes through gospel love. 'What a grand thing it is to be loved! What a grander thing still to love.' Sarah J. Burner.
