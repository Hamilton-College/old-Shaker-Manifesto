THE FAITH I WANT. [Contributed by Emma J. Thayer. | Grant me a faith, I pray Thee, FatherIt must be gift divineï¿½ That will not weaken, but the rather Grow stronger as it bears each destined cross Grow richer as it meets with seeming loss. O may such faith be mine ! I want a faith that will not falter When deepest shadows fall; That changing seasons cannot alter, That 'mid the wildest tempest dwells in peace, With calmness waits the raging storm's sur[cease, And sings its way through all. I want a faith that, erer resting On God alone for strength, May shock of battle boldly breasting Fear not the force of e'en unnumbered foes, But fight till their retreating ranks disclose The victory won at length. I want a faith which, when kept waiting For gifts it seeks in prayer, May, by its own anticipating, Though human reason deems the hope in vain, Possess the joy it covets, nor complain, Though God may long forbear. I want a faith whose steady lustre Shall shed its cheering rays Where sorrows do most thickly cluster; Whose shining radiance will the brighter grow As earthly tapers lose their feeble glow. And life seems lost in maze. I want a faith that will not shiver When death says. 'Come to God;' But dauntless meet the parting river, Defiance bid to Jordan's rolling tide, With one bold stroke its current turn aside And then go home dry shod. Selected.
