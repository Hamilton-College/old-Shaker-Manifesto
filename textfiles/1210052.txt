Bones for Poultry. Bones for the Poultry—The various preparations of pure bones, selected and prepared, as crushed, granulated, bone meal, etc., for feeding to poultry, are becoming each year more popular, and deservedly so. The experience of nearly every one who has given them a faithful trial has bee?- such as to make them constantly patrons of the most reliable venders, it being invariably found that by a judicious use of broken or ground new bone the fowls are healthier, more prolific, stand confinement better, and acquire less bad habits by confinement. Chickens fed on these preparations to the proper extent will grow to a much better size, the use of the bone having the effect to postpone the time when the bones harden or, in common phrase, set. Chicks are, therefore, such for a greater period, and may be kept growing for a longer time by the use of bone preparation.— New York Poultry Journal.
