What Boys Should Be A philosopher has said that true education for boys is to ' teach them what they ought to know when they become men.' What is it they ought to know, then ? First. To be true — to be genuine. No education is worth any thing that does not include this. A man had better not know low to read—-he had better never learn a etter in the alphabet and be true and genuine in intention and in action, rather than 3eing learned in all sciences and in all languages, to be at the same time false in heart and counterfeit in life. Above all things, teach the boys that truth is more than riches, more than culture, more than earthly power or position. Second. To be pure in thought, language and life — pure in mind and body. An impure man, young or old, poisoning the society where he moves with smutty stories and impure examples, is a moral ulcer, a )lague-spot, a leper who ought to be treated as were the lepers of old, who were banished Tom society and compelled to cry ' Unclean,' as a warning to save others from the pestilence. 90 THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. Third. To be unselfish. To care for the feelings and comfort of others. To be polite. To be just in all dealings with others. To be generous, noble and manly. This will include a genuine reverence for the aged and things sacred. Fourth. To be self-reliant and self-helpful even from early childhood. To be industrious always, and self-supporting at the earliest proper age. Teach them that all honest work is honorable, and that an idle useless life of dependence on others is disgraceful. When a boy has learned these four things, when he has made these ideas a part of his being — however young he may be, however poor, or however rich — he has learned some of the most important things he ought to know when he becomes a man. With these four, properly mastered, it will be easy to find all the rest.—[Home Arts.
