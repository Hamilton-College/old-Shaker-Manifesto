Crib-biting is often a habit, but may be caused by a disease. Indigestion occasions a constant irritation and uneasiness which may impel the horse to take hold with the teeth and stretch the neck as a means of relief. From this grows the habit of cribbiting and wind-sucking, which ceases when the cause is removed. As a remedy, feed him upon cut feed, with crushed or ground grain, and an ounce of salt in each feed.
