Poetic Sermon—' Judge Not.' In speaking of a person's faults, Pray don't forget your own ; Remember, those with homes of glass Should seldom throw a stone. If we have nothing else to do But talk of others' sin, 'Tis better we commence at home, And from that point begin. Some may have faults—and who have The old as well as young! Perhaps we may, for aught we know, Have many where they've one. I'll tell you of a better plan, And one that works full well: e sure your own defects you cure Before of others' tell.
