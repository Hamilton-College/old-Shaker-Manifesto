The Vision of Echard Whittier 's last poem-, ' ,' has this bit of Quakerism, and 'tis all the better for it : Ye bow to ghastly symbols, To cross and scourge and thorns; Ye seek his Syrian manger Who in the heart was born. For the dead Christ, not the living, Ye watch the empty grave, Whose life alone within you Has power to bless and save. 0 blind ones, outward groping The idle quest forego ; Who listens to his inward voice Alone of him shall know.
