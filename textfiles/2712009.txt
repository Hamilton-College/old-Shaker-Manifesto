Shakers, N. Y. Nov. 1897. As we read in the Nov. Manifesto the testimony of Aaron Wood, that dear Father in the New Creation, we thought of many of those blessed saints who have past on before and we askt; Are they still interested in us, their children, to help ns by their heavenly influence, giving strength to the weak and encouraging the faint-hearted? In the silence of our meditations the answer came; 'We are still with you and our influence is growing stronger as the years roll on.' When we read of what they suffered for the Truth's sake we are ashamed even to think of crying the burden of the Lord. As we see the portends of the coming upheavals in social and religious life we feel that strong souls are needed to meet those conditions with a courage befitting the times. The testimony of the new life is not dead neither doth it slumber, for like a mighty army with banners cometh those sainted souls from the summer land with love and power and their march is one of triumphant victory. In conjunction with our singing school Sunday afternoon, an effort is being made to establish a school for moral and intellectual development, on the lines of original thinking. A subject is announced at one meeting and essays are written or spoken upon that topic the succeeding Sunday; the object being to develop the latent powers of the young by providing that which is both interesting and instructive. Hope that success will crown the effort. Hamilton DeGraw.
