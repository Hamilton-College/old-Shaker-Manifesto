Dear Albert O. C. Hampton â€” You see, our friend speaks out pretty plainly concerning the present villainy of moneyed corporations and monopolies, but it is from a standpoint of experience in the practical chicanery by which government has been,is and will be more and more manipulated by and in the interest of these infernal institutions; for he was for eight years a member of the Oregon Legislature, much of the time entirely against his own will or inclination. However, I submit all to the judgment of the Ed. S. M. whether to publish this or a part of it, or none, as may seem best.
