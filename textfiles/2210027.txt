LET BYGONES BE BYGONES. Let bygones be bygones. Oh, try to forget: If one has e'er wronged thee, why cherish regret? Let the memory painful far from thee depart, Lot bygones be bygones, nor burden thy heart. Let bygones be bygones. If one gave a slight, Let it pass, as at morn pass the dreams of the night. The burden o'er heavy will grow, if eac'.i day You gather and garner each slight by the way. Let bygones be bygones. Why plait for thy brow The thorns of the Past in a crown for the Now? Go gather the roses that bloom by the way, They'll yield thorns sufficient for the crowns of to-day. Let bygones be bygones. No room's in thy heart, For this day with its joy and that with its smart, Fill up fullest measure at the joy wells to-day, Xor quaff at the founts that erst bittered thy way. If bygones be bygones thou nobly canst bear, Each day what it brings thee of sorrow or care, While the burden too weighty will grow for thy back, If the Past with the Present is borne in thy pack.
