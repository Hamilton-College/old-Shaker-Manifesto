Sabtaathday Lake, Me. Nov. 1897. Just now we are rejoicing over the safe arrival of our good Elder Wm. Dumont and Sister Aurelia Mace who have been visiting our kindred in the Granite State in company with Elder Henry Greene and Eldress Elizabeth Haskell of Alfred. Indeed we are glad to have them with us again. They brought many blessings oi love and encouragement to us, the greatest of these is Sister Ednah Fitts, who is kindly sent by the Society at East Canterbury as a teacher of music. We realize the sacrifice it must be to her and her people and also the great benefit to us. In her we find a true and faithful worker for Zion. One with whom we have pledged ourselves to be loyal. The young Brethren have been doing some ditching for the improvement of the farm, also ploughing and fencing, working faithfully during Elder William's absence, thus proving that their interests are truly centered in our consecrated home. 'In Union there is Strength.' This motto is true for when we are all at home together, even tho our numbers are small, we feel strong, and naught shall ever sever the bond of love which unites us. Br. Frank Stanton from Harvard is with us. We trust he will receive much good from his visit here, and may he return to his home and kind friends, renewed and encouraged to continue the work which he has so bravely commenced. We extend a loving greeting to all our gospel relation. Ada S. Cummings.
