REVERIE. Moore Mason. 'What do ye more than they.''1 Matt, v., 47. We are constantly informed that numerous inquiries are being made in regard to the life and principles of Believers, and much is said about the fields being 'white for the harvest.' Still, conscientious persons say,ï¿½Oh, they are not ready for it yet. Now the manifp:sto. 253 how are we to know when they will be ready, or if they ever will be, to share the good things contained in our Father's storehouse? And although the commandment says: 'Go ye into all the world,' may it not be wise for u.s in our detennination to perpetuate this gospel, to consider that earnest people to-day, in their thirst for advanced thought ask of us 'What do ye more than they?' and will not be satisfied unless we show that we follow Him who went about doing good. And is it not our doing that will demonstrate to the world that we have passed from death unto life and have become partakers of the divine nature? It is doing that the world needs, doing those things that exhibit the divinity within the soul; deeds of kindness, deeds of beneficence, deeds of self-sacrifice, deeds of heroic opposition to all forms of individual and organized wickedness. We want to make all feel anew and forcibly our earnest, determined warfare in opposition to wrong, and in favor of truth and righteousness ; and is it not time to be up and doing, dropping good seed at every opportunity. Only let us be sure that those seeds are the truths taught by Christ, and nothing else, so that in the spiritual upheaval we are passing through, when startled with the cry 'Lo here or lo &gt;there' we may always have the Teacher's injunction in our mind, 'What is that to thee, follow thou me;' and doubtless He who can temper the winds to the shorn lamb, will safely guide his followers, who 'walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.' Only the man who presses succeeds, No man becomes very religious wli) does not press himself often into unpleasant duties and engage in unpleasant service. The church that stands still dies, but the one that keeps on a heavy pressure is the oue that moves on and up to higher and better things, and it is the discipline and trials on the way that make the narrow path more shining and cause us to exclaim : 'Keep thou my feet, I do not ask to see the Distant scene; One step enough for me.' When we think of the vast numbers who love to gaze upon that weary walk from the manger to the cross, thosL' few years of such great sadness, how few we find who are willing to regulate their lives by the one test of motive, 'do good to all men ;' and thus show they have a claim on Him who aloue founded his empire on love, and who to this day millions would die for. What a happy change it would be if professors of theology would stop trying to regulate the kingdom of heaven with their purblind theories, and teach that all should give their hearts and souls to doing good and rendering justice to their fellow men; and while thus endeavoring to lead the Christ life here on earth, we may have a kingly march from earth to heaven.
