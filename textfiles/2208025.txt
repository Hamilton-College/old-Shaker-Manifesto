Sabbathday Lake, Me. July, 1892. 'He shall have pity on the poor and needy and the souls of the needy He shall save.' It is a comforting promise that God will have pity on the poor and needy and work in them for their salvation. By feeling the need we put forth an effort and therefore are saved. Thus, in 'seeking first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness' all our temporal blessings are added. While hundreds of people are seeking rest in the public resorts we are busy like the bee laying up a winter store. We have lately enjoyed a visit with Elder Josiah Barker and Sisters Anna Case and Isabella Graves of Watervliet, N. Y. They are like polished diamonds adorning the temple of God and we know there are many more like them from the same mine. Not long since Gen. Butler was at the Springs and came to see us. It was interesting to hear him tell of his adventures in the war and especially of his cleansing the streets of New Orleans and other reminiscences. Home duties are progressing as usual at this season. The Brethren are just commencing the haying with the anticipation of an abundant harvest. A. S. C.
