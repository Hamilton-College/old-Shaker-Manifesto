GREETING. Prudie A. Stickney. Loved friends of my youth, Ye are nearer and dearer As each day that passes, Brings joys that are new; In storm and in sunshine And life's busy conflict, The love that I bear you, Is loyal and true It is not a task, but A pleasure to write you The hearts inmost thoughts Of affection and love ; And each little missive Will bind us more closely With loved ones on earth, And with angels above. 'Tis sweet thus to ponder 'Mid shadows of twilight, When night hovers near With her balm of repose; The stars, looking down From their high home above us, Reveal not their mission As time onward goes. But, let us not faint Nor grow weary with toiling, The goal lies beyond, Our friends 'watch and wait;' With them we'll be gathered, And songs of rejoicing Will welcome us in At the 'Beautiful Gate.' West Gloucester, Me.
