NOT FAR. AGNES E. NEWTON. Not far from the soil of sin Though white thy robes to-day; Not far from the daiig'rous path Where the feet of many stray. Not far from Virtue's dwelling The snares of sin are set; And near the peaceful harbor Fierce tempests may be met. Not far from light the darkness Obscures the Christian's sky ; Not far from good the evil Is ever lurking nigh. Not far O Christian traveler The goal thou long hast sought; Not far the priceless treasure Which ne'er with gold is bought. Not far is Heaven's portal Its pearly gates ajar ; Near is thy home immortal Its glories not afar. Not far the song of triumph 1 The world I've overcome ; ' If thou wilt all surrender To-day, is vict'ry won. Not far the good nor evil The broad or narrow way; But near is strength and courage Our safety, watch and pray. Not far 0 Christ our Savior Be from each struggling soul; Thy cross shall be our refuge Thy law, our lives control. Canterbury, N. H.
