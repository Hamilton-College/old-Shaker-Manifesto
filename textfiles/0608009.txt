CENTENNIAL YEAR ELIZABETH H. WEBSTER For what shall this year, the centennial, be known, For what be emblazoned on high ? In the archives of history what laurels be shown, That never can wither nor die? What victory gained o'er oppression and wrong, And all that truth's river dams? What power to enable each heart to be strong, What triumph o'er shoddy and shams? For what shall this year, the centennial, be known, What record of progress be made? Wxhat noble deeds done like sweet flowers strewn, To mark this our greatest decade? Not honor nor riches, not science nor art, Though shining effulgently bright, Can make her page white if she still bears a part In any injustice or slight. Oh, deed the most worthy, if she could but give To all of her daughters so brave, The freedom her sons have, to be and to live, All true to the life which God gave; The treasure of freedom our forefathers won, With a goodly and blessed increase; A freedom for all, beneath its broad sun, Each sex and each nation in peace.
