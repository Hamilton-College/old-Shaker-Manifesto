SPRING. Mary Whitcher. As bursts forth spring our hearts expand With new and joyful feeling, And we for life make new demand And should new life be dealing. To take and give our balance just, Should stand for daily weighing, And nothing kind by others said Should outweigh our kind saying. Canterbury, 2f. H.
