Dear Brother; We send you the... Pleasant Hill, Ky. May 24, 1885. ])eae Brother ;- -We send you the amount of our subscription to the Manifesto, and as it is one of the means for the dissemination of the truth of the everlasting gospel, for the redemption of a lost world, as introduced and taught by Jesus Christ and our Mother Ann, and all their true followers, it has my hearty support and approbation. And although not much fruit doth yet appear, yet it is best to keep the leaven working until it may leaven the whole lump.- -Your Brother, Benj. B. Dunlavy.
