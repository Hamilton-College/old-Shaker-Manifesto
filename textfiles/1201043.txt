EVERY ONE PLEASED Some time since, Parson M—of Mass, (then a British colony,) being at Boston, bought him a wig, and returning home, wore it at church the next sabbath. As a wig of such a size and shape was quite a novelty in that obscure place, it gave offence to almost the whole congregation, who, both men and women, repaired the next day to their minister's house, and stated their complaint, the burden of which was, that the wig was one of the Boston notions, and had the look of fashion and pride. The good natured minister, thereupon, brought it forth, and bade them fashion it to their own liking. This task they set about in good earnest, and with the help of scissors, chopped off lock after lock, till at last they all declared themselves satisfied—save one,—who alleged that wearing a wig at all, was in his opinion, a breach of the commandment, which saith, 'Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth be- neath.' This last objector was soon silenced by convincing him that the wig in its present condition, did not resemble anything either above or below. Even so fares it with the characters that make it their aim to please everybody. Slashed on this side and on that, and twisted into every shape, and out of all shape, they finally come to the condition of his reverence's wig.—Brief Remarker.
