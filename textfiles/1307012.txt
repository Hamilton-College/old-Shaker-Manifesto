DO NOT 'HAVE THE BLUES' BELLE BUSH What if thy day be dark and drear, And cheerless seems the sky? Yield not thy soul to doubt ox fear, Heave not the bitter sigh. Though earth may wear her sablest hues, 'Twill naught avail to 'have the blues.' Though friends may prove unkind to you, And faithful ones depart, Still let thy course be up and on, Bear thou a fearless heart. But do not all the fates abuse— 'Twill naught avail to 'have the blues.' Be firm, be strong, thy purpose high, Stay not thy upward flight; True courage wears the strongest shield Amid the shades of night. Then wear not melancholy hues— We're weakest when we court 'the blues. Though fortune prove a 'fickle dame,' And wealth 'a fleeting show,' Still from the treasures of the mind The purest joys may flow. Then cast aside those sable hues— The brave will never seek 'the blues.' If thou wouldst win a deathless fame, Bear well thy weight of years. The priceless treasure of a name Was never bought with tears. Then cast aside those sombre hues— Toil on, and wait, but shun 'the blues.' If thou wouldst nobly live and die, Fear not the passing gale. Know thou that to the valiant soul There's no such word as fail. Then cast aside those sable hues, And bid farewell to all 'the blues.' Selected.
