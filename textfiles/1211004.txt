PRAYER GEORGE CLARK It seems to me that prayer has a very significant and deep meaning. It is not merely the uttering for a few moments several times a day a list of words learned by rote, for the sake of conforming to some outward rite or ceremony, or for apparent internal sanctih'cation, when in reality the thoughts and feelings of the heart are in au entirely different direction, thus impressing one with an outward sense of piety. This, to my mind, is hypocritical. True prayer is the soul's deep earnest yearning and desire to God for His holy spirit to enter into, and have constant access to the heart, that it may cleanse and purify it from all error even from impure thoughts, that His perfect truth may have an abiding place to illuminate the whole spiritual being. And the soul, like the gold, after it has passed through the refiner's fire, becoming purified, stands on the sea of glass in resplendant beauty an exact likeness of its Maker. True desires of the heart go out to our heavenly Father and Mother in our every day life, seeking for love and wisdom to cheer and guide us in all our motives and actions ; that we may live and act, not from the promptings of a selfish spirit, but to do good to all around us. and to feel kindly and affectionately toward humanity at large.
