MOUNT LEBANON. Lucy S. Bowers. Blest Holy Mount ! thy summits grandly rise Amid the circlings of the clear pure air; No warmer sunlight gilds God's earth so fair Than bathes thy slopes in daily glad surprise. Fruit, that no Tropic gift in worth outvies Richly the pendant branches freely bear Which all thy habitants in fulness share, In Christian harmony that never dies. Down come the rains upon thy harvest fields, Oft build the singing birds among the leaves, Peace, gentle peace its holy sweetness yields, And love amid it all its glory weaves. The gratitude and happiness each spirit feels Are praise, for this their home, which God receives. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
