Questions of church government is... The question of church government is, more than any other one question, that which divides, and will continue to divide the Christian world, until they all agree upon what was, the regimen of the early church. Any diocesan Episcopalian who desires to study into the early regimen will learn from the second and ninth book of Bingham's ' Antiquities, ' that episcopacy, in the present form existing, is very, very far removed from the early regimen. Departure from it is one, at least, of the chief causes of the present divisions. And so a return to it may hasten the day when all may be one, for which many hearts devoutly pray. R. R. Goudv.
