THEOLOGY: PRENTISSIANA Every age, every race, every nation, every individual, must have a Theology. It is an inherent right. The theology will accord with the mental expansion and the elevation from the animal — the earthy — to the Angelic — the Heavenly. As we climb the ascending grade, we make the sublime discovery that the universe, through every gradation, from the Cherubim — masculine — and SerapMm, — feminine — Angels of the most advanced heavens to which we can stretch our spiritual vision — all the way down through man, animal, vegetable, mineral — all proclaim the Holy Eternal Parentage — Father and Mother the vitalizing centers of all vitality . When, by indomitable, persevering selfdiscipline, we achieve full emancipation from all lower law influences, the Divine Afflatus from the Eternal throne thrills every fiber of our being — the morning stars sing together and the daughters and sons of God shout Amen ! Hallelujah ! No trait of character is more valuable than the possession of a good temper. Home can never be made happy without it. It is like flowers springing up in our pathway, reviving and cheering us. Kind words and looks are the outward demonstrations; patience and forbearance are the sentiments within.
