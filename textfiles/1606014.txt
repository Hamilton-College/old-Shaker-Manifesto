'THE TONGUE GUARD SOCIETY.' [Contributed by G. B. Avery. ] A NOVEL Society started in Hartford, Conn., a short time ago, has led to the formation of similar societies in many places ; the motto, and constitution given below show the aim of the society. If aught good thou canst not say, Of thy brother, foe or friend, Take thou then the silent way, Lest in word, thou shouldst offend. Article, 1. The name of this association shall be'' The Tongue Guard Society.' Art. 2. Any person may become a member of this society, by signing the constitution and conforming to to its rules. Art. 3. We, the undersigned, pledge ourselves to endeavor to speak no evil of any one. Art. 4. Should we, however, through carelessness, break our pledge, we agree for each and every offence to forfeit the sum of one cent. The money so forfeited to be placed in a box reserved for this purpose, and to be expended, semi-annually, for charitable objects. (For our Shaker Societies we would suggest, as a penalty, going to the person slandered, if accessible, and confess it; if not accessible, to the. Elders, and confess it.) Art. 5. We also agree to use our best endeavors to increase the membership of this society in our town, and, to assist in organizing societies in other places. Art. 6. It is, however, understood, that, when called upon (by proper authorities and from pure and good motives) to give our opinion of the character of another, it shall be done in truth, remembering in what we say, the scripture injunction, tk Do unto others as you would they should do unto you.
