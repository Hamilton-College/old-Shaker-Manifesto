NOTES. PREACHING and practicing are so very different from each other that it has become one of the wonders of the present day to find them conjoined. We have no end of religious speculations, brought out by the multiplied shades of biblical reading and then by the thousands of additional explanations. In our astute wisdom we have felt warranted in casting a sneer and even in indulging in a laugh at the expense of a class we call heathen, because of their long list of gods that preside over the public and private affairs of a semi-civilized nation. However, as laughing, is not, as a general thing, followed by any disasterous results the heathen can quietly worship as they may think best. Just now it may be well to confine our remarks to those who are denominated Christians and let the class who make no profession of religion as well as those whom we call anti-christians, rest till another time. A Christian, Webster says ;ï¿½is ' One who professes to believe in the religion of Christ; especially one whose inward and outward life is conformed to the doctrines of Christ.' This is a very clear and very acceptable definition of the term, and if made practical would insure a Kingdom of God upon the earth. It would afford the hundred fold of all earthly blessings and give us an assurance of the promise of Eternal Life. But as preaching has become an occupation through which one is expected to earn his daily bread, it is largely a matter of the brain, and men are awarded for their ability in rhetoric rather than for their goodness of heart. Every class of Christians preach and pray and it is one of the wonder working features of the religious world that so many shades of belief can be held forth, and these often becoming quite antagonistic, while at the same time they all claim to accept one book, a work of divine inspiration, from which they make their scholastic recitations. With this system of multiplied forms and ceremonies, it cannot be thought strange that even the Christian world has been called a babel, a confusion of tongues. The simplicity with which Jesus performed his ministrations, and the direct application of all his words to the daily life of the individual, establishes a foundation for righteousness upon which every one may build with confidence. This makes Christianity a work of the heart, the conforming of the inward and outward life to the doctrines of Christ and establishes it as the essential part of a Christian's duty. But as men are not usually paid a salary for the manifestation of their piety, the practical life of Christianity is allowed to become rusty and moth eaten, rendering it more or less unfit for presentation. Those who make a close comparison between the life of the Teacher and that of his disciples, at the present date, think it a subject of mirth, or of surprise as so little is found in the last that harmonizes with the first. To make, the preaching, however, of the first consequence, a cloak of excuses has been used to good advantage, and Christians like Free-thinkers and Infidels are not expected to walk uprightly, for the Scripture has expressly stated in speak-
