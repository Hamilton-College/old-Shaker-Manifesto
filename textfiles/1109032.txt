Preserving Cucumbers .â€” Cucumbers for pickles may be preserved as follows : When fresh gathered, wash them in cold water, then put them in a pail with salt, and let them stay 12 hours ; then put them into a tub or barrel of brine as strong as it can be made and some salt left at the bottom. After a time more salt should be added so that some is always left undissolved at the bottom. To pickle them, take them out of the brine, soak them over night in fresh cold water; then drain them, put them in a jar or bottle, with spice and red peppers, and pour hot vinegar over them, and seal them up at once. They will keep for years thus preserved.
