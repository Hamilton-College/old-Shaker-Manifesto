ADORATION. Lucy S. Bowers. I love, I deeply love, there is so much My earnest heart embraces, and each day Finds reason for true happiness. My mind Springs up exultant every time I think Of God's unfailing beauties, and my soul Rejoices in his love. Sometimes I think To count the glories o'er, and blessings full, And ever varying scenes before my eyes, But find no good beginning, for a round And round, a perfect circle do they fill. ï¿½ But be it first among my buoyant joys, The winter time, with all its gale and storm, And pearly snows and frosty air and chill; Its radiant blue and clear and matchless light, And glowing stars that gem the mighty sky; These usher in the merry mornings of The Glad New Year, the season when Old Time Seems to have reckoned up his full accounts And started out again. I often think Of blessings, which, meanwhile my soul protect And comfort, and my wants well satisfy, For which I render praise and thanks each day. I love the happy spring, and gleeful birds, And myriad blossoms of the hill and dale, Whose swaying censers perfume all the air. The stream, its verdant banks and pebbly bed, Whose varied coursing ends within the sea, The great deep sea, the crystal ocean, where Many millions have rendered up their souls, And laid their bodies down among the strange And countless wonders of its trackless vault. I love the wave, the foam, the bounded shore. I love the sunlight gleaming through the blue, And clouds that 'mid them sail, and all the gifts They give throughout the year. The dews, the stars&gt; The breezes that make glad the summer time. I love the daisied meadows and the lambs, The waving golden grain and tasseled corn, And all the mellow fruits of harvest time. How grand the thundering in the awful dark, The vivid flash, and rolls of ebon mist, And rainbows painted in the evening sky. Behold the mountain-tops and sylvan slopes, Fountains, canons, cataracts, rocky cliffs, indeed I cannot: tell it all, but well I love, Yea more, I fill with ecstasy, and pant Amid the palpitations of my heart, So awed am I, wondering how God could Have made them so. I love the happy soul Who walks and lives among these things, and loves Them too; Through them is known the great kind His handiwork, omnipotence and power. [God, And 'mong them all, most dearly truly loved Is my good home, sweet home, all circled round With these unfailing lovely gifts. If things External could the soul's eternal grace Insure, and give to life below and life Beyond, the joy and treasure it would gain, Then would our living be complete; no sound Of discord would there be, nor strife nor woe, So perfect would the concord be. But sad Enough, much evil born to multiply Has entered every human heart, and darkened With its clouds and graceless images The holy light, and robbed mortality Of bliss, its just and rightful heritage. I love the truth, the virtues every one, The heart most honest, true to consciousness of right; The brave, the noble, valiant in the cause That will elevate to heaven all the race. The ever gentle truly Christian spirit That each day gives out its gifts of gold In deeds and words well tried, and coined within The mint of faith, and scattered with kind care. I lore the wayward, erring, thankless, With a pitying love that harbors no ill-will, And fain would pardon those who do me wrong. I prize my counselors, companions, friends; The kiss that ministers sweet peace, and words That teach the holy way of righteousness. I daily pra}' that 'mong the many things That others love, they may love me, For I would win it by my toil, and strive To recompense it by my humble gains. I often pray for angel care, and kind Direction, and all that will redeem and Make me worthy of a privilege to live Upon God's earth, so glorious and great, So beautiful, so grand and truly good. Mt.
