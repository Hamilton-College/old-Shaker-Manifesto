Dear Sister Marcia; In the September number of the Manifesto... Shaker Village, N. II. Dear Sister Marcia ;In the September number of the Manifesto I found an article entitled 'The Voice of Age' which agreed so perfectly with my ideas of faith and gospel principle, that I wish to make mention of it to you, with my sincere thanks. Every sentence seems written as with a pen of fire never to be obliterated, and should be so deeply impressed in the heart of every church member, that a slothful selfish spirit can find no place in their abode. 34 THE MANIFESTO. I have thought it unwise to measure health and strength by age, if one should retain their youthful vigor at eighty years of age : why not enjoy the precious blessing of moving in active labor and not fearing any sad results therefrom? Longevity is becoming more universal with the people of our country, and is it not because the laws of life are more carefully regarded? I also endorse your sentiments concerning a want of energy to work for the things of the spirit as we advance in years, for unless we watch and pray we are liable to become dimsighted and lose a portion of our well-earned treasure, this would bring discouragement to others and a burden to the leaders of the flock, whom we should delight to aid and bless in every act of our lives by our faithful exertions and love in the cause of God.
