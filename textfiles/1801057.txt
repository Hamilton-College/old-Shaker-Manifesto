PREPARATION FOR DEATH When you lie down at night, compose your spirits as if you were not to wake till the heavens be no more; and when you awake in the morning, consider that new day as your last, and live accordingly. Surely that night cometh of which you will never see the morning, or that morning of which you will never see the night, but which of your mornings or nights will be such you know not. Let the mantle of worldly enjoyment hang loosely about you, that it may be easily dropped when death comes to carry you into another world. When the corn is forsaking the ground, it is ready for the sickle ; when the fruit is ripe, it falls off the tree easily. So when a Christian's heart is truly weaned from the world, he is prepared for death, and ii will be the more easy for him. A heart disengaged from the world is a heavenly one ; and then we are ready for heaven, when our heart is there before us. Selected
