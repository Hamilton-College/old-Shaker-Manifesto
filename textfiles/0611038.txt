GLORY BE TO GOD Elder TIMOTHY RANDLETT Enfield, N. H. Oh Glory be to God Most High, For in Thy majesty Thou dost reign triumphant in heaven, and o'er the earth. Glory be to Thy name evermore, Thou hast caused Thy light, in splendor bright, to shine on earth, â€” as in heaven, so on earth, so on earth.
