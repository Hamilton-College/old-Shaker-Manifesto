HOME-DRIVEN THOUGHTS Was Jesus a Saviour ? By obedience to the principles taught by Christianity, Jesus was saved from sin. If Jesus ever proves a Saviour to any others, it will only be by their obedience to the same life-guiding principles that crucified him unto a sinful world. It is the glory of Christianity, to show what it can do for humanity', not for divinity. Jesus was human, like ourselves, not divine, as too commonly believed. Christian principles elevated him above Judaism, to be what he was. What Christianity gloriously did for Jesus, it will, by our obedience, do for us. An individual, possessing every Christian virtue, excepting one, is like a golden chain with a missing link. Persons are not better, excepting in external appearance, because they are ingenious enough to hide their faults. Who so loves human souls, will not be deterred therefrom because they have faults; and this love is of very few words. There is no louder nor more effective preacher than example; let the people see as well as hear.
