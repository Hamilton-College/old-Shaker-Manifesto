MOTHER. CATHARINE ALLEN. Most tenderly my soul doth cherished keep The meaning of this blest endearing word; No eloquence the gifted tongue may speak Hath e'er the human heart so deeply stirred. The parent true�for little ones who cares� Whose faithful heart forgets no earthly need, But patiently all toils and trials bears, And in their weal alone seeks joy or meed, Can in that sphere but dimly symbolize The higher, purer gift of Motherhood, Which in my angel home I realize, And daily proves the source of lasting good. How few among the countless throngs of earth Have found a mother for their longing souls; Or of that consolation known the worth Which bideth ever where lier love controls. Unworthy though I am, 'tis mine to know Maternal care that meets my spirit's needs; And feel within my heart the hallowed glow Of love that from all earthliness is freed. And ye, O precious ones! who bear this love, Are unto me as saviors true and dear; Baptized of Christ, with unction from above, Ye guard the altar I would gather near. The altar whence that spark celestial came, That kindled in my heart faith's quenchless fire, Which will regenerate from sin and shame, And God-ward turn each feeling and desire. Whate'er has been my burden, pain or grief, The door of hope has opened unto me, Where I have found a healing and relief, And peace, that dwelleth with a conscience free. And who could e'er such tender mercy show, And patiently with all my trials bear, As ye, to whom confidingly I go, And from the truth no evil prompting spare ? Ah ! none but God's Anointed One, so blest, The Heavenly Comforter revealed on earth, The Mother true, on whom that love doth rest, Through which the soul may find angelic birth. This name with gratitude�of living greenAround my heart entwined shall ever be; And there affection's fadeless flowers be seen, With lilies fair of spotless purity. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
