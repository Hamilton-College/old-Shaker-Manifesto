VICE OF LYING. There is no crime against self and others comparable, for enormity and destructiveness, with insincerity and the several forms of lying. Without this element there would be little sin in the world. It was the first fruit of sin, and it is the seed by which evil is propagated. There are many ways of lying, and the least direct is the worst. Playing on words, or misleading, or taking refuge in a special meaning, is worse than a simple falsehood. It costs the mind more pains to practice deception cunningly than to lie openly. The lie that looks like 'prevarication' is therefore not less, but more heinous than others ; and yet parents make light of these offenses and call them 'romances.' Truth is the regenerator by which human nature is to be restored. Selected.
