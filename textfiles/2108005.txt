In Memory of our Sister LYDIA WHITNEY Fannie G. Casey. One by one the dear ones Are taken from our side, And carried gently over The dark and rolling tide. They are not gone forever, Our loving friends so dear, But oft are present with us, To comfort, bless and cBeer. They only go before us To reap what they have sown; Remembering God is justice, He'll ne'er forget his own. O kind and faithful Sister; As we look on you to-day, And view that form so silent, Of cold and mortal clay, We ask in earnest accents, Is this to be the end Of all thy honest toiling? And will not God commend? Ah nay! we know thou livest, And in that world so bright, Thou'lt meet with all the dear ones And walk the streets of light. And God will there reward you With garments pure and white, A crown of brightest glory, With jewels sparkling bright. Thy toils and cares are over, On earth, no more we meet, But in that land of spirits, God grant we all may meet. Alfred, Me.
