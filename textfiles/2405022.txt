White Water, O. -North Family. April, 1894. The last number of The Manifesto is with us. The reading matter is interesting and instructive, especially the article from Pittsfield entitled, 'The Shaker's Belief.' We have been remodeling our laundry recently; the building that it is in was badly out of repair, so we were obliged t &gt; tear the entire end out from top to bottom and build anew. The building is two stories with a basement and the amount of old brick that had to be cleaned before they could be used in the new wall was immense ; but happily that is a thing of the past, and it will not be many days before the house will be as good as new. The weather has been so changeable that we are not up with our spring work as we would like to be. To-day April 6, is very chilly with indications of snow. Had a very cold season two weeks ago that killed almost all our fruit. The thermometer was down to 18 deg. below freezing on the morning of March 28. We were blest by having the Ministry with us for a few days. Had the opportunity of listening to one of Elder Oliver's excellent sermons last Sabbath day, week. We have had several cases of La Grippe, nothing more serious. ,/. O. Tyler.
