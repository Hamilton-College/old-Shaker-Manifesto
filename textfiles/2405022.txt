Reed. the leafless trees, and the verdureless earth, we feel a trustful reverence and exclaim with Browning, 'God's in his Heaven All's well with the world.' Indeed the Creator has given mankind a home 'beautiful for situation,' and when man's God-given faculties are used in unison with the Divine will, we shall find that,� 'This world is full of beauty As other worlds above And if we did our duty, It might be full of love.' The silence of the saw and hatchet, and the stir of the gardener and farmer, tell of duties done in season, and when we consider the promptness which characterizes our home life, year after year, we rejoice that our 'lines have fallen' where it is recognized that 'Order is Heaven's first law.' Our little people were quite surprised when reading the March Home Notes, that any one could suppose that a school vacation for them meant mischief, when there are so many pleasant and profitable things to learn and practice at home. The month's vacation is not half long enough for all they plan to do. The mountain stream is none the less beautiful, that its leaping, bubbling waters are converted into a useful power; neither is the healthy, happy activity of childhood disturbed by winning it to useful and pleasant employment. True education alternates the exercise of the mind with that of the body, and only when brain power can be put to practical use, is it of service in the march of life. Truly Elder Oliver in his last Notes has given us a beautiful description of those who have attained to the beatific state of the 'kingdom of heaven within.' Such a travel of soul is worth striving for, where self is forgotten, and all our efforts are concentrated to make the world better by our passing through it. Amelia J. Calve?'. 116 THE MANIFESTO. Center Family. April, 1894. We are having some blustering weather for April, the few warm days of March made us all feel that spring had come to stay, but April proves to be the 'true March.' The health of our family is quite good at the present, very few colds. Our aged Sister Ehoda Blake, is in good health for one so far along in years. She is still able to do much for herself. Brother Alonzo Hollister is better in health than he has been for a year past. Our Brethren are doing some grafting of both apple and plum trees, also cutting off the black knot which has become very troublesome; We have a few early chickens but the cold weather is very disagreeable to the little downy things. If the bad weather continues our chances for early vegetables will be small indeed. If it does not kill the fruit buds they will be saved through a special act of Providence. Our Sisters have not begun 'housecleaning' yet, so our Brethren will not have any trouble in dodging a 'Woman's weapon' in the hands of some energetic housekeeper. E. M. Sears. Canaan, N. Y. April, 1894. Some time has elapsed since we were represented in Home Notes. Nevertheless time has worn steadily on and with the feathered creation, we are constrained to sing of the glories of the advancing spring. Of March we can make no just complaint, as his roaring, piercing blasts, generally sweeping with unrestrained vigor through our domains seemed somewhat tamer than usual. He gave us a lively visit only now and then, bringing sufficient force to blow away all noxious gases, accumulations from the remains of decaying vegetation which might have proved detrimental to our well being if not dispersed. Thus through this advantage by careful discipline in dietetic habits, and by an observance of hygienic laws which pertain to the development of a good spiritual as well as physical condition, we are pleased to say that the health of the family in general has been maintained. If the cheerful attractions of our Canaan home have proved inefficient to draw to us people of more mature years, we are not destined at present to fall short of numbers as there are continual applications for the admission of children into our Order. Some, no doubt, are necessitated through the conditions of the prevailing hard times and others through an expressed desire to have them disciplined by higher and purer forces than those operating in the world at large. Under such circumstances within the past three months we have taken seven children ranging from three to thirteen years of age, and our only desire is that Sis they advance in years they may, through faithfulness, honor their privilege and become the 'glory of heaven and flowers of Paradise.' School for the season closed March 30, having been in session sixteen weeks. Our teacher is worthy of much credit, having devoted her time and strength freely to the interests of her pupils who number fourteen of various grades. Through her untiring zeal she has kept her scholars lively and active and now for a short season they will turn their attention to a different form of education in an industrial school. Angelina Brown. �Watervliet, N. Y. Second. Family. Apr. 1894. With spring, Mother earth is awakening into life and activity and while we are preparing the ground for planting that we may realize a harvest for the sustenance of the natural body, to our mind it seems quite essential that we also prepare the spiritual soil of our soul, that we may plant and reap a harvest of spiritual food to sustain the spiritual and immortal part THE MANIFESTO. 117 of our being. We are pleased with the efforts of our Brethren and Sisters everywhere who are daily striving to further the gospel work, and our hearts' best feelings go out to the faithful few who are now engaged in spreading the gospel in California. Our Sister Cornelia R. Powers and her son of San Diego have been earnestly engaged in this work for several years past. They have been very desirous ofjjestablishing a Community of Believers in that land, and it looks as if the time has come to have their prajers answered. In a letter from Sister Cornelia dated Nov. 26, 1888, she says, 'I have so often thought that it would be one of God's highest blessings if we could have one of your Communities here where for so much less hard labor you could have much better returns, and there are so many young people who are in need of such instructions as they would receive from you.' And from that time on, she has continued to strive for the conversion of souls to the Shaker faith and principles, we have sent her Believers' publications and The Manifesto, and she has been faithful to distribute them. We hope for Bro. Dowe and Sister Cornelia much success in their missionary work, and if we can not do much at present for them, we can at least pray for and encourage them in their efforts for good. There is one thing sure, nothing is gained without a sacrifice, and blessed are they who are willing to work for humanity's good by giving up all for Christ's sake and the gospel. May all Zion's inhabitants awaken to the needs of the hour for certainly 'the harvest is great and the laborers are few.' Let not our lamps go out for want of oil, which is the testimony of eternal truth against the evils, that would lower the standard and drag us back into the vortex of worldliness and sin. Let Zion offer a universal prayer, that the Pentecostal Spirit may again descend and baptize us with fire and the Holy Ghost. Let us pray in faith, for it is written, 'Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened unto you.' Let us persistently knock at the gates of heaven, until they are opened, by confessing a^id forsaking our wrongs and walking in newness of life, that we may obtain the resurrection power of God;� 'Awake, arise, O Zion, No longer sleep nor slumber, For the Lord Almighty Is passing through the earth. He will sound his holy trumpet 'Twill sound from pole to pole, And gather many people To Zion's peaceful fold. Isaac Anstatt. North Family. April. 1894. Our daily life should be that which enables us at times to pause and consider the momentous question,�What are we living for? We hope that it is not to have the 'mark of the beast' placed upon us by serving self so supremely that we forget our duty to our fellow creatures. Br. Alonzo's definition seems on reflection correct; though we had not thought to consider it in that light. Br. Arthur W. Dowe's suggestion shows a desire to help the poor and oppressed; but would need great judgment in directing it. We fully agree with Elder Oliver that, first this should be a home for the soul, a place for those who are tired, not merely of the external conditions of human life, but weary of the lusts of the flesh and the mind, are willing to obey the injunction fully to 'come out from among them that ye be not partakers of their sins.' Those who are willing to obey this spiritual command are welcome to all of the temporal blessings. The month of March was exceptionally fine. Very few stormy days. At present writing, April 1, it is delightful spring, which makes one anxious to be delving in the soil. But we will probably have all we want before the season is over, and be ready to exclaim for very weariness in the labor of subduing weeds. But we will try to gather some of the inspiration ministered to us in our Church 118 THE MANIFESTO. service to-day when the congregation sang the result of the Grippe which visited us 'Conquering Legions.' We will he one factor that goes to make up that mighty host. Hamilton DvGraw. Shaker Station, Conn. South Family. April 1894. Farming began in earnest in April. We are putting in some soiling crops for our milch cows. These need a variety of feed, and respond to such care in a pleasant manner. The farmer ought to study the conditions that will bring success to his business. At the present time there is more scientific knowledge applied to farming than ever before, and good harvests show the results. We sowed rye last fall to be cut and fed in the barn as early as possible. Oats and peas are the second dainty dish as soon as pastures begin to fail a little. There is a great deal of albuminoid in peas. Corn fodder, oats and peas, fall feed then barley sowed early in July. May the cows furnish us with plenty of milk. We are sowing twelve acres of oats and peas some for early feed, green, some for hay and some to ripen to be threshed for grain which will save buying nitrogenous feed. The haulms of the peas are equal to good timothy hay if cut with dry corn fodder. We have sowed some early garden seeds, and wait in hopes of a taste of the good things there. We were just getting ready to sow oats when last night a heavy snow storm set in and is still with us. Having had April in March, March comes in under the name of April. This will no doubt retard our farming. The fruit trees are neatly trimmed and now patiently await the spray pump. Spring work of housecleaning is rapidly advancing. The blessing of health is desirable in our little circle just now. Our good Elder is confined to the house with slow fever of the typhoid type accompanied with malaria, in January. We hope he will soon recover and be in usual health again, as the spring days are coming we trust, to renew strength and vigor. Maria Withani. Church Family. April, 1894. 'Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven'�true possessions that will not wear away; they are abiding and they supply happiness in time and in eternity. Would we lay up lasting treasures? Let us begin now. This is the harvest time. Let us use it to do deeds of goodness, righteousness, purity, truthfulness, which shall bless, not only ourselves, but others. It is well to have faith in God, but He is not going to overcome our inward foes, that is our work. Are we in our duty? Virtue speaks the same pure, refining language to all. The true and virtuous are childlike, angelic, and Christ said, 'Of such is the kingdom of heaven.' Let us exemplify in daily life that which is pure and true. Remove the blot of sin's dark stain, Then truth and virtue will remain. 'The most curious village in the world is situated on Saginaw Bay, an arm of Lake Huron. It is without a name, has a population of about five hundred, and consists of modern huts on wheels to the number of one hundred and fifty, which, when the fishing season arrives, are rolled on the ice in the bay.' 'The largest lighthouse in the world is that near Havre, France.' 'The first cast-iron bridge in the world was erected over the Severn at Coalbrookdale, Eng. in the year 1779.' ******* Great improvement in thorough-bred poultry has been made in the last few years. It is possible to combine all the excellencies in one breed in a moderate degree, so as to have good layers and a fair weight of body. The Plymouth Kocks are an illustration of the best that can be accomplished in this way. Daniel Orcutt. Enfield, N. H. April, 1894. 'Sijbing-time and robins have come.' The season is about a month earlier than usual, and unless the spring is cold and backward, there is prospect of an early harvest. The maple harvest is finished, and we have had about five hundred gallons of syrup from our two orchards. Our contract for corn-planters is about completed, and we have orders for twenty-five extra machines. The next large job of work is a yard full of lumber to be sawn and stacked. In our Saturday evening service, many of us were surprised by the announcement of Elder Abraham's resignation from the Eldership of the Church. It was also announced that, of choice, he would spend the remainder of his days at the Society in Canterbury. To many who have been blest with his care and ministration since childhood, the change seems but one degree short of a visit from the 'Angel Reaper.' However, we find a great source of consolation in the fact that he is still spared to us; and though we may not be blessed by the benediction of his presence, still we feel assured that his love and interest for the people in this part of the Lord's vineyard will never wane. He leaves us loved by those who know him; respected by acquaintances, and honored by all. We know that he goes among those who in years gone by have been cared for and loved by him, and we feel assured that his declining years will be spent in the peacefulness and quietude his long term of service so well merits. Our service on the 8th inst. was an ovation of love and kind remembrance, botli old and young presenting many tributes of love and respect. Elder William Wilson succeeds Elder Abraham as first Elder in the Church. Sister Julia Russell, who is first in charge at our Infirmary, met with an accident a few days since, by falling and breaking her wrist. We hope for a speedy recovery for her. G. II. Kirkley. North Family. April, 1894. In attending Easter service with our Church kindred, the many recitations bearing on the subject of the bodily ascension of Jesus, brought to mind the text, 'Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness.' Qualities of nature achieved by doing good works that resurrect from the soil of sin into an atmosphere of active goodness,�these unite souls to Christ and to their fellow beings by principles of holiness, and become to awakened souls as the voice of the risen Christ, asking for greater activity and for 'patient continuance in the way of well doing.' Since writing our last Notes heralding the news of excellent health, almost every member in the family has been stricken with a hard cold and in some cases quite sevei'ely hit. If a vegetarian diet will aid in fortifying the physical structure against colds as well as against other distressing afflictions which flesh is heir to, would it not be well to heed the injunction, Be temperate in all things? and thus help to bring about the full resurrection of our being from all things that bring disease to mind, soul and body. Our sugar harvest is small compared with former years. We tapped but five hundred trees, preferring not to hire extra help. May we all, like the budding foliage and the merry summer birds, be filled with renewed life unto God, and sing songs of praise to both divine and human powers of good. George II. Baxter. Alfred., Me. April, 1894. Since writing a month ago of the early spring, we have had plenty of winter. Today we are having a severe snow storm which seems like first of March instead of April. After such changeable weather we shall gladly welcome the warm pleasant days of spring. We have a great deal to 119 120 THE MANIFESTO. cause thankfulness. Little or no sickness has visited our Society this winter, while in this neighborhood 'La Grippe' and Pneumonia have made their unwelcome call and death has claimed many victims. We feel to exclaim with the Psalmist 'Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks; for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare.' Brethren have begun spring work on the farm, and Sisters are ready with brush and broom for putting the house in order. Thus all find employment, and with cheerful hearts and willing hands we toil on together. Fannie Casey. Sabbathday Lake, Me. Apr., 1894. 'O friends whose hearts still keep theirpriuie Whose bright example 'warms and cheers, Ye teach us how to smile at Time, And set to music all his years!' As time seems to glide along so quickly it is good to be able to smile as we are striving to set to music all the years, by following in the footsteps of those whose lives have been pure and bright. Another month has gone and springtime is now really upon us, although the weather does not appear much like spring, for it is snowing and the wind wails mournfully without. Still we know that the brighter days will soon come, when all around us will be clothed with beauty. As I am writing I hear children's voices singing;� 'Beautiful Brethren and Sisters too Loving companions so faithful and true.' and I am reminded of the treasure and blessing which we enjoy in our gospel ki ndred. The patient mothers; the kind and true fathers; the hundredfold relation! With in our home are four aged ones who have seen more than fourscore years, namely,� Br. Samuel Kendrick, Br. Thomas Noyes, Sr. Mary Jane Jones, Sr. Lydia Mariner. These are with us, of the many who have gone before. Precious ones, while you linger may you know that you are loved, even as your love and care have been extended to us. For our aged ones we often sing the promise which is particularly theirs;� 'In my Father's house are mansions For the faithful and the true Fear ye not, beloved children, I've prepared a place for you.' We all send love to the Editor and those who assist on The Manifesto. Ada S. Curnmings. Pleasant Hill, Ky. April, 1894. Beloved Elder Henry:�Please accept thanks for the books; we shall read and endeavor to profit thereby. We had a disastrous frost which destroyed our early vegetables, oats, and the fruit, except strawberries and raspberries. The wheat is uninjured, corn and potatoes also unhurt. We had peas almost ready to blossom, but we are glad it is no worse. On Feb. 12, we had a wind storm which blew down fences and tore a portion of the tin roof from the Office, but we were fortunate to escape with so small a loss. Accept with this our best love and our repeated thanks for your kindness. James W- Shelton. Watervliet, Ohio. April, 1894. We have been having very nice weather through the month of March, and had some potatoes, peas and onions planted; also set out some fruit trees, one thousand raspberry bushes, five hundred blackberries and other fruits. Had a very hard freeze the latter part of March which was disastrous to fruit and oats. Have put in about forty-five acres of the latter. We have built about one hundred rods of picket fence and will put out probably one hundred rods of hedge fence. Our young fruit trees are all doing well. We were blest with the company of Elder Joseph Slingerland on the 29th ult. Health of Society good. Henry W. Fredrick. White Water, O. -North Family. April, 1894. The last number of The Manifesto is with us. The reading matter is interesting and instructive, especially the article from Pittsfield entitled, 'The Shaker's Belief.' We have been remodeling our laundry recently; the building that it is in was badly out of repair, so we were obliged t &gt; tear the entire end out from top to bottom and build anew. The building is two stories with a basement and the amount of old brick that had to be cleaned before they could be used in the new wall was immense ; but happily that is a thing of the past, and it will not be many days before the house will be as good as new. The weather has been so changeable that we are not up with our spring work as we would like to be. To-day April 6, is very chilly with indications of snow. Had a very cold season two weeks ago that killed almost all our fruit. The thermometer was down to 18 deg. below freezing on the morning of March 28. We were blest by having the Ministry with us for a few days. Had the opportunity of listening to one of Elder Oliver's excellent sermons last Sabbath day, week. We have had several cases of La Grippe, nothing more serious. ,/. O. Tyler.
