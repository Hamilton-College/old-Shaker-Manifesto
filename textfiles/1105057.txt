A Cure for the Epizooty .â€”As this disease is becoming quite prevalent in many parts of the country, remedies are in order. An old veterinary surgeon of the United States army furnishes the following as a sure cure for the epizooty : ' Take one pound of gum assaf cetida, mix it with one gallon of boil ing water; stir the mixture constantly until the assaf oetida is all dissolved. Let the mixture cool Strain and give the horse half a pint every three hours. This will relieve the horse inside of twelve hours, and give a good appetite.'
