FASHION. MARTHA J. ANDERSON. Fashion sways the world ; her dictates are absolute, and her whims imperious. The worshipers at. the ancient shrines of heathen deities, were not half so numerous as the devotees who compass her altars. Her image is in every household, aud in the througing thoroughfare her name is flaunted to your sight. ''Great is Diana of the Ephesians !' was the cry of old; so we may repeat. Mighty is this sovereign goddess of the people ! No matter what her hideous transformation from crown to heel, she is the same beauteous creature, sent by Jove, to fascinate and afflict mankind. All the nymphs of earth, air and water, combine to lend some novel charm to her changeful being. Unsightly shapes dame Nature never wore ; ludicrous bumps, aod abnormal compressions, that distort the human form divine ; and all that fancy's vagaries can invent, are forced upon her votaries, and they, her willing or unwilling slaves are fast bound in the thralldom her service imposes. Is there no power that can rise in the name of common sense and justice, to dethrone this tyrant, and proclaim mankind free to live, to dress and act, according to the demands of their own conscience and reason ? Men and women should be noble in mind, perfect in form and upright io spirit; not mere apes or illusory phantoms of life. A sound mind in a sound body cannot be attained, so long as the people allow themselves to become mere manikins in the hands of the fashionable mantua-makers aud tailors of the world. If men aud women who love truth and righteousness, and hate the hollow shams of society, had the moral courage to rise superior to their surroundings, and live for health and comfort; practically and earnestly bearing their testimony against the evils and follies of fashion ; soon would the vain goddess turn her face, abashed, and retire in ignominy and disgrace, acknowledging that she had ruled the world too long.
