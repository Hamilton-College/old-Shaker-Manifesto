The Loretto Order The Loretto Order. Bv Eleanor M. Parker, in Donahue's. Self sacrifice so heroic must necessarily bear abundant fruit, and today throughout the great West the Society counts many noble institutions. Historic Loretto Academy at Florisant, Mo., which this year celebrated its golden jubilee, lias sent forth many distinguisht pupils; like- wise the school of the same name in St. Louis. In the city of Denver is St. Mary's Academy and, crowning Loretto Heights in the suburbs of the same city, is the superb new Loretto Academy, built of red granite. Houses have also been establisht at Las (Ji-uces, Soeorro and Bernalillo, N. M.; Pueblo, Col.; El Paso, Texas, and many other points. The school at Bernalillo is a government contract school for the education of Indians. This institution was recently made prominent by Morgan's infamous attack. By impartial judges this school is conceded to have done much toward civilizing the Indians. The most interesting of the Kentucky branches are Betnlehem Academy in Hardin County and Mt. St. Benedict's, Louisville. On the grounds of the latter stands a small building known as the Â¦'Bishop's House,' in which Archbishop Spalding wrote the greater number of his valuable works.
