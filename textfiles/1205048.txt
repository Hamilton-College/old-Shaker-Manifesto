Dust Baths for Poultry Cleanliness is important in fowl-houses, for experience shows that poultry are unfavorably affected by the emanations from filthy quarters; and, besides, working in places where roosts and floors are covered with the droppings is decidedly unpleasant. Dry earth, in the form of powder scattered everywhere, will absorb the bad odors, giving a wholesome atmosphere to the hen-house, and at the same time preserve the manure in the least offensive condition. Besides these purposes, a box of dry earth should be in a convenieut corner of every fowl-house for the fowls to roll in. Dust from the highway is most convenient. Replace the same by an equal quantity of good gravel, and the public will be the gainer. Live Stock Journal.
