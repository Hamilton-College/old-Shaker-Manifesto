What's in a name? The pious Cincinnati Enquirer, and the evangelzed Democrat, are holding up their dious heads in holy horror at Col. Inersoll, as an ' infidel.' History inbrms us that Thomas Jefferson, the aulor of the Declaration of Indepenence, and father of the democratic Darty, was an infidel. John Adams, a igner of the Declaration of Indepenence, was an infidel. Benj. Frankfin, a signer of the Declaration of Indepenlence, was an infidel. Thomas Paine, one of the most distinguished of the revolutionary patriots, was an infidel. And Jefferson says, in his 'Notes on Virginia,' that even Washington himself was an infidel. In fact, a very considerable number of the leading and wisest politicians of to-day are infidels. Common Sense
