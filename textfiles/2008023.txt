Enfield, Conn. The season is fruitful materially, and we hope spiritually, in a substantial soul travel Godward. Contentment is our lot, and thankfulness to God for all his goodness. Warm weather has come in earnest, the nights have been cold until the past two weeks. Strawberries have been very abundant, we have secured nearly seven hundred quarts from a plot 3x7 rods. Early pease thirty-fivo bushels from a plot 4x15 rods. The Champions are just corning on now to pick. The early pea-vines are cleared off and cucumbers phmted. In June from twenty cows 'without grain' we made S720 spaces of cream, divided by 6 gives the lbs. of butterï¿½who heads this? Haying inactive progress. Our new implements enable us to put in our hay at the rate of twenty tons per day; we feel confident that with a little more experience we can put in thirty tons a day. Potatoes give an unusual promise, if we con judge by the growth of the vines. Abundant blessings are showered upon us. Would that many more of earth's inhabitants might be awakened by the power of conviction, and the fire of divine truth so as to be the happy sharers in the bounties of our Heavenly Parents. M. Witham. We should try to make the best of everything, and not be cast down by frequent trials and burdens. A beautiful rule to govern our lives is to look only on the bright sidi.' of life. Many of life's sorrows are just as dark as we make them, and no darker. A good way is to do no more than we can do well. It is the best work that pays best in the end. Weeds rob us of the results of our work and the fertilizer we have used to help the crop that we want, and farming is a struggle against them. We must not weary in well doing, but keep courage to fight them to the end. Plant food costs too much to let it go to waste. Spare the weeds and spoil the crop. Our field of ten acres of cabbage looks well, and there will be some cabbage to sell. The Rubicon carrot is well worthy of cultivation. Our Eureka mower, with six feet cutter bar, does good work. Coal ashes sifted in the hen-house makes a good disinfectant, keeping down the odors and making the house easy to clean. Dust is fatal to lice. Rather than bear it they oftentimes move out. Fowls should have all the water they want to drink during the summer months. Is it necessary to say, put in the shade? D. Orcutt.
