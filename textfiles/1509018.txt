BUSRO, NO. 5. SAMUEL S. MC CLELLAND. In 1822, two brethren came from Pleasant Hill, Samuel Harris and James Voris and from South Union, Robert Johns, to assist us in finishing the new dwelling. The family arranged to move into the building on the 23rd of May and Elder Archibald read the rules and regulations that were to be observed. It was not uncommon at this date for the Brethren and Sisters to pass from Busro to Union Village, in a carriage or in the saddle. The distance is 300 miles and the trip occupied from eight to eighteen days. In 1825 we had a cold and open winter. The spring and early summer were very favorable but a drouth commenced about the first of July and continued till the first of September. This proved very injurious to the crops, especially to the fifty six acres of corn. The death rate this year was large and the unhealthiness of the place began to be more and more a matter of discussion. The country was but sparsely settled, and the low lands could not be sufficiently drained, so that as warm weather approached the at- mosphere was charged with malaria. Those who were delicate in health or overtaxed by physical exertion soon fell victims to the scourge, and were taken from us, much to our sorrow. In 1826 John Dunlavy and Samuel McClelland made a visit to Pleasant Hill, Ky., on the 19th. of January, arriving at that place at ten o'clock in the evening. Samuel returned on the 27th of April but John remained in Kentucky till the third of June. Thirty or more persons were sick with the fever in the spring and before the year closed nearly every member of the Society had been under the physician's care. On the 8th of Sept., Br. John Dunlavy was taken sick and confined to the house only eight days, as he passed away on the 16th. He was able to walk about the house till the last day. Several of the leaders of the Society made a visit to Union Village in the month of Oct., and on the 19th. of Nov., the Society was informed that the Ministry, Elders and Trustees in the communities of Ohio and Kentucky thought it to be for the best that the people should move from Busro and leave the place forever. Small parties were made ready and sent to South Union, Pleasant Hill or to Union Village. On the 25th. the great removal took place, but the journey was comparatively light as the roads were so much better and the conveyances more convenient. It required much care and wisdom to be able to arrange for those that remained for the present at the old homestead. All the property of the Society was passed into the charge of the Trustees of Union Village and Pleasant Hill as officers in order before them. Several parties had already gone to the Societies in Kentucky and Ohio since the opening of the new year and were finding good and beautiful homes in these several localities. On the 10th. of Mar., four wagons that had arrived from South Union, returned to that place with twenty eight persons. For two or three weeks the making of boxes and the packing of plunder, (baggage) kept all hands very busily employed, and all minds filled with anxiety. The trustees of Pleasant Hill had agreed with the officers of the steamboatï¿½Lawrence, to take us and our baggage on their return trip. The boat arrived on the afternoon of the 19th. when the sailors began to tumble the property into the boat, with but little care so that we were put to much inconvenience as it was to be unloaded at several places. At thirty five minutes past five P. M. we pushed off from McCarter's landing and bid adieu to all our hard earned possessions on Busro prairie. The boat stopped at Vincennes during the night. Many of the citizens who had been acquainted with us, seemed sorry for our departure and sought to entertain us with instrumental and vocal music, and many good wishes for our welfare. To many of us it was a sleepless night, and a season of solemn meditation. At three o'clock the next morning the boat left the landing. We made a stop at Harmony for about an hour and then soon reached the Ohio river. We sailed all night and passed Evansville at daybreak and landed at Yellow Banks at one o'clock, P. M. Here we unloaded the property belonging to those who went to South Union, and left it in care of Samuel McClelland and Washington Rice. These Brethren then proceeeded on foot to their home where they arrived safely on the 26th. Our boat sailed along easily and pleasantly up the Ohio and arrived at Shipping Port at 6 P. M. and remained there through the night. We soon learned that the steamboat could not pass over the falls. Two Brethren 'rom Pleasant Hill came on board today 24th. much to our surprise and pleasure. We are now, the 25th. spending the Sab&gt;ath, and are visited by a great number of )eople. from Louisville Ky., and Shipping 3ort Ky., who look with astonishment at the observance of a Sabbath on board a steam)oat. On the 26th. we left the boat, and all of our goods were unloaded and conveyed above the falls. Those that were going to Union Village lad their goods shipped on board of the teamer, Decatur, which would stop at Cininnati. Those for Pleasant Hill were put n board a keel boat and this was lashed to lie side of the steamer. By this move we were forced to another degree of separation. We had bid adieu to the dear friends who had passed on to South Union and soon must take our last farewell of this company bound for Pleasant Hill. At night we reached Louisville and remained in port till the next morning. The engine was in motion quite early on the 27th* We had a high wind and rough sailing but arrived at the mouth of the Kentucky river at 7 P. M. The distance between the boats prevented the expression of many good wishes for each others welfare, so that one of the Brethren acted as the speaker in the ceremonies of adieu. The keelboat was unlashed and fastened to the shore during the night. The next morning it pushed off into the Kentucky river, and the sailors were now obliged to use their oars and poles as they had lost the aid of the steam engine. The progress, however, was necessarily slow. Several of the Brethren and Sisters were suffering from severe colds and were quite unfitted for such a long and laborious journey. This company arrived at Pleasant Hill on the 9th of April where they found many friends. After a few days of rest they were all pleasantly settled in their new homes. The steamer moved along very pleasantly for awhile, but as ill luck would have it, the steamboat Atlanta carelessly stove into our wheel house. That we were all very much frightened, might well be expected, but we soon learned that the accident was not very serious. Some hard words and strong speeches were freely used by the officers and sailors of both companies. The boats separated, the fright passed away and we once more moved safely along. Mar. 28th. at the mouth of the Big Miami river, Elder Archibald and several others landed at Lawrenceburg. We then passed on to Cincinnati where we were met by friends from Union Village, who had prepared carriages for our special conveyance to their and our home. As we were to remain in the city over night, we gladly retired early ; we so much needed the quiet rest. At eleven o'clock on the 29th. the whole company moved off and having reached the village of Reading we made a halt for the night. Early the next morning the company were again moving along and arrived safely at Union Village where our friends uniformly bid us welcome and treated us with all the kindness our hearts could wish. We spent several days in resting and in visiting from house to house, when we were conducted to our respective homes, where we expect to dwell for the remainder of our uncertain lives.
