The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for May�sustains the advance that is conspicuous in the first number of the year, new and living features being given the prominent places in its columns. The first character in this current issue is one that just now is a centre of public interest�Paderewski the pianist, who is 'done in black and white' from a personal interview, with two admirable portraits. 'Spain' is described and illustrated in the very interesting series of 'Race Studies,' by Dr. Oswald. A gentleman of some. prominence in Chicago, Mr. Chalkley Hambleton, is sketched among the phrenological worthies. Prof. Nelson Sizer discusses the Ministry in his series on Human Pursuits and illustrates it happily. Governor Matthews, of Indiana, is written up by one who evidently knows him. Those who are really interested in domestic life and true social development will read 'Let Them Alone' and 'The Doctrine of Paternal Authority,' both articles by well known writers. In the Health section good advice is given with respect to the prevention of cholera and what to do in poison emergencies. A brief note on the use of Hypnotism will attract attention, as it gives a double view of the subject. The variety of notes relating to Anthropology is unusually considerable and the same can be . said of the Editorial departments, the latter containing another installment, the thirteenth of the valuable series of papers on moral education. The price of the Journal is 15c. a number or $1.50 a year. Address Fowler &amp; Wells Co., 27 East Twenty-first St., New York.
