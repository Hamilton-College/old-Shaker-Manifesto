EXPULSION OF FLIES We copy the following from the London Garden. Have any of our readers witnessed similar results ? The Rev. George Meares Drought, writing from Ireland to the Times, says : ' For three years I have lived in a town, and during that time my sittingroom has been free from flies, three or four only walking about my breakfast-table, while all my neighbors' rooms were crowded. I often congratulated myself on my escape, but never knew the reason of it until two days ago. I then had occasion to move my goods to another house, while I remained on for two days longer. Among other things removed were two boxes of Geraniums and Calceolarias, which stood in my window, the windows being always open to the full extent, top and bottom. The boxes were not gone halfan-hour before my room was as full of flies as those around me. This, to me, is a new discovery, and perhaps it may serve to encourage others in that which is always a source of pleasure, and which now proves also to be a source of comfort, viz., window gardening.'
