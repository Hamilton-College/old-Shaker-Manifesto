To-day To-day.—What is the happiest period of human life ? I am sure there is only one answer. It is now. If I am doing my duty, to-day is the best day I ever had. Yesterday had a happiness of its own, and up to this morning it was the best day of all. I would not, however, live it over again. I string it, as a new bead, on the chaplet of praise, and turn to the better work and the higher thoughts of the present time. Of all the many daysof life, give me to-day. This should be our feeling always, from the cra- dle to the hour when we are called to come up higher. Childhood is best for children, manhood is best for man, and old age for the silver-haired. We will all join in a chorus of commmon thanksgiving to God, and when asked ' Which is the happiest period ? ' will say , childhood, manhood, and old age alike, ' Oh, Father, it is now ! '—Brethren's A dvoeate.
