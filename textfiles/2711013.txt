Shaker Station, Conn. North Family Oct. 1897 Once more we greet you dear readers of The Manifesto with love and goodwill to all. At present we are enjoying the presence and ministration of our dearly loved Ministry. We have also been iavored with a visit from Sisters Marcia Bullard and Charlotte Tremper of the Harvard Community, who brought much love from gospel friends. Elder Henry Blinn from East Canterbury, N. H. spent a few hours with us, and we hope an occurence of the same pleasant nature will not be far in the future. Elder Joseph Slingerland from Union Village, Ohio also made a short call, and last but not leMount Lebanon Levi Shaw of Mt. Lebanon, tarried with us over night. Now blessed it is to be united to the pure in heart, whose lives are consecrated to God; who maintain a clean separation from the spirit and elements of the world, for such is the life and testimony of the gospel of Christ. Our Brethren are employed in perform- ing the duties encumbent upon them at this season of the year; some are harvesting the fruit of which we have an ample supply, while others are preparing the soil and sowing crops for another year. With this comes the comforting thought, that the ha nils that toil are consecrated to God's service. Edith E. Shufelt.
