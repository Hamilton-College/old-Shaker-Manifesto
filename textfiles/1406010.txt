RESPONSIBILITY. MARY WHITCHER. What Seers, what Saviors and what Gods 'Tis needful we should be ! And yet we arc but merest worms To act in such degree. God grant humility of heart,� Best armor of defence ; That better we may act our part Removed from arrogance. Our motives must decide our case In part, but not the whole ;� Unless we've studied for our race Creation of each soul� We'll say no more, but think anew On this consistent plan, While least and most that we can do, Is, ' do the best we can. ' Canterbury, N. H.
