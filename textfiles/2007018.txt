TRIFLES. Jessie Evans. 'How particular you are ! that is only a trifle,' was the closing remark of a thoughtless youth, in. answer to a gentle reminder that she had carelessly repeated a message, misstating the time and thus causing an hour's delay in the appointment of a very important conference. A trifle !�so it was in the common acceptance of the term, and the tiny words pass flippantly from lip to lip. Let us pause a moment and define the term. A trifle may be considered one of the unequal parts into which life indirectly may be divided. As the seashore is but an accumulation of grains, so life is a vast multitude of trifles. A slight exaggeration in conversation is but a trifling matter, an unkind word is easily uttered, yet the effect is by no means slight, for 'in the Divine Economy nothing is lost.' The tongue which 'cannot be tamed' in the minutiae of life is unfit for the service of God. The value of seeming trifles rests with the Creator of time ; our duty is to improve them as though each were the last. The contribution of a tiny coral polyp is but a speck beneath the deep waters. Slowly, yet surely, the additions are made, until the beautiful atolls and reefs, the wonder of the southern seas, rise to view. So it is in our experiences. Life is but the multiplication of one moment and character, the accumulation of good or evil to which the moments give birth. How often we read and sorrow over the railway aee'eit i.ts and fir.'S which occasion so fearful a loss of life and property. We enquire the cause. A lighted match incautiously thrown down, or one person away from his post of duty, we are told. Mere trifles in themselves,� yet hundreds of lives pass from our midst in consequence. Applicable and true are the words of St. James, 'Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth.' 'The whole is equal to the sum of all its parts,' is an axiom well proved. The individual who is true in the trifles of life, is true in the ultimate, and 'he who is unfaithful in the least is unfaithful also in much.' Canterbury, N. H.
