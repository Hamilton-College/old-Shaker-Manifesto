SEASONABLE ADVICE. Don't let the door stand open, But shut it with much care, Without a bang, without a whang, Yes, shut it fair and square ; Without a slam, without a jam Without a slat or jerk. For if you've left it open, Go shut it, do not shirk. No Christian man or woman, No well trained chick or child, Will let a door swing idly, To make weak nerves run wild, When chilly winds are blowing� And some one taking cold� While the open door is creaking And muttering like a scold. Haste makes but waste, Remember, so plenty take of time; Don't leave the door half open� A fault almost a crime� And if you've ever done this, Don't do so any more : Whatever else you fail to do, Don't fail to Shut the Door. Good Housekeeping.
