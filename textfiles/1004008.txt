OPEN LETTER Lizzie Morton. Why, my dear sister, Mrs. Harter, What'n the world can you be ' arter ? ' Putting us Shakers so above you And all your neighbors who so love you ! But true it is, the life-partaker Must first become an honest Shaker. Now let me tell you, my dear madam, That when God made the first old Adam, THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 83 He had in view the second man To introduce the better plan, The spiritual to substitute, And raise mankind above the brute. By leaving off the old profession, In this you'll find is true progression ; But keeping still the counterpart, To love in spirit and in heart; But having animals outgrown, We let the animal alone, And live in truth, Christ's higher life — Still love the woman, but hate the wife — Still love the man — the husband hate, Conditions us the higher state. Below, the counterpart to find, We guess and guess, then ' go it blind ;' And then what must we women say ? ' In all things 1 will thee obey.'1 Thus take our counterpart on trust — Become a slave to lordly lust — To come and go as he may choose — To wash his feet or tie his shoes. We cannot be among the ris'n, But soul and body both are his'n — Thus ' fixed to one peculiar spot We only propagate and rot.' With all our pledges, vows, and loves, We can't rise higher than the doves ; And all delights we fondly cherish How very, very soon they perish ! Your inferential reasoning's good For all who want that kind of food — A little nest, and a little love-y —¦ A little egg and a little dove-y — And vine and bud, and breeze and blossom. Are on the line of pig and possum — Thus live and die and know no better Than to be enchained in nature's fetter. But we in the celestial city Look down on such with earnest pity. Now, sister Harter, I'm not sportin' Of me, I'll tol'rate no such courtin' Not while my name is South Union, Ky., Feb. 23, 1880.
