Keep the pores of the skin open by frequent and thorough bathing... Keep the pores of the skin open by frequent and thorough bathing; and see that the bowels are regular and active. Good health is impossible with a disordered stomach, and if the effete matter of the system is not daily disposed of in the natural way, it is hrown into the blood, thus poisoning the entire system. And this is far from being conducive to social purity. Avoid idleness, ease and luxury as you would a rattle-snake. Take exercise, and plenty of it, in the open air, and keep the mind so full of good and noble thoughts that there will be no room for impure ones. Christian Thought.
