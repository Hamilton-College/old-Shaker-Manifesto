Sanitary. A BATH! A BATH! Private cleanliness is a matter of public interest. Wherever dirt and filth are suffered to accumulate, there the enemies of human health are gathered together, and plague and pestilence hold carnival. Nor does it matter whether the dirt consists of an exposure to decaying matter on the surface of the ground, or of an unwholesome or undrained pool, or whether it is distributed in unwashed parcels over the surface or in the pores of the human body. In the latter case it is rather more dangerous, since a thoroughly clean person may escape all injury from contagion, whereas a system not fortified by cleanliness is doubly liable to the attacks of disease. The majority of mankind, both in the city or country, are imperfectly washed. We know there are a great many who do not get a bath once a month, and we fear there are some who have never been thoroughly immersed. The consequences are found in a predisposition to disease. The unwashed skin is incapable of discharging its natural and healthy functions, and the stoppage or interrupted action of the deep pores in the skin, which throw so vast an amount of the waste of the system, develops and fosters every morbid tendency. This danger to health may not be palpable at first, but with each growing neglect of the means of cleanliness it becomes greater, until it is no longer possible to ward off the attacks of disease. The human family is large, but we have never heard that the supply of water is deficient for their wants. Indeed, nature seems to have taken special pains to distribute the health-giving fluid widely. Not satisfied with piercing every portion of the earth's crust with innumerable rivers and smaller streams of fresh water with a lavish hand over every continent and island she has poured forth her superflux in oceans, ready salted to keep them sweet, until the quantity of water on the surface of the planet largely exceeds that of the land. But the bountiful mother goes still farther, and pours down on our ungrateful heads profuse showers, as if to teach us those laws of health which we are too stolid to learn for ourselves. We are forced to realize that pure water with its cleansing, refreshing nature accepts no substitute�many of the ailments of frail mortals now so often aggravated and prolonged in the vain endeavor to find relief in some mysterious and perhaps poisonous drug, would have a better cure in water alone� and, in almost every case of sickness the judicious use of the bath would add very much to the nower of other remedies�but in sickness or in health every one should have ample means of bathing�and as good practicable baths at low figures are now advertised in many leading journals, there is no excuse. Every Family Should Have Its Bath. ' In Health, Invaluable�In Sickness, Indispensable.' Ann Arbor Courier Print. Keep the pores of the skin open by frequent and thorough bathing... Keep the pores of the skin open by frequent and thorough bathing; and see that the bowels are regular and active. Good health is impossible with a disordered stomach, and if the effete matter of the system is not daily disposed of in the natural way, it is hrown into the blood, thus poisoning the entire system. And this is far from being conducive to social purity. Avoid idleness, ease and luxury as you would a rattle-snake. Take exercise, and plenty of it, in the open air, and keep the mind so full of good and noble thoughts that there will be no room for impure ones. Christian Thought.
