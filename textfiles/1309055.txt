Deaths Isaac Augur Isaac Augur on the 19th of July, at Hancock, Mass. Age 67 yrs. 2 mo. and 21 days. We take a few notes from an article in the Pittsfield Daily Evening Journal. The venerable, Elder Isaac Augur, died after an illness of a few weeks, having suffered a paralytic shock, from which he did not recover consciousness. He was for many years a prominent member in the community. He came to Berkshire when a lad of four years, and knew no other home or life than the simple ways of the Shakers. He was appointed to the office of an Elder quite early in life, and was considered one of the clearest headed men in the councils of the sect and one whose conclusions were reached only after mature deliberation. He was also, for many years a Trustee of the United Society of Shakers, a position which he held at the time of his death. He was an excellent farmer and was an enthusiast on some of his specialities. He was well informed of the matters of the day, and an extensive reader. He was a kindly man, a perfect gentleman, everywhere, and an entertaining companion and conversationalist. His funeral was quietly conducted at the Church family, after the custom of the sect. Elder Isaac's death will be learned with regret by many outside * of his own belief, who knew him well.
