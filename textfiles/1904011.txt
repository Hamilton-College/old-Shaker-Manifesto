Extract of a Letter to a Friend by Sister MARY WHITCHER. Mine is a long experience in what we term the Higher life or in other words, the Order of Grace. The Order of Nature is God's order, and whoever chooses to walk therein, feeling no higher call, may be justified according to their uprightness in that Order. But if the light of Higher life Should break upon the mind, And this we love, in Tain the strife For peace on earth to find; We're like the bird that's fledged for flight Mount up, we must and will, For how can we with wing and might Remain as nestlings still. Canterbury, N. H.
