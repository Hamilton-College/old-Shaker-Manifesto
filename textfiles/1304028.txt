NOTES. Every person who puts his conscience Every person who puts his conscience and heart, honestly to work for good receives invisible aid, and none ought to claim and appropriate it to himself. I received the spirit and faith from the founders of the Institution ; but it is a two edged sword and cuts back as well as forward, and is as binding on me as on you. It is written. 'They shall flock to your windows, like doves ;' but there must be some cooing inside of the windows or the doves will not come in. We must not forget that we had to be cooed in. I find no difficulty in showing to persons that tribulation dire has to be endured in raising natural children, but they think that spiritual children should be begotten, born and reared without any trouble at all! Well the spiritual being the most important we should calculate on more trouble, more pain and suffering than in the natural order. Many think if we forego the pleasure of the natural man and woman, then we should enjoy eveiy thing else in the world. Foolish virgins ! who seem not to know that we are not called to see how much we can enjoy for our redemption, and that of the world, but to see how much we are willing to suffer for them. Elder H. L. Eads. Last year we gave all our attention to Last year we gave all our attention to putting things into good shape for the sisterhood. It :s the sisters who make the homo, and they need the wherewith to do it effectually. The Dutch farmers first build a log house for the family and then bu good barn for the farm. The barn is the leading feature until he is able to build a frame house. N. E. settlers put up a great frame house first and paint it white, and then follow, in good time, barns and sheds. Believers by reason of numbers must have large dwellings immediately afterwards improvements on the farm are in order. Elder F. W. Evans.
