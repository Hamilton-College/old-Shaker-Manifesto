Truth Dear Children :—In God, our Heavenly Father and Mother, are embodied the living principles of all truth. If you love God, and desire to express your love, live in the element of truth — speak the truth, act the truth. Adopt as the motto of every day's life: ' / will speak the truth at all times, and under all circumstances.' You will meet with circumstances that will tempt you to stray from this path of duty, and which promise more pleasant inducements. Beware of the tempter, stand firm by }rour motto ! The real heroes upon our earth, who have striven in the past, and who are now zealously striving to elevate the race, have ever scorned to speak or act an untruth. Learn to be heroic, and you need never fear any harm when clothed with the armor of truth. God will bless, if you will be truthful. The spirits of love and purity will journey with you daily, and writh pleasure; and your spiritual fathers and mothers will own you and admire you if you resolve to stand upon the ground of truth. Endeavor to rise in love with truth, and then the kingdom of heaven will not be far off—you will be in a condition to enjoy life; or, preparing for death, you will find peace and happiness with Christ, in those mansions, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
