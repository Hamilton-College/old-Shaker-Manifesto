One of the most touching incidents in English history... One of the most touching incidents in English history is connected with these words. 'Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Charles I., died as a prisoner in Carlsbrook Castle, Isle of Wight. When the people made Cromwell protector, after beheading King Charles, she was put in prison in sight of the barred window where her father had been held. The little princess only read her Bible and gazed out of the window, day after day. A month after she had been brought to Carlsbrook, her attendants entered her room and found her Jying dead upon her bed. Her pale face lay upon an open book. It was her Bible, and it was open at this sweet text: 'Come unto Me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Geneva M. Martin.
