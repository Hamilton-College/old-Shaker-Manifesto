Shaker Station, Conn. South ITainily-. Spring has arrived once more, bringing duties which faithfully performed give a present satisfaction and happiness to be constantly enjoyed. The more perfect the plans of action carried on by united and harmonious effort for the good of all, so much greater their attainment in loftiest virtue, and their exemplification of godlike principles and spirit. The Creator has filled the material world with analogies, which make an irresistible ap- peal to the attentive observer; every ob ject having the power to suggest ideas in. calculably more important than anything belonging to itself: 'God diffused through every part, God himself triumphant in every heart.' Spring has apparently come to stay, and we expect to commence farming this week. A little gardening has been done in this vicinity. Our firewood is about all housed and we are now thinking of the summer work. We have done a good deal of repairing this winter, and are now fitting up a large shed for grain in an out lot. Spring cleaning is rapidly advancing. But while laboring to be faithful in temporal things, we feel the need of so laboring that temporalities may be subordinated and truly related to the spiritual life. Our meetings are often scenes of spiritual satisfaction, where an abundant flowing of divine love and power may be experienced. It may not be out of place to mention the good ministration enjoyed by us on the occasion of good Elder Abraham and Br. Franklin's visit with us a short time ago. The health of our family, good and of the Society generally. M. W.
