CHRIST'S MESSAGES While musing on that wondrous love, Leading the Savior from above, Yearning o'er man in sin's abyss, Giving e'en life, to save from this ; A form stood near, whose garment bright Seemed woven as of holy light; Saying in tender tones, and sweet, 'Would ye follow the Master's feet?' 'If His disciple ye would be, And would from sin thy soul set free, Ponder the words the Master spake, Who follows me, his cross must take. 'Seek ye to enter at the gate? The way is narrow, plain, and straight Which leadeth to eternal life, But few who seek, endure the strife. 'Secure not treasures upon earth, Lest moth and rust corrupt their worth; Let heavenly riches be your care,— The heart is where its treasures are. 'Freely my gifts ye have received, Freely give ye to those who need; The cup of water in my name, Shall its reward of blessing claim. 'Keep pure thy heart and clean thy hands, Keep, if ye love me, my commands; When heavy-laden and oppressed, Come unto me, I'll give you rest. 'Suffer the little ones to come, The Father's love hath ample room; x\nd in my kingdom ye must be Like babes, in spotless purity. And lest ye in temptation stray, . I bid you always watch and pray; For, willing tho' the spirit be, Thy strength is weakness—trust in me. 'Let not your heart sore troubled be Believe in God,—believe in me. My Father's house hath mansions fair, That where I am ye may be there.' Then stretching forth a wounded hand, 'Whither thou goest by sea or land, My peace be with thee to control The raging conflicts of thy soul.' Folding his robe of dazzling light, The glorious form was lost to sight, Though as by evening breezes borne Came echoing words, the sweetest known:— 'I will not leave you comfortless, For often shall my presence bless. Continue steadfast in my love, And thus my loyal servant prove.' As deepening shadows gathered round, My spirit knew a peace profound, And joyfully the truth confessed—¦ Jesus himself had been my guest! Enfield, N. H.
