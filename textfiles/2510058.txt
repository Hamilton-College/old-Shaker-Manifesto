Popular Monthly Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly for Oct. is an exceptionally beautiful number pictorially, without any sacrifice of that quality of timeliness which makes it unique amongst illustrated magazines. The opening article is an idyllic description, by Mrs. Leicester-Addis, of a summer holiday visit to old England's loveliest county, Surrey, with a description of the stately manor of Deepdene, upon which the present American Duchess of Marlborough has spent large sums of money to a good purpose. Apropos of this year's tercentennial Tasso celebration, there is a sympathetic and elaborately illustrated paper on 'The Last Days of Torquato Tasso,' by Marie Walsh. Another Italian contribution of rare artistic interest is Miss. E. C. Vansittart's description of Monte Oliveto Maggiore, to which are appended some 'Souvenirs of Siena,' by the late John Addington Symonds. Other picturesque features are; 'Women as Athletes,'' byW.de Wagstafle; 'Burmese Women,' by H. Fielding; 'Light-Givers,' by Mary Titcomb; 'Town and Cloth Halls of Flanders,' by Alexander Ansted: 'Widowed Sovereigns,' by A Oakey Hall; and 'Alpine Soldiers,' by Henry Tyrrell. This number also contains some unusually interesting short stories and poems.
