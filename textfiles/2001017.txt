NOTES ABOUT HOME Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Nov. 1889 Beloved Elder Abraham :â€”I have been engaged with three hands to assist, in trimming one thousand apple trees. Quite a job you will say. I got pretty tired so that I did not walk or write very straight. We have one orchard of five hundred trees, and one of fifty trees finished. I have come to the conclusion after fifty years experience in trimming trees, that the best time is as soon as the tree has been harvested of its fi-uit. Then the whole system of roots is set to work to prepare buds for the next year's crop. No time nor energy is wasted and the wounds will heal with nothing put on them, better than at any other season. I can show when trimming has been done at different times, and the wounds show for themselves. They vary from a nice, clean wound, healing kindly, to a black, poisonous wound and the black running down the limb, unsightly. Of course the state of the tree has its effect, whether it be stagnant or thrifty. F. W. E.
