Cosmopolitan A complete and immediate revolution of the transportation methods, involving a reduction of freight charges on grain from the West to New 'York of from 50 to 60 per cent, is what is predicted in theNovember Cosmopolitan. The plan proposes using light and inexpensive corrugated iron cylinders, hung on a slight rail supported on poles from a cross-arm the whole system involving an expense of not more than fifteen hundred dollars a mile for construction. The rolling stock is equally simple and comparatively inexpensive. Continuous lines of cylinders, moving with no interval to speak of, would carry more grain in a day than a quadruple track railway. This would constitute a sort of grain-pipe line. The Cosmopolitan also points out the probable abolition of street-cars before the coming horseless carriage, which can be operated by a boy on asphalt pavements at a total expense for labor, oil and interest, of not more thai one dollar a day.
