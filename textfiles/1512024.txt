SANITARY THE SICK-ROOM How to manage a sick-room so that it shall be as wholesome, as comfortable and as cheerful as the possibility of the case admits, is a study which will probably never receive the attention it merits until the ' art of nursing' shall be fully recognized as forming a legitimate and important branch of the art of healing. Xo error of management in a sick-room is so common as a neglect of proper temperature and ventilation; yet upon these very subjects physiologists have written more pages, and physicians spent more breath, than upon all kindred topics put together. Of course no inflexible rule can be formulated upon these points. An open window may be salvation to a man in the burning stage of a fever; at the same time it is fatal to one in the sweating stage. With all due regard for the thermometer, good sense and enlightened and careful observation should regulate these essential conditions. Every one admits the necessity of keeping the air of a sick-room as pure as possible, yet how seldom, except in cases of contagion, do we see disinfectants about a sick-bed. Chloride of lime and carbolic acid are cheap and effective and something of the kind should always be used wherever fresh air cannot be freely admitted. There should always be a towel-rack in the 100m, or just outside, where moistened cloths can be quickly dried. Cloths wet in pure water even give out an unpleasant odor if left lying in a heap to mold or dry as they best can. Keep one stand or table for food or drinks and another for medicines. A clean newspaper often renewed makes a better eovering for such tables than a cloth. Have a basin of water always at hand, that whenever a spoon or wineglass is used, it can be rinsed immediately and ready for use. Guard against irritating noise, creaking doors, chairs or shoes, also against too much light and cross lights. Holes in window-shades and gaps in shutters are often first-class nuisanees. Many an invalid is tortured by a single point of piercing light, which seems, like a faithful eye, to pursue him everywhere, and to which in spite of himself he is ever returning. A little daily change in the arrangement of furniture, a little planning for such pleasant surprises as an invalid can bear, in the way �f food, company and amusement, will often be more effectual in hastening the convalescence of a patient than all the tonics that have been used in the building up of infirm humanity since the days of Esculapius. A soft tread, a mild, persuasive word, a magnetic hand, a tact�or shall we say a genius?�for detecting the interior aspects �f disease, are invaluable adjuncts of good nursing. Clatter of firearms, rattle of dishes and newspapers, loud talking and whispering, are about equally abominable. Growing plants are usually interdicted in a sick room, but cut flowers are great brighten ers of its somberness. Tribune and Farmer. HE WANTED TO 'TAPER OFF.' A CLERGYMAN called upon a well known physician one day and said : *' Doctor, I wish to consult you about my health ; I am afflicted with very uncomfortable symptoms ; my hands tremble and shake, my eyelids twitch and quiver, and my lips are without sensation. as if they were numb, Isn't it a serious matter? Am I not in danger of paralysis?' ' It is, indeed, a serious matter, ' replied the physician, who knew his patient, 'but you can be cured entirely if you will follow my advice ; but I am afraid you will not be willing to take my prescription. ' 'Iceitainly will, doctor; try me; what is it?' 'It is simply to give up the use of tobacco entirely and forever. That is the whole cause of your trouble.' ' Aren't you rather hard on me, doctor? I own up, I both chew and smoke when I am diggiug out a sermon, and I need to. I couldn't write well without it. If I should give it up my people would see ilie difference at once. ' ' Excuse me, but do you really mean to say that you, a minister called of God to preach the way of salvation to lost sinners, must depend upon a filthy weed for your inspiration ? What kind of a call is that?' '� I will give up tobacco if I must, doctor, but you will allow me to taper off gradually, won't you? I am afraid it will injure my health to give it up all at once.' '� ' Taper off! ' it would soon be tapering on again. I never knew of a man who turned from a wrong way to a right way too quickly. My dear sir, if I were a repentant horse thief and had come to you for spiritual help, would you tell me I might ' taper off ' and stop stealing horses and only steal pigs and chickens and smaller things, un'il finally I should reform altogether? &gt;�*o, you would not preach any such nonsense. You would tell me to leave off stealing entirely, once for all. ' �; If, after I had given it up fur a week or two, a terrible hankering and craving should come over me. what could I do ?' 'Go down on your knees and pray for divine help until you get it.' ��Well, doctor, I think I must stop using tobacco, but I will wait until I go to the Adirondacks in the summer. I can attend to it better then than now. ' 'Like Felix, you would put off this important matter 'till a more convenient season. I warn you, sir, that you cannot trifle with your health in this way without serious consequences. It must be attended to immediately or I cannot answer for the result. ' The patient finally concluded to follow the physician's counsel fully, and the gain in health :-ind vitality proved the wisdom of the course.�Mary Winchester, in the Christian Home.
