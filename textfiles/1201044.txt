ANGELS' VISITS Robert Collyer says that Angels' visits are neither few nor far between, and tells how the death of his mother, who was far away, was told to him abont the time of its occurrence. 'Men laugh,' he says, 'and say that we live in a prosy, railroad world, in which the telegraph outflies the old-fashioned angel. But it is not true that angels don't care for usâ€”it's we who do not look for them after they have come to visit us. All the angel that we care to look for is a Michael Angelo angel. But all common human agencies are touched with angelic power, while we are like children, who breathe on the window pane and shut the beautiful landscape out behind a dull cloud. The angels are all about us, though, and they ascend and descend upon humanity. Bad as any man may be, he has angels to minister to him. And when a bad man sinks down and down, and will not listen to the sweeter voices of ascending angels, then come the terrible shapes of descending angels, that do save him in the end.' Golden Era.
