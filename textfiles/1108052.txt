In a time of profound peace... In a time of profound peace, and with an army of only 25,000 men, yet our government paid last year $41,000,000 for military expenses, besides $6,500,000 for Indian expenses, $15,800,000 for naval expenses and $50,200,000 for pensions. War and all its incidents are very expensive. What a jubilee it will be when men learn war no more.
