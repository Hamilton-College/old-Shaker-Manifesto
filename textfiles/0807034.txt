A method of coating wood... A method of coating wood with a varnish as hard as ; stone has been recently introduced ; the ingredients are: forty parts of chalk, forty of resin and four of linseed oil, to be melted together in an iron pot. One part of native oxide of copper and one of sulphuric acid are then to be added, after which the composition is ready for use. It is applied hot to the wood with a brush, in the same way as paint, and as before observed, becomes exceedingly hard on drying.
