The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 24. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Re-written by Henry C. Blinn. Mother Ann and the Elders arrested and tried before a court of Justices. The board of justices met in the church at Richmond. It consisted of Samuel Brown, J. WoodbrMge and James Gates. These judges were to try Mother Ann and her little company upon the charge of blasphemy and disorderly conduct. Many evidences were produced against them, and readily heard, but few witnesses that were brought forward in their defense could scarcely obtain a hearing. The riotous and abusive conduct of the mob, which created the disorder, was by a strange perversion of coincidences, charged upon the Believers. This was a manifestation of the spirit that governed this court. To prove the charge of blasphemy, it was testified that Samuel Fitch had declared that, '' In Mother Ann dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily.' Samuel replied in his own defense, 'We read in the Scriptures that the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in our Lord Jesus Christ bodily,' and said he, 'Except Christ be in you, ye are reprobates.' The inference was at once perceived by the judges who found themselves unable to proceed with the charge, which must, in the issue, prove themselves reprobates. Samuel then took the liberty to warn the judges as follows ; 'Take heed what you do to this Christian people, for they are God's annointed ones, whom he hath sent to America.' This admonition was highly offensive to the judges, and they privately consulted what they should do with these Shakers. It was admitted that they appeared conscientious and acted upon religious principles, yet they deluded the people, and disturbed the inhabitants of the town, and they must be taken care of, or they would turn the world upside down. After a long deliberation it was decided that Mother Ann and the Elders should be fined the sum of twenty dollars as disturbers of the peace, and then leave the state. The money was immediately advanced by the Brethren, so that they might be set at liberty ; but as to leaving the state, they chose to obey God rather than man, and accordingly continued their labors among the people. Samuel and Dyer Fitch and Elizar Goodrich, being inhabitants of the town, were required to give bonds for their good behavior and for their appearance in the county court in Barrington. These Brethren, however, insisted that they had not trespassed, but had a right to worship God in their own homes, without molestation. They could not consent to give bonds, as they might be charged by their adversaries, with breaking the peace whenever they attempted to worship God. They were therefore, committed to Barriugton jail, to be tried by the county court. Mother Ann and the Elders moved on to Hancock, and remained over the Sabbath with Nathan Groodrich. The assembly that came to the worship on the Sabbath was so large, that they were obliged to hold their religious services in three several places. The gospel was preached by the Elders and others and the meetings were attended with manifestations of the holy Spirit. Some persons were present who ' breathed out threatenings,' but it fortunately ended wholly in words. Mother Ann and the Elders now arranged to make a visit to the Brethren who had been committed to prison in Barrington. On reaching the place of their confinement they made this salutation, 'We have come to see Christ in prison.' The Elders remained two days, and ministered comfort to their Brethren in bonds, and then passed on to West Stockbridge, to the residence of Elijah Slosson. The whole family had accepted the faith of Believers, and at this time were very solicitous that the Elders should call and see them. They reached the place on Saturday and remained over the Sabbath. On this last day a religious service was held and a large body of Believers attended. These came from New Lebanon and Hancock and other places. Many not of the faith were also in attendance, and listened attentively to the services. On this day not less than two hundred persons were provided with food by Elijah's family, so that the Believers said, ' The Lord blessed the family of Elijah, and all that pertained unto him.' More than one hundred horses were turned into a field of seven acres and the grass was entirely eaten away. Elijah for this free will offering was made the jest of the neighbors who laughed at him, and then asked, ' What will you do now, after the Shakers' horses have eaten up all your pasture ?'ï¿½ 'Trust in God,' replied Elijah, and this trust brought the blessing to his family. His field was not, in the least, injured, and his prosperity was more abundant. The Believers were always made welcome to share in his hospitality, and if any poor per-on came to his door, he was never sent away without some aid in food or clothing. Od the next Sabbath the Elders were at the house of Nathan Goodrich and held a public service. A large company of Believers were present, and at the same time several men who were disturbers of the peace. The Elders spoke to this unruly class with an authority which they regarded, and falling into confusion among themselves, they drove off' without creating any marked disturbance. During the time that Mother Ann and the Elders continued in Richmond and Hancock, they were visited by many Believers, who were fed and nourished by the power and gifts of God, from their gospel Parents. A large share of the time was spent in religious service and some one expressed it in these words, ' We could hardly distinguish the days of the week, as every one seemed like the Sabbath.' While this company was rejoicing in the powe' of the resurrection, the spirit of opposition was not asleep. The preaching of the testimony of Jesus Christ produced a disturbance in the kingdom of darkness, and the sons of Belial were determined to redouble their efforts and drive the Believers out of the place by violence. A mob collected on Friday, and came on like drunken madmen. Arriving at the house, they cried out, ' Bring out those Europeans.' Mother Ann and the Elders were now ordered to leave the place, and this was accompanied with threats and abusive language. The Elders had arranged to go from the place the next day, and so informed the mob. Some reckless characters proposed to use violence, while others objected. This difference of opinion created confusion in their company, and the majority insisted that no violence should be used. The mob then dispersed and the Believers enjoyed the night in peace.
