HOW TO BREAK OFF BAD HABITS Understand the reason, and all the reasons, why the habit is injurious. Study the subject until there is no lingering doubt in your mind. Avoid the places, the persons and the thoughts that lead to the temptation. Frequent the places, associate with the persons, indulge in the thoughts that lead away from temptation. Keep busy ; idleness is the strength of bad habits. Do not give up the struggle when you have broken your resolution once, twiceâ€” a thousand times. That only shows how much need there is for you to strive. When you have broken your resolution, just think the matter over, and endeavor to understand why it is you failed, so that you maybe on your guard against a recurrence of the same circumstances. Do not think it is an easy thing that you have undertaken. It is a folly to expect to break off a bad habit in a day, which may have been gathering long years.
