WONDERS OF LITTLENESS. Pliny and Elian relate that Myrmeeides wrought out of ivory a chariot, with four wheels and four horses, and a ship with all her tackling, both in so small a compass, that a bee could hide either with its wings. Nor should we doubt this when we find it recorded in English history on less questionable authority, that in the twentieth year of Queen Elizabeth's reign a blacksmith of London of the name of Mark Scaliot, made a lock of iron, steel and brass, of eleven pieces, and a pipe key, all of which only weighed one grain. Scaliot also made a chain of gold, of forty three links, which he fastened to the lock and kay, and put it around the neck of a flea, which drew the whole with perfect ease. The chain, key, lock, and flea, altogether weighed but one grain and a half! Selected.
