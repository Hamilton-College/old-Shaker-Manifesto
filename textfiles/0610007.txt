CORRESPONDENCE Enfield, N. H. Aug. 9th, 1876 G. A. Lomas, Editor, Shakers, N. Y. Dear Friend: â€” Allow me to give expression to the promptings of my inner life, in praise and commendation of the precious truths and principles so ably and manfully advocated in The Shaker, and which are so much needed at the present time, and which were also uttered forth to the world by our Lord and master Jesus Christ, when here on earth personally, who said 'I am the way, the truth and the life.' It is high time I sincerely believe, for humanity to pause, think, consider watchfully and prayerfully the signs of the times at what a poor rate the majority of souls are now living, so far away from the teachings of Jesus, his life. True spiritualism and true Shakerism, I believe, must step to the front of priestcraft, sectarianism and old theology, take the lead in the broad, universal religion of Jesus of Nazareth, free for all, without money and without price. May God, His angels, ministering spirits, speedily help us all to be wise for ourselves and choose that better part and live it, which can never be taken away from us. Then as said Jesus we can truthfully exclaim 'The kingdom of God is within us.' Respectfully, WM. G. DENNISON
