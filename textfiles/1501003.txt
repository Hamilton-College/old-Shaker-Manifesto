SILENT PRAYER In prayer we speak to God, but there is also the silence of prayer. Our lips utter no sound, we cannot find words to express the language of the heart, but the soul still prays. Perhaps we are too weary in body or in mind, perhaps the brain may be too utterly exhaust- ed to frame the petitions we would ask. Still we desire to hold communion with Him who bids us come to Him when we are tired. ' Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. ' Then comes the experience and the sweetness of the silence of prayer. What is it? 1. It is just kneeling down in our accustomed place, and lifting up our hearts to Him in wordless petition which speaks only in the well of longing deep down in our souls. 2. It is letting God speak to us in our silence and listening to His voice. There are many things He will say to us if we will only hear them—deep, sweet, holy things—comforting things, and things that will draw us away from the world to follow Him more closely. 3. It is a time of great nearness to Jesus. Is he not close by? Having felt the weakness of our nature, he draws near in full sympathy with our weariness. 4. It is a time of strengthening. Our ' strength is ' sometimes ' to sit still. ' No less do we receive strength from God when we are drinking in silence from Him who chooses sometimes Himself to be 'silent in love.' So may we arise from the silence of prayer invigorated and strengthened. —New York Observer.
