Vick's Floral Guide for 1891 Vick's Floral Guide for 1891. No lover of a fine plant or garden can afford to be without a copy. It is an elegant book of over 100 pages 83^x10% inches, beautiful colored illustrations of Sunrise Amaranthus, Hydrangea and Potatoes. Instructions for planting, cultivating, etc. Full list of everything that can be desired in the way of Vegetable and Flower Seeds, Plants, Bulbs, etc. Also full particulars regarding the cash prizes of $1,000 and $200. The novelties have been tested and found worthy of cultivation. We hope it will be our good luck to see the Nellie Lewis Carnation and taste the Grand Eapids Lettuce. It costs nothing because the 10 cents you send for it can be deducted from the first order forwarded. We advise our friends to secure a copy of James Vick, Seedsman, Rochester, N. Y.
