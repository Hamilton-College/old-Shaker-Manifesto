FORTY DAYS WITHOUT FOOD. To Dr. H. S. Tanner:- -Yourbook, addressed 'To whom it may concern' is addressed to me, seeing I am deeply interested in your successful, fruitful, and self-denying experiment. The results of which, coupled with your former experiences, are suggestive that the long train of maladies incident to humanity may be disposed of. I see the importance, and highly estimate your labors in the above line. Again, your retirement ia the Shalam community New Mexico, is not without its importance. Its non-success involves lessons of great value. I recognize in that Community an effort to rid its subjects of the prevailing social maladies of our times. Underlying all social formations there are laws, as invariable, and as omnipotent, as are the laws productive of mateiial phenomena. I find in the leaders of that community, the same forces that inhere in all men and women. And that these forces when active produce definite results. The universality in the prevailingform of social life on our planet, points to a corresponding force, or cause, which uniformly brings forth the usual family relationships. The auimal affectional affinities existing between men and women, is the force which creates the private family. It is worthy of note, that all animals are the subjects of that force ; therefore, it may be called 'The animal emotional force,' it being represented by the propensities. Now, I find in your leaders, and also in those who sympathize with them another force, a force to form a universal brother and sisterhood having one common interest; and to eliminate from themselves bodily, as well as moral maladies; and also, to substitute peace for war. This force, may be called the divine, emotional force ; it being represented by manifestations of 'Good-will to men,' justice, 'benevolence, mercy, and by aspirations after, and a growth into these divine attributes. To live under the vitality of this force exclusively, is to have heaven in and among us. As the said leaders manifested in forming such community the divine emotional�the higher life, why did they not succeed? History deals in facts, not in personalities. Well, what are the facts in reference to said leaders, or rather the leader? At first he taught abstinence from propagative emotions, and afterwards married a woman. He formed a community having goods in common, and then introduced the force, having goods in severality ! Is it not also a matter of history, that the women in the Shalam community remained under the influence of their animal emotional affinities? And that there was neither power in said community to destroy the organizing affinities of Adamic relationships, nor ability to unfold within these women, angelic life. On these points, hinge the success, or failure of communal homes. Woman is the organizing force in social formations. If you will have divine homes, first, find the divine woman�the woman clothed with divine energy. The moon�animal desires under her feet. Her children will bruise the serpent's head, and render communal homes an everlasting success. The teachings of the Faithists to go direct to Jehovah, without the necessary preparation of step by step on the ladder of ascension, suggests the inquiry is dictum growth ? I have the happiness to be very respectfully your much obliged friend, Daniel Fraser.
