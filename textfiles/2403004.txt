TRIA JUNCTO IN UNO. By Oliver C. Hampton. MY intuitions lead me to recognize in the over-soul of the Universe, the two qualities of wisdom and love. I find that in finite man, these two qualities can, may and do act as it were separately. A mother may love her offspring to death and destruction and not show any wisdom in th &gt; whole process. A man may love gold merely for itself, till he starve to death before he will spend it to live. He is entirely wanting in wisdon. These are extreme cases, but they prove that love may be exercised while wisdom is not in activity. Again, man may be intensely exercised in cold, cast-steel calculations in mathematics, vivisection or even theology. Witness Calvin's grizzly horrors of doctrine, and in all his speculations not one atom of love is to be discovered. The absent quality in each case is merely lying dormant in the human soul and is not yet developed into normal activity. These fairly represent humanity on its lower, rudimental plane of existence. All the way between these extremes of inequality, there are grades and degrees of distribution of wisdom and love, even to comparative equality and perfection. Jesus Christ supposed man to be capable of absolute perfection, that is, infinite perfection, else why did he say, 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.' Our Father in heaven� the Over-soul of the visible universe�the Divine Intelligence or whatever one may call it, differs from our humanity on the lower plane in this way, viz., that the Infinit Father possesses in exact equality, the energies of wisdom THE MANIFESTO. 57 and love and from these, a third active attribute, a perfect union thereof ensues. Here is a trinity of aspects or conditions not possible to be experienced on the lower plane of humanity with its abnormal, unequal and imperfect conditions. This Trinity in Unity is what constitutes the difference between the rudimental plane of existence and the grand and glorious Christ plane. It is the difference between selfishness and self-abnegation, love and hatred, revenge and holy forgiveness, mercy and cruelty, war and peace, purity and impurity. This is the glorious height to which we are called and the green pastures of everlasting consolation in which we may walk. 'Let us lay aside every weight,' envying and strife, intoxicants, even as medicine, flesh-meat, etc., etc. 'and the sin which doth so easily beset us,' the 'flesh with its affections and lusts,' and 'let us run with patience the race that is set before us.' 'We'll follow those who've gone before And have the prize possessed, Who've all their trying scenes passed o'er And entered into rest. For Prophets, Kings and Holy men Did long to reach this light, Yet lingered out their days in pain And died without the sight.' Let us do all we can for humanity in our day and generation in all prudence and wisdom not forgetting the inspired word of the great Seer of the Babylonian captives 'The wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.'
