SHALL I DESIST! LOIS WENTWOETH. Because I've failed to do a task As well as I would have it done, Shall I desist and idly shrink As life's bright sands drop one by one? Nay! let me try, yet once again, Take greater pains, use greater care, The cunning hand we all may train To do our bidding every-where ! Because my feet slip on the way, The upward way that leads to life, Shall I turn back without delay, And mingle with the sin and strife? Nay ! good right foot take firmer hold, And soon the left will follow thee ; Naught should discourage pilgrims bold, Not e'en the wild tempestuous sea. Because I spoke a bitter word. That hurt a friend or wronged a foe, Shall I still keep my anger stirred And drink the gall as on I go? Nay ! tho' the bitter word can ne'er Be taken back as long years roll; The wounds I may bind up while here, Before we meet at yonder goa) ! Because to-day I quite despair Of sunshine when the clouds hang low, Shall I remain cast down with care, Nor watch for the returning glow? Nay ! let me still with hope look up, While hands and feet their task obey; Eor well I know that all life's ills In Heaven's good time will pass away. Hancock, Mass.
