Books and Papers. Hood's Sarsaparilla Calendar In the past few years Hood's Sarsaparilla Calendar has become such a favorite that the people anticipate its annual appearance with pleasure. The Calendar for '89, which is now before us, will fully satisfy every expectation as to beauty and utility. It is a little larger than ever before, retaining the cut-out feature of last year, and a handsome child's face looks over a pad of clear, plain figures, all printed in harmonious and pleasing colors. To be appreciated it must be seen. Get a copy of your druggist or send 6 cents in stamps to C. I. Hood &amp; Co., Lowell, Mass.
