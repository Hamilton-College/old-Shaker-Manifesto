Dear Children: Love one another... Enfield, Conn. 1886. Dear Children :ï¿½' Love one another, for love is of God.' Adorn the chambers of your hearts with virtue, truth, and patience. Give beauty and happiness to the future by dai'y acts of kindness, by tender charities, by deeds of love. These will mate beautiful the mansion prepared for you above. Loving deeds and kind words never die. Every time you speak a gentle word, or do a right act from a right motive, you are adding beauty to the garment your soul wears, and on the contrary, everytime you do a wrong act or speak an unkind word, you are defacing that garment. Loving acts and kind words are the stepping stones to heaven. Pure love is the fruit of the spirit. 'More love is needed.' If you love each other purely, your language will bear the evidence of love and truth. 'Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.' If you put in practice heavenly love, you firmly implant that love, and it becomes strengthened as you cherish it. If your lives are full of purity, your hearts will be full of love. Deeds of sympathy, words of love and encouragement to each other, are tending to your spiritual elevation. Hold fast . that which is pure in your own hearts, lose nothing which adds to the loveliness of your characters, but keep a clear conscience, and you will shine as jewels in God's Kingdom. It is the nature of purity to shine. Grow better, purer, more true and loving. Love is the great teacher of all good, for God is love. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
