Dear Children; Lay up for yourselves... Enfield, Conn. June 1885. Dear Children ;�'Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.' Treasures of purity, truth, charity and love. Pure thoughts and virtuous deeds fill the measure of life, and constitute heavenly treasure. ' Sweet the pleasure, rich the treasure.' It is not the outside riches but the inside ones that produce happiness. The harder you struggle for abiding riches the better. Devote time and toil to obtain them. True wealth consists in virtue. Self-denying efforts bring wealth to the spirit. Heavenly wealth never perishes, never disappoints, destroys not the body, corrupts not the soul. Be 'rich toward God. ' Purity is a bright jewel� ' the pearl of great price. ' Having it, you have riches untold. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
