A Discipline that has life —The Catholic University of Notre Dame, at South Bend, Ind. with 1500 students is in Prohibition Territory. 'Two students while on a visit to the City, became intoxicated. It came to the ears of the President who expelled them by telephone. They were not permitted to return to the College and their trunks were immediately sent to the depot.'—The New York Voice. The Episcopalian bishops are at variance on the subject of Marriages and Divorces. The church tries hard to make it a divine institution, but it still remains in the hands of the civil law.
