SUNNY SIDE Look on the sunny-side—dense clouds may gather, And silently overspread life's fairest sky; Look on the sunny-side — next to your sorrow, And soon the dark shadows of gloom will pass by. Look on the sunny-side, weary, worn sisters, Ye who are treading the world's thorny maze ; You tread not alone, if your faith reaches heaven, You toil not alone,—God will brighten your days. Look on the sunny-side, true struggling brothers, Ye, who are battling with hardships of life ; Fight on, your weapons heaven will prosper; And vict'ry determine your zeal in the strife. Look on the sunny-side, ye who are hopeless, And constantly mourn over life's many ills ; Keep up good courage, for glorious sun-light Is gilding the tops of faith's beautiful hills ! Look on the sunny-side, O ye who are drooping, Like flowers that perish for want of good care ! Come, gather new strength — Truth's morning is breaking, Lift up your frail heads, and breathe in its sweet air. Look on the sunny-side, ye who are burdened, Cast off your cares, for this life is so brief, It must not be wasted, nor robbed of enjoyment, Nor given to toil without rest or relief. Look on the sunny-side ye who are youthful, Gather the light that will ever abide ; The way to be hopeful and healthful and happy Is to keep right before you — the bright sunnyside.
