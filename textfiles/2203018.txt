West Pittsfield, Mass. Feb. 12, 1892. Dear Editor:Winter seems to have finally become disentangled from the other seasons, and has asserted his supremacy. We can scarcely realize that the second month of the Xew Year is so nearly spent, but our reliable calendar gives indisputable evidence of the fact, and we hasten to forward our meagre offering for the columns of your valuable pamphlet. In the past few weeks the roads have been in excellent condition for sleighing; which has been well improved by all classes. Teams have been busy in all directions securing the ice crop. Our people have harvested their supply which Avas about nine inches in thickness, but of good quality. The usual routine of winter business is being closely pursued. Hauling and sawing loirs, preparing wood for a future cold, winter, and the daily necessary duties that come, serve to occupy our time and keep us briskly moving. While performing these manifold duties may our hearts each day be drawing nearer to God and our future home in the world supernal. Our meetings abound in spiritual blessings and heavenly ministrations. A fair degree of health prevails at presen in our Society. J. L. S.
