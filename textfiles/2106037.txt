RESIGNATION. Canterbury, N. H. 1 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee.'ï¿½Isa. xxvi., 3. I may not ask where Thou wouldst lead, It is enough to know Thou dost my fervent prayer heed, Define each whisper low. I'll trust Thee, Father, Mother, God, Thou wilt,as Thou hast done, Remember in parental love The daughter and the son.
