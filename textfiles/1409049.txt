The Fallacies in 'Progress and Povebtt,' in Henry Dunning Macleod's ' Economics,' and in ' Social Problems, ' with the Ethics of Protection and Free Trade, and the Industrial Problem considered a priori. By William Hanson. Extra cloth, $1.00. Fowler &amp; Wells Co., Publishers, 753 Broadway, New York. This is a bold attack by a clear-headed observer and most candid writer on leading points and arguments made by Mr. Henry George, in his well known 'Progress and Poverty' atid ' Social Problems.' Mr. Hanson is as radical as the Laud Reformer himself, in his views of the fundamental changes necessary to true social progress, and has a warm sympathy for the purposes of Mr. George, but his sharp logic brings into clear light the errors that mar the reasoning of the books above named, and shows how inconsistent and impracticable are the methods of reform advised therein. For instance, he analyzes Mr. George's theory of Interest, and 'Law of Rent,' and also his remedy for landlordism, and points out their unsoundness and injustice in a concise fashion that everybody can understand. The same vigorous handling is marked in his consideration of the work of Mr. Henry Dunning Macleod, 'Economics,' a powerful treatise in itself, but shown to be based upon assumptions that are unscientific. ' The Ethics of protection and Free Trade' constitutes one essay, in which the principles of the two great parties that stand arrayed against each other on the Tariff question, are reviewed in the light of political responsibility, and what constitutes true national progress. The final essay, ' The Industrial Problem considered a priori,' looks into the essential merits of the subject, that has to some extent been considered in the preceding essays; but this time the argument is purely deductive, and impartially points out wrong doing and mistakes on both sides�on the part of the capitalist, and on the part of the work�and fearlessly admonishes both with regard to their duty. The work is written for the people, from the point of view of the practical man and Christian philosopher who is consciously radical, but seeks to make his every proposition for social reform based upon justice, and responsive to the simple demands of humanity.
