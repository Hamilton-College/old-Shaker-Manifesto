Doing up Shirts .— A shirt-board for ironing is a necessity in every well-regulated family. This should be covered with at least two thicknesses of blankets, and have the ironing sheet, also double, smoothly pinned over it, so that it cannot slip. Keep wax tied up in a rag to rub the iron. The polish of collars, etc., done up at large laundries is given by means of a polishingiron and by dint of much rubbing. It may be done by any good laundress, but it takes much time, and is fearfully hard on the linen. Spermacetti added in small quantities to the starch gives a pretty gloss. We insert this recipe:—Melt together with a gentle heat, one ounce white wax and two ounces spermacetti; prepare in the usual way a sufficient quantity of starch for a dozen bosoms; put into it a piece of this enamel the size of a hazelnut. This gives a beautiful polish.
