This deeply interesting story, by the author of Seba's Discipline and Ruby Ilamitton, forms the second issue in the Young Eolks' Library Series, an honor it richly deserves. The plan of the publishers is to rnakc this series a model in (-ver3Tthing that goes to constitute good book?ï¿½interest, purity of tone, and a direct purpose to leach lessons of truth, honor and usefulness. These qualities give each separate book a claim upon the consideration of every parent who exercises a judicious care over the reading of his children. The present volume may well stand as a representative of the series in all these respects. Margie is the youngest daughter of a country clergyman, and at the age of fourteen is left without father or mother, but is cared for by kind friends. She is a thoughtful and sympathetic child, and anxious to be of some use in the world. She often wonders what her ' mission ' is to be, and at last it is opened up to her. It is by no means a pleasant or romantic one, but she bravely accepts it, and although her trials are neither few nor light, its fruits are abundant and permanent. We do not propose to interfere with the reader's right to enjoy the s-tory by describing its plot, but simply give the authors motive, coupled with an endorsement of the book, not only lor its intrinsic value, as a story but as a teacher of lessons which it behooves all young people to learn.
