THE CRY OF THE SUFFERING. Cora C. Vinneo. The earth hath need of prophets in this day, Who will not down, and will not quiet be, Who fear not creeds, nor danger, nor delay, But speak the truth for God's humanity. 'New times demand new systems and new men,' Then why embalm the old ones long since dead? Why set the boundary to a law, and then Condemn the hungry when they fight for bread ? Earth's cry of suffering rises like the cloud That hung so darkly over Sinai, While Israel stood below, a faithless crowd, And Moses caught the tablets from the sky. Borne on the lightning and the thunder peals We hear the echo of man's strife with man, While patient Justice to our souls reveals The curse that lingers in oppression's plan. Strong manhood languishes in fetters, cast At the fierce forge of its necessity And then is branded, and condemned at last To prison cells. Who says that man is free? Who talks of virtue ? When the man is starved Can conscience hesitate and question law ? Nay, it must sin and see its tombstone carved, Nor raise a voice to justify its cause. Ah! where is virtue, when our woman-hood Must sell its birth-right for a crust of bread ? Must tread its feet upon the soul of good And heap the coals of shame upon its head? And where is virtue when the children dear Must learn with care the youthful ruffian's art? And with the strife for money boldly sear The early promptings of an honest heart? 226 THE MANIFESTO. The haughty may condemn with words of pride The humble victims of their craft and hate, But though delayed, 'twill never be denied The justice that must come though ne'er so late. And it will come, the promises are sure, God's voice we hear above the strife and din, The triumph comes to spirits who endure; And goodness will erase the blight of sin. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
