Shakers, N. Y. Sept. 1899. Well, so we must say goodbye to The Manifesto! It is like saying farewell and giving the hand shake to a friend from whom we are being parted, and whom we do not expect to again meet until we clasp hands on the other side of the mystic river. It causes a feeling of sadness to come over our spirit and a regret that conditions necessitate such a change. Longfellow beautifully expresses the sentiments that should dominate the soul under such conditions. 'As one by one thy hopes depart Be resolute and calm; O fear not in a world like this And thou shalt know ere long, Know how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong.' While we are penning these lines by the light of the evening lamp we realize plain- 158 THE MANIFESTO. ly the presence of some of those saints who have journeyed on and they minister hope and courage; they were faithful unto the end and our prayer is may we be worthy to follow in their footsteps; and may those who to-day, here in earth life, are bearing the brunt of the battle to sustain the cause and uphold the principles of the higher life be comforted and strengthened. The trend of thought manifested in the writings of the advanced thinkers, religious or political, point very plainly to the culmination of another of those wonderful cycles that, as mile-stones, mark human progress; and the race is entering upon a new cycle that will bring to the front powers that have in the past laid dormant, and by their use human life will be lifted higher in the scale of spiritual evolution. The testimony that Believers have held forth, that a denial of the attractions of the lower life and a spiritual growth away from those conditions is necessary for a development of the spiritual life is stronger to-day in the world than ever, and though sects and parties may rise and then decay, that truth will remain forever a beacon light showing the way to attain to those treasures that perish not with their using.
