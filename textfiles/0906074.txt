SOCIALISM Professor Henry Fawcett, in a lecture at the University of Cambridge, England, expressed the conviction that repressive measures are powerless to stay the progress of Socialism. On the contrary, they would stimulate its development. This had been shown in England, where laws to prevent combinations of workingmen had driven them into forming secret societies. He said nothing could be more unfair nor unreasonable than to associate the Socialists of Germany and other countries with the crimes of a few fanatics. The principles of Socialism in various forms had been advocated by the wisest and best of men from the earliest times. The social life of the early Christians was organized on communistic principles. ' All that believed were together, and had all things common, and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.' The fundamental principle of Socialism was that men should not be permitted to appropriate to their sole use all that they are able to acquire, but that a portion of what they possess should be devoted to the relief of the necessitous.
