Watervliet, Ohio. June, 1893. Oue field of corn is growing nicely. We have eighty acres of wheat to harvest, fifty acres of oats and one hundred acres of hay. Of corn we have one hundred acres put in. We also started a nice orchard of one hundred Lombard plums and the same number of peaches of six or seven different varieties. Fruit with us is about all killed for this season having had several frosts in May, which were very severe. I think we may have a few peaches and some small fruits and shall have in abundance, raspberries, grapes and strawberries. The strawberries are already being harvested. We are having rain, rain, rain every day, so we can not get into the garden to do much work. The cabbages are doing well and the beans are throwing out their fourth leaf. We also have a nice piece of sweet potatoes. Six nice, large, deep red, mulley calves have been purchased and quite an interest is manifested in the polled Durham cattle. For the market, this fall, we have fifty head of young cattle, and would like to realize about five cents per pound for them, which would give us a nice little income. Our farm has been improved by the repairing of fences and the digging of drains. Have just purchased a hay loader, as we have some one hundred acres of hay to make, and it is claimed that vou can put up from four to six tons of hay per hour, that is if you have teams. However, we shall be satisfied to put up fifty tons a day, with three teams and three extra men to assist in putting the hay into the barn. The hay loader does the raking and puts the hay in the wagon and leaves the field very clean. Sisters are fixing up their flower beds in front of the family Dwelling, and they are very pretty. I hope all who have the privilege may be faithful in the gospel cause, and help to build up our Zion home. II. W. Fredrick..
