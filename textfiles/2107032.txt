WILL AND WORDS. [Contributed by F. W. Evans.] Persons who are determined to do what they like are usually likely to say what they like, whether true or false, and their statements are often as inaccurate as their acts are unreasonable. If the principle of lawlessness and disorder possesses the will, it will run through the whole being. The tongue is the index of the life and the character. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. By their words men shall be justified, and l)j their words they shall be condemned. He that bridles his tongue can bridle his whole body. He who cannot rule his temper cannot control his tongue. An unreasonable will, makes an unruly tongue. The voice of wisdom says: 'Make no friendship with an angry ir.an.' The defect in his character is radical, and in the case of a man who has but one favilt, the fault is generally sufficiently serious to pervade and vitiate his whole character. If the words are right the will can hardly be wrong; and if the will is wrong the words will not be right. Selected.
