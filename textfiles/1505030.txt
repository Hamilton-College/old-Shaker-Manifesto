THE EARLY QUAKERS. [Contributed by Elder F. W. Evans.] ' Quakerism aimed at the overthrow of nearly all vested interests. The Quaker dogma of an unpaid ministry was hateful to the ministers of other denominations. Its non litigious principles dealt as great a blow at the very existence of lawyers as its noncombatant ones did that of the soldiers. All who loved the beautiful disliked the idea of a religion which forbade music and painting, and which prescribed a sober monotony of dress. Whilst the gay dreaded one that held every amusement, however harmless, as mere waste of time, and therefore sinful. The rich and noble still more dreaded one that destroyed all inequalities of rank and forbade the honors they considered theirs, by right. The Quaker system not only run counter to the habits and customs of the time, but it ran perpetually counter to them. Other dissenters, if they chose, might conform to them in social or political matters, but the Quaker was forbidden by his creed to do so. In the house and workshop, in the field or on the highway, he was a marked man. His speech was couched in different phrases from that of other men. His dress was not of the same cut and was of more sober color. His manners were less polished and seemingly less courteous. His whole existence was a protest against conventionalities, nor could he consent to make any concessions to the weaker brethren. None of these peculiarities were absolutely novel, nor were any of the religious! doctrines of the Quakers. In the most distinctive of the latter, the doctrine of the inward spiritual light which superseded revelation, they had been forestalled at least in part, by the German Mystics, and in others, such as the non use of the Sacraments, they did little more than copy or continue the earlier Puritan religious systems.
