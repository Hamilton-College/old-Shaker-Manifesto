SELF-CONCEIT EDITORIAL NOTES This ugly feature is found very prevalent among those who are ardently inclined to religion. There is really as much, if not more, need of a crucifixion of self-conceit among professors of religion than anywhere else. When individuals get to be so good as to consider themselves especially cared for by Providence, and do not show the effects of this special notice by self-abasement that longs for and works for the good of others, all forgetful of themselves — even of their goodness and their physical comforts — we are reminded of the truth of the wise man : ' Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit, there is more hope of a fool than of him.' 'Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth ; a stranger and not thine own lips.' It is commonly observed, that as persons become really better, they become less boastful and boasterous of themselves; and a calm, sweet temper controls them, which prompts them, unlike their former selves, to seek how they may do good unto others, their foes perhaps, and are hence no longer wrapped up in considerations peculiarly selfish, and ostentatiously so. If any are really better than others, they will show it by their increased Christian demeanor; and unless it is so manifested, none will accept it as a fact from their own mouths.
