MANNERS AT TABLE. The face and hands should be washed and the hair should be brushed and combed nice, ly. We should eat with our fork and use 6ur knives to prepare our food. We should not gaze at other people when they are eat ing. We should bend slightly forward. When we take our chairs, we should move them as quietly as possible. We should take soup from the side of the spoon. When any one meets with an accident it is impolite and unkind to laugh or gaze at them. We should not fill a cup more than two thirds full. We should not drink out of the saucer. Before and after taking our food we should ask, with a thankful heart, the blessing of our heavenly Father. Jennie L. White.
