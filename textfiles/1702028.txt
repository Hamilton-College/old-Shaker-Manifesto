From the Little Children. Winter is here again with... Wintek is liere again with its snow and ice, I would like it if I did not get so cold. I like spring best. I love to see the trees budding and the flowers blooming and the pretty green grass. In the spring 1 love to go down on the cliffs and see the wild flowers and watch the waterfalls. In the fall the leaves on the cliffs are very pretty so many colors together. When I stand upon the cliffs I can see the river, it looks like it was standing still, yet I know it is running as fast as it can into another river which runs to the ocean. The dear Manifestos come every month and we girls like to read them, we find some pretty verses which we memorize. We all want it to come another year. Alice Montgomery, age 8yrs. Pleasant //ill, Ktj. . MANNERS AT TABLE. The face and hands should be washed and the hair should be brushed and combed nice, ly. We should eat with our fork and use 6ur knives to prepare our food. We should not gaze at other people when they are eat ing. We should bend slightly forward. When we take our chairs, we should move them as quietly as possible. We should take soup from the side of the spoon. When any one meets with an accident it is impolite and unkind to laugh or gaze at them. We should not fill a cup more than two thirds full. We should not drink out of the saucer. Before and after taking our food we should ask, with a thankful heart, the blessing of our heavenly Father. Jennie L. White.
