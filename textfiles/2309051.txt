' Penny wise and Pound foolish' are those who think it economy to use cheap rosin and soda soaps, or washing powders of any kind, instead of the good old Dobbins' Electric Soap; for sale by all grocers since 1869, and used during all that time by millions of intelligent economical women who know its merits, and therefore use it. All who use it praise it as the best, cheapest, and most economical soap made, bu t if you will try it, even just once, it will tell a much stronger tale of its merits itself. Ask your grocer for Dobbins' Electric Soap, take nothing else. men make cheap imitations of the best articles; other unscrupulous men seek to palm them off on their customers as the genuine, for the sake of the additional profit made by the deceit.
