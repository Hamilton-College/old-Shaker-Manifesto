SHAKER CENTENNIAL Mt . Lebanon, August 6, 1874. Beloved J. M. Peebles : Your last, from New York, is under my eye. If any thing I write comforts or strengthens you in your life work as a Christ Prophet — a diffuser of light and purity — life from the inner Heavens — I am ''glad, and rejoice,' I live to be and do good. One hundred years ago, to-day, Mother Ann Lee and her little band landed in New York, on Sabbath eve. They were in a new world, having fled from the face of the monster, blasphemously calling itself the Church of Christ — the Episcopalian Church of Old England — a powerful Hierarchy which was forever pointing the poor of the earth to the heavens, there to behold a crucified Jesus, standing, with pierced hands and feet and bleeding side, pleading for those whom they, the priests, had robbed of their inheritance in the land; and then employed press-gangs to force them into the English armies and navies to fight for their God and King, whom, in their hearts, they cursed, and looked upwards to see if there were not better Gods and beings, than their God and King. In the ' Beecher-Tilton scandal,' there is more than the public or even your own dear self may imagine. It is not persons, but principles and systems. It means Babylon. Generation and Chris- tianity mixed, God, not man, is in it. It is the judgment of Protestanism in America, even as Catholicism is being judged in Europe. Does not Europe possess her infallible Pope ? And does not America possess an image of that infallible Pope, in every one of her great, popular preachers and leaders? War 'the Bible and Sharp's Rifles,' are component parts of Protestantism as of Catholicism. How long since Church and State Clergy were slave holders ? Some being slaves and Christian ministers too. It is judgment day. The revelation of the Christ Spirits is, increasingly, brighter and brighter. The Christ Angels do often obsess the public men, like T. K. Beecher, Chapin, Chever, Tyng and H. W. Beecher, and corresponding leading women. And in the ' fervent heat' of their inspiration, cause them to forget themselves, and to utter sentiments and advance ideas, consistent only with Shaker theology. This creates confusion in their own minds, and great incongruity between their life conduct and their preaching is the result. Not that they, as men and women, are 'sinners above all others.' But being quickened by Christ Angels, and their spiritual powers developed, they are capable of sinning beyond the power of the unbaptised. If their light be turned to darkness — to do evil — how great the darkness ! And how transcendant the evil!! When the seven plagues are fulfilled in Babylon, and the seven devils — of which the prostitution of the reproductive powers is chief— are cast out, war and poverty will not be. The noble, cultivated powers and faculties of our intellectual giants and giantSHAKEEESS. 75 76 8HAKEK esses, will be left free for the service of Heavenly Ministering Angels, who are hovering — brooding — over the whole of Babylon — Catholic, Greek and Protestant. And their rest from self serving, will be glorious. Eepentant Peter— the symbol of Rome, which has denied and crucified the true Christ for 1,260 years — 'will become their Father. And Mary Magdalen—the symbol of Protestantism—-will be their Mother. Babylon — Flesh and Spirit Order — is fallen — is fallen — before the Angel of Spiritualism, and Harvesting Angels follow on to attend unto, and cut down the wheat and tares, which are so inextricably mixed and interblended, that none other than Christ Spirits could or would do any thing with them. Such as call upon the name — character— of true Shakers, will be saved. For in Christ's second appearing, there is salvation from the ' sins of the world,' that are, even now, ' accusing the Saints of G-od day and night continually.' And swamping the fieshmongering amphibious Christians — Priests and People — in Pilgrim's Slough of Despond. Write and tell me you will be, in spirit, if not in body, at our social gathering. Fraternally, F. W. Evans
