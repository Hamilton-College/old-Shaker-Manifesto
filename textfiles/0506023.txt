RIGHT AND WRONG It is written, ' The way of the transgressor is hard,' and that ' Wisdom's ways are pleasantness and her paths peace.' When the mind is rightly directed, it is far easier to do right than to do wrong. Right leads in the straightforward path of life and duty; error leads into the by-ways of sin, and among hedges. Eight dwells, walks and is conversant with her followers, as with companions,; never forsaking them in adversity. She attires them in robes of honor, and crowns them with immortal glory. Wrong tempts and allures her votaries with fair promises of happiness and pleasure, that are never realized. Her greatest pleasures leave a sting behind. Her reward is pain and misery. She clothes her subjects with degradation and shame. The old theory, that it is hard and disagreeable to do right, is false — a device of satan's own planning to deceive and captivate souls and retard their progress. It is true, educated as most children are, pernicious habits are formed in early life; hence many difficulties are experienced by such, in seeking to do right, and effort, self-denial and moral courage are requisite to remove obstacles, which appear formidable ; but a wise, determined energy to do right will bring a recompense — a just reward.
