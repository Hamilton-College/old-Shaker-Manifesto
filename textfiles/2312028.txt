Sabbathday Lake. Nov. 1893. It hardly seems possible that the closing month of the year is so near at hand and that Thanksgiving and Christmas will have come and gone, ere we again write notes for our Manifesto. At this early date, we send Christmas greetings to all our Brethren and Sisters with the prayer that the gospel taught by Mother Ann Lee, may spread over the land and many may hear the tidings of Peace on earth. The 'History of the Shakers' written by our good friend, C. E. Robinson, and published by our beloved Elder Henry is highly appreciated by the people of Maine. Elder John Vance was in Portland lately, and met Ex-Gov. Robie, who said to him,ï¿½ 'I thank you for the book you so kindly sent me. It is beautifully composed and put together. It is an honor to your people. I took it to bed with me at night, and did not close my eyes to sleep until I had read it through; it was so very interesting.' Our Brethren are building a new ice house and are putting in a cooling room in which meats can be preserved during the warm season: a convenience which we have long needed. We, this week commence our winter term of school with twenty-two pupils. It means work, to so bend the twig that the tree may be rightly inclined. Ada S. dimmings.
