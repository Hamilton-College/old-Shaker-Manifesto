A HOLY LIFE A holy life is made up of a number of small things. Little words, not eloquent speeches or sermons; little deeds, not one great heroic act of martyrdom, make up the true Christian life. The little constant sunbeam, not the lightning; the waters of Siloam, 'that go softly' in the meek mission of refreshment, not the 'waters of the river great and many,' rushing down in noisy torrents, are the true symbols of a holy life. The avoidance of little evils, little sins, little inconsistencies, little weaknesses, little follies, indiscretions and imprudences, little foibles, little indulgences of the flesh, go far to make up, at least, the negative beauty of a holy life.
