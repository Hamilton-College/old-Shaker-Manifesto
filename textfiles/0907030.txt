WANTED, A BOY! A tradesman once advertised in the morning papers for a boy to work in the shop, run errands, and make himself generally useful. In a few hours the shop was thronged with boys of all ages, sizes, sorts and conditions, all wanting to find a situation. The shopkeeper only wanted one boy, but how to get the right one was the great difficulty. He thought he must find some plan to lessen the number of applicants, and give him a better opportunity of selecting a good one. So he sent them a^away, and thought the matter over a little. The next morning the papers contained the following advertisement : ' WANTED, A BOY WHO OBEYS HIS MOTHER !' Now, then, thought the tradesman, I shall 164 THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. see soon who will apply. He also put up a bill in his window with these words on. And how many do you suppose did come '? The story is that there were only two of all the numerous boys seeking employment in that big city who felt that they could honestly come and say, ' 1 obey my mother.' The crowd of lads was indeed quickly thinned out most effectually, and the tradesman had not much trouble in selecting a boy. Such boys as these — boys that obey their mothers —are in great demand. My little boy, if you saw an advertisement for such a boy, could you truthfully go and offer yourself for the situation ? If not, I fear there is something wrong about you. Look to the matter; seek the Lord's salvation; be an obedient son, and God will bless you.—Children's Friend.
