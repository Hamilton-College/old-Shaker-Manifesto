APPRECIATION Dear Shaker and Dear Friends: Enclosed please find sixty cents for one year's subscription of 'The Shaker,' which I have read for several years, and which has been to me a source of great peace and comfort; so much so that it would be a great privation to do without it. Though my life has been one of many cares, and though difficulties have darkened my pathway, and cast gloomy shadows upon the bright prospects of my future; I have pressed on my way with faith, trusting to the guidance of that hand that can lead us safely, even through darkest clouds, and thickest mists. 'The Shaker' has been a light to my feet and a lamp to my pathway. It has brightened my hope and renewed my strength. May its light continue to shine, and its might prevail, till all clouds shall be driven away, the rough places made smooth, all wrongs righted, and all shall see the salvation and glory of God. Looking forward to this glorious consummation, I ask to be remembered in your prayers, that I and many others may be strengthened and enabled to go forward in hope and happiness, even to the end. With my best wishes that ' The Shaker ' may ever continue — doing for others what it has for me — teaching purity and peace on earth that all may enjoy rest and joy in heaven. I remain, hopefully, C.
