LABOR. HANNAH E. WILSON. How sweet is labor, when we can feel that we are in the employment to which our gracious Father has called us. Any calling becomes sacred, though it be the most laborious, with such convictions; for we feel our Father's arm sustaining us, and while we are busy with our hands, our hearts are drawn continually upward 4' from whence cometh our strength.' Give us such labor, instead of any other our selfish heart would choose, though there may be a cross in it, if it is faithfully performed, there will be a crown beyond, that our Heavenly Father will surely bestow upon every humble Christian worker.
