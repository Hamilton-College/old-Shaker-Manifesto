Ayer, Mass. May, 1893. I indokse the worthy sentiments of our good and worthy Elder Isaac Anstatt. The harvest is great and the laborers few, and this calls for a strong faith and a greater testimony. In days long gone by it was this strong faith and trust in an Almighty Power, that doeth all things well, that drew souls by the power of faith and conviction to see and to know the principles of truth. The Believers in Christ's Second Appearing became a strong power among mankind, and the blessings of heaven rested upon them, and the gifts of the THE MANIFESTO. 147 spirit were the food that fed the immortal part. O that this same faith may be revived and the same trust in prayer bring again those Pentecostal days, when strong and powerful minds will be gathered to the faith. I envy no quality of mind, nor genius, power, wit or fancy, as I do a strong religious faith in the true principles of righteousness. Faith is an emanation from God and is manifest through the moral and spiritual faculties. Faith like love casteth out fear. It is faith that says, 'Our Father who art in heaven, Thy will be done on earth.' O that our eyes may be open to see and to know the worth of this strong and noble faith. What peace of mind it will bring,ï¿½what consolation it will bestow. It will bring to us the same increase that it did to our fathers. Spring is with us. Our garden is ploughed and some seed is in the ground. Potatoes are being planted on the farm. Andrew Barrett.
