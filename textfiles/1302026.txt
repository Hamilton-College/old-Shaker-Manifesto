ABOUT RABBITS. I think rabbits are very cunning little creatures. I will tell you what some of their colors are; some are dark red in summer and white in winter ; they are found in forests. I had a dark red rabbit once, I fed it with clover, but after a while it ran away, and I felt real bad. Rabbits are plenty in Canada where I used to live; they are more harmless than other wild animals are that have claws. People can handle them when wild, the same as a kitten, without being bitten by them. They live on the same kind of food that sheep do, and their meat makes good stews. Once while clearing a piece of grass-land that had a lot of old logs on it, my Father found a nest of five rabbits in a thick patch of grass. They were too small to run, and he gave them to some Frer.ch children that lived near our house. My Father used to catch a great many wild rabbits in a box trap he caught one once that had four little ones and he made a pen for them and was going to tame them but after they were a little more than a week old, a big cat came one night and killed them all; so my Father set a large wolf trap and the next morning we found the old cat caught fast in the trap.
