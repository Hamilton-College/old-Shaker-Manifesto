The Father and Mother have opened the way so well adapted... The Father and Mother have opened the way so well adapted to our needs, that we begin here to reap the benefits of salvation. Here is where the Mother spirit has surpassed the understanding: of man of the earth. She has devised a plan which supersedes aristocracy. Theologies and creeds melt before the warming rays of a Parent's love. Selfish ties hold no sway where the Mother spirit brings all into one universal family. The lives of such are a standing miracle before the world. Beautiful are the feet of those who walk the path of virtue. Their example sheds forth healing balm. Their homes are arbors of peace, away from the turmoil that reigns among the selfish. Come and walk with us iu Wisdom's ways, for her ways are pleasantness and her paths are peace. C. D.
