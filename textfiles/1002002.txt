SAINTLY COMMUNION: 'PRENTISSIANA.' Of the creed, drilled into my protesting cranium on the 46th parallel of north latitude, in the spring of 1807, one item remains, to wit: ' I believe in the communion of Saints.' By Divine inspiration it doth fully appear that Humanity is a compound — a germ of Divinity, enshrined in an earthly house, or casket, having appetites and passions not much unlike animals in general. Let the germ germinate — take sufficient growth to keep the earthly house in order — hold its appetites and passions in subordination to the germ's Divinest Idea of the true dignity of the Daughters and Sons of the Holy, Eternal Parentage, and we have Saints with whom to communeThen is actualized the Prophecy of Habakkuk : ' The Lord is in his Holy Temple — Let all the earth keep silence before Him'— actualized in every such saint as aforesaid. In children and youth, in comparative innocence, the germ of the saint is more cognizable — more approachable — than in children of a larger growth, who have long been under the control of their animal appetites and passions, called, in Holy Writ ' the kingdom of the beast.'
