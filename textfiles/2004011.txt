GOOD MANNERS. F. W. Evans. I still remember how, half a century ago, while traveling in New England, when passing a school-house, if the scholars were out, the boys would bow and the girls courtesy to the stranger or traveler. The pleasing impression and involuntary blessing upon the children, their parents and teachers, would almost find audible utterance. To-day, the passer-by is fortunate if he escape some rudeness or insult. When I see ministers, editors, and public teachers using the* contemptuous expressions of 'Tom' Paine, ' Abe ' Lincoln or ' Ape ' Lincoln, and 'Bob' Ingersoll, I ask myself, 'Were these men, when boys, taught good manners ?' They are zealous, religious advocates of Sunday laws, applicable to a day which they select, out of the seven days ; and that day not the Scriptural Sabbath at all, but a heathen /S?mday. These men presumptuously assume to select the day, determine how it shall be kept and by whom; compelling, like familiars of the Holy Inquisition, by fine and imprisonment, those who have no faith in it, and who want nothing to do with it. I say, 'Great is the mystery of' ��godliness. 'Mystery' was written on the forehead of the symbolic woman who represented church and state�Babylon ; the mystery of a trinity of three male Gods. The absurdity of an atonement�of one person being punished, and that person a God, for other persons' iniquities ; and the d-v-1-t-y of an Inquisition that would fain torture human beings for not believing its doctrines of devils; believing, not from evidence, but by authority. Those are God-&amp;-Christ-in-the American constitution people, who seek to destroy the only civil government upon earth that impinges not upon liberty of conscience the inalienable right of human beings. Are not the infidels to this persecuting church and state system, like Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin, Abraham Lincoln and Robert Ingersoll, the 'horns'�rationalists�that grew out of the head of the Beast; who hated 'Mystery' the whore that rode it, and tormented her with the ;Age of Reason,' with 'Common, Sense,' with the 'Rights of Man' and with the 'Crisis,' which produced the American Revolution, the Declaration of Independence, and finally established a civil government that is no more a Christian than it is a Buddhist or Mohammedan government? Honor to whom honor is due ; respect and reverence to those friends of man who founded a republic free from theology, leaving all people at liberty to do as they would be done by, and to 'do violence to no man.' Yet they -'ate her flesh ;' whatever that may mean. Let us all learn good manners ; treat each other with respect; and love those who are good and who do good, regardless of nicknames, or phrases such as 'Thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil,' &amp;c.
