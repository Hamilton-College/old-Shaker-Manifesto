MRS. GIRLING. To the Editor of the Daily Gazette, i London, Eng. SIR�Will you concede me a short space to rectify a common misunderstanding as to the order to which Mrs. Girling is associated? She does not belong to the Shaker community, but to the Peculiar People�a people whose fundamental feature is a miserable negation of the necessity of medical advice in times of sickness. In short, although at the point of death, these unfortunate Peculiar People simply anoint the sufferers, tenaciously believing that if it is God's will that they should be restored to health He will restore them; if not, they will depart to enjoy His eternal presence. Hence, repeatedly, a practical world has indicted many members on account of manslaughter. The Shakers, who have several deeply interesting communities in America, are far too sensible a people to pursue any such eccentric tenet as this. Indeed, they have a medicine manufactory, they are highly conversant with the very best herbal remedies, and in the cute people of the State find a ready market for their medicinal manufactures. In many ways the American Shakers are a most intellectual and instructive community, solving many enigmas which to many of our eading philanthropists seem absolutely in soluble.�Yours, &amp;c, A FEIEND TO THE SHAKERS.
