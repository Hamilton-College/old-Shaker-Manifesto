Mt. Lebanon., Oct. 1889 Dbae Elder Henry :â€”Last Winter Brother Orren gave me one of your little 'Dew Drop' books, which you printed thirty-seven years ago. I have read much in it, and like it very much. I was going to write to you about it, but when I saw you were coming here I thought I would tell you what I like in it best. I have not seen you only a few min- utes, so thought I would write to you. The verse for my birthday is very pretty. It says 'By your works and deportment, all that know you will form a judgment of what you are.' For your birthday it says, 'Cultivation is as essential for the mind, as food for the body.' The funniest verse is, 'You may shine, but take care not to scorch.' I was so glad that you could come to the Bible class last evening, and that our class could sit up late and come too. I hope you will come again, soon. From your little girl Eva St. Clare. 7 yr,s. old
