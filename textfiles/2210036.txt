New England Magazine Edwin D. Mead, the eminent publicist and lecturer, discusses the recent Homestead disturbances with fearless vigor and candor in the September New England Magazine. He deals with Homestead and the press, the pulpit and the politicians, and comes to the conclusion that it will be a bad day for the American Republic if the masses of working men ever come to believe that the State stands behind our millionaire barons, ready to crush those whom they would crush into obedience. It is an article that all real thinkers, especially among wage-earners, will read with interest.
