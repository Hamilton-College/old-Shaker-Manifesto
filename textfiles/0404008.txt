WATCHMAN Tell us, watchman, what of the night ? Has the hour of midnight passed ? do stars shine out; or, is it all dark, dark, darkness? Or, do you see the signs of the coming day beginning to appear ? Tell us, for we have work to do, and with the first signs of the day we would be astir! 0, Seeker! yet a little while and the day shall come, bright and beautiful, for the sky is already aglow with beams of morning light, such as tell of a glorious day ! Wrong, injustice, tyranny, superstition, avarice, falsehood, with all their attending followers, who, through the long, dark night, have tramped the streets of the great earth with polluted feet and violent hands, leaving misery in their wake â€” these are already trembling for their deeds, which testify against them, and one by one they are being banished from the face of the earth ; and men and women are speaking without fear, undaunted by the darkness; they are rising up in judgment against the wrongs of night, and, as the day dawns, they are running to and fro, asking each other anxiously, ' Where shall we go to wash ourselves clean; to clothe ourselves; to find employment for our hands and feet, fit for the light of the noonday ? ' And they who have not bowed the knee to the powers of night, nor sacrificed on her altars, shall point them to the running stream, to the garments bright, to the work of the day, that the Kingdoms of this world may become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and His knowledge cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.
