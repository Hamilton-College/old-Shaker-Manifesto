Messenger of Peace It gives us pleasure to know that the 'Messenger of Peace' still lives. That it has contended earnestly and kindly for the reign of Peace, in the hearts of the people is well known to all the readers of that beautiful little advocate of peace principles. No 1 of vol. 20 comes to us in an entirely new form. The combined fellowship of the 'Christian Arbitrator and Messenger of Peace,' must be the means of doing a great deal of good by advocating the brotherhood of man, and by urging the settlement of all national or individual disputes by a Christian arbitration. Send fifty cents to Daniel Hill, Kichmond, Ind. and obtain the Christian Arbitrator for one year.
