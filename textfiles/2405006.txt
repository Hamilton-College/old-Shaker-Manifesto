Dear Friend, Martha J. Anderson... Camden, New Jersey, 1894. Dear Friend, Martha J. Anderson ;��I thank thee for the pamphlets tliee sends me occasionally. I am interested in The Manifesto, and think it is rightly named, because it tells all about your home life, which to outsiders, speaks much. It shows your adherence to Christian principles, and social order and discipline. There is no purity where peace dwells not. The fruit of unity is loving service. The foundations of modern society are out of course. Conformity to fashion and the rules laid down by those who are in the tide of worldly pleasure, shuts out the simplicity that shines with lustre in a truly virtuous character. But, it is as the wise man saith, the end of all is 'vanity and vexation of spirit.' If people were more eager to speak and spread the truth, instead of discussing the forms of doctrines and creeds of the various sects, there would be more of the true spirit of religion in the earth and not so much infidelity. Man is prone to wander from the known into the unknown, hence, from light into darkness. The teachings of the Master are plain and simple. 'Deny thyself of all ungodliness take up the cross daily and follow me.' THE MANIFESTO. Ill This is a selfish, grasping age, the lust of money and the greed of power, overrule the love of righteousness, and the desire to do good. 'Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled.' There are but few who share this blessing. Disunity and confusion prevail in the political, industrial, and social systems that man has inaugurated. The time has not come when the Lion and the Lamb can lie down together and be led by a little child; neither has woman found her just place and position as man's true help-meet in every sphere of life. There will yet be a renewal of heavenly strength and God will make manifest his power, through those whose lives are upright, to the pulling down of the strong worlds of satan. It gives me great pleasure to hear from thee. God bless thee. Sincerely thy friend, Sarah Hall.
