Let us Earn our Pay A common share in the toils and [burdens of life, whether of a temporal or spiritual nature, always enhances our happiness. This is a life of toil; let us not leave our portion for the ever burdened. Let us each make the most of our own capital, that we may not have to beg, borrow, nor steal. Let all that we possess be justly and truly earned. Then we shall have nothing unpleasent to reflect upon when our accounts are cast up. Harvard, Mass.
