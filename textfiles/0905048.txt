THOUGHTS FOR TO-DAY Different Lives In a letter of a correspondent of the Christian, , London, Eng., writing from Cannes, said: 'A skeptical young German said, ' Plead for your Christianity as eloquently as you like, but till I see your professing Christians live different lives frona other men, I cannot believe in Christianity.''

Ef any ob you know ob any church ob dis kind, what died from liberality, jes tell me where it is, and I will make a pilgrimage to it, and by de soft light ob de pale moon I will crawl upon its mosscovered roof, and write upon its topmost shingle : ' Blessed am de dead what die in the Lord.''
