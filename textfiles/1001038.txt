A Lie Sticks â€”A little newsboy, to sell his paper, told a lie. The matter came up in Sabbath-school. ' Would you tell a lie for a penny ? ' asked a teacher of one of her boys. ' No, ma'am,' answered Dick, very decidedly. ' For sixpence ? ' ' No, ma'am.' ' For a shilling 1' ' No, ma'am.' ' For a thousand ? ' Dick was staggered. A thousand shillings looked big ! Oh, would it not buy lots of things ! While he was thinking, another boy called out, 'No, ma'am,' behind him. ' Why not? ' asked the teacher. ' Because, when the thousand shillings are all gone, and all the things they've got with them are gone, too, the lie is there all the same,' answered the boy. It is so. A lie sticks. Every thing else may be gone, but that is left; and you will have to carry it with you, whether you will or not. A hard, heavy load it is ! Selected.
