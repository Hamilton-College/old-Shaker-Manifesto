We cannot make men unworldly... We cannot make men unworldly by crying down their daily work as of no spiritual importance, and contrasting it with ' religious ' duties. What they need is the presence of Christian motives, to act in every thing for the glory of God, and whatever they do, ' do it heartily as unto the Lord.' Under the inspiration of this motive, a man may be just as religious in managing a railroad, in planting crops, or in making brooms, as in preaching and praying. Indeed, all honest work, done with Christian motives, is a sort of prayer, and is an essential means of grace. â€” The Methodist.
