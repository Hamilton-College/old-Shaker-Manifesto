SPIRITUAL LIFE. CHARLES JULIUS PRETER. l'A HOLY and spiritual mind doos not suffer himself to be led to the indulgence of inordinate affections, impure and fleshly desires, but subjects them to an illuminated and sanctified spirit. No conflict is so severe, as his own labors to subdue himself; but in this he must be continually engaged, if he would be strengthened in the inner man, and make real progress towards perfection. An humble knowledge of thyself therefore, is a more certain way of leading thee to God, than the most profound investigations to science. Purity of conscience, and holiness of life, must ever be preferred before it; but because men are more solicitous to learn much, than to live well, they fall into error, and receive little or no benefit from their studies. But if the same diligence was exerted to eradicate vice, and implant virtues, so much daring wickedness would not be found among the common ranks of people, nor so much licentiousness disgrace those who are eminent for knowledge. Assuredly in the day of judgment it will not be inquired, what we have learned, or what profession we have made, but what good we have done, and how holy we have lived. He is truly good, who has great charity ; he is truly great, who is little in his own estimation, and rates aï¿½ nothing the summit of earthly honor ; he is truly wise, who ' counts all earthly things but as dross, that he may win Christ;' and he is truly learned, who has learned to abandon his own will and do the will of God,' Union Village, Ohio.
