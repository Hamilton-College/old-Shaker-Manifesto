Enfield, N. H. March, 1S94. On the 28th ult. we were startled by an alarm of fire at about 10 a. m. We found smoke pouring out of the building in which our workmen lodge. Soon we had the hose in readiness to test the efficiency of the new hydrants, but before the water was turned on, the welcome crj came: 'All out.' Upon investigation, it was found that a former workman had carelessly left some old quilts and papers near a stove pipe extending from the room below. Little damage was clone however, beyond burning a large place on the floor and damaging a robe or two. It would have been quite a loss to us in these 'hard times' even if we could hav^ confined the flames to this one building. We are grateful that it was not more serious and we count it as one of God's blessings that we were spared a conflagration. Spring has made us an early call. Our wood supply is being sawed, and the buzz of the saw in the air sounds decidedly like April. Our Ministry arrived on the 1st inst. and are now blessing us with their presence. On the 5 th we were obliged to bid farewell to sleighing and accept the inevitable 'mud time.' Bluebirds were reported on the 8th, but not a sign of a robin as yet. The 'sugar makers' have commenced operations, and we look forward anxiously to the 'Sweet Bye and Bye.' G. H. Kirkley. North Family. Mar. 1894. No better theme suggests itself for the commencement of our notes than a quotation from Elder Andrew Barrett's essay on 'Cultivation' in our March number: 'Make home life interesting;' that is, call into action the mental, spiritual and social qualities of each individual composing the home circle as far as practicable, and thus help to brighten, as we may, our own and other's lives. The saying, Man can not live by bread alone, embodies a volume of suggestive thought. Knowledge of Christian duties teaches that all inspirations from literature, meditation, or the loveliness of nature are divine sources i'rom which to be benefited and those having a life mission of purity and doing good to humanity, realize that 'there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.' Job xxxii., 8. 'One holy name bearing, no longer they need Credentials of party, and pass-words of creed; The new song they sing, hath a threefold �c[cord, And they own one baptism, one faith and one [Lord.' We were glad to join hands with our Church kindred, and contribute our mite to help relieve the suffering poor. We have been blest with unusually good health, a fair amount of sale for our dairy produce, and otherwise general prosperity during the long winter months; and now as the balmy breezes of spring awaken the earth to newness of life, and farming implements are brought into action, thus utilizing the means open to us for continued life and activity, may we with all our Christian friends be able to sing:� 'I know that Christ my Savior lives, I feel his power to-day. A perfect peace, which, born of love, Can never pass away.' George H. Baxter.
