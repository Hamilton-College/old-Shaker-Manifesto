The Outlook [From The Outlook�February Magazine Number.] One writer asks, proposing his question as a conclusive objection to my method, if I am not acting on the principle, 'Assume the truth of evolution and then go head.' This is exactly what I am doing. I have no desire to persuade Christians to become evolutionists; I desire to show evolutionists that they can be Christians. My aim is not at all scientific; it is purely religious. The object of the series might be stated in a sentence thus: Assuming evolution to be true, it does not weaken, it strengthens, Christian faith. We accept the testimony of the experts when they have reached a conclusion. This is my first reason for being an evolutionist. Practically all scientists, I believe absolutely all biologists, are evolutionists They have proved themselves careful, painstaking, assiduous students of life. I assume the correctness of their conclusion. I have, indeed, studied somewhat the writings of Darwin, Huxley, Haeckel, Tyndall, and the later epitomes of Le Conte, Drummond and Tyler, and have read something of the criticisms on the other side�enough to see that the hypothesis of evolution has a groundwork of fact and reason. But I accept evolution, as a statement of the process of physical life, not from a personal scientific investigation, which I have not the training to conduct, but upon the substantially unanimous testimony of those who have such training.
