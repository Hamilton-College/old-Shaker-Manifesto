BOOK TABLE We would call especial attention to The People, a weekly paper, published by Chas. C. Pearson of Concord, N. H. It is an excellent family paper; brim full of news; enterprising in its every department, even in its politics! Our relations with the firm and The People, have been of a very pleasant character, and we only do duty when we make known to our readers, that as a New Hampshire paper, it is unexcelled. The best farm, stock and garden paper in our country, or in any other as far as we know, is The Country Gentleman, published by Luther Tucker f Son, Albany, N. Y. With the farmers who are successful in business, it is as readily and commonly found as is their Bible, and what the Bible should be to the morals of the community at large, such is the Country Gentleman to the farm and garden. We will send it and The Shaker for its subscription price, $Â¦2.50. Send us your orders. Christianity and Infidelity': A Discussion. Herein are the pro and con of Christianity pretty fully ventilated. The weakness of the affirmative side, is certainly manifested, because of its being an argument for a Christianity, not radical and true, but manmade. Half-way work in regard to Christianity, or arguments in its behalf, leave pregnable the positions of any advocate, to the javelins of the most radical infidel. Pure Christianity is an impregnable position. Those who are fond of such arguments, send to D. M. Bennett, 141 Eighth street, New York. ' The Radical Review.' for November contains many very interesting articles upon radically humane subjects. Prominent among many others are ' So Railway kings itch for an Empire, do they?' and ' The Spirit that was of Jesus.' Whoever is in earnest, as a worker for human weal, will do well to secure a copy of this Review, and they will then feel fully equipped. Send to Benjamin R. Tucker, New Bedford, Mass.
