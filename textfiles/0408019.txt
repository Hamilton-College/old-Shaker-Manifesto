Notice — To me, the Temperance movement appears so important as to almost include every other. I feel a deep interest in every thing that tends to diminish the great and growing evil of intoxicating drinks. Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people. I would that every bar-room and drinking saloon was banished from the face of the earth, or turned into something useful. For half a century I have advocated the cause of temperance in all things, and in that time, have experienced but a few days of sickness. I am thankful for our little Monthly. It bears a true testimony, sifted, screened and purified — a little here and a little there. Every contribution is like a sparkling gem, or a diamond, bright, sharp and flinty. The Editors have my blessing and love. Clark Hayden, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
