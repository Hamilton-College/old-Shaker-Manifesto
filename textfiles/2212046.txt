CHOSEN. 'I have chosen you out of the world.' John, xv., 19. Canterbury, N. H. I walk thro' the valley and meet Thee there, I rise to the mountain, still feel ing Thy care, Amid throng or desert thrilling whispers declare 'I have chosen thee, come follow me, I have chosen thee, come follow me.' me.' CHOSEN. Follow Thee, follow Thee ? my whole soul replies, I grasp the hand outstretched and stand with the wise, with the wise. Tho' calm may succeed, tho' calm may succeed or fearful tempest rise, In truth shall my spirit follow Thee.
