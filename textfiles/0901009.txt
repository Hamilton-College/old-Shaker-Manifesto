LORD MAKE ME WHAT THOU WILT JAMES G. RUSSELL If on the rough, tempestuous sea of life, My lot be cast 'mid wild terrific strife ; If lightning's flash and heavy thunders roar, And drenching torrents oft upon me pour; Or if my feeble barque should often strand., Upon some rock-bound coast in stranger land; Exposed to enemies of sin and guilt, My words shall be, Lord make me what Thou wilt. If on the battle-field of strife and might, (Though Lord I know Thou would'st not have me fight) Within its fated ranks I'll meekly stand, Proclaiming peace unto my fellow man; Administering the healing balm of love, With the becoming meekness of a dove ; And though in martyred form my blood be spilt, My heart shall say, Lord make me what Ihou wilt. If as a missionary o'er the earth, Proclaiming gospel truths of priceless worth, Through trackless wilds in weariness I plod, To teach the suffering millions, of that God Who reigns supremely in the realms of light; And guides the planets in their rapid flight, On God's pure word my solid fortress built, I'll still proclaim, Lord make me what Thou wilt. If in the cause of temperance I move, To check the drunkard in his fated groove ; Protesting with that ardency of soul, That would the dissipated course control; I will not count on life's affliction sore, As far surpassing those my Saviour bore; But with a spirit free from stains and guilt Again I'll say, Lord make me whatThou wilt' If, as a watchman on Mount Zion's walls, A sentinel to give the watchword calls; To keep the lurking enemy at bay ; Throughout the weary hours of night and day, I will not count my burdened care unjust, Nor traitor-like betray my sacred trust; But ever true and free from shame and guilt, I fain would say, Lord make me what Thou wilt. Or if within Mount Zion's courts I stand, A humble servant, laborer; heart and hand Shall be devoted truly to the cause, Upholding and supporting Zion's laws, Contented, happy, cheerful in my lot, To know and do God's will the part that's sought; Devoted ever without sin or guilt, I'll ever say, Lord make me what Thou wilt.
