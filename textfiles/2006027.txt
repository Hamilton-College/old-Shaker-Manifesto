Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Elder Henry ï¿½Do you think it would interest the people in any otiier section of the country to learn that here in good old New Hampshire we have just now too much of a good thing. What may the good thing be, do you ask, of which you have too much? Why, rain, rain, RAIN. We have warm rain, cold rain, smart and sharp rain, and rain in every forin, from dampness and drizzle up to fierce showers that last through day and night. And it makes us both glad and sorry. Glad, because the grass, asparagus and strawberry plants are telling wonderful tales of marvelous growth. Sorry, because our gardens are not fully sown, though peas are quite tall, and our potatoes are not planted in full crop. Verily the leading feature of the day is rain, which may be said to reign triumphantly. *
