RESIGNED. SUSANNA BRADY. How hopeful and happy must be the mind that is resigned to the beautiful life of a true Christian who loves it, and lives it each day. Such are true leaders and their examples are the lights that are illuminating our pathway and destroying the power of sin and darkness that surround us to-day. Those self-sacrificing lives, devoted to God do not live for the enjoyment of selfish indulgence, but are guided by a benevolent love for humanity. Such have helped to mature and give strength to the formations of all good Institutions, wherever located. All are in obedience to the will of God, when the purpose is to counteract the depravity of our natures and raise the soul to a better condition. Just so tar as the spirit of Christ rules that body, it will be under the blessing of God, He allows us to make our homes as we may wish to, with many or few, provided we live in love and obedience to his commandments, have love erne for another, and are pure and peaceable. All such have helps to mature and give strength to the great truth which will when souls are prepared to receive it, give to the mind that rest and repose, that is far beyond all the treasures of earth. Until a soul has within itself a reverence for God, and a love for his creatures, can it feel and know the happiness arising through the exercise of charity, love and sympathy, they move in action all the finer feelings of our natures. They enable us to look with compassion and sympathy on those whose lives have not fallen in pleasant places, and give to the soul that meekness and affection that draws the soul to it. Let us bear ia mind that our sphere of action here is not only to benefit ourselves alone, but all or any who wish to live the life of Christ and his followers. Union Village, Ohio.
