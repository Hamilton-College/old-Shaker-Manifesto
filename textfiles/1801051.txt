BRIGHT VISION Canterbury, N. H. There's land beyond, I see the height, Press on, my soul, nor fear the Efc night; A broader truth, a purer love Shall guide thee to those realms above. A voice from out the 'Higher plane' Calls Zion to bap tize again, To live in God in works of truth, In love which over comes the earth.
