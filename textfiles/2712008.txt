To be logical it should be named December instead of October. To be Astronomical, its proper name according to number should be Uni-december; but it does seem the more unnatural statements are made, the better people in general are suited. Theological creeds and dogma's evidence this. For example; The Trinity, Vicarious atonements, heaven, hell, the fall of man, etc. Well, notwithstanding all the inconsistencies of names, October has been quite a favorable month. It has given us but one rainy day, so we have had an opportunity to prepare for the oncoming cold winter. It has also f urnisht us some pleasant associations. We have had gospel relation from Watervliet, N. Y., Harvard, Mass, and Union Village, Ohio. Oct. 14th our lawsuit terminated in our favor, for which we thank kind Providence. Oct. 31st we had an unusual meeting. We assembled in the Meeting House and listened to a lecture by Ernest H. Crosby of Brooklyn, N. Y. The subject; 'Single Tax' as advocated and promulgated by Henry George, lately deceased. The lecture was given by request. It occupied an entire hour, and was very interesting. This closes public meeting for this year, In the evening we had a meeting composed of the Church and North families. Ernest H. Crosby was present and was deeply affected by the spirit of the meeting which was truly inspirational. The Angel bands were with us. We felt their heavenly influence. Meeting occupied at least one and a half hours. Our visitor thought we did not do right in not spreading our doctrines through the aid of missionaries of our faith. Elder Joseph sent me a note stating that the Ministry would leave Enfield on Nov. 4th for Hancock. The probability is that befora-many months an electric R. R. will run from Greenbush through our place to Pittsfield, Mass. Work has commenced on it already. No death to report this month. It is a time of usual health in the Community. Calvin O. Heed. North Family. Nov. 1897. Among the list of visitors we had the pleasure of entertaining the past month is the name of E. H. Crosby, an earnest worker in the social as well as political movements of the day. Spending the Sabbath with us, he was invited to address the assembly on the 'Moral and Religious aspect of Single Tax.' As it was Sunday he took (as he usually does on such occasions) his text from the Bible. 'The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's, but the earth hath he given to the children of men.'�Psa. cxv., 16. While he does not believe that the Single Tax movement is the beginning and end of all things, yet he recognizes the fact that the taxes should be placed on the valuation of the land instead of the individual labor of improving the homestead, which necessarily raises the taxes, to the discouragement of the laboring classes. The land belonging to the Lord who has a right to monopolize it! They who own the land also own the people who live on it, proving his statement by quoting from Gen. xlvii., 23. 'Then Joseph said unto the people, behold have I bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh; lo, here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land,' showing forth the fact that the command of tlie landlord requires obedience or expulsion. In the course of his very interesting discouse he alluded to Elder F. W. Evans1 writing. 'The practical principle which Christ instructed Jesus, was brotherhood, to love his neighbor as himself, and not to appropriate to his own selfish uses to the exclusion of those on the same plane, either of the life elements�earth, air, fire or water.' Roger W. Montgomery a traveler and writer, also spent a week with us. With the many opportunities of giving as well as receiving we find our measure filled with the good things of God. Sarah J. Burger.
