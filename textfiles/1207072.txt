Here is a curious picture of the way in which Sunday was spent in early English times :â€”''The minister used to sit on a Sunday afternoon on the green at Hatton with his pipe and his jug and witness the exertions of his parishioners in the truly English game of cricket, making only one provision, that none should join the party who had not previously been to church. It is needless to say that his presence was an effectual check on all disorderly conduct. He was beloved by his flock during his life, and sincerely lamented at his death.'
