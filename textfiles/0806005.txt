WAITING LIZZIE C. DORE Who of mature years has not sometimes lifted his eyes in mute envy to great Nature which is so calmly waiting? Every heart lives in the expectation of a time to come. But the floods of time have often swept away all the old landmarks of the past ere the expected season arrives. Only those are worthy of the noblest things, who have exercised God's gift of patienceâ€”who have proven their firmness and ability by remembering that waiting does not mean, to single out some object or desire and sit down listlessly by the way-side, waiting for the wheel of fortune, in its revolutions, to cast the treasure at our feet, while we are anticipating our own cherished joys, we can perform, daily and hourly, work for our brethren and sisters. We can wait when we are tempted to censure; we can wait before uttering the unkind retort; we can wait a thousand times upon the weakness of others. And when we have ceased to question, whether life has most sour or sweet, and have learned to make doing good the burden and care of life, God will send to us in some quiet noon-time the reward for all loss, all pain, all grief, and in the hush of that holy hour, our souls will grow stronger, and we shall yearn for a larger and closer inheritance, with Him who is waiting for our perfection.
