DUTY AND PRIVILEGE People seem to have very mixed ideas of duty and privilege. In the first place, they seem to think there are more duties than privileges; in the second place, that it is harder to discharge the former than to enjoy the latter ; and in the third place, that these are quite opposite, if not contrary, things. Each of these propositions is false. There are a hundred things to enjoy where there is one to do. It is difficult to enjoy our privileges, because they are not always perceived to be privileges, and most of us have accustomed ourselves to pull in the harness of duty. We have contracted the habit of making ourselves do what we ought to do. We feel as if there was something glorious in that. We praise ourselves and others, and expect ourselves to be praised, for doing duty. We are all the while magnifying duty. All heroism seems to consist in doing duty. And that is right. But we do not accustom ourselves to enjoy our privileges, and that is wrong. AVe do not blame a man if he permit a proper enjoyment. We do not blame him if he omit a manifest duty. More than all that, so far from being antagonistic, we cannot long study either one or the other without coming to perceive that there is no duty incumbent on man which it is really not a privilege to discharge, and there is no enjoyment possible to man which it is not his duty in some sense to possess. We forget that all existence is the gift of our heavenly Father. If we could only always remember that, how it would change the color of our entire life; we should cease to drag ourselves to the discharge of duty. We should cease to regard life as a hardship because it has its duties.â€” The Watchman.
