From the Diary of Eldress Nancy E. Moore. No. 4. A WORD TO THE YOUNG. Always be respectful to age. Treat those who have borne the burden of life for you with tenderness and due regard. Be ready and willing to receive instruction from them and never speak unkindly to or about them. My heart has been pained with the cruel treatment of the poor, dumb animals of God's creation. I am thankful that I was taught in my childhood that it was wicked wantonly to ill-treat any living thing. This is necessary to be taught to every one who would be a Christian. I would write of my thankfulness for having been so favored in my childhood and youth. The Brethren and Sisters spared no pains to instill into my mind the love and fear of God.
