Narcoossa, Florida Jan. 1898. The tide of winter travel and business has never set so strong toward Florida as it does to-day, all telling a good record for the future of the State. The leading question of the tourist is this,'Is the soil of Florida capable of raising enough to sustain the farmer?' Florida is willing to trust her own unaided charms, even against the false reports that have been made. Let the farmer come and show for himself or go and see what his neighbor has done. The enterprising advertiser of the Pacific coast has caught the men who deal in wheat, and pork and beef, while Florida has done all too little to offset these efforts of the California boomers. Since writing the above we have had another sad experience. Jan. 1, 2, and 3rd. Florida is again visited with an untimely freeze. The mercury fell to 25 deg. below freezing, which killed much of the vegetation that was not protected by fire or shelter. This may, for the present, retard the tide of emigration which has been so strongly turned this way. Like the other states, Florida has a dark side, and has also a bright side. Three years ago we had a big freeze which cut down most of the fruit trees north of the frost line, and the state has hardly recovered from that sad blow. 'A smooth sea never made a skilled mariner.' We can hardly learn humility and tenderness, except by suffering. Andrew Barrett.
