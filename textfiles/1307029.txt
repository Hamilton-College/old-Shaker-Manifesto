MEASLES This infectious disease, with ordinary care is not fatal, as a general rule. Symptoms.â€”The child appears as if it had a cold in the head sneezing, cough, running at the eyes and nose, itching of the face, the eyes are red, and very sensitive to the light. On the fourth day small red spots appear on the face, generally in clusters, and then spread. If you examine them carefully, you will find they are not round, but crescent or half-moon shape. In measles the fever increases as the rash comes out. When it has been out three days it turns brown, and the skin crumbles off like bran. The common saying with regard to measles is 'It is three days out and four days in,' that is, the patient is ill four days before the eruption appears, and that it remains three days. At this state diarrhoea frequently occurs. Let the child be in a room shaded from any strong light. Keep the chest particularly well protected from cold. Give plenty of warm weak drinks, such as tea, arrowroot, etc., and if the breathing is difficult, put on a mustard and oatmeal poultice to the chest, and give a small dose of purgative medicine, if needful. In general this is all that is required, if you only protect the child from getting cold. But if the disease is not running its usual course, and more than this is needful, you will need good medical advice. Housekeeper's Friend.
