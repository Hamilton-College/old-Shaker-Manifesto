THE CORN AND THE LILIES. Said the Corn to the Lilies, ' Press not neai my feet. You are only lilies, Neither Corn nor Wheat; Does one earn a living Just by being sweet? ' Naught answered the Lilies, Neither yea nor nay, Only they grew sweeter All the livelong day, And at last the Teacher Chanced to come that way. While His tired disciples Eested at His feet, And the proud Corn rustled, Bidding them to eat, ' Children, ' said the Teacher, 'The life is more th&amp;n meat. 'Consider the Lilies, How beautiful they grow ! Never king had such glory, Yet no toil they know. ' Oh, happy were the Lilies That He loved them so ! ï¿½Anon.
