TESTIMONY AGAINST THE USE OF TOBACCO. We are glad to note the growing sentiment against the use of tobacco, especially by professing Christians. The writer of this note has recently heard the use of tobacco by ministers condemned in the strongest terms. One man said if he had a pastor who was addicted to its use he would give him to understand that he was never to use it about his house, and that he never wanted his boys to see him using it. Another went even further and said he would not listen to a minister preach who used tobacco. He said he could not receive the pure sweet truth of God coming through such a filthy channel. Apropos of all this is the suggestive testimony of the noted New York missionary, the late Jerry McAuley. He says : 'And here let me say a word about tobacco. I consider it a great stumbling-block in any Christian's life; but when a man has had an appetite for liquor and is trying to keep from drinking, the use of tobacco is positively fatal. It will surely bring him back to his cups. * * * I was led at last, by the grace of God, to do the clean thing to give up every sinful habit, and from that time Jesus has kept me.'
