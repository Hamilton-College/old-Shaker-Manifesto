LETTER FROM WM. FISHBOUGH Brooklyn, Aug. 13,1880. Elder H. L. Eads : Dear Friend — I acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of your book, ' Shaker Theology,' which you were so kind as to send me, accompanied with your letter of August 6. Your expression of sympathy with my views as expressed in the article in the R. P. Journal, gives me strength and encouragement. I feel that there is beginning to be a necessity of more union and cooperation between those spiritualists who believe in God and revere Christ and his re ligion. Yet there is one thing for which I am thankful — it is that since the advent of ' seducing spirits and doctrines of devils ' must come, it comes, with all its force, in these earlier years of the spiritual manifes. tations ; and when it exhausts its direful power, as it will at no distant day, we shall be rid of it forever. There is no element in infidel spiritualism that can give it permanence, though for a time, its specious appeals to the unworthy and selfish propensities of the animal man may lead many astray, and to their own destruction. Meanwhile let us labor and pray, and feel assured that the truth will prevail as surely as God lives. This is about the only thought that has consoled me during these many — many weary years of my life. I have not yet had time to read your book, but I see by its attractive table of contents that I shall read it with pleasure and profit. Again thanking you, I subscribe myself truly and fraternally yours, Wm. Fishbough
