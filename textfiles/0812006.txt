THE SHAKER J95 Let none come to spy out our liberties—to appropriate the knowledge, garnered in the Institution, to selfish, worldly ends—nor to act as critics, or dictators to the Order of Shakers. All such are welcome to establish a better Church than ours—but here they are not welcome. Except a man, or woman accept the Kingdom of Heaven— Shakerism—as a little child accepts earthly things—through parents—neither he, nor she can become a Shaker. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
