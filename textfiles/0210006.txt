Wait no Longer BV ANNA ERVIN ' Shall we wait and wait forever, Still procrastination rueing, Self-exertion trusting never, Always dreaming, never doing? ' Truth claims limitless dominion, Ease and pleasure, what are they? There are souls well worth the winning Who must live through endless day. Souls there are that long have slumbered, Great in heart, and strong in hand; Awake, awake, rise unincnmbered, And scatter trnth throughout the land. 'Wait no longer! Hope, faith, labor,' Bear our spirits to the prize; Let ns give unto our neighbor What has made us heaven-wise. What wait we for? 'Tis for thy blessing, O God of love, of life, and power! Give us zeal to aid progression, And around us light to shower.
