CROOKED STICKS One crooked stick in a pile of wood is sufficient to isturb the whole heap, and if two or three such ticks are placed together you cannot make them lie : °^ ley will tumble down. Nothing can be more trying a o the woodman or the housewife than these crooked n ;icks. Who can abide them? There are some individuals in society who are al' ways finding fault with everything which they do not ' originate themselves. They cannot get on bar- w moniously and help forward any good cause, because w something goes wrong. Unless they can manage everything in their own way, they will do nothing but to be perpetually grumbling. They are uncom- ' fortable brethren—you cannot work with them,— n crooked sticks—you can harmonize them in nothing, r; Such individuals have a mortal disease, of a very a troublesome if not dangerous character. It is difficult to trace its origin, but we suppose the moral system to be affected more or less with the virulent hu- a niors of selfishness, jealousy, self-conceit, pride of tl opinion and ill nature. We know not exactly what c to call it, but suppose the grumbling hypochrondriasis may not be amiss. We venture to prescribe a remedy: Take of Humility, 3 grains, e Forbearance, h ounce, Charity, 3 scruples, ¦ Brotherly love, 2 drachms, Patience, 3 ounces : ]_, Mix in 3 gills of the milk of human kindness. To be kept on hand, and taken whenever the grumbling symptoms appear. If the paroxysms continue, increase the strength of the prescription by a little self-knowledge.
