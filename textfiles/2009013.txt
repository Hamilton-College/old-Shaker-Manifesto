THE LADY HILDEGARDE. [Contributed by Wm. L. Lincoln.] 'Twas at the bleak time of winter, And a drought lay on the land, And bread was scarce and cries of want Were heard on every hand� When a beggar roamed through the village, Meanly, but cleanly clad ; Her back was bent 'neath the burden of age, And her face was pale and sad. ''Give me of your bread, kind stranger. Give me of your bread' cried she, 'That I'm hungry and cold and ragged and old, You all must plainly see.' With many a look of anger, They drove her from th? door; Or if food they gave, 'twas a mouldy crust Or a bone and nothing more. At last at a little eottnge, And humbler than any there Where a poor old man and his feeble wife Dwelt lung with want and care, She paused�that wretched wanderer� And asked awhile to rest On the stens, but the man with a kindly smile Urged in his ragged guest. And gave her a seat at the fireside ; While his good wife in a trice, From the fresh baked loaf of barley bread Cut off an ample slice; And this, with a cup of water. They set before their guest. 'Twas all they had they smiling said, But the food upon her prest. 'May the good Lord ne'er forgive us, Nor e'er bestow us more. If ever the hungry we turn away Unfed from our humble door, The little we have to offer Is God's, not ours, eat pray.' And the beggar ate of the barley bread, And thankful went her way. The Lady Hildegarde up at the castle, The castle stately and grand, Invited the villagers to a feast To be given by her hand ; And smiling they went to the castle, And smiling they entered the hall Where a chair was set for every one And a plate was laid for all. Said the Hildegarde, smiling sweetly, 'Come friends sit up and eat.' And they gathered around the ample board, With glad and willing feet, Then their eyes oped wide with wonder, For they saw�Oh ! sore dismayed !� A mouldy cake, or a mouldier crust, Beside each platter laid With scraps of cold potatoes Which the swine would scarcely eat, And tainted fish, and rinds of cheese, And broken bits of meat. While up in a place of honor. A table was set for two Groaning beneath its weight of food, � And dainties both sweet and new. Then up spoke the noble Kildegarde, And sternly thus she said, �'I was the beggar that roamed your streets Yester-cve and askf d for bread ; I did it to test you people, So anxious was I to know How kind ye were to the hungry and poor Amid the season of woe. And these were what you gave me As yo spurned me from your door; These fold scraps and these mouldy crusts, But these and nothing more ; Not one in this whole village, Save him with yon lioary head, And his dear old wife that asked me in And gave me of their bread : For them is yon table waiting, With richest viands stored; Go, sit ye down, dear servants of Christ, And feast ye at my board ; And want shall be thine no longer, For a home I've given to thee, Where every comfort of life shall be thine Till life shall cease to be. And ye. go home, ye people, Each with your mouldy crust, And bow your heads in very shame. Aye, even to the dust. And back to my noble castle Oh, never come again, Till ye learn, with what measure ye mete, It shall be measured to you again Our Dumb Animals.
