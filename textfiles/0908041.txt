GOD'S LOVE M. R. HILLSGROVE Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. O the love of God how precious, Filling all immensity, 2. By this love we're led to serve Him, And to bear the chastening rod, 3. Gracious Father, we surrender, Time and talents all we claim,â€”And His mercy O how boundless! Lasting as eternity. By this love we hope to triumph, In obedience to his word. Asking to be worthy ever, These to offer in Thy name. Guiding us to perfect heaven, Where no evil can intrude, Bless us with that holy fervor. That shall quicken us to be May Thy love preserve and hold us To a life divinely pure, May this love so freely given, Fill our hearts with gratitude. Sons and daughters of his likeness, By the truth made wholly free. Light the darkest night O Father, With thy love a passport sure.
