TAKE THOUGHT. By Andrew D. Barrett. IS there anything on earth that can equal a true friend? A true friend will never alienate his friendship by hearing imaginary reports. Your grief will be his grief, your sorrow his sorrow. Any other friend is not worth having. Let him go! A sterling character is one who thinks for himself, and speaks what he thinks. He will never swerve from the truth for the sake of keeping friends. I believe if there is any class of people that God will love better than another it is the honest hearted. No doubt that truth and honesty, as Wm. Garrison says, in many cases make enemies. Go straight on and not mind them. A man who has no enemies is seldom good for anything. He is made of that material which is so easily worked that every one has a hand in it. A celebrated character who was surrounded by enemies used to remark, 'They are sparks, if you do not blow they will go out themselves.' Contention only adds food to the flame. 'The flying rumors gathered as they rolled, Scarce any tale is sooner heard than told. And all who told, added something new, And all who heard it, made enlargement too; On every ear it spread, on every tongue it grew.' Such is the old saying which has often been repeated. But ' 'let by-gones beby-gones.' After the tempest comes the calm. Let us brush away the clouds and hurry into the sunshine. Life is too short to be worrying and fretting over the disagreeable past!
