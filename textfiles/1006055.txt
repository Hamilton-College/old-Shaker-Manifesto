CURE FOR DIPHTHERIA ' We publish the following because the experiment may be safely tried, and it is worth trying. Diphtheria is becoming a dreadful scourge, and the writer of what is here said, saw the working of this cure in the hands of an English physician, at a time when the disease was prevalent in an English town. Speaking of the physician's application, the writer says : All he took with him was powder of sulphur and a quill... ' 'All he took with him was powder of sulphur and a quill, and with these he cured every case without exception. He put a spoonful of the flour of brimstone into a wineglass of water, and stirred it with his finger instead of a spoon, as the sulphur does not readily amalgamate with water. When the sulphur was well mixed he gave it as a gargle, and in ten minutes the patient was out of danger. Brimstone kills every species of fungus in man, beast, or plant in a few minutes. Instead of spitting out the gargle, he recommends the swallowing of it. In extreme cases in which he had been called just in the nick of time, when the fungus was too nearly closed to allow the gargle, he blew the sulphur through a quill into the throat, and after the fungus had shrunk to allow of it, then the gargling. He never lost a patient from diphtheria. If a patient cannot gargle, take a live coal, put it into a shovel and sprinkle a spoonful or two of flour of brimstone at a time upon it, let the sufferer inhale it, holding the head over it, and the fungus will die. If plentifully used, the whole room may be filled almost to suffocation, the patient can walk about in it, inhaling the fumes with doors and windows shut. The plan of fumigating a room with the sulphur has often cured most violent attacks of cold in the head and chest.' British Friend
