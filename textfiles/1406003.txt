A story is told by Rabbi G.... A story is told by Rabbi G. at a recent meeting in New York City, of a man in Bagdad who was attacked by another, who, when his assailant ran away, instead of pursuing him turned and ran in the opposite direction until he came to the gate of a burial-ground. 'Let him go where he will, ' said he, ' I shall finally meet him here, and I will say to him,' 'My brother, thou hast struck me. I mightest have struck back. I am strong enough for that but I will not. I might complain to the Caliph and he would banish thee. I might call upon Almighty God to send down curses upon thee for the wrong thou didst me, but I will tell thee what I will do. When the time comes, when we both shall have passed this gate and I shall stand at the portals of Paradise, thou by my side, I shall say : '0 God, I will not go into Paradise unless this brother goes with me. '
