HOW BEES MAKE HONEY. The first thing, they go and try to find a flower to get some honey from and then they call the other bees to go with them until they all get a place. Then they go to work and fill their honey bags but I never knew before that they had a honey bag. I thought that they carried it on their feet because I have seen something on their feet but that was yellow. L. G. W.
