TO OUR GOSPEL KINDRED. Giles B. Avery. Hail, hail, all hail, Dear Gospel Kindred blest Ye noble worshipers at Zion's shrine, Shall not our Lord in mercy give you rest, Clothe with his grace, and feed with love Divine? We ween He will, 'tis prophecy engraved Upon the tablet of their soul's ensigns For every righteous deed is balm to save The souls on whom the sainted jewels shine. List! Hear we not the approaching onward tread Of myriad armies from the heavenly spheres? Welcome, Bright Messengers! These are not the dead, But living lights, well known to sages, seers! Now is the chasm bridge dividing death and life The pure, the good, can meet on life's bright planes, And no emotions rise to gender strife Peace rules our temple; grace in triumph reigns. The world may sing of Heaven, but here 'tis now possessed, Deeds wrought in righteousness the boon hath born. 'Tis not an airy name, by soulless forms professed, It is not painted emptiness, a soulless, bubble form! 'Tis purity in love's embrace, and worldy wiles forgot, 'Tis virtue's charm, in every face, and rich forget me nots Of deeds of goodness, mercy, truth, of all that grace may tell, Of sympathy, of aid forsooth, to all who would do well. Then let the welkin ring with notes of joy. Christ's day of judgment is a day of peace, To souls who, freed from passion's base alloy, Can bid the flow of sins emotions cease. Resounding blessings peal from shore to shore, Of life's vast ocean. Hallowed notes of bliss, Bright angels echo, and the saints encore Till not a toiling traveler the meed shall miss. Quaff then, the nectar, O ye saintly throng, Of union's parody in words sublime, � In raptures which to none but saints belong, But, which to these, shall echo all aleng the line. Let angel gifts your toiling sons inspire, Let graces bright, upon the daughters shine While Heaven steops to lift your spirits higher, T� share the blessings of the home divine. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
