Beloved Elder Henry:--I enclose a letter which will explain itself... Mt. Lebanon, June 13, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½I enclose a letter which will explain itself, pretty well. Benjamin Sones and a son thirteen years old are on their way here from Lewiscoft, Suffolk Co., England. While on the steamer, the boy wrote his address Mt. Lebanon, Columbia Co., N. Y. IT. S. A., and putting it in a bottle, cast it overboard on the 6th. of May. The bottle was found on the 27th. of May at Montauk, L. I., thus showing the course of the ocean current, and how rapid it runs. Such simple facts are valuable as scientific data to philosophers. In love, F. W. Evans.
