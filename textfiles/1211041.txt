Taking grease out of carpets The following mixture is recommended for taking grease out of carpets : Aqua ammonia two ounces soft water one quart, saltpetre one teaspoonful, shaving soap one ounce, finely scraped. Mix well, shake and let it stand a few hours or days, before using, to dissolve the soap. When used pour on enough to cover any grease or oil that has been spilled, sponging and rubbing well and applying again if necessary; then wash oft' with clear cold water. It is a good mixture to have in the house for many things; is sure death to bedbugs if put in the crevices which they inhabit ; will remove paint where oil was used in mixing it, and will not injure the finest fabrics.
