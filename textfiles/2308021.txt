It is customary in some Oriental cities for the night-watchmen to hourly announce the time, adding 'All is well,' when it is so, for the comfort of the inhabitants who are trusting their safety to these vigilant guards. This is very much like our little Home Note corner, where we can pass the word of hope and cheer from one Society to another, though not hourly. It is pleasant to hear of homes being renewed, brightened up and put in order. It shows that there is life within, as much as the quick healing of a wound, speaks well for the healthy vitalizing fluid, which courses through the veins. We regret to learn of drought and frosts as so troubling our Western Societies. Columbia County, N. Y. is one of the best places to live in after all. The weather is always doing better for us than we expect. We can stand a drought without much injury (only to strawberries,) and although we had quite a severe freeze the last week in April, we had no frosts afterward of any amount, although we expected them for 'Hicks said so.' Under these conditions we have and shall be blest with all kinds of fruit, which has been provided with a tree, bush or vine to grow on. The second Sabbath in June witnessed for us an unusual gathering to our morning service. The worthy Ministry from Maine being on a flying visit to Lebanon, we being unwilling to share such privileges � North Family. The heavens are full of promise of the brighter day. We have had quite recently several very interesting callers. They came to us seeking information and to make the acquaintance of our people. We are pleased and encouraged to meet so many thoughtful and intelligent inquirers who are giving their earnest efforts to the solution of the dark problems of human life. We are thankful that Zion is yet able to minister strength and encouragement to such souls, and that the hallowed influence in and about our consecrated homes is felt and the source of it acknowledged and revered. Much has been gained and come to us through the labors of those who have alone, invited the Society at Hancock to meet with us, and it was a season of mutual strength and encouragement. Small families, (where the premises are in accordance) and large meetings is the ideal Community. For the information of all who have so long known our dear Eldress Ann, we would say that she is still the same loving mother as when she stood at the head of Community. Age drafts upon her bodily strength, but she is bright and active, lending her aid in the little home duties as far as her strength will permit, and more than we feel that she ought. She lives to show us the beauty of that character which has made a life work of crucifying self and living to make others happy. Amelia J. Calver. Center Family. July, 1893. We have begun haying. I have been out picking cherries, most of the time for a fortnight past. But I must close this to get off this morning. Inclosed find copy second and completed edition of Synoptic View. Hope you will be pleased with it. I do not yet despair of seeing E. M'Nemar's sermon in Manifesto. Alonzo Hollister. THE MANIFESTO. 191 passed on. We have been blessed beyond hope or thought. We desire an increase for ourselves, for our day and time. We are straightening the wall of our large stone silo on two sides. The unevenness caused considerable loss, and we think with straight walls there will be no necessity for weighting the ensilage when the silo is filled. We have under way considerable improvement in our barnyards with the object of having them in as dry and tidy a condition as possible. Our gardeners have noticed there are fewer insect pests in the gardens and orchards this year than for many previous years. We hope this is general and presages a time of relief from these plagues. A company of our Sisters have been on a visit to our good friends at Watervliet and have just returned with increased strength and a renewal of the spirit that quickens and makes alive. Walter S. Shepherd. Shakers, N. Y.. North Family. July, 1803. On the 25th of June we were privileged to enjoy a season of spiritual communion. Our beloved Ministry and several Sisters from Mt. Lebanon and others from Enfield, Conn., were with us and what a blessed ministration it was. The heavens were opened and holy angels descended with their blessing and strength for the faithful. Also on the 30th ult. a company of Sisters from the North family at Mt. Lebanon came to enjoy a season of social and spiritual interest with gospel relation in the Valley. Through the kindness of a beloved gospel Sister we were favored with the loan of a work entitled, 'The Way, the Truth, and the Life.' by J. H. Dewey, M. D. It is a non-sectarian work and every one who is seeking the higher illumination, desirous to unfold their spiritual life, can peruse the book with both pleasure and profit. At present we are enjoying beautiful growing weather with occasional showers to refresh vegetation. We do not want to 'count our chickens before they are hatched,' but at present we feel safe in saying to our beloved Editor that if he will call around about melon time he will have the pleasure of sampling some choice varieties. A barn is being erected at the North family 50x135 ft. in place of the veteran structure that has performed service for the hist century, being nailed together with hand forged nails. Thus it is in both material and spiritual things, the old must pass away to make room for more advanced and better conditions. Hamilton DeGraio. Second Family. We have lately been privileged to enjoy a season of refreshing gospel love, with gospel kindred from the Mount and elsewhere. Eldress Emily Smith, Elizaette Sutton, Annie Clapp and Alma Shattuck from the Second family, Mt. Lebanon. Caroline Taite and Emily Copley from Enfield, Conn. Also Sisters Martha Anderson, Julia Lincoln, Mabel Lane, and Belle Rulhausen from the North family, Mt. Lebanon. The younger part of the family were much interested in Sister Martha's account of the progress and good done by the 'Self-improvement Society' at the North family, and are quite anxious to form a little band here, for the same purpose. The writer was absent from home on a short, pleasant, and profitable visit to the Society at Canterbury, and was entertained both spiritually and temporally as Canterbury can do it. He did not have the privilege of meeting the first company mentioned, but fully appreciated the love extended here, of which he received a share on his return home. 'Such seasons are delightful., such company we love, And with the true and faithful, right forward we will move.' We are busy securing hay and taking care of other crops. Grain will soon be ready for the reaper. Grass will not be as good a crop as expected last spring. Isaac Anstutt. Shaker Station, Conn. July, 1893. 'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.' Serving God is a profitable employment and a satisfactory service. God abundantly rewards the faithful. There are many living witnesses who can testify to present payment for labor in the vineyard of God. The consciousness of divine approval, the assurance of being a co-worker with God and the eternal witness of the true spirit, are soul-satisfying even though the way seems rough and the trials great. The testimony that God is a sure paymaster is uniform and overwhelming. The heavenly joy gained by living in purity fully compensates for the most trial-tossed life, the heaviest crosses. The virtuous and true will find a heaven of peace and blessedness. Heaven is a state of continual labor and activity that knows no weariness. Let us make our heaven here. Let us do and be as near right as possible now, and strive for higher wisdom. The pamphlets entitled 'Synopsis of Doctrine Taught by Believers in Christ's Second Appearing,' and 'Interpreting Prophecy' by A. G. Hollister, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., are valuable and they should be in every home. Their cost is as nothing compared with their value. ****** There is money in poultry if you know how to get it. We study poultry for profit. In feeding poultry, too much whole grain should be avoided. Poultry should have a dry place to run and roost. Damp and muddy yards are a prolific cause of disease. Daniel Orcutt. South Family. July, 1893. Already I am admonished that the time is here for the few items of interest which have occurred in the short time that has intervened since the last Manifesto, which was so richly laden with interesting topics. The haying season has commenced and is progressing with speed. Twelve large loads were put in on the 8th inst. and the number will increase as the better portions of the mowing fields are reached. The hay loader is a great addition in the field to save time and labor. The garden is looking unexceptionably well. A number of bushels of peas found ready market about the 4th. Quite a number of crates of fine large strawberries also paid well for raising, and a plenty was reserved for home use, the yield being large. Cherries are abundant and of this fruit the preserving jars are well filled. Currants are in good demand at 15 cts. a basket. The sweet corn is about four feet high and promises a good yield. Tomatoes and cucumbers in full bloom, next the fruit. Beets and turnips are now ready for cooking. Potatoes are looking fine, but late. With all these blessings, health prevails. These demonstrations are proof of God's care for his grateful subjects; and love being an evident quality of his nature, will it not ever remain the same? The number of those who look into the great book of Nature where every page speaks of its Divine Author, are wilfully blind to the grandest expressions of truth radiant with meaning, and full of evidence of an All-wise God. Maria Witham. Ayer, Mass. July, 1893. Dear Elder Henry:�We are just at present having beautiful weather, and about all we hear is the click and sound of the mower and tedder. Busy hands and hearts are pushing the business, and every thing denotes a bountiful hay harvest. This gives joy to the farmer's heart. All this is telling how well the stock is going to be kept through the rigor of a hard winter. When we see that vegetation is giving promise of a bountiful harvest, then how dependent we are on a kind and merciful Father who gives his blessings to all who ask, or rather to those who work and wait. There is a joy that meets the farmer as he passes out upon his gardens and fields THE MANIFESTO. 193 and can see them flourishing by the hand of industry. Well may he sing, 'Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice.' Joyfulness is a characteristic element of Christian life, and is full of hope, courage? J�y an(i peace. Andrew Barrett. Enfield, N. H. July, 1893. We left our allotted space in June No. and as a reward, have received in July No. three pages of music, so. we shall do it again. If 'Brevity is the soul of wit,' why not as well applied, when we change the t into s and and add d-o-m? It certainly is in harmony with 'boil it down' which is the needful watchword of every editor, wherever located. We welcome our long-tried friend and counselor Elder Henry C. Blinn, to the vacancy made by the removal of Elder James S. Kaime, from the Ministry of our Bishopric ; two noble examples of consecration and true manhood; (we) say, the mould is broken, wherein such specimens of true worth were fashioned, and can hear the echo of expressions like these, 'hero worship, conservatism' ; not at all; those who come after, have yet to'prove their mettle, no words spoken or written, can give or take merit; we believe in the comrades of our own life battles, in the rising generation also, and are just as hopeful and prayerful, that a faithful few may sacrifice error to truth, maintain the vital principles of the Christ life, thus performing the duties of their day and time with equal honor to both God and man; speed the day. Strawberries have been abundant: 100 qts. of field berries canned for winter use. 10 bushels from the garden have graced the table in all their pristine beauty. Not a Shaker visitor booked for this season, how unneighborly! Mary Ella Briggs. Watervliet, Ohio. July, 1893. We are busy putting up clover hay of which we have about one hundred tons. Crops are good all round. Commenced cutting wheat, of which there are about ninety acres. We purchased a hay loader and it works to perfection. It is like the Irishman who came to this country, and wrote home to his people, telling them this country was a great country. All you had to do was to carry the brick and mortar to the men on the building and they did the work. But it is a little better with our hay loader; it does the work, and all we have to do is to stand on the wagon and place the hay wherever we want it. We have been hauling corn and oats to market. Corn is bringing 40 cts. a bush, and oats 34 cts. Everything is moving on nicely here at Watervliet. We are all striving to do good to our fellow-beings, and helping each other in the right way. Doing unto others as we wish to be done by and having charity for all good Believers who are trying to better their conditions day by day. Two Brethren from White Water came to see us and spend a few days. Brs. A ugust Frederick and William Beckwith. We enjoyed their company very much, and would say here that Believers are welcome to visit our home at any time. We are a small Society, but nevertheless our hearts are with all good Believers in Christ's second appearing. I close by giving my love to all who read this. H. W. Fredrick. Pleasant Hill, Ky. July, 1893. Beloved Elder Henry:�I have been looking over various numbers of the Manifesto to-day. What a fount of heavenly virtues beams forth from the pens of our inspired ancient worthies! There I find our gifted Elders, F. W. Evans, H. L. Eads, G. B. Avery, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, and scores of others beautifully illustrating the sublime teachings and example of those self-sacrificing, devoted souls, who received and kept the gospel in its purity in days gone by. I always hail with joy the Manifesto 194 THE MANIFESTO. so fraught with precious truths. O, for a score of Brs. like Isaac Anstatt and truthful sayings so bravely proclaimed. We are a little band away out here in a region called the 'dark and bloody ground;' toiling and struggling with foes within and without; intermingling with the world, dependent on them for aid in our daily toil. ''Oh! what will .the harvest be?' Communities have sinned and strayed (in many things) from the true fundamental principles of the faith, therefore, few in numbers and works. Though like the Xinevites we sometimes cry out,�''Where are the hundreds and thousands that were to flock to Zion for the food of eternal life?' From early childhood we have watched and waited, and still the vision tarries. And, where rests the responsibility? A certain inquirer, visiting us once, said, 'If the testimony you put forth was strictly lived to, people would fall before you like grass before the scythe.' What a responsibility is resting upon the subjects of this faith! All praise and honor to your faithful heart and toiling hands, in keeping afloat the highly prized Manifesto. May your days be long and blissful. I was so impressed with the article of Br. Isaac Anstatt, that I felt like making a faint effort to add to your columns a few lines. We are having very warm and stormy weather. Our fruit about half a crop, meadows and grain fine. Kavcy L. Rupe. Shirley, Mass. July, 1893. Beloved Elder Henry :�Your kind favor of the 6th and the Manifesto, also a copy of Friend Kobinson's book, received. It has much information, in an attractive form, and people will be looking after it more and more as the necessities of the case will require. In consideration of the great changes that are going on, it does not require prophetic eyes to see, must go on, in the minds of the people, as they feel the increasing pressure resulting from panic and the accumulation of riches on one hand and consequent impoverishment on the other. Politicians may shout themselves hoarse, to little avail. The Heaven-born plan of Christian Communism is the panacea for poverty, destitution and the inequality so deplorable in our day. Would that the masses could see these things in their true light, and be willing to pay the price required to enjoy the blessings of a peaceful, pure relation. Nothing can well be imagined more wicked and deplorable than the spirit of anarchy that is becoming so prevalent in Europe especially, and gathering strength in our own country. How true the figure� 'Men shall hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.' Will repeated failure prove the fact to them that 'All things shall work together for good to them that love God and keep in the way of his counsel?' How sad it is to think that, 'The ways of our Zion do mourn, that none come up to her feasts'�while so many are needy, but hungering and thirsting after worldly pleasure, rather than the self-denying way of Jesus and his faithful followers; would also the world could know that they can not follow where lie never went on the generative plane. But I would not weary you or your readers. We have been blest by a short visit from your wTell known correspondent Br. Daniel Orcutt of Shaker Station, Conn. We are well along with haying, a beautiful crop, and thus far in excellent condition. Our first green peas were enjoyed on June 25 th instead of as mentioned in my last had been previously on June 7th, showing a great difference in the seasons. John Whiteley.
