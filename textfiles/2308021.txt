Shirley, Mass. July, 1893. Beloved Elder Henry :�Your kind favor of the 6th and the Manifesto, also a copy of Friend Kobinson's book, received. It has much information, in an attractive form, and people will be looking after it more and more as the necessities of the case will require. In consideration of the great changes that are going on, it does not require prophetic eyes to see, must go on, in the minds of the people, as they feel the increasing pressure resulting from panic and the accumulation of riches on one hand and consequent impoverishment on the other. Politicians may shout themselves hoarse, to little avail. The Heaven-born plan of Christian Communism is the panacea for poverty, destitution and the inequality so deplorable in our day. Would that the masses could see these things in their true light, and be willing to pay the price required to enjoy the blessings of a peaceful, pure relation. Nothing can well be imagined more wicked and deplorable than the spirit of anarchy that is becoming so prevalent in Europe especially, and gathering strength in our own country. How true the figure� 'Men shall hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.' Will repeated failure prove the fact to them that 'All things shall work together for good to them that love God and keep in the way of his counsel?' How sad it is to think that, 'The ways of our Zion do mourn, that none come up to her feasts'�while so many are needy, but hungering and thirsting after worldly pleasure, rather than the self-denying way of Jesus and his faithful followers; would also the world could know that they can not follow where lie never went on the generative plane. But I would not weary you or your readers. We have been blest by a short visit from your wTell known correspondent Br. Daniel Orcutt of Shaker Station, Conn. We are well along with haying, a beautiful crop, and thus far in excellent condition. Our first green peas were enjoyed on June 25 th instead of as mentioned in my last had been previously on June 7th, showing a great difference in the seasons. John Whiteley.
