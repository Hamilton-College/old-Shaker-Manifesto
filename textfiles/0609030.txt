SPIRIT OF THE FARM Tite practice of trimming leaves from tho vinea to expose grapes to the sunlight, we have found by experience to be an error. Instead of grapes ripening quicker, those trimmed wore several days later than those left unexposed to the sun. The quality of the fruit from trimmed vines aleo suffers. ^ Keep this until next season : A neighbor of ours had suffered exceedingly from onion maggot. He used plaster last season and reduced his loss twothirds. This year lie rolled his bed until the ground was hard; sowed it, and as soon as the onions would bear it, tread the earth on both sides next to the onions, so as to press them snugly. We visited his onions lately—not the sign of a maggot anywhere. ¦£¦ Jeremiah Low, of this place, has been a valuable, amateur gardner. Recent mishaps, with threescoro and ten and more years, add to his inability to do. But he has produced somo valuable new fruits — early pears, corn, grapos, mulberries, the white wax bean, and a thornless black-cap raspberry, ever-bearing, that we do not believe can be equaled in the world. • -feA. J. Downing advocated the ploughing of orchards, and our experience has invariably proved, that doing so is much tho best plan — turning under clover or some green crop — rather than pasturing or idling. -fa Great differences exist between the wheat fields of Shaker farms in Genesee Valley. Recent reports say, some yield only ten bushels to the acre, while others are yielding thirty. Why this difference on alluvial soils? -^A spading machine is the latest novelty, and a valuablo one too. Tested in Albany county, last week of July, it spaded as fast as three horses could walk with it, a surface three feet wide. The Country Gentleman says : ' If it had spaded only two feet wide, two horses could leave the ground in better trim than ploughing, cultivating and harrowing' — three operations. Its work is eight inches in depth.
