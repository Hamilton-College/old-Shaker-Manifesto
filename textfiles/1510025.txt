NOTES NOTES. Working in the interest of righteousness, we have a broad and beautiful field of labor. In this we find so much to do that we have no need to fear. We shall always, in all probability find those who will need assistance on the journey of life. To do right or righteously is quite an essential feature in the pursuit of happiness. The day has gone by when a mere profession will be of any vital worth to the individual who is bound for the kingdom of God. A man will be known better, in this work, by what he accomplishes among men, than by the multitude of words which he may speak. If he seeks to establish a good name in the society of his friends, he must do right. ' Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you,' is the only safe rule. For a man to say he is honest is not sufficient evidence to warrant the fact. The manner in which he conducts his business will much more readily determine the fact. To say that he is a Christian because he performs some few religious offices, cannot be a very permanent foundation upon which to stand. Religion does not consist in the performance of outward rites, but it should be made a discipline of the soul. Bad men, sometimes do good deeds as a matter of policy, expecting through this means to obtain some advantage as a compensating reward. Righteousness may be the pleasant accompaniment of every moral and religious life. Creeds, forms and ceremonies however much they may be used, can never build up or establish a character. This will be accomplished only by earnest and persistent efforts to do right, because it is right. Prayer, even may be a form of words, and these may be repeated while upon the bended knee, and yet be destitute of righteousness. Alms may be bestowed upon the poor, and the deed bear the outward form of a charitable gift, and yet the whole may be more closely allied to selfishness, rather than to righteousness. Christian professors may sometimes place more value upon their organization than upon the quality of fruit which their lives bear while in the organization ; forgetting that most essential lesson which Jesus gave to his disciples,ï¿½ 'By their fruits ye shall know them.' ;'Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?' Churches, Societies and Institutions are all very essential for the good and happiness of mankind. If it might be possible to be without them, it is certainly of great advantage to have them. Having established the Church or Society, the principle of righteousness should be of the utmost importance in every transaction. And even this should be an active and living growth in which a healthy circulation of gospel duties maybe maintained. All quite well understand that the advent of the gospel work was to be known for the promotion of peace, and for the manifestation of brotherly love. Those who accepted it would be designated as the sons and daughters of God, and their righteousness would be one of the marked features of the order. This test of a religious body should always be open for inspection, as a system of religious discipline that did not make righteousness one of the most essential points for cultivation, could not in this ag3 of the world be regarded as the spiritual house of the Lord our God.
