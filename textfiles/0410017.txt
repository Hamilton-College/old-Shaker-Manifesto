ANSWER My Dear Friend : Yours of the 13th inst., came to me by last evening's mail. I was pleased with its con- tents from beginning to end. I love the breathings of your spirit — your frankness — sincerity and child-like dependence. That ' old book ' that has so quietly rested in the ' trunk,' contains some beautiful instructions, ' profitable,' to those of enlightened understanding,' for doctrine, reproof and cor- rection, that the man, or woman of God, may be thoroughly furnished unto all good works.' If we give heed to the instructions of that book, we cannot give to the children a stone, when they ask for bread ; neither say to them, when cold and naked, ' be ye warmed and fed,' without imparting to them of our treasures. Our heavenly Father and Mother — God — give freely to those who ask, if they ask in faith and sincerity. If we freely receive, it is our duty to freely give. This is the reason, dear child, that I take the earliest opportunity to reply to yours, that you may feel, we have ears to hear and hearts to sympathize with you, in your aspirations for a higher life. Verily, my friend, God hath dealt kindly and generously with us ; and after many years' experience, we are enabled to say, that the eyes, ears and hearts, of those who seek pleasure in worldly things — in unrighteousness — can neither see, hear, nor understand the things that God hath prepared for those who love him so truly, that they consecrate all to his service ; and, who not merely say, ' Lord — Lord,' and retain all that is self-pleasing, and think to pay their way to heaven and happiness, by giving a large salary to a hireling priest-hood — as they would pay their fare from New York to Cincinnati, in a railroad car ; but through self-sacrifice, and toil, they gain the treasures of eternal life. Such find the highway that is cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in. The waters of the great deep (sea of worldly, carnal pleasure,) are dried up, and truth lovers will pass over and come unto Zion, joyfully. They will gladly leave the house of bondage in the dark and shadowy land and seek to find the place, where broad streams and rivers flow; where are green and living pastures, warmed and vivified by the sunlight of truth and Divine revelation. I wish you were free from all claims that the world has upon you, that you might ' Come home now' and take with us the Christian's cross, and with us wear the victor's crown! While duty calls you to remain where you are, you may come in spirit, or by letter, to me — to us — and freely make known your feelings and desires ; and while you are thus separated from us, attending to present duties, if you feel at times that you are surrounded by temptation, and dangers attend you, remember your Shaker friends. Come to us, and we will give you love that is not of the world, to strengthen, shield and protect you. Ask any question freely, and we will be honest and deal frankly with you. If we possess knowledge of the true Christian life and character which you are not in possession of, we have received that knowledge through practical obedience to truth, and from spiritual guides and teachers, who are progressed beyond us,and we have no cause for boasting; but freely impart to others, of the treasures that have been so mercifully bestowed upon us. We are thankful to know, there are many, at this time like yourself, who are ready to burst their swaddling clothes — open their eyes to simple truth — and leave the dark shadows of mysticism which have gathered around the bible by false teachers and worldly interpreters, until all has become a myth. With you, I sorrow in spirit that those who would thankfully receive food for their famishing souls, do not know where to seek it. We must pray to God to send Agencies to them, as he has done to you, to show them the way, the truth, and the life. That good Being, who endowed us with reason and intelligence, will never ask us to surrender those God-given powers, in regard to religion. Reason, Science and Religion are in perfect accord. So hope on — hope ever — Write whenever you feel like it. Thine in Christian friendship. Antoinette Doolittle
