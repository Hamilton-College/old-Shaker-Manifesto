WHITHER ARE WE DRIFTING? Marinda M. Keniston. This, to me, is one of the weighty questions of the day, as I note the method of holding the so-termed 'Consecrated property of Believers,' by the employing of so much help from the world. As I see it, this practice prevails to such an extent in some Societies, as to place the Brethren and Sisters in the minority. Only a few more years of this mode of management, and who will be the legal owners of this Consecrated Property ? Echo answers, Who? I cannot be reasoned into the belief that this is the right way to merit the prosperity and blessing that is promised those who forsake the earthly order and come into the spiritual relation of Brethren and Sisters in Christ's kingdom. Are not the Believers of the present day drifting away from the proper appropriation of the property that was consecrated and dedicated by the founders of our institution, designed to become the inheritance of those seeking to become the true followers of Christ and Mother Ann? Some one has affirmed, and most truthfully too, I claim, that the more hired help a family or Society employ, the fewer will be the genuine Believers ; and why not, if 'Hands to work and hearts to God' is the cherished motto of the truly consecrated members of the virgin order? No thinking, reasoning mind can deny the assertion, that depending on hirelings to the extent that some of our Societies at the present time are doing, has a growing tendency to create indolence on the part of the members, and with it a train of evils, which surely cannot aid in bringing out those qualities of mind which characterize the true Believer ; or in other words, the genuine Shaker. Hence, arises the query, Whither are we drifting ? Will some one reply? Enfield, N. H.
