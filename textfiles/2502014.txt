West Pittsfield, Mass. Jan. 1895. Like a tale that is told the book of the Old Year is written. Each of its three hundred and sixty-five pages bears its message, and now 'Finis,' is signed, the book closed, and sealed with prayer, is sent speeding on its way to eternity, joining others, each numbered volume bearing the history of our lives. As we open the new book entrusted to our keeping, bound so closely that we can see but one page at a time, let us entitle ; 'Noble Endeavor,' and, dedicating it to God and friends around us, write the pages with devotion and care. As a New Year's present, the brown, bare earth around us, was given a garment of glistening snow. To be sure, it has grown rather dingy in appearance, and many thin places are visible, but we think soon another will be provided. With a view to improving each opportunity, sleighing parties were organized, and three double loads, on as many days, went to enjoy a ride over the snow. Each trip was pronounced a complete success, and enjoyed to the utmost, especially by the children. To-day the men have commenced filling our new Cold Storage with ice, which I hear is about 12 in. thick. On the 3rd inst. the State board of highway commissioners arrived at our place. The object of their visit being to inspect the road leading from Hancock to Lebanon, preparatory to building a continuation of the State road now commenced in West Pittsfield. Elder Joseph, of the Central Ministry, and several Brethren from Mt. Lebanon, were also here. They drove over a route leading across meadows, and through woods, finally coming into the highway, thereby securing a grade more even and less dangerous, than the regular road over the mountain. Though no decision was made, it is quite certain that a better road will be the result. Fidelia Estabrook.
