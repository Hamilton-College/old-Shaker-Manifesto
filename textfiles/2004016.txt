In Memory of SISTER LUCINA. Sarah A. COLLINS. Once more we've met together, And with a care we tread :� For one dear form is absent, They tell us, she is dead. That she has gone before us, Where soon we all shall dwell; She'll try, no doubt, to help us To do life's duties, well. For she was always ready To do wbate'er she could, When she was young and able, And when her health was good. And since she had grown feeble, We've often heard her say ;� 'I want to help you, Sisters, I wish I could each day.' Though she has now departed To realms, both bright and fair, She cannot soon forget us, Fond objects of her care. We're sure a robe of beauty, Of glory all her own; In early life was fashioned Complete when older grown. So rest, dear Sister, kindly, Rejoice in songs of love; And when our mission's ended, We'll meet in worlds above. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
