A CHRISTMAS OFFERING. Alma I. Shattuck. One year has swiftly passed since last Christmas ; can we review it with comfort, with a satisfaction that it has been well spent or, do wTe look back upon it with regret that it has not redounded to our benefit as we wish it had ? if so, do we realize that it is ourselves that have formed the picture which we see before us, do we once think, that we, individually, could have made the picture one that would daze our eyes to behold the brightness thereof, and could with gratification know this picture was showing how well we had improved the last year? These reflections have certainly awakened my thought to a sure and full determination to be more careful, prayerful and faithful, and to be forming a picture, the ensuing year, with a sky bright and the sun shining, instead of a cloudy horizon that the sun can scarcely peer through. At the closing of the year, I hope I can, with all, behold in retrospect the scenes of the first given picture. It will be a comfort and pleasure, to know I have been successful in carrying out my determination. This can only be done by taking up a daily cross, accepting pleasantly, reverses as they come, making the path of others smooth according to my ability, helping the weak and feeble, and setting an example of uprightness before all, while patterning the good life of my Savior. I certainly have great cause to be thankful for the many blessings I am partaker of, and my earnest prayer is, that I may so live the passing year that I can at its close receive the reward of a justified conscience. I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
