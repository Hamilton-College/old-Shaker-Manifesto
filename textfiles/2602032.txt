Cosmopolitan No one ever thought of introducing so expensive a feature as lithographic color work in the days when the leading magazines sold for $4.00 a year and 35 cents a copy. But times change, and the magazines change with them. It has remained for The Cosmopolitan, sold at one dollar a year, to put in an extensive lithographic plant capable of printing 320,000 pages per day (one color.) The January issue presents as a frontispiece a water, color drawing by Eric Pape, illustrating the last story by Robert Louis Stevenson, which has probably never been excelled even in the pages of the finest dollar French periodicals. The cover of The Cosmopolitan is also changed, a drawing of nage length by the famous Paris artist Rossi, in lithographic colors on white paper takes the place of the manilla back with its red stripe. Hereafter the cover is to be a fresh surprise each month.
