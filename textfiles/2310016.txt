PURITY. Lucy S. Bowers. It is a wondrous gift of glory bright, Rich essence of divine and sacred grace, Upon whose whiteness evil finds no place To mar the beauty of its pearly light. 'Tis clear as sunlight from its golden height; Deep as the rolling seas that none may trace; High as the blue heaven's etherial space, And strong as the eternal power of right. Then vanish every thought of doubt and ill, .Of sin, of death, of shadows dark and deep, That every soul this substance may infill; In every heart its holy presence keep, Till thoughts and deeds and life and human will Are molded in it, and its glory reap. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
