Watervliet, Ohio. Sept. 1893. Sixce our last letter we have been threshing our grain, and the yield is not quite as much as we expected. However, we will be satisfied with what we do get, as we know God will help us in other things. Wheat has averaged about fifteen bush, to the acre, and oats thirty bush. As the price is now on wheat we shall not grow rich very rapidly by selling it. At present it is bringing only 54 cts. per bushel. We have had some visitors from White Water. On the 12th of August, Brs. John Tyler, George Eushman, and Albert Masters, were with us for several days, and we trust the visit was reciprocal. We also entertained another company of one Brother and five Sisters from White Water on the 25th of August. We all enjoyed the season with a great deal of satisfaction, and trust it will be the means of doing a great deal of good. Our love and our interest is for the whole household of faith. //. jr.
