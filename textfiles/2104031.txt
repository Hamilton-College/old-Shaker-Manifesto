SONNET. Lucy S. Bowers. O God, illuminate our hearts to-day; [ness; Yea, judge us with thy living righteousfectness Teach us to know the soul's true perWhen turned from evil to Thy glorious way. Lead Thou our sight from things that outward lay To inner views, to seek our own redress For every sin, and others trust and bless; We have a nobler purpose when we love and pray. The human errs, but Thou art ever true; In justice Thou canst measure every need, At variance with evil through and through, At peace with truth wherever it may lead; God of the holy, and of the wayward too, Bless with Thy virtue every thought and deed. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
