A WONDERFUL MACHINE The enormous capacity and lightning-like rapidity of the Hoe printing press for doing work are almost incredible. It turns off in first-class shape 24,000 papers, sometimes 27,000, and has done as high as 30,000, in an hour, or at the marvelous rate of six, seven, and eight papers in one second. These papers too, it must be remembered, are divided by it uniformly and accurately into pages, put in book form, the backs glued, the edges cut, and the last of all are folded in the nicest possible manner, ready for delivery
