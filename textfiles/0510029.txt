OATMEAL AS FOOD The advantages of oatmeal as an article of food are getting to be tolerably well understood, and all persons who have commenced its regular use will agree that its nutritious and health-giving properties have not been overrated. Chemical analysis shows that oatmeal is richer than wheat in starch and the nitrogenous compounds, the first being fat-forming and the latter flesh-forming constituents. As compared with barley and corn, oatmeal is found to be still richer in these elements. As food, it sits lightly on the stomach, and is exceedingly digestible. It is one of the best articles of food to give to growing children, and is especially valuable, also, to persons who do brain work. A little oatmeal mixed in water 'makes a cool and refreshing drink, and farmers and contractors who supply their laborers with it will find it far better than any form of stimulant, and in the long run more satisfactory to the men themselves. Oats grown in far northern localities have larger and plumper grains than any other, and it is for this reason that Scotch oatmeal ranks so high. Excellent oats for mealing, however, are produced in Canada, the New England States, Central and Northern Michigan and Wisconsin.
