PREACHING. By Nancy G. Danforth. WHEN quite young, more than fifty years ago, I attended a meeting where the preacher took for his text the words from Revelation 'Behold I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man as his work shall be.' Assuming the judgment-seat, he placed his audience on the left and began dispensing the rewards. Presently a man in the audience arose and exclaimed, 'If you have got any of the love of God why, for God's sake don't you preach it and not preach hell and d- - - - - - - - -n all the time ?' Though I was very young in Christian experience it taught me a lesson which I have never forgotten, that we are all apt to preach by either word or action whatever we possess. Then as servants of Christ it becomes our duty to labor for that degree of the love of God that it will be easy to manifest it at all times. We sometimes sing of the ' 'Better land where the fountains of God's eter- 32 THE MANIFESTO. nal love overflow on every side.' Why not bring the 'better land' to us now, by showing the love of God in all we do and say ? L?t the fountains of love overflow to all, that they may know that we aro indeed the disciples of the loving Teacher. Then there will be found no room for condemnation of brother or sister when with that love or 'charity which covers a multitude of sins,' we turn from beholding the faults of others and closely investigate our own with the view to self-improvement. Then we can preach the love of God in such a manner that it will be felt and acknowledged that there is a power above the powers of earth. East Canterbury, N. H.
