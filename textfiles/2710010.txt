Being blest�if it is a blessing�I improve this rainy opportunity for penning a few Home Notes for The Manifesto . If it does not rain every day, we hope to finish our haying this present week. Some of us are trying to mend our ways both spiritual and temporal. The spiritual is an uphill path, straight and narrow but it requires a strong, unflinching will and a firm determination to ascend continuously the rugged hill of heavenly progression, and few there be who undeviatingly and successfully make the ascent. Our temporal paths we have rectified in part, and if strength and life are continued to us, we may complete the work of leveling the pavements so that we may walk safely without stumbling. Our harvest is great but the laborers are few. Grain is under shelter, also most of our hay. The gathering of apples, pears and plums call for preservation. We pickt the first ripe tomatoes this year on the 26th day of August. We ought to have had tomatoes at least a fortnight earlier, and doubtless should, if the rain and wind had not injured them sadly. Public meetings opened July 4th and we have not missed a Sabbath since. There are several able expounders of our faith, so we are ably and honorably represented. Several novitiate members have joined the North Family. 'In love the righteous are remembered While they journey here below. Every toil and care is numbered Grief and sorrow as they flow.' Calvin G. lieed. North Family. Sept. 1897. The slanting rays of the Autumnal sun, the opaline mists that enwrap the distant hills in dreamy radiance, the gorgeous and brilliant coloring of the foliage, all remind us that we are in the month of October. Despite the golden glory of the month, we know that death and decay have replaced life and growth. But the year dies royally. And like a long and godly life that grows more beautiful towards its close, so the earth seems to enwrap herself in a soft, spiritual brightness, before the melancholy rhythm of the wintry wind-harp sighs its last requiem. The passing season has brought its usual activities. The Brethren have harvested over five hundred tons of hay, which has been secured under the most unfavorable circumstances. The heavy rains of the past season in this locality, have done considerable damage; the usually quiet, meandering mountainstreams have been swollen to impetuous torrents. We have gathered fifty-six bushels of cultivated blackberries; the greater part were sold in the Pittsfield market. Sisters Martha Anderson and Lydia Staples are spending the present week at the Chatham Fair, exhibiting the handiwork of the Sisterhood, from which they expect satisfactory sales. Several companies of the Brethren and Sisters have also visited the Fair. We should be glad to speak of our spiritual status, but things that appeal to the inner senses are more difficult to describe, than those that speak to the outer eye and ear. Our wealth consists not in houses and lands, but in the noble, uplifted lives of inspired Brethren and Sisters, who are seeking for the highest expression of truth in their daily lives, having these, we are rich in all things. Despite outward evidences to the contrary, never before was spiritual evolution in progress as to-day. It is the duty of each and all to cultivate the truth-seeing power of the soul, to follow the inner light that it may shine brighter and clearer. In doing this we may not only be able to flash its bright rays upon the pathway of others, but all errors, mistakes and seeming chains of spiritual bondage will melt away before the shining of the God light within. For are we not made to stand as sons and daughters of God holding all things under our feet? Annie R. Stephens.
