Juvenile. Dear Children:--'Fear God and keep his commandments... Enfield, Ct. 1890. Dear Children :''Fear God and keep his commandments.' The true fear of God is not to be understood in the sense of terror nor slavish droad. Good people possess the true fear of God, but the bad do not. The true fear of God is perfectly consistent witli true love; you can cherish this^ar, and yet love God, as did Jesus and the Apostles. 'The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.' It is the highest kind of wisdom. Job's language agrees precisely with this: 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil, is understanding.' The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, and those who do this will have great spiritual prosperity. 'Wisdom is profitable to direct.' 1 'With conscience clear, you have no fear.' Where humility is there is wisdom. Humility is a beautiful ornament, and very much you need it. Be early wise and shun the pitfalls of sin. Strive for the crown unfading. In wisdom's path ever abide, spotless, blameless, purified. Guard your virtue as the 'pearl of great price.' Only by unremitting watchfulness can your innocence be protected. You often feel the greatest security when you are in the greatest danger.. Watch and pray, day by day. Better acknowledge your faults than try to conceal them. Improve the flying moments and your lives will be filled with good deeds. What saintly characters you meet as you journey along'! Walk in their footsteps. So live that others may imitate your example and be virtuous. The making the best use of the talent you have, instead of wasting time in sighing for what you have not, is wisdom in the highest degree. Think of the parable of the talents. How frequently the beautiful lesson is veri fled. To those who improve the one little talent will other talents be given. What an easy lesson to learn. 'Little by little, a wise youth said, As each day more wisdom he stored in his Little by little in virtue he grew, [head. Learning each day to be pure and true.' Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt. Beloved Elder Henry;--We wish you to know how much... Sonyea, N. Y., Mar. 2, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry;ï¿½We wish you to know how much we all prize the Manifesto. Surely all Believers ought to feel grateful to our Editor and all the willing hands who aid in its publication. It is a welcome visitor to our home, and we think it grows better and better. Observing that sometimes there are letters from the children printed in the Manifesto, we submit to your judgment, three short letters written by some of our children. The writers are only eleven and twelve years of age, and these are their first efforts in this line, and should you not deem them worthy of a place, we can try again, and not feel hard about it. The month of March has come in with a little snow, and we may possibly have some ice yet. We find that the peach buds are not all destroyed, but they probably will be, if we now have weather cold enough to make ice. Kindly accept the love of Groveland Brethren and Sisters. Bemember us in love to all your Order. Yours sincerely, Ella E. Winship.
