Beloved Elder Henry;--We wish you to know how much... Sonyea, N. Y., Mar. 2, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry;ï¿½We wish you to know how much we all prize the Manifesto. Surely all Believers ought to feel grateful to our Editor and all the willing hands who aid in its publication. It is a welcome visitor to our home, and we think it grows better and better. Observing that sometimes there are letters from the children printed in the Manifesto, we submit to your judgment, three short letters written by some of our children. The writers are only eleven and twelve years of age, and these are their first efforts in this line, and should you not deem them worthy of a place, we can try again, and not feel hard about it. The month of March has come in with a little snow, and we may possibly have some ice yet. We find that the peach buds are not all destroyed, but they probably will be, if we now have weather cold enough to make ice. Kindly accept the love of Groveland Brethren and Sisters. Bemember us in love to all your Order. Yours sincerely, Ella E. Winship.
