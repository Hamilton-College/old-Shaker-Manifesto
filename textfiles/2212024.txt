Shaker Station, Conn. Nov. 1892. The delightful weather of the past month has proved favorable for the securing of crops and making preparations for the coming of winter. Some repairs are being made on barns and other out buildings. The year which is drawing to a close has been crowned with blessing in every way. Health has been the fullest and best. At all times would we appreciate the innumerable blessings bestowed upon us, and the love which passeth understanding and would ever trust in those promises which never fail. M. W.
