Julia A. Scott. My Dear Friend:--Your letter came near... Troy, N. Y. Dec. 1890. Julia A. Scott. My Dear Friend :ï¿½Your letter came near being a Christmas offering. It wras a surprise and pleasure to hear from you. I feared you would forget the promise made, but, here is visible proof of your kindly remembrance. I too, am glad that 'Mother Betsey' still lingers on earth. I was much in- terested in her, and have many times thought of our pleasant interview. Many times have I read the names so kindly written in the book given me. Her name is first, and as I trace the letters bold and clear, I seem to see her face, and hear her voice. Bless her! my soul-arms embrace her, and on her lips I press a loving kiss. May her living presence be with you another year. Like a sheaf of full grown, golden grain she stands, waiting to be 'gathered in.' My tenderest love to her. The 'Testimonies of Mother Ann,' I have read with much interest, and here I will make my 'confession.' I believe she was sent of God, to do the work she did, and lay the foundation of the Societies that have been the outgrowth of her labors on earth. I believe she was spiritually illuminated ; that in her experience she passed from darkness to light; from ignorance to understanding ; from simple belief in a truth to a positive knowledge of truth, of divine law and order. I am no saint, wish I was ; but, in my life, 1 have had experiences that have taught me some of the possibilities of the human soul; that in certain conditions it may climb heights, see sights, fathom mysteries and learn lessons of wisdom, not otherwise known to man, and never found in books. It cannot be written. Ah, well are ye that follow, looking upward to that beaconlight set out to guide your feet in purer, pleasanter paths, even the paths of peace. The 'Manifesto' is a treasure-house. In its numbers I find many jewels of thought and inspirational poetry. All these prove, that while you are shut in from the coarse elements of the world, you have fields of thought rich and fertile. Your hearts encircle every problem of life. The great questions of the day and age ; the purification of the avenues of worldly life. Who can better point the way to the heights of holiness, and the better adjustment of law, political and social, than the peace-loving Shakers ? Have you not worked out each problem theoretically and practically ? Heaven bless your Society ! May its purifying, vitalizing elements, bless the world and bring the dawn of that day, or period, when earth's children can say, thy kingdom has come, thy will is done on earth as it is done in heaven. Mother Ann was a goodf Prophet; Trust her words and fear not, her coming was not in vain. Remember me in love to each and every Sister. Thanks to Sister Minerva for her pretty card and Augusta for her remembrance. I often think of our pleasant interview and wish for another. I hope to see you next summer, and sooner if it is possible for you or any of the sisters to visit Troy. Don't fail to call. My husband joins me in a New Year's Greeting to all. Truly Your Friend, LULA SWORMSTEDT.
