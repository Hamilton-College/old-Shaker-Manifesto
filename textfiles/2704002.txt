O my Father! My Father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof [This poem is an inspiration. The heading is a revelation. I was passing from our Infirmary on Monday, Jan. 25, three days previous to Brother Frederic Sizer's decease. When I was midway between the street gate and the house, in the air above the house these words were repeated,�'My Father, my Father! the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof.' These words sounded new and strange to me. Israel being referred to, I inferred the statement must be in the Bible, and found it as quoted above. I questioned what the meaning of this manifestation could be, and was strongly imprest that it referred to Br. Frederic's demise. I returned to the Infirmary and said to the Sisters, 'Frederic is not long for this world, he will soon pass away.' He deceased Wed. Jan. 27, at 4 o'clock p. m. The poem is the result of this revelation. I do not now call to mind any incident of my life that has so deeply and almost uncontrollably affected me as this has, and still does. The funeral was held Sabbath, Jan. 31T at 2 o'clock, p. m. At the opening of the service I read the poem with a swollen heart and tear-stained eyes. C. G. R.] O My Father! My Father! the Chariot of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof.�2 Kings, xiii', 14. By Elder Calvin G. Beed. This passage I heard in the midst of the alrT As tho it descended from regions on high. I lookt for it seemed that a spirit was- there Repeating these words.;�Tho I could not desciy The form or the visage. But the letters were plain; They were written with light, transcending In brightness, the light of the sun 1 They remain In my mind, as I saw them that day,�pending On air. But what was its meaning? thus written So plain ! so radiant t so impressive 1 so- grand I So presented with pathos 1 I was smitten With awe 1 The sublimity caused me to stand,, And view it, as the Sovereign of Israel did The Prophet Elisha; repeating the word ; uMy Father, my Father I the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof I' What accord Had this passage,, with events now transpiring, That it should be thus imprest on, my mind ? I reflected with heartfelt emotion ; enquiring; What import the manifestation designed ? The mystery opened. The true revelation Unfolded the vision, as clear as the light Of the sun at noon-day. The presentation) Removed the obscurity blinding my sight. It brought two conditions thus plainly to view ; Elisha was closing his labors in time, And the Patriarch Frederic was bidding adieu To all that is earthly, for regions sublime. As Israel of old, bound by Syrian ehainsr Appealed to Elisha to guide her aright, In her efforts for freedom from Syria's domains ; The Prophet directed her how she should fight � Not alone by the weapons of human device, But by obeying the wisdom directing� She thus should be able o'er Syria to rise, Instead of obliged her will to subject to- Ah,�has not our Israel need of assistance, To help her to wrestle with powers, that would fain Bind her with bands to prevent her resistance, To hold her in darkness,�in death to remain. Does it not behoove us, in humble submission To seek for assistance from powers divine ? Shall we not appeal to our Father,-�ascending To join our relation in regions sublime, In that blissful sphere of joys yet unspoken To more earnestly labor,�unflinching, ne'er yield But keep the pure laws of Mount Zion unbroken, Make them our phylactery, signet and shield? Shall we not appeal as did Israel of yore; With the very same message she then humbly bore? Shall we not appeal to our brother, ascending To dwell in the mansions of life never ending, Shall we not repeat,�'O my Father, my Father! The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof! ' That he may present it to each loving brother, And kind-hearted sister in mansions above ? And to our fathers and mothers who suffered, And stood as firm pillars in gospel relation ? By sacred devotion and toiling they proffered And reared up the standard of the New Creation. Ah! will they not listen to our intercession And kindly assist us in this hour of need, To climb the high hill of unsullied progression And join the bright ranks of those truly agreed? And will they not in their wisdom direct us, And shower upon us divine inspiration That will enlighten, guide, protect, And clothe us, at last, with the robes of salvation? If we truly follow the heavenly Instructors ; Are careful to stand in unsullied light, They never will fail to be our Conductors, They ever will guide us in paths that are right. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
