Mt. Lebanon, June 16,1875 Charles A. Dana — Esteemed Friend : Your note of 14th instant, is to the point. I did not suppose that, individually, you believed materialization a verity, or that to you, Truth would be more valuable for being uttered by a Spirit. You are a sensible man. Are not old men for wisdom and history? If Moses and Elias were materialized to Jesus and Apostles, two points were made — First, that they did exist, and could prove it; Second, being older, by many hundred years, than any earthly man, they were more valuable, for history, than two new books. To me, the natural law of materialization is an interesting scientific fact. I expect to instruct materialized spirits, not to be instructed by them. But the materialized spirits may be inspired by spirits superior to themselves. Should we hold a meeting, as I propose, I hope to accomplish two objects. First, by the Mediums we will bring with us, to materialize Spirits from the other world, who will appear as ordinary men and women, and speak to the audiences. Second, by the Spirits we will bring with us, to inspire the speakers thus materialized, so that they shall utter truths of great importance and of the highest order — truths that will be of practical use to society and to the attendants of said meeting. A smith may work cold metals — he prefers working them at red heat. Excitement with human beings is as heat or fire to metals. To be baptized with fire and with the Spirit of Truth, is to receive Truth — Spiritual Truth — under excitement. Will not Wisdom be justified of her children, if materialization be a means to a good end ? Respectfully, F. W. Evans
