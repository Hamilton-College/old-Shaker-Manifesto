BEAUTY OF ZION See Zion fair city, in beauty arise, Her children in heavenly harmony join, While thousands their order behold with surprise And truly confess that her Laws are divine. No nation, or people that dwell on the earth Can boast the bright joys of this lovely abode; 0 bless'd emanation from mansions of mirth, Such harmony, union and peace are of God. Harvard, Mass.
