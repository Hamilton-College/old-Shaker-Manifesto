Beloved Eldress Harriet:--I have received two good letters... East Canterbury, N. H. 9-17-1890. Beloved Eldress Harriet :�I have received two good letters from home since coming here, one from Laura and one from Aurelia, and instead of auswering each or writing to others as requested, I thought I would address my letter to you. I have much I could write that I think would interest you and them, as well, but I shall have to desist for the reason that I find so much to see, to learn and to admire, that I do not feel that I can do justice to the season in such a letter as I shall be able to write, in the short time allotted for this purpose. Therefore, I will confine myself to a simple statement of facts as they exist. I am here and enjoying the company of the blest. We arrived at the time appointed. Were met at Laconia by our kind friends, according to agreement. Have been well received by Ministry, Elders and all. Have had several good meetings, where we gained much love and have been greatly strengthened and encouraged. The continuous rain has not diminished our enjoyment so far as visiting is concerned, but 1 have felt very sorrowful at every recollection of the situation of our crops at h')ine, and at Alfred, as well as at this pla-�e. On account of much weariness I have kept my room most of to-day. I have felt a sort of ''all goneness,' if I may be allowed the expression. I think my case may be like the person who applied to an M. D. for advice aud was told that rest was all that was needed ; but says the patient, 'Please look at my tongue.' After doing so the Doctor remarked, '�That needs rest also.' But I must admit that my pen has no reason to complain of overwork, and as it will not go of its own accord I think I will place it in the rack as an unprofitable servant, while 'I to my cabin repair.' Adieu in much love, Samuel Kendrick.
