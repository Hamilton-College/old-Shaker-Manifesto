HE GIVETH POWER TO THE FAINT. By Virgie Breedlore. SAY what you may to the contrary, whoever lives in this world without communion with God, lives poorly. There is nothing which th.e human mind can feed upon and thrive thereby, that can so strengthen it and give it the needful thrift and culture as the living forces which God can impart. Human nature can not develop its best by the sources of strength which are fitted for bodily uses alone. The soul needs to be nourished as much as the body, and the food on which it can thrive the best is that which it obtains when it is in sympathetic, loving communion with its Maker. Such intercourse is easy if we will but have it so; the Bible describes with minute precision the true way to get to God, and having found Him, to draw upon Him for the supply of his needs. This way is through Jesus Christ. 164 THE MANIFESTO. Jesus has said 'I am the way, the truth and the life.' There is nothing derogatory to the dignity nor to the freedom of human nature therein, so let us not live alone, nor be down-hearted, for he giveth power to the faint, and they that ha,ve no might, he increaseth their strength, for the heavens declare his glory, and the firmament showeth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. Nevertheless, no human soul is satisfied with merely sensuous apprehensions of God. It seeks to pass beyond what the eye can see, or the ear can hear, to that condition of apprehension where interior consciousness is satisfied only by personal communion,is satisfied to live in God, that our lives may be hid with Christ, and then throughout the endless ages there will be neither defeat, decay nor death.
