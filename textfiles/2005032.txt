APPETITE VS. REASON. It is said that the conquering hero in the battle with appetite, is superior in courage to one who can walk with unfaltering tread to the stake, or face the cannon's mouth. We listen with astonishment and disgust to the oft-repeated story of the weak-minded inebriate, clinging to the cup, when he knows that utter ruin of both soul and body is the result; yet how little we think that an equally overpowering foe, is our assailant in a depraved and excessively indulged appetite. When we hear the remark, 'I know such food is unhealthy, but I like it and must eat it,' can we not class the temptation of eater and drinker together, and wonder where the difference lies, when the weight of self-denial, is in the balance. ' 'Let no man call himself free, who is a slave to any passion,' are the words of one of earth's noblemen, and if one passion can lead us, why may not another, if the reins are not within our own grasp.
