LOVE TO GOD. Agnes E. Newton. Love to God inspires my spirit And his blessing cheers my way; As I sacrifice the earthly Dawn the joys of endless day. Joys that perish not with using Peace that hath its source in God; Balm that heals the wounded spirit When 'tis bowed beneath the rod. And there learns to own God's dealing And his wisdom as the best; Learns to trust his wondrous leading Thus secure the promised rest. Rest of soul! the Christian's portion When the Christ has full control; And the victor's song of triumph Is the music of the soul. Rest of soul, ye heavy Jaden Come to me and I will give; Was the Savior's loving promise Which the ages will out-live. And my yoke indeed is easy And the burden light to bear ; As the truth is made thy refuge And ye seek the vale of prayer. 'Peed my lambs ! ' forsake the selfish ' Follow me 'all else resign; Lose thy life, and Life Eternal With its glories shall be thine. Cross of Christ! God's love revealing Blest indeed thy worth to know, 0 be mine a Savior's mission Whereby works my faith will show. Canterbury, N. H.
