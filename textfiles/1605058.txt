KIND WORDS. Editor, Manifesto; The Manifesto is a welcome vistor... National Military Home, Montgomery Co., Ohio, Apr. 188(5. Editor, Manifesto;�'The Manifesto' is a welcome visitor to many an inmate of this home and to our Library. The three volumes of the 'Shaker and Shakeress,' a monthly publication of 1873,�74&amp;75, I received with the Index and had neatly bound and they are now added as No. 8493 to our Thomas Libkary. Hoping and believing that The Manifesto will be read with interest, and aid in building up what is pure and ennobling,� I am fraternally, Frederic Haase.
