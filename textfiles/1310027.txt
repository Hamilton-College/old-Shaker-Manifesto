The Bible likens the good man's life to a light. It is the nature of light to send forth its rays in every direction; where light enters darkness scatters. The sun. gives light to the earth, with this comes warmth and growth follows its healthful influence where life exists. The Christian's example shines as a light, making the true Christian as a light and guide, not so much because he seeks to be such, but being filled with the light of love, of truth, of forbearance, of Godliness, the acts of his life are rays of divine light which, falling in the path of another, cheers, brightens and encourages to good deeds.â€” E. A. S.
