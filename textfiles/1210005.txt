SELF CONQUEST Of heroes and heroship we hear much; hut there is a spiritual heroism little known; that of man who resolves to conquer himself hardest of all conquests. Impatience, envy, rage, selfishness, eager for success or sullen at defeat, passions of the flesh and passions of the spirit these are his enemies. In the silent depths of the heart he sturdily fights his battle. What he does and what he sutlers no man knoweth : God only knowsNot one bloody day does he fight, at Waterloo or Yorktown and win fame forever; but all through his life does he wage the war and win no fame. Not to lift himself to honor, but to forget himself, to still the throbs of self-conscious disquiet and all selfish passions this is his endeavor. In the midnight and in the morning, in the throng and in the silent hour, ever is it his holy care and prayer to keep all right within him, to keep all just and true, to keep all pure. Loneliness and neglect and sorrow may be upon his path, even as they were upon the path of Christ.
