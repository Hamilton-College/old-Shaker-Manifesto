Dear Children:--'Buy the truth and sell it not'... Enfield, Conn., 1890. Dear Children :ï¿½'Buy the truth and sell it not.' The power to be true and faithful is only gained by waging unceasing warfare against wrong; by resolutely turning from all deceit; by always being and doing just as near what you know to be right as possible. Every deviation from truth makes the possibility of a greater deviation easier. Every lapse from the path of right is at a cost of precious principles not one of you can afford. Truth is best. The ornaments of truth and virtue will last in eternity. It is by self-denying struggles that you form upright characters. Follow the path of duty through good and evil report, when you make a promise keep it firm as a rock. Love the truth and shun the wrong, then you will be pure and strong. Grow in spiritual things. You are growing in goodness or sin, as you weave trie web of life weave truth within. Guard against sin as you would guard against a pestilence. If you seek for sinful pleasure you will find it, but the finding will bring you to grief. Oh ! the misery and woe of an untrue life. Be governed by the strong power of principle. 'Lay aside every weight.' Strive for the ore thing needful. Live right each day. Obey the spirit of truth and see how happy you feel. Life is beautiful and noble only as you make it so. Make your last day on earth a fit introduction to your first in heaven. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
