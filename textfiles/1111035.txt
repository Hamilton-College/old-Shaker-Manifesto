For Burns .â€”When cooking, you often burn your fingers or arms, and there is not time to turn to tie them up. Take a piece of hard soap, and dipping it in water, rub it over the spot. Continue to do this two or three times until the surface is thoroughly covered. It will be found to afford great relief. Or you may dip your burned hand in the soft-soap bucket and hold it there a few moments, and you will experience the same relief. Aunt Addie.
