THOSE ALLOPATHS. Aella Greene. God grant that all the allopaths, With all their sins forgiven, May be translated from the earth To some far distant heaven. And all their books of medicine And all the drugs they mix Be ferried soon and finally Beyond the river Styx; And speed the day when common sense And mild botanies rule, Till history shall scarce record� There was another school! �Springfield, Mass.
