PERSEVERE Rugged toiler, son of labor, Stoutly battling every day, For existence, O my brother, Thou shalt triumph in the fray. On life's changeful scene of action, Though defeat may oft appear, Thou shalt win the victor's laurels, If thou wilt but persevere. Though thou art obscure and lowly, You may reach the wished-for goal, Grasp the prizes wealth and station, If thou hast a dauntless soul. If thou hast a resolution, Which misfortune cannot shake, One on which the angry surges, An impression fail to make. Art thou sneered at and derided By the self-styled lofty born, Heed ye not the fool's contumely, Nor the weak mind's harmless scorn. Art thou friendless, friends will gather As do courtiers king around, When thou hast achieved distinction When thou hast position found. Strong in faith let nought repel thee, Thou shalt in the end prevail, What if years of fierce endeavor, H^s been spent by thee in vain, What if thou hast met disaster, Up and take the field again. Wreck and ruin all about thee, Give not up but struggle still, Stubborn courage is resistless, Ye can conquer if ye will. Selected.
