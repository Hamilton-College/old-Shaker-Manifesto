Hard Work and Long Life. The writer of the following has been known to us as a vegetarian ever since 1842. He never had the appearance of great natural vigor, but possesses the faculty of Scottish tenacity and industry. He has been for many years the respected and beloved Elder of one of the Families at Shaker Station, Conn., and now writes: 'I am sometimes surprised at the amount of business I perform and burden I bear at the age of 75 (on the 14th of April) ; I am credited with doing more work than any man I hire, and besides'all that, it is small to the mental and spiritual burden I am under, for I am called to fill three offices : Farm Manager, Trustee and Elder of the Family.'
