Warden Brush, of Sing Sing, said before the prison conference at Cincinnati the other day: A large share of the men and boys who are incarcerated in our state prisons and penetentiaries are there because they did not have proper discipline in the family, and were allowed by over indulgence to play truant instead of attending school, and therefore received n&gt; school discipline. Often when I have been asked what- are the causes of particular crimes that send most of our men to prison I have of late years invariably answered: 'The want of family discipline.' The indulgence of the father and mother, who allow the child to grow up without any discipline to form character, leads almost inevitably to evil ways and consequently to prison. The child even of tender years who is indulged in its natural waywardness and who is allowed to say to its father and mother 'I Avill' or '-I won't' is in a fair way to become an inmate of our penal institutions. The intelligent child when deceived by its parents in small things is likely to form evil habits which in its future life will not be easily eradicated. R. P. Journal.
