South. Union, Ky. June 3, 1891. Well, strawberry time has nearly passed away. I had a few to-day. The drought cut the crop short. We have had only one eighth of an inch of rain since the 23rd. of April. Preserve-makers begin with cherries, to-day. Wheat is not injured by the drought, but unless rain shall come in the near future, corn will be a failure. Garden peas on the table today. H. L. E.
