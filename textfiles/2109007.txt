Correspondence. Sister Aurelia:--The Manifesto comes regularly, and always freighted with good things... North Falmouth, June 23, 1891. Sister Aurelia :ï¿½The Manifesto comes regularly, and always freighted with good things. The 'Notes about Home' are becoming more and more interesting. There seems to be a rich vein of spirituality running through them ; and why not ? If we give our hearts to God and consecrate the labor of our hands to Him, our secular life must became spiritualized. It was a wise saying of Mother Ann, 'Hearts to God and hands at work.' Thousands of sermons might be written from that text and still its substance not exhausted. It is a clear exposition of the unity of the text, Love to the Lord and love to the neighbor. I was grieved when I heard of the death of Sister Mary Ann Hill, but there was joy in my grief for I felt assured that she had gone to the joy of her Lord. I have always had a filial affection for her ever since our first acquaintance; the motherly love she manifested to all drew me toward her. I often think of her, she may not now be far away. I dare not promise myself the happiness of visiting you soon for all my 'Ideals that shine like a star on life's universe,' are pretty sure to be 'wrecked on the shore of the real.' But I live in hope and trust that Divine Providence will guide me aright and give me strength to do his will. To battle with the cold, hard, profane world is a trying thing. I often wish I was out of it. It may be a wicked thought but it will come up. The notes from Sabbathday Lake have the right tone ; why can't A. S. C. make them a little longer? With love to all good Shakers, I remain your brother, A. Lewis. [Br. Lewis must be very near the kingdom to be able to write with such an understanding heart. Ed.]
