The Bible Class. IDOLATRY. Jessie Evans. The book of Judges, in our estimation, is of double interest to the Bible student. First, it contains a very interesting account of the Children of Israel, and second, because the iravels and experiences of the twelve tribes, in journeying from Egypt to Canaan, are typical of Christian progress from error to right, in this day. Many lessons given to them by their leader Moses, are worthy of attention from professing Christians now. The Ten Commandments embodying the Moral Law, is one of the wonderful revelations of that period. The first one reads, 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me,' and the sicond emphasizes it, 'Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth,' inducing the opinion that idolatry was one of the besetting sins of the Children of Israel, and was therefore forbidden first by their divine teacher. And so it afterward proved. Each time that the people were deprived of their leader, we read that 'they remembered not the Lord, but turned again to serving false gods.' Judges viii., 33, 34. Some writers are of the opinion that the journey of the Israelites through the Wilderness is but an allegory, portraying the opposition of thf human heart then as now, to the divine hand that would direct and guide to the spiritual Land of Promise. Whether taken in this light or otherwise, the history of their strange wanderings is a wonderful lesson. The condition of society in the days of the Children of Israel necessitated the commandment referred to ; but to-day there is no need of its literal injunction, for civilization has done away with the graven images and false gods of ancient days; but the words, 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me,'ï¿½are they not applicable to our lives? Where is our God, when fame, wealth or intellectual attainments claim the first and last consideration? When we deem ourselves and selfish interests, wherever centered, worthy of the best efforts of mind, might and strength, are we not guilty of idolatry, and in its most degrading form? The gods of the heathen, we think, are almost incomparable with the varied, yet none the less adored gods of to-day, at whose shrines so many 'bow down and worship.' If we live in conformity with the first of the ten commandments given so many years ago, we may understand the words of Jesus, when he said, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with ail thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength,' for this can be made a reality only where the soul is free from the sin of idolatry. Canterbury, N. H. SOLILOQUY. Mary E. King. One morning in Autumn while contemplating the comparatively desolate aspect of outward surroundings, I was led to think how silently the laws of God, governing Nature are carried into effect, and how unlike the noise and bustle characterizing all of the works of man! Only a few weeks ago, and we were anxiously watching for the seemingly tardy growth of vegetation. How imperceptibly, as it were, the fair earth had been clad with its many shades of green, and ah, how silently too has this marvelous growth been fulfilled ! I mentally queried, 'Is not the law which enhances the growth of the soul as silently fulfilled? And is not one obscure worthy deed of far greater value to the Christian than many performed merely to be seen by human eyes, or praised by human lips? Too often we regret to find that the motives prompting our daily acts are hardly in accordance with the dictates of conscience! I realize, more and more that the reward arising from conscious integrity and the approval of 'Him who seeth in secret' is rather to be chosen than any words of human praise. * *.'.'* * Sober' Autumn having come again, another lesson presents itself to my thought, for today, I perceive that by the same silent forces noticed in Spring, Nature is being disrobed of her leafy mantle, and that each plar.t and shrub will, ere long, be revealed in its true character, and while one at our right may disclose an ill-shaped, uncomely figure, another at the left is well-defined and symmetrical, and I see that each is presenting its individual outline, revealing its undisguised merits and defects. Just so, I think, must every soul sometime appear before the sunlight of truth. I involuntarily closed my eyes to the earthly scene and the following questions seemed to be put to me audibly. 'Are you willing to be stripped of all false coverings and to lay aside your claim to a name, a profession of religion, and to aught that appears well in the eyes of men? Are you willing to stand in the light of God alone clothed in your just merits? What kind of a character have you been forming, what degree of growth found in spiritual life? Are you willing to display the treasure you honestly claim as yours, gained by the work of the heart or that of the hands? ' While pondering these weighty questions, the rays of an autumnal sun began to gild the distant horizon, and gradually, yet surely rose above the hilltops, until I could see the whole of its broad disk. Unwonted joy thrilled my being, for by the accompanying impressions I was assured that the Intelligence which had questioned me so closely, had also giv n evidence that the rays of the San of Righteousness had not only appeared upon the horizon of my soul's vision, but reassured me that though apparently slow in its progress, it would yet rise above the mountains of self-love, pride, vanity and other worldly influences, surrounding me, and finally illumine my whole life, if faithful to my conscientious trust.
