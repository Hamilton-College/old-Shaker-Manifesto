God's hand to help us What is the hand of God, but the power that is within us from Him? The power to will and to do what ig right; to stand fast in the front of temptation; to walk securely in the strength He gives us? We grasp his hand, when we use this power. The true order of life is the government of reasonThis must rule over all the lower things of sense. The appetites and passions must be held in complete sub. jection. (Jod is with us and in us; gives us of His strength, and keeps us in safety so long as we maintain this true order of life. If we will not maintain it, He cannot do it for us; and the same law must rule in restoration and cure, as in normal order. We must use the strength God is always giving, and use it for ourselves. We would be only machines, if He merely lived in us the mainspring of all our actions.â€” T. S. Arthur
