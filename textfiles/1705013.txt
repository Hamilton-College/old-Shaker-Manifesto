PRAYER IN MAY. ARABELLA 8HEPARD. I wander forth and pensive stray, This pleasant morn of lovely May, And O may Angels deign to meet To pour out inspiration sweet. Away from every earthly care, I bend my soul in fervent prayer, And wilt thou answer when I pray And chase all gloomy clouds away? Here I can feel the sighing breeze, That whispers softly through the trees, And I can feel a holy calm That's like a sweet and heavenly balm. Help me to trust my all with Thee, Prom every sinful thing be free; And when life's journey hath an end, My Father, Mother be my Friend. North Union, Ohio.
