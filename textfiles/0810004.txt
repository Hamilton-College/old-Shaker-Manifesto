INDIANS. No. 8 JAMES S. PRESCOTT The history of the United States with few exceptions is but a little move than a history of frequent and protracted wars with the Indians. They were entailed upon the colonies by emigrants from the old world, long before the U.S. became a free and independent nation. Being of long standing and complicated they will be hard to eradicate. It took one hundred years to abolish slavery after it was admitted it was a grievous sin and a reproach to the people. This delay was caused by a division among the people, and as are the people, so is the Government, and as is the Government, so will be the Indians. The Indians arc what the Government makes them. They arc wholly at its mercy. If they go to war iL is because the Government makes them, by withholding their supplies, and curtailing their appropriations. Rather than starve they will fight and who would not, who are not Christians? No doubt the present Avar might have been avoided if there had not been a failure on the part of the Government to properly provide for the Indians of Lemlii and Fort Hall Agencies. There is too much of human nature about the Indians ever to be conquered by the sword. They may yield for the time being, or, they may be exterminated, but never conquered. It is a law in nature that like begets like. The spirit of war begets war, the spirit of peace begets peace. North Union, O.
