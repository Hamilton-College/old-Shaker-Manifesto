'SHAKERESS.' To the ' Shakeress,' we send Sisterly greetings, acknowledging your important and glori- ous mission. We hail the new Cap(tion) of the ' Shaker.' It fits admirably. Now the 'daughters of Zion have come forth, clothed in needle work, finely wrought with gold ;' and, in those spotless garments of purity, are, by their most glorious ' Queen,' presented to the King. ' The Lord will create a new thing in the earth ; a woman shall compass a man.' Glo- rious era! What a theme for reflection! What a realm of light is revealed for exploration ! Millions have sought thee in prayer and anguish of soul, but were not thus favored in time. May the blessed ' Shakeress ' prosper and be true to her most needful duty, which is to seek out her poor fallen sisterhood, and bind up their many wounds, and, upon their sensitive, emotional spirits, pour the balm of hope and consolation, to dry up those numberless unseen tears that are dripping, dripping away the physical lives, and impairing the spiritual growth of their soivh. Up, then, thou favored of the Lord, there is work to be done. The strong must bear the infirmities of the weak, and Heaven requires all your talents. ' Where there is no vision the people perish.' Virgin daughter, tune the inspirational harp of Purity. May the cords thereof be touched, and the new song of the ' hundred and forty and four thousand' be re-echoed from pole to pole. And may the portals of Heaven never more be closed to mortals, or hidden from their comprehension. Nancy L. Rupe
