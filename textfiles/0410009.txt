Mt. Lebanon, August 16,1874 G. F. Tbain — My Dear Friend, I want to hear from you — and to see you. Next Wednesday, if you will be here, you shall have the rare privilege of attending our Social Gathering. You would be the first outsider who has ever attended. I have invited Peebles, but do not much expect him. This invitation is to you, on the ground of friendship, and the self-denial you practice, in abstaining from fleshly lusts and fleshly food. Come by G. F. Train, on Harlem Express, to New Lebanon Depot, then to North Family. F. W. Evans
