North Family Nov. 1890. These autumn days—for whatever mere almanacs may say, winter has not yet come—we have gathered up all the cider apples findable and sent them off to the mill. Of good apples, our cellar is now quite full. Greenings, smooth and sound being the main part of our crop, but we have also got in quite a quantity of Baldwins; of these latter, more than we had at one time expected. In the very mild weather we have been having, the Greenings are not keeping as well as they might (in this respect being inferior to the Baldwin apple,) and it may be, we shall have to dispose of them before Christmas, although in former seasons we have kept them along into .January and February. The continued spell pf dry weather is allowing us to get fields and gardens ploughed and fertilized and we have also got in our supply of coal for another winter. But still, we would be glad to see some rain come along and fill up ponds and reservoirs before winter sets in. It would give us some water power with which to do a little sawing and other necessary things. This winter, if we can get at it, we expect to make a lot of carpet whips, a useful article to have in the house and one for which there should be a fair demand when once they are known. This is about all there is to write about home this month; only one thing now remains to do; bid adieu to our little magazine. It is a pity. Like a friend, it has called at our gates these many years, passed a few pleasant words and gone away again until another month came round, and has always been welcome in a quiet way each time it came. But now it is not coming back and this time we are to say farewell. But nay! we look forward to that 'wave of enthusiasm' of which our good 'directors' speak and say—not farewell but only, au revoir.
