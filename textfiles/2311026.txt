Enfield, N. H. North Family. Oct. 1893. Multitudinous are our blessings; among which is pure language; clothing all themes with comprehensible wisdom. The beauty and wisdom of the Infinite is illustrated at this time in the autumnal foliage, which is indeed inexpressible in its grandeur; superior to the grandest painting ever made by human skill, and which is a fine similitude of the superiority of Christ's teachings over all manmade theories; the trutli of which, the writer U&gt; reminded was first made known to him through the instrumentality of our Manifesto. Christ's teachings, soul-refining and redeeming powers which are the strong fulcrums of daily life, causing the soul to rejoice in the knowledge. 'I know the voice that calls me From darkness into light. I know the hand that leads me And guides my feet aright.' Out from the darkness of ignorance and sin into the light of God, prompting the soul to live to its purest ideals of Christ discipleahip. But what about home? The harvest season is upon us. Dock root of fair quality. Potatoes, apples and pears a medium crop. So numerous are our blessings that all of our earth lite is none too long a ti me in which to serve God and humanity, as well as to cultivate self-hood in Christ-like virtues. George H. Baxter.
