To Remove Dandruff Some people are disfigured, and are commonly considered to be unclean, by the appearance of much dandruff. Take an ounce of flour of sulphur, added to a quart of soft water. Shake thoroughly. In twenty-four hours pour off the liquid, washing the head every other day until relieved.
