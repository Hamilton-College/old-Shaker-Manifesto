PRENTISSIANA: Shaker and Ism Virginity and Community are the Shaker. Inherited and educational notions are the Ism, in which novitiates are wont to enshrine the Shaker as the chestnut is enshrined in the bur, to keep off squirrels. This procrustean bedstead Ism, however needful in humanity's unprogressed condition, subsides in proportion to mental expansion. 'We live in an age of wonders. By the aid of unseen forces, the world moves as it never moved before. The day dawns—the Day Star arises—The Shaker—the good, the true, the beautiful—will never be lost to humanity. Truth loving souls are being prepared to shove the car of human progress, to sublimer elevations. Creed. '1 believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ his only son, conceived by the Holy Ghost.'* The above is the august commencement of the creed drilled into my juvenile cranium in St. Armand, P. Q., in 1807, by an old Scotch pedagogue. Creed, or no creed, 'tis manifest enough that somebody must do the conceiving, as well as^the begetting. If we have a Father in Heaven, why not a Mother in Heaven ? But, is Ghost the prettiest name for our Holy Eternal Mamma ? We would'nt, for a common-sized world offend, but how would it do to moderize our creed thusly ? We believe in God—Father and Mother— the vitalizing center of all vitality—and in all their Sons and Daughters, who, by indomitable self-discipline, squaring their every act, word, feeling and thought by their divinest ideal of the true dignity of man and womanhood, come forth in the likeness of their Holy Eternal Parentage. We believe in the communion of saints— better not have any sins—and in the resurrection of the body, clear above all unphysiological — all indelicate appetites and indulgences—Amen.
