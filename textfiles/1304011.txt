LIFE'S OBJECT. ELVAH F. COLLINS. Live, for higher ends and aims Than the sons of earth aspire to, Live, to render God His claims, Though the effort oft may tire you. Live,â€”as blest for having lived, Doing good, though good oft fail you, Give, though you have not received, Though in giving, wrongs assail you. Live a spiritual life, Though the tempter bid you falter, Be a martyr in the strife Rather than your purpose alter. Firmness in the path of truth, Nerves the heart and hand for action, Weakness, levels to the earth Every plan for good transaction. Bigotry, and cowardice, Bar the way of true progression, Hold the spirit in a vise, Turning gain, to retrogression. But a firm and steadfast mind, Holds its own through opposition, Looking upward, there to find Only heavenly transition. Calm, mid persecution's wrath, Stayed in virtue's holy power, Strewing in another's path, Some lowly and sweet scented flower. Happy in a consciousness, Of having blest the world in living, Such bear the fruit of righteousness, Bright memories to the future giving. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
