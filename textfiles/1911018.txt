Watervliet, N. Y. Crops are nearly all harvested; corn was hardly medium. Potatoes some rotted but better than we expected. Apples, poor crop. Tomatoes poor, weather too cold and wet. We are painting the Meeting House and Ministry's Dwelling. The Second Family have just finished filling their silo ; they cut their fodder with a steam engine; four horse power, also do their threshing by the same power. Weather remains cold and damp, fall pasture, good. Oct. 6. We are repairing and painting our 'House of Public Worship,' and we think we are making a move in the right direction. We have finished the work of canning Tomatoes, for this season, which has kept us busy for some time past, as we had a large supply. The Potato crop has also been very good, but the Corn has been injured by the wet weather and the Apples to be kept for Winter will be a very limited amount. J. B.
