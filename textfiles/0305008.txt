DOES THE WORLD MOVE? As a whole or a part, is humanity moving on an up-grade 1 Much depends on the standpoint from which the view is taken. Go down into turmoils — the scrambles for place and for pelf — go down into the condemned little difficulty yclept ' the social evil'— stay there long enough to get your perceptives obfuscated—and should you be asked, Does the world move ? you might say, as did Ezekiel when asked, ' Can these dry bones live 1' ' 0 Lord, Thou knowest.' But here let us quit these regions and go up — higher up — up to the highest parts of the earth — the parts that come nearest to the heavens — nearest to angels and God. Now cast about, and what do we see ? We see some splendid specimens of the race Homo — intellectual, political and moral. Compared with the 'homos' of former periods, these specimens we see now are almost divine. Herein lies the grand secret of the differences, to wit: In olden time ' homos' got up gods in their own likeness; now, these ' homos' get themselves up in the likeness of God. This makes a difference, we see. What though these approved editions are not yet the many 1 we must confess they are not. They are the few. But they are prophe- cies of the future many — the poetic few. Now just look ahead a few centuries. What do you see ? We see this planet peopled with the likeness of God as the waters cover the sea; this is what we see. O. P.
