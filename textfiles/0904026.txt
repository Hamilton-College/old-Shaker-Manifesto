Somebody Else A lady was walking quietly along the city street, not long ago, when the door of a house flew open, and a boy shot out with a whoop like a wild Indian. Once on the pavement he danced a sort of double shuffle all around a curbstone, and then raced down the street in great haste, for it was evident by the books under his arm he was going to school. The lady was thinking what thoughtless, noisy creatures healthy boys always are, when just a few yards before her she saw something yellow lying on the stones. Coming nearer she fancied it was a pine shaving, and looked after the boy again. She saw him suddenly stop short in a crowd of people at a crossing, and come back as fast as he had gone, so that just before she reached the shaving he did, and picked up —not a shaving at all—but a long, slimy banana-skin. Flinging it into a refuse barrel, he only waited long enough to say, ' Somebody might have slipped on it,' and was off again. It was a little thing to do; but that one glance of the boy's clear, gray eyes, and this simple, earnest sentence, made the lady's heart very warm toward the noisy fellow. He had not slipped himself ; he was far past the danger, and when one is in a hurry, it is a great bother to go twice over the same ground ; but the ' somebody else ' might slip, and so for the sake of this unknown somebody the hurrying boy came back, and it may be saved the life or limbs of a feeble old man or a tender little child. He might have said, ' I can't wait to go back. It is none of my doing, and so it is none of my business ; ' but he made it his business, and in this showed a trait of character which promised well for the future. There is nothing nobler on earth than this taking care that ' somebody else ' shall not suffer needlessly. The child who grows up with such a spirit always active in him may make his home like a heaven upon earth, and he will never know what it is to be unloved or friendless.—[Christian Secretary.
