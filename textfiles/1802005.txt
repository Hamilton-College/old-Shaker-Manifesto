UNSELFISH INTEREST. Martha J. Anderson. Every situation in this mundane sphere has its vicissitudes, trials and vexations; none cau escape them. The closer human beings come in contact and relation, the more apparent are their imperfections and peculiarities, and the greater the abrasion of feeling. A community of individuals is like a machine, no matter how nicely adjusted its parts may be, there will be friction, unless it is lubricated by the oil of love, charity and forgiveness. '�To endure and to pardon is the wisdom of life,' so said the great prophet of Islam. Inharmony and variance is often the result of selfishness ; an intense self-asserting spirit tramples upon the rights of* others to the seclusion of peace, setting up a little feudal kingdom of its own, claiming all a~ its retainers, and making war upon all who will not acquiesce. ' All civilization and every religion; all morality, and every kind of society imply some restraint and subordination,' and those who seek to evade salutary discipline, work against their own interests and the good of others. We may prate of individuality and freedom ; but where is the independent man or woman ? Surely they are not the heads of families; for who makes greater sacrifice than the true parent. They are not the leaders of organizations or societies ; for are not the words of Jesus actualized. 'He that would be greatest among you let him be the servant of all.' He or she that renders noblest service to mankind, merges his or her individuality in that of others ; through condescension, union and harmony are attainable. But, pleads one�I do not want to be like anybody else, I prefer to be myself. If to be one's self is to exhibit those distinctive characteristics that mark the animal creation, then are they unfit for the higher relations, and harmonial associations of the superior life. In Christ all are equal; no distinction recognized save goodness. In Him souls find a centre of life, love and fellowship, which fills all hearts that have received the unction of his divine spirit, with a satisfaction inconceivably deeper, sweeter and more lasting, than is found in the isolated, fractional relationship which orgauizes the ordinary family and makes selfish society. It is love, true genuine love, (not lust) that can satisfy human hearts; without this they perish for sustenance, and 'who can show greater love than he who is willing to lay down his life for his brethren.' Jesus gave to the world and illustrated in his life, the grandest ideal and conception of human society the world has ever dreamed of. A social and religious fabric to be reared on the eternal principles he enunciated ; of which his immediate followers only had a blessed foretaste in the Pentecostal Christian Church, in whose decline we see aptly illustrated the tendencies of human nature to drift with surrounding circumstances, and gradually lower the high standard raised by those whose souls were inspired by lofty principles and whose lives were examples of heroic sacrifice. If we consult our own interests, desires and wishes in regard to what constitutes our comfort and happiness, then are we unworthy the name of the great Master who lived and died to implant in humanity the grand law of universal love, and self-abnegation. 'Not my will but Thine be done' was his contiuual prayer. How strong and encouraging his exhortations. 'Be of good cheer for I have overcome the world.' 'Ye are not of the world for I have chosen you out of the world.' 'Be ye perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.' 'By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one for another.' Let us inculcate in our lives the beautiful soul inspiring lessons of the divine teacher, and in his kingdom come on earth, be loving and simple children ; so virtuous, noble and true in all the duties and relations of life, that we shall be preparing ourselves to enter the upper kingdom of his glory, robed in habiliments of brightness; worthy inheritors of the joys, felicities and companionship of the redeemed and blessed.
