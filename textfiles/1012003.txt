DON'T STAND ON THE TRACK EASTERN SHAKERS. A thought fills my soul with a feeling of awe, That life is a railway whose engine is law ; Which knoweth no rest and never turns back, While it shrieks out its warning, ' Don't stand on the track.' The iron horse, progress, forever rolls on, Old principles die out, and new ones are born ; We must go with the engine that never turns back, Then hark to the warning, 'Don't stand on the track' There are laws for the body and laws for the soul, By yielding obedience their force we control; They know no exemption for white nor for black, Then hark to the warning, ' Don't stand on the track.' Young man! keep awake, on the journey of life! Your pathway with terrible danger is rife ; The speed of the iron horse never grows slack, For the love of your life, then, ' Don't stand on the track.' Shun the fumes of the cup as a rattlesnake's breath ; You are playing with fire that will burn you to death ! Yield not to temptation, though fierce the attack ; Remember the warning, ' Don't stand on the track.' With eye never closing your watch you must keep, For our passions are often like wild beasts asleep ; Sin takes from the soul what it never gives back, For the sweet hope of heaven, ' Don't stand on the track.'
