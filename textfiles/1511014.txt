LETTER BOX TEEES. Some trees are very tall and large and others are not so large. I will name all I know of. The Oak, the Maple, the Fir tree, the Chestnut, the Horse chestnut and the Willow. I will name the fruit trees, the Cherry, the Peach, Pear, Plum, Apple and the Quince. The fir tree keeps green all the year round. Gertrude Lackey. Canterbury, N. H. STRAWBERRIES.

In picking strawberries they should be picked on the stems because if they are hulled they jam together and it is very hard to pick them over; and I have been told that in canning strawberries that the field strawberries are the best. I think that this is because in cultivating the strawberry to make it larger it takes away its real strawberry taste and makes it sour. Rebecca Hathaway. Canterbury, N. H.
