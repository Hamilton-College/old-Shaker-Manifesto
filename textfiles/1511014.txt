STRAWBERRIES. I think that strawberries are among some of the best kinds of fruit. In picking strawberries they should be picked on the stems because if they are hulled they jam together and it is very hard to pick them over; and I have been told that in canning strawberries that the field strawberries are the best. I think that this is because in cultivating the strawberry to make it larger it takes away its real strawberry taste and makes it sour. Rebecca Hathaway. Canterbury, N. H.
