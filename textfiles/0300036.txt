'FIRST FOUNDERS.' What bright examples of purity and godliness were Mother and her little band who first settled in the wilderness of Watervliet. These faithful disciples of Christ maintained their allegiance to their faith, in hunger and thirst, in labor and fatigue, in watching and prayer. How numerous and severe were the trials of these true cross-bearers, who followed Christ in the regeneration : They hated their own lives, that they might obtain life eternal. How severe a life of extreme self-denial did they choose! What long-continued temptations did their perseverance overcome ! What soul-trying conflicts did they sustain ! How earnest were their prayers ! With what zeal and power did they aspire after higher and higher degrees of spiritual possession ! With what earnestness and resolution did they wage war against sin ! And how ardent and sincere was their love to God ! The day they devoted to labor, and the night to prayer and praise ; and, even in their hours of labor, their hearts were lifted up to heaven in continual aspirations. With respect to all earthly possessions they were poor; but they were rich in heavenly gifts and durable treasures. Outwardly, they were many times in absolute want; but inwardly, they abounded in Divine consolation. They were the despised and the outcasts of the world, but Sons and Daughters of God. In their own estimation, they were nothing; but, in the sight of God, they were 'elect and 'precious.' By deep humiliation, strict obedience, heartfelt charity, and persevering patience, they made continual advances in spiritual life, and obtained greater and greater degrees of spiritual power. Such were the First Founders of our Gospel Homes, in the New Jerusalem on earth, and such are all their faithful followers. Let them be our Pattern; let us tread in their footsteps, and imitate their virtues. Daniel Orcutt, Enfield, Conn.
