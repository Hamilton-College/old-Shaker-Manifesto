THE CRANK. LOUIS BASTING. The crank is a product of the nineteenth century and belongs to the genus homo. He is generally a male, but there are premonitory symptoms that he will soon make his appearance in the female also. The crank has never received a systematic education. His early training having been neglected he is prone to spell God with a small g, but never, nay never, will he fail to employ a capital in the personal pronoun I. He reads a book or hears a lecture�no matter what the subject�he there meets with ideas or learns of facts hitherto unknown to him, and he immediately pounces upon them as his individual property. His education is finished. If he ever condescends to absorb any further information, or if he stoops to notice the facts of human experience, they are all twisted and tortured to conform to his fixed idea. Henceforth he has a mission. In season and out of season, wherever opportunity offers, he will inflict his platitudes upon his unfortunate fellow men. The capital upon which the crank works is a borrowed idea, an adamantine cheek and a tongue hung in the middle. If he is a married man, you may at once pity the wife; if he is unmarried, lie is either a libertine or a hater of women. Rarely is he a worker; lie is content to let others do the world's drudgery. He has no reverence for the religious opinions of others : ego is the only God he worships. In politics, ten to one he will be a mugwump. He has tried his hand at perpetual motion, and still thinks that if he only had time and means he could demonstrate it. If he is a temperance man, he will present his arguments in a very intemperate manner. He always wants to reform something or somebody; he never dreams of reforming himself. He is not a pleasant person to meet, for in his self-conceit he monopolizes all the conversation. There is one thing which the crank never is, namety, a humble, devout and consistent Christian. The crank is aperson in whom self-esteem lias become so abnormally developed that he has lost the true sense of his proper relation to his environment. Hath then the crank no use? He hath; so has the mosquito and the potato-bug, but, like them, his useful purpose has not as yet been discovered. What are you going to do with him? If you oppose him he will strike an attitude before the world as a martyr; if you seek to convert him, he will talk you blind. Let him alone. He is a nuisance. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
