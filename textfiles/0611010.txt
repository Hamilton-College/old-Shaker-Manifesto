INTERESTING CALCULATION The following from the Christian Observer is commended to the reader who chews tobacco: Allow that a young man, who is a confirmed tobacco chewer, may live twenty-five years. In each day there will issue from his mouth half a pint of fluid too nauseously disgusting to describe. In twenty-five years this will amount to five hundred and fifty gallons or more than four hogsheads of this detestable mess. In the same time, allowing him only two ounces a day, he will roll, as a sweet morsel under his tongue, half a ton of the hateful weed, which will sicken a dog or kill a horse, forming a heap the size of a haystack. Then his rejected quids would form a still larger pile. Now if such a young man could see ten half hogsheads full of abominable filth, destined to pass through his mouth, a wagon load of tobacco and ten wheelbarrows heaped up with quids, designed for an equally intimate association with his lips, how would the prospect affect him ?
