Shakers, N. Y. North Family. Aug. 1894. We have had a special privilege the past month, in being favored with a visit from our beloved Brother, Alonzo G. Hol- lister, of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. How true it is that we consciously or unconsciously mister to others, just what we have in possession; and in the visit of our dear Brother, We realized more fully than ever the truth of that assertion. His ministration was to strengthen and encourage those who love the cause and to uphold the standard of virgin purity, that it may be seen and read of all tribes and nations, that the truth alone maketh free, We are encouraged to press forward and to give all that we have to the support of the cause, knowing that the testimony is going forth, bringing mankind to judgment a witness thereof is given in the desion of the Catholic Church in regard to the liquor traffic. It is to be hoped that they will have the courage of their convictions and stand firm in the position bey have taken; if theydo, a blessing ill attend them. Every such move mong mankind, is the trumpet sound of he angel of judgment, cleansing the outer temple, preparing it for the repeption of e resurrection testimony; for how oould soul whose body is filled with liquor and 'Qbaooo, understand the truths' of the higher life? Impossible. Our grain harvest is about finished. At resent writing, we are having a refreshing rain. Fruit prospeot fail' for apples nd pears. The cold weather in May rerded tender vegetables, but if we can have a late autumn, they will develop a good crop. Our beloved Ministry are with us and all the faithful ones are ministering he testimony. May we receive it with humble spirits.
