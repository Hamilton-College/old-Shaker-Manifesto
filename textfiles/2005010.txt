Beloved Elder Henry:--The readers of the 'Manifesto' may be interested... Mt. Leranon, N. Y. Mar. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :- -The readers of the 'Manifesto' may be interested to know more of 'the Ballston Shaker,' as some in that vicinity are disposed to call her; while she very wisely accepts the name, we are pleased to introduce her to you as our Gospel Sister, Sophia Wayne. Three years previous to her uniting with Believer's testimony she was an earnest investigator of the faith, and when convinced that it was right for her to obey it, she did so without hesitation ; and the seed fell into a good and honest heart. Prior to this, she belonged to the high Church of England and was thoroughly imbued with its tenets; though of later years her eyes were opened to see that true religion was not to be found within the pale of the Church, and that a more perfect form of Christianity was needed ; this she partially found in the Swedenborgian doctrine, which prepared her for a superior life in the resurrection Order. When brought in contact with the simple faith of the Gospel, she being thus prepared� drawn by the Father�was led to a work of repentance and confession, and this brought her into union with the Maternal Spirit; through this baptism she now receives spiritual gifts. Circumstances beyond control prevent her being gathered into the family, and consequently she belongs to the Novitiate class ; and as she meets with op- posing forces, is ministered unto in a remarkable and wonderful manner, very foreign from anything she ever before experienced. Hear what she says : 'While visiting at your home last Summer, I was kindly invited to join a company of Brethren and Sisters in their pleasant evening entertainment. At the close of the meeting, a dear Sister requested the prayers of the company for the new comer who had so lately been accepted as a member of their Order. After my return, and while thinking of that kind request, a wish took possession of me, that I might in some way be influenced to receive a little of the power that led my chosen friends to compose verses in line, as they were constantly doing. The thoughts in my mind did not run in a spiritual current, but seemed all centered on Mt. Lebanon and its inmates. Then one night while thinking deeply of your mountain home and of things pertaining to its surroundings, I was surprised to find that my thoughts were forming into verse. I repeated them to myself several times, so as to retain them in my memory, and in the morning wrote them down. It was about the same time that I held conversations with our ministers, and I found to my sorrow that one im-colleged learned heretic, could not compete with three college bred Divines. Then came your kind letter of comfort and advice, 'to let such things alone, and if I held the taith steadfastly, it would be given me what to say.' From that time I found my power to write in verse was increasing, and what surprised me most was, that the very subjects which I had been advocating as my ideas of right were being given to me in verse, via., those I call 'Self Atonement' and 'The Orthodox Resurrection.' That I am at times influenced by Believers' spirits may possibly be true. I know there is some other power at work besides my own. But I claim that these messages are sent to me on the spiritual telegraph from your mountain home ; though I am a believer in spirit communication and may be a medium ; that those lines I call 'Atonement' should come to me in verse is to say the least, rather strange. I was thinking on that subject, and how I had been told by our Minister that there was no other name given under heaven whereby we can be saved but that of Jesus ; this thought came to me. Jesus took on our humanity ; was tempted like unto us ; he retired to the wilderness and there fought against the tempter by prayer and fasting. Now, if that was not self-atonement I do not know what is. But our orthodox clergy tell us that Jesus was, and is God ; if so, why did he pray 'My God, why hast thou forsaken me ?' If Jc?us was God and born entirely perfect, wherefore his temptation ; and if created with an impossibility of committing sin, whence his glory ? In regard to a belief of the resurrection of the body, that belief of itself is of minor importance unless it is joined to a belief in a general wholesale day of judgment; then we must protest, for it is calling into question the righteousness of the Supreme Ruler. The orthodox creed allows but two places for the spirits abode after leaving this earth; one, the extreme of happiness, the other the entire reverse. We are also taught that we are not to be judged until the general resurrection day, and then Christ is to judge us. We must then naturally suppose that some are allowed to be in glory for per haps thousands of centuries, while others are in extreme anguish, and this without being judged to see if they were worthy of glory or punishment. Then after centuries on centuries have passed, we are to be called out of our separate places ; we must come back to earth ; find the old body again, get into it as best we can and come to Christ for our judgment; or, come to be told whether his Father�the Mighty Ruler of the universe�had possibly made a mistake, by letting some live so long in supreme happiness, and others in misery, without according them a judgment. I do not wonder that those who are taught such a doctrine, fear and tremble at the idea of meeting such a Judge. And we might well ask these faithless Shepherds the meaning of the beautiful words, 'In my Father's house are many mansions.' I cannot go to Church to hear our heavenly Father's name traduced, and to be taught that while some are allowed to go direct into the presence of God, others are doomed to eternal misery. If our God is thought to be so stern and unrelenting, whence came the Christ Spirit that would not break a bruised reed ; and the command to Peter to forgive not only 'until seven times, but until seventy times seven? Is the servant greater than his Master? I never again can adopt the orthodox Church faith which allows Ministers and members alike, to live in the works of generation, in idleness and luxury, and conforming to the fashions and vanities of this wicked world. Though a lone passenger in a frail barque I am assured of my union in spirit to the body of Christ in his Second Appearing, and of the prayers of all my chosen people ; this is my hope and the anchor of my soul.' Further comments are not needed; as long as one soul can be touched by the power of conviction, and come under the baptism of tlie Christ heavens, there is hope for the race and a joy for the future Zion of God. In love that knows no shadow of turaiug, I am happy to be your Gospel Sister, Anna White.
