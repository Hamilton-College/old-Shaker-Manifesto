Shaker Station, Ct. March, 1896. 'To be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.' If we keep our hearts pure, our aspirations holy, our thoughts mild and humble, our souls ever opened heavenward, we shall be enriched with the fruits of the Spirit, which are peace, joy and love. Let us breathe more of the pure air of heaven, and be strengthened by the sweet songs of peace the angels sing. Denying self makes peace. Let us hope on though we meet with discouragement. We have the same God and heaven and truth; the same duties and the same helpers. Let us hope in God. Let us be courageous and noble- THE MANIFESTO. 69 minded; our own heart, and not other men's opinions of us form our true honor. Duty can not be neglected without harm to those who practice as well as to those who suffer the neglect. 'The Cathedrals of England were many years in building. Bristol Cathedral surpasses all others, 522 years having elapsed between its commencement in 1306, and its completion in 1888. ****** * Time intelligently given to poultry will pay equally well with that given to any other kind of farm work, and where too many are not kept it may be done at such times as not to interfere with other important work. Outside of any pecuniary benefit it pays well in furnishing fresh eggs for the family. Daniel Orcuit. South Family. March, 1896. We have experienced a remarkable winter, in that we have had some of the coldest and warmest weather known in any one winter. It will be a very hard season on new seeded land, for which the worst condition is this constant freezing and thawing; which is also bad for the sick. We note the absence of snow; the warm heavy rains we had lately caused the Connecticut to rise higher than in thirty years. We hear at times several song birds whose notes gladden our hearts at the sound of prospective spring. Experience has demonstrated that such a winter is often followed by a late spring. An Ornithologist informs us that some rare birds have been seen in this neighborhood lately;notably, two Lapland longspurs or Greenland Nightingales, a bird which breeds near the shores of the Arctic ocean and sings on the wing. These birds were seen in February; Savannah, and tree sparrows, Eed-winged blackbird, kSnow Bunting, Red-poll Downy wood-pecker, Brown creeper, White bellied nuthatch, Eed-tailed and rough-legged hawks, Murgauser, Chickadee, and Butcher birds. Now a very interesting question presents itself to the bird lovers, namely, Will the Bluebirds return in strong force this spring? Last winter thousands were destroyed by the unusually severe winter in the south. We would ever be thankful for the blessings we enjoy. Maria Witham.
