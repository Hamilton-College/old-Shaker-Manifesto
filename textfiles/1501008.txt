A VISION In the fall of 1821, Ralph Resell, of Warrensville, Cuyahoga County, Ohio visited Union ATillage, Warren County, in the south part of the State, and united with the Society called Shakers, and returned home, expecting to move his family in the Spring. As an evidence of liis faith in Shaketism, he related the following Vision. ' I saw,' said he ki a strong, clear, ray ot light.proceeding from Union Village, in a perfectly straight, horizontal line until it reached a spot near my log cabin, (and that spot is the very place where the Centre House, or Church Family now stands.) And then it arose in a strong erect column, and became a beautiful Tree.' â€” James S. Prescott
