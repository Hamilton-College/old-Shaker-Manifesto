SCENES OF GLORY South Union, Ky. Canterbury, N. H. 1. Away I have turned from this world's transient glory, 2. Behold the sweet prospect of life never ending! 3. 'Tis here you may find the true balm of the spirit, 4. Though trials await me the light has decscended, From evil, and all that the Here scenes of bright glory will And feast on the bread and the The highway of heaven to wicked can boast: open to you; waters of life; me has appeared; And have set out for Zion, O! hear the glad story! And as all the strong ties of nature are rending, Yea, rich treasures eternnal may safely inherit, Though my life it will cost me, I'll not be offended, To gain, more than gain what in Eden was lost. Kind heaven will grant you a life that is new. Secure from this world of confusion and strife. But keep the strait way which the Lord has prepared.
