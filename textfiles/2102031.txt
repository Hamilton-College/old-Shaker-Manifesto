HOW TO LIVE. Maria Witham. 'While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the tilings which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.' 2 Cor. iv., 18. To cultivate the intellectual faculties, to aspire after moral excellence, to devote the active powers to the glory of the Creator and the benefit of mankind, to live as strangers and pilgrims upon this transitory scene, to keep the eye constantly fixed on the realities of an immortal life, is characteristic of a small part of humanity, although it may be admitted of the highest importance and wisdom to make the temporal subservient to the spiritual. With the vast majority of those who throng the great thoroughfare of life, present enjoyment seems the ultimate end of their efforts. Some have set their hearts upon the acquisition of wealth, their minds are continually racked by new schemes, their bodies wearied with the effort required for the realization of their golden dreams. No sacrifice is thought too much. They will forego comfort and convenience and occasionally refuse the claims of friendship. To build and increase is their motto, despite the storms and winds and tempests, which now so often sweep away the palaces and treasures that are resting on sandy foundations, leaving scarcely a trace of their existence. Of what account is it to have the name engraved a little higher than some other. The tablet which bears the name of earth's honored ones is perishable. Better to have that 'new name' written which shall stand forever. A well known cardinal once sought distinction at the court of his king. He found it; but the sad words that appear at the close of his eventful history. 'Had I been as diligent to serve my God as I have to please my king, He would not have forsaken me now in my old age.' How important that there be something to show a fidelity in the gospel work, that we may claim the reward. We are living for eternity. Enfield, Conn.
