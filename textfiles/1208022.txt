I suppose by this time you begin to think that I am somewhat of a trifler. But then I don't believe in jumping into anything regardless of thought. Now what I want to know is if you desire to have me come among you, and if you do will you allow three hours a day for practice on the Violin? And another thing if I were to have my own way in selecting work I would rather teach the Violin than anything else, because I could.become more profitable to you for that purpose. So I will close hoping to hear from you again,— I remain, Yours truly, G.
