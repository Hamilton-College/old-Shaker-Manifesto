A WORD ABOUT WORDS Ah me! these terrible tongues of ours ! Are we half aware of their mighty powers? Do we ever trouble our heads at all Where the jest may strike or the hint may fall ? The latest chirp of that 'little bird' That spicy story 'you must have heard,'� We jerk them away in our gossip rash, And somebody's glass, of course, goes smash. What fames have been blasted and broken, What pestilent sinks been stirred, By a word in lightness spoken, By only an idle word ! A sneer,�a shrug,�a whisper low,� [bow : They are poisoned shafts from an ambushed Shot by the coward, the fool, the knave, They pierce the mail of the great and brave: Vain is the buckler of wisdom or pride, To turn the pitiless point aside; The lip may curl with a careless smile, [while. But the heart drips blood,�drips blood the Ah me ! what hearts have been broken, What rivers of blood been stirred, By a word in malice spoken, By only a bitter word. A kindly word and a tender tone,� To only God is their virtue known ! They can lift from the dust the abject head, They can turn a foe to a friend instead; The heart close-barred with passion and pride Will fling at their knock its portals wide, [sears And the hate that blights and the scorn that Will melt in the fountain of childlike tears. What ice-bound griefs have been broken, What rivers of love have been stirred, By a word in kindness spoken, By only a gentle word! Sunday Magazine.
