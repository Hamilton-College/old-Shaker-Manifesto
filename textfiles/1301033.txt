Apples â€”The practice of picking the fruit and putting it in heaps for a few days until the skin toughens, before barreling, is a good one. Put the fruit into the barrels with care, shaking it down when half full, and again when full, so that the apples will fit closely when the head is pressed in by means of the barreling press. The opposite head should be marked as the one to be opened.
