'TO ALL NATIONS There is one feature of the gospel of Christ, we are almost invariably inclined to evade ; and this is the universal application of the gospel to every sinsick soul, no matter of what color or nation he or she may be. There will be people of various colors, desirous of the gospel given us to preach; and what right have we to interdict, by deciding that 'their day has not yet come?' Let us be careful to feed hungering souls, regardless of their color or nationality ; else there may be chargeable to our account a loss to souls, much inhumanity, and a mournful want of Christianity. Let them come, and when they arrive, asking a share in our cross, testimony, and life, do not let there be heard from our habitations queries as to nationalities, or 'what is the color of your skin?' May heaven preserve us from such prejudices ; and from becoming unwilling sharers of gospel comforts with any and all who want to be good. The reminder and rebuke, applies equally well in the East, as in the West.
