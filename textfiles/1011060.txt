MUTUAL FORBEARANCE No Christian grace is likely to be called into play more frequently than that of mutual forbearance. If we resent every apparent injustice, demand the rightings of every little wrong, and if all the other parties in the circle claim the same privilege, what miserable beings we shall all be, and how wretched life will become ! We need to guard against a critical spirit. Some people carry microscopes fine enough to reveal a million animalculge in a drop of water, and with these they can find countless blemishes in the character and conduct even of the most saintly dwellers on the earth. There are others who are always watching for slights and grievances. They are suspicious of the motives and intentions of others. They are always imagining offenses, even where none were most remotely intended. This habit is directly at variance with the law of love, which thinketh no evil. â€” Week Day Religion-
