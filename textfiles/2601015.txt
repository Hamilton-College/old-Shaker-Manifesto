Shakers, N. Y. North .Family. Dec. 1895. We write with the closing month of the year giving us a pleasant greeting; but time is swiftly passing and the year that has gone can never be recalled. Onward must be the motto; those who have wisely improved the time that has been given, happiness is their portion. We notice by The Manifesto, that many of our gospel kindred have passed on to the spirit land. There is a vacancy by the hearth-stone, but we shall meet in the morning light, and we trust and believe that they will minister to their earth kindred in time of need. We would offer a vote of thanks to the Editor aud printers of The Manifesto, for its neat appearance, and to the contrib- utors for the presentation of the truth in a manner that has been most acceptable to intelligent, enquiring minds. November was all that our autumn month could be for the consummation of the work of the season, with rain to fill out the vacancy that existed in the creeks and ponds. By the time these Notes appear, the New Year will have been announced, and may it be one of joy to all of our gospel kindred. Hamilton DeGraw
