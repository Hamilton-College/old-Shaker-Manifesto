Thousands have admired the sheep-skin mats... Thousands have admired the sheep-skin mats, so common among The Shakers. They are easily made, none who can purchase a sheep-skin needs be without one of the mats. Wash the entire skin In soap suds until thoroughly clean and white. Dry the same slowly. Pulverize equal parts of alum and salt, and dissolve in warm water. Next saturate fine sawdust with the liquid, spreading the same on the flesh side, to remain there until dry. Remove the sawdust, and as the flesh side dries rub it until soft. The Shakers have proved that the 'bobs' or fruit of the common sumach compose the best dye for black, elegant and durable. The 'bobs' are brought to a simmering heat for a day or two, in an iron, kettle, when the dye is fit for use ; the iron of the kettle being sufficient to set the colorâ€”a rich black.
