THE PROMISES. NAPOLEON D. BROWN. ' The promise of God is the declaration of assurance, which He has given in his word, of bestowing blessings on his people. Such assurance resting on the perfect justice, power, benevolence 178 THE MANIFESTO. and immutable veracity of God, cannot fail of performance. 'ï¿½ Webster. 'The Lord is not slack concerning his promises.' 2 Peter, iii., 9. We will quote a few of the promises of God. 1. ' Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord. ' Psa. cxii., 1. 2. 'All things work together for good to them that love the Lord. ' Rom. viii., 28. 3. ' The prayer of the upright is God's delight.' Prov. xv., 8. 4. ' Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother.' Matt, xii., 50. 5. 'Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, they rest from their labors and their works do follow them.' Rev. xiv., 13. 6. ' The just shall come out of trouble. ' Prov. xii., 13 7. ' God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom and knowledge and joy. ' Ecc. ii., 26. 8. 'He saved his people from the hand of him that hated them.' Psa. cvi., 10. 9. 'The righteous hate only the haters of God. ' Deut. xxxiii., 11. 10. ' The Lord preserveth the strangers and relieveth the fatherless and widow.' Psa. cxlvi., 9. In the fifth chapter of Matt, from the third to the ninth verses we find promises as follows ; 'The poor in spirit shall obtain the kingdom. ' ' The mourner shall be comforted. ' 'The meek shall inherit the earth.' ' Those that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled. ' 'The merciful shall obtain mercy. ' 'The peacemakers shall be called the children of God.' ' The pure in heart shall see God. ' The pure in heart, only, are granted the privilege of seeing God, and of beholding him as he is, and of feasting on the beauties and comeliness of his being. To see God we must see him by and through our whole body. Our bodies must be full of light. God is a whole, not a part, therefore we must be a whole, or in other words we must be wholly cleansed from all impurity. Our love must be cleansed. We must love God above all others. He should have no rival in our hearts. Forsaking the worldly relationships of father, mother, brethren, sisters, wife, children, private property and their enjoyments, let us go on to purity and perfection. Whosoever looketh on a [man] or woman to lust after [him] or her hath committed adultery already in his heart, Matt, v., 28, and Paul has said. ' It is good for a man not to touch a woman. ' 1 Cor. vii., 1. For the better protection of Brethren and Sisters in the gospel of Christ's Second Appearing all undue familiarity is disapproved, and great care should be observed that we go not in the way of temptation. We may be defiled by the cherishing of impure thoughts, as we lose sight of God. Have God first in the heart to the slaying of self and selfishness ; then love each other as brothers and sisters in spirit. This far excels any mutual worldly relationship. Thinking improperly of any person, will in the end prove to be defiling to the pure in heart. Let God only have a seat there and he will invite the guest to the wedding feast. Let us ask. Do we make the purity of our feelings the greatest enjoyment we have? Do we feel that when we are 'away from the world and the flesh,' that we are nearer to God ? The only chain that is able to bind the natural man and to 'crucify the world with its affections and lusts, ' thereby setting the spirit free, is, in truth, the order of Believers. By obeying this purifying light, we are admitted into the Holy of Holies, and there we can see God and 'follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.' Such Christ delighteth to lead. ' Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. ' Pleasant Hill, Ky.
