'Peculiar People ' The Shakers, aiming to live superior to carnal, passionate impulses, and above the world, become peculiar as a result; with no intention of being singular as a cause. There are no people, who, as a class of religionists, bring equally to bear on all of its members similarly, the restraints of Christianity that do the Shakers. Bishop Hughes, when living, remarked this feature of our church— all were priests unto an exceeding puri- ty—none marry, nor indulge the flesh ; none, are permitted to fight, wage war nor quarrel; none hold private possessions ; and where but little of the gospel of Christ is active, the name and spirit of mine is cast out, and all is ours. Thus is proved that the wrong comes, not in working for our own comfort, but in not seeking the good of others equally well and in excess of our own. It m. good to be thus peculiar.
