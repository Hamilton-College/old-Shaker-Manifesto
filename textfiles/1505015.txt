Reasons for supporting the MANIFESTO. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. Much credit is due the Editor ami Publisher for the able manner in which they have conducted our Journal, the past year, in giving us a new and improved edition of that excellent work. I have been much edified in reading the biographical sketches of some of the first founders of Shakerism. I always feel the wiser and better for having read them. Likewise, the Pictures of 'Our Homes,' in Enfield. N. H. and South Union, and Pleasant Hill, in Ky. They are delightful to look upon. Likewise those in Alfred, and New Gloucester, in the State of Maine. I consider them all model examples, of ''Rural Homes, ' in the world. May God bless the inmates thereof, and increase their numbers, from the rising to the setting sun. 1. Because, It is the best moral reform paper published, and as such, is worthy of universal patronage. 2. Because, It contains original articles, from some of the best writers, among Believers, of both sexes, on Theology etc. 3. Because, The music on the last page, is worth more than the subscription price of the paper. North Union, Ohio.
