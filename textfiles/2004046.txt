Deaths. Andrew Fortier Andrew Fortier, at First Family, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Feb. 15, 1890. Age 66 yrs. 2 mo. and 14 days. Punctual and faithful we shall sadly miss him in the home circle. Rhoda R. Hollister Rhoda R. Hollister, at North Family, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Feb. 15, 1890. Age 71 yrs. 9 mo. and 20 days. For half a century her life was one of unselfish devotion. A dearly beloved, influential and useful sister. Oh cruel stroke which laid our sister low; But heavier far the second blow That screens her from our sight. . Triumphant in the grandeur of her faith She rose in victory o'er the powers of death. We can but say, 'tis right. A. W.
