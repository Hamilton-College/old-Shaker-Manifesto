Rhoda R. Hollister Rhoda R. Hollister, at North Family, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Feb. 15, 1890. Age 71 yrs. 9 mo. and 20 days. For half a century her life was one of unselfish devotion. A dearly beloved, influential and useful sister. Oh cruel stroke which laid our sister low; But heavier far the second blow That screens her from our sight. . Triumphant in the grandeur of her faith She rose in victory o'er the powers of death. We can but say, 'tis right. A. W.
