Cause and effect... Cause and effect are two ends of the same beamthe positive and negative extremities. If they could be separated, both would cease to exist at once. But when a magnetic beam or rod is separated, both parts assume the positive and negative qualities of the original rod. So cause and effect tho ever so obscurely hidden among the mysterious manipulations of environment are never separated in their final issue. O. C. Hampton.
