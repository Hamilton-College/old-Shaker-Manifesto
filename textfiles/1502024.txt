AWFUL GOOD. REV. LEANDER S. COAN. &gt; I respect a good man, parson, Ef he docs have occasional outs, Ef he leaves concerning his motives On the whole small chance for doubts, There are many I'd trust my purse with, My good name, even my life, To whose care I'd leave the honor J*v daughter, or son, or wife.� ' Men well deservin' the title, The praise uv bein' called ' good,' So in what I'm now a savin' I wont he misunderstood. Agin' plenty uv prayin' people I haven't a word to say;� The noblest thing I know uv Is, in Christ's sperit to pray. ' But there's one kind, parson. Who claim to be terrible good, Who think all faith 'n reason Are under their hat or hood. Who talk for the Lord amazin', Beginnin' and endin' with 'I,' Believin' ez Job well had it. That wisdom with them will die. ' Settin' up to judge everybody, Ez though their opinion was law, Without any mercy or jestis; � Ez though they hadn't a flaw In their own spotless whiteness, Which they leave to be understood ;� This is a class well deservin' The title uv ' awful good.' ' An' then agin' there are others So pleasant 'n sweet to your face, So sinilin', admirin', an' artful. Never once sliowin' a trace Uv the spirit with which they bite ore After his back is turned, Until how ' awful good' they are Too late and too well we've learned. '� When I hear a parson prayin'� ' Forgive us ez we forgive ' Who crowds all who will not stoop to him, Ez though they'd no right to live ; Who would injure them even unjustly, Ez few ungodly men would;� The devil may well send a runner To sample the ' awful good.' ' When to pay a dead soldier's outlawed By clutehm' with skinny paw, [note, His sick widow's pension stipend Enriches a covetous maw, An' then a long sermon on ' charity ' Is talked, but not acted out, That there's a sample uv my ' awful good, I haven't a single doubt. ' An' when men stand up boastin' That they never think any sin. Let alone doin' a single wrong, I think its a leetle too thin; � Or, when away on the other extreme, They groan how wicked they are,� I guess if I should say the same Our friendship would get ajar. 'I love a good man. Thank heaven There are more than sometimes seems, Men ez true and pure hearted, Ez kind ez your ideal dreams. But the more I learn of Christians, The better they're understood. I pray the good Lord to deliver me From the eluthch uv the ' awful good.' ' � Old Corporal Bollards.
