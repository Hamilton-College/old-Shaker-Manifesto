TO THE MANIFESTO. Amanda Tiffany. As my old-timed friend the Manifesto for which I so anxiously wait is handed me I am reminded how swiftly time flies, as ever it comes laden with many beautiful truths and testimonies, offerings of sincere, devotedly consecrated souls to the service of God and the uplifting of humanity. It is ever a source of encouragement to me to read of soul battles valiantly fought and victories won. I was forcibly impressed while reading in the August Manifesto, 'Soliloquy,' by Oliver C. Hampton, the truths it contained aud the necessity of frequent self-examinations. It stirred within my soul latent forces and nerved me for greater action. I always love to read the good teaching? of my older Brethren and Sisters. From good Brother Daniel Orcutt's instructions, I have received much good. The Manifesto is a power, a blessing and I would say, speed on thou swift-winged messenger of truth, flood all the laud with light and love, never cease till peace shall bear the sway and right shall triumph over wrong.
