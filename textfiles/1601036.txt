The Rev. Samuel Jones, the southern Evangelist... The Rev. Samuel Jones, the southern Evangelist, says in one of his sermons,â€” 'Every man and woman has to get every vestige of the hog element out of their characters before they can become Christians. I am here to assist in destroying this hog element. 0 Lord, come down and help us kill hogs. I want this to be a regular hog killing meeting.'' The Rev. Samuel hits the nail square on the head. He is right. The hog element should be driven out. Men and women, north and south need something better to warrant them a recommendation into the '' Holy City.' By all means keep the hog out of the souls and bodies of the Christians. Thirty thousand acres of tobacco are under cultivation in the state of Wisconsin. The Methodist conferences held in the state declare their belief that Christian men ought not to raise or sell tobacco.
