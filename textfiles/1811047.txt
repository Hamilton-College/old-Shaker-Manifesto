The Rev. Lewis B. Bates of East Boston, Mass... The Rev. Lewis B. Bates of East Boston, Mass., has been a minister for thirty-six years, and it is a remarkable fact that during his ministry he has never been known to use a 'slang phrase,' or the words 'hell' or the 'devil' in any of his discourses. As a revivalist he has but few equals. Boston Journal.
