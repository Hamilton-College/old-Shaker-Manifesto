Letter Box Shaker Village, N. 11. May, 1882 Emma Shaker Village, N. 11. May, 1882 Dear Sister Sarah;—I felt so thankful this morning during our season of worship for my privilege to grow up in a Christian home, with such true, kind friends who teach me how to live a pure life that 1 resolved I would make myself worthy through obedience and carefulness each day. When I am led to confess and repent of my faults, through the forgiving love of my friends, I feel so happy I can hardly express it. I am told that by this means my conscience is kept tender, and I shall never be left to fall into sin, and I do want to be always pure at heart. I mean to pray continually for strength to resist each evil temptation that I may grow up pure and true like you, dear sister and finally become one of the 'flowers of Heaven.' 164 SHAKER MANIFESTO. I am trying very hard to improve my time in school, there are so many things I want to learn that I may be useful, and able to be a teacher myself some day. My scripture text for this week is 'Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find.' Now, please remember in your prayers, the teachers, scholars, and also, Your little girl—'Emma.
