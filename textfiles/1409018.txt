HOLINESS. NANCY G. DANFOKTH. Our faith is founded on the word of God ; He hath said, 'Be ye holy, for I am holy. ' The Apostle also says : ' Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. ' To be holy is to be pure, even virgins. It was a virgin company that John saw standing on Mount Zion. If we become defiled with sin, our virginity is gone, and we are not justified or saved, until that sin is canceled, and the stain washed from the soul by true repentance, with confession to God before his witnesses. This has always been the manner in which God has dealt with his people ; the way by which they found forgiveness. Under the law they verbally, confessed their r&gt;ins to the Priest, and brought offerings for atonement. Many came to John and were baptized 'confessing their sins. ' When the apostles were gathered at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, many came confessing and ' showing their deeds.' Further, we are exhorted to bring our deeds to the light that they 'may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.' It is said of some, that they will not come to the light ' lest their deeds should be reproved.' As we cannot hide from God, this hiding must be from his chosen' witnesses. He e it is that we ' mortify our members which are upon the earth,' even every earthly desire, and thereby obtain the grace of true humility which is found in its fullness in no other way. The gift is noticed with the peculiar blessing of God, for, 'He resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble. ' In this spirit we find that true repentance, which enables us to forsake sin and live a new life. Again we accept the words of Christ when He .says ; ' Except a man forsake all that he hath he cannot be my disciple ;' also, 'If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me. ' We are required to hate fathers, mother's, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives and children, more than all this, our own lives, also. Not that we are to hate the individuals ; but rather that life which constitutes these relations. In order to hate our own lives, we must practice self-denial until it becomes a pleasure to separate ourselves from all sinful indulgences, where our dispositions would crave gratification ; thus prove ourselves the servants of Christ according to his word, ' Ye are not of the world, even ^ as I am not of the world. ' We must follow our Lord in the regeneration, not in the oldness of the letter, which killeth, but in newness of life ; not in the course of this world, in the gratification of any passion or lust. It is written, ' They that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts ;' and again, ' There remaineth a rest for the people of God. He that hath entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his. ' We believe the fall of man consisted in yielding to time insinuations of lust, and this passion .has debased him below the brutes, for they keep the order of nature. This, even the lust of the flesh, is that beast which ' sitteth in the temple of God,' showing himself that he is God. ' See that ye defile not the temple of God, which temple ye are. ' This shows us where the temple of God is. Who hath not bowed to the god of lust in this temple? Paul said the married care for the things of the world, how they may please their companion, while the unmarried care for the things of the Lord.ï¿½This forgetfulness of God's law, being the state where man first fell from God, here the resurrection must take place. As it was the spirit, not the body which died, so it is the spirit that must rise again. Hence, we 'turn the battle to the gate, ' to overcome our inbred foes. Under the reign of the Prince of Peace, we are not called to meet our fellow mortals in deadly strife ; but to crucify our own inbred passions whence these enmities proceed ; thereby gain the true love of God. This love enables us to speak words of peace and comfort to all. It changes the warrior to a man of peace. It teaches us to love our enemies and to pray for those w ho despitefully use us. Merely believing these things will not save us ; but practicing this beautiful faith every day of our live-, brings salvation from sin, and the full assurance of perfect redemption from the very nature and likeness of the fall. Surely, with this prospect before us. we have a right to rejoice in the heavenly songs of Zion ; for truly we have found the way of holiness and deliverance from the servitude of sin. And now we ask, Where is the soul that is weary of sinful pleasures ? Where the soul that hungers after righteousness? Are you willing to meet God's require-' ment, and forsake all for the kingdom of heaven, for Christ's sake, and the gospel? To such we would say, 'Come, 20 with us, and we will do you good ; for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel,' and concerning his Zion on earth. Here is found the power to lay hold on eternal life and keep it constantly in possession, while dwelling on the earth ; yet above earth's sordid plane. Here we find heavenly comfort in all the trials of life, a balm for the wounded and sorrow stricken spirit. Yet we know that, ' Straight is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there be that find it. ' Canterbury, N. H.
