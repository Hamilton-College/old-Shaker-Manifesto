DISCIPLINE OF GOODNESS LARZ ERICKSON What is it to be good ! How does the goodness of the heart reveal itself? A man or a woman that obtains the goodness of the heart is, in a great measure, a saviour. Soft, mild and kind words are the signs that proceed from a pure heart. A pure heart is like a good spring, always full. And it is noticed far and wide that many come to drink, and gain strength, so long as the heart, as water, keeps clean. But if the spring gives dirty water, people lose their desire for it, and soon none will visit it to be refreshed. The same with a man and woman called out from the world to be saviours. If they become offended, and speak harsh and bitter words, they do great harm to themselves and others. Let us watch and keep our spirits pure ; then we will save many souls and be happy in our saving element. Let us labor to know ourselves as we are, and strive daily to live like our Christian pattern. Then we will think more of our brethern and sisters than of ourselves. Let us not be self-righteous ; it is not the safe way to find fault with almost everybody but ourselves. They that gain the most purity and goodness of heart, find the most fault with themselves, and very little with others. They are the most able to fulfill the law of Christ: 'Esteeming others more than themselves.' Pleasant Hill, Ky.
