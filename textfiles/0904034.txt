Lemon Pie One grated lemon, two and one-half cups of boiling water, one-half cup of cold water, one and one-half cups of sugar, three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, and butter the size of an egg. Put the cornstarch in the cold water and stir in the boiling water. This makes two pies. Bake with under-crust. Beat the whites of three eggs for frosting.
