CREMATION The idea of being buried alive, is, to me, perfectly horrible. This awful dread is, no doubt, shared by thousands. We have reason to believe, that throughout this wide world, there are many, every year of our Lord, who wake up and find themselves boxed and buried, six feet under ground. To poor mortals, in this situation, a few minutes must seem like an eternity. No language can describe the anguish of a human being thus incarcerated. The horrible accounts, we frequently have, of persons buried alive, are enough to sicken the heart of humanity. Cremation is now agitating the public mind. I have, of late, read many articles on the subject. Many good arguments have been advanced, in favor of cremation. But one, most important, has, in my opinion, been overlookedâ€” to wit, cremation puts the danger of being buried alive entirely out of the question. So I go in strong for cremation. Hallelujah ! the day dawns, that when our spirits shall have shuffled off these mortal bodies, the elements that composed them shall melt with fervent heat. Daniel Slzer, Canaan, N. Y.
