TRUE EDUCATION. No. 2. GRANVILLE TEMPLE SPROAT. They passed on, and Peter next perceived several angels bearing golden buckets, full of water, which they poured into sieves. He could not restrain his surprise and disapproval. 'What a folly !' he cried ; 'the water runs out as fast as they pour it in.' The angel sternly rebuked him for this second violation of his pledge, and showed him that the fine sieves strained out leaves, and other matter floating in the water, which ran underground, in numerous channels, all over the garden, to refresh the flowers and fruit trees. Peter hung his head, and proceeded for some time in silence. In a little while, however, they came to a gorgeous chariot whose driver was urging, with voice and whip, two pairs of horses harnessed on his right and left� one pair headed to the east, the other pair to the west. Peter forgot all his caution, and his former experiences. Was he not a teamster, and did he not know ? In a loud voice he called to the charioteer, ' Fasten your horses all in , the same direction, or you can never move. ' Suddenly a bitter repentance fell on him, for he now saw that the horses had wings, and as they strove in contrary directions the chariot rose in the air, as was meant. It was his third offence against the teaching spirit, and the angel put a bandage over his eyes, seized him by the ear, and hustled him out of Paradise, into the sterile place whence he had come. The human is admitted into the society of the angelic, not to criticise, or condemn ; but to love, and assimilate. The first lesson, therefore, is docility. The second lesson is energy. There is a multitude of ringing maxims, with which the wise in all ages have tried to enforce this salutary lesson on idlers, unbelievers, and shivering deserters. ' Fortune favors the bold. ' ' Nothing venture, nothing have.' 'What will you have? quoth God. Pay for it and take it. ' The brawny arm and the heavy hammer arc required to make the anvil of our opportunity ring, and to shape the stubborn masses of our fortune. There are no obstacles which will not go down before the fire and charge of enthusiasm, heroism, and decision. Thrilling voices breathe from the monuments of the mighty dead, and thunder through the dome of fame the truth, '.hat determination, strength, and perseverance, are the three champions of the world. The word to us all is, ' Push ahead?' The youth who tried to climb the Natural Bridge of Virginia is a good illustration of this virtue. He had essayed to write his name on the topmost stone. But the crag crumbled beneath his feet; he was fast losing his hold ; there he hung, a hundred feet in the air ; but he could not go back ; it was push ahead, or die. * And he did push ahead; and at last reached the summit in safety. The third lesson is submission. After the most puissant efforts of our knowledge and power, there are multitudes o� facts with reference to which we are equally ignorant and helpless. Herein our best wisdom is modest surrender and acquiescence. Man's freedom is tethered by law, and at the inevitable limit of his energy, he should voluntarily kneel in submission. This is a lesson we are slow to learn ; but nature is fast in teaching it, and experience thrusts it in on our attention from every side, until, sooner or later, we become aware of its import, though it may be not until we are at our last gasp. Perhaps an illustration will cause us more vividly to appreciate this great truth. ' A man' says the Oriental legend, ' was once sitting with Solomon, 'the sovereign of the Genii, when the Angel of Death, visible in a human shape, passed by, and looked fixedly at him in passing. ''Who is^that?' asked the shrinking companion of Solomon. 'It is the Angel of Death,' replied the king. 'He has come for me!' cried the man, in terror ; ' blow me into India.' Solomon raised a wind which swept the trembler whither he had desired to be borne, and then asked the dread messenger of fate, why he had gazed so sharply at the man. 'Because, he answered, ' sent to take him in India, I was surprised to see him in Palestine. ' The fourth lesson is faith. How clearly, all the way through one allotted term, we are instructed to believe and trust. Nearly the first thing we learn to do is to place implicit confidence in our parents. We are called to believe in the reality and phenomena of Nature about us, and the beneficence of the order by which we live in time and space. Hinting gleams of a concealed truth and glory, greater than we can dream, awaken strange hopes in our breasts. Above all, the continued inspiration of the Divine Spirit always lives, and works in us forever, breathing balm, whispering promises, lifting veils, solving doubts, preaching glad tidings. Faith will lift us above all the clashing elements of time, and enable us to feel that good will triumph over evil, justice over injustice, right over wrong. ' Had you faith to believe,' asked a visitor to the ex-president, J.ohn Adams, sitting under the shade of his trees at Quincy, then an old man over ninety years of age,�as his mind went back to the stormy days of the Revolution,� 'had you faith to believe, amid it all, that you would succeed?' ' Yes' replied the aged veteran, rising and striking the ground with his cane, while the fire seemed to flash from his almost sightless eyes, 'I believed that God would guide the old Ship of State safely through it all! ' The fifth lesson is , love. Here we come to the crowning lesson of all education. Love is the fruition of our faculties at their goals. God has made each scene of beauty and each strain of music preach to the human soul with mystic eloquence, ' Abjure every form of pride and hate, and open thyself to all gentleness and love !' The snarling cynic, soured, scornful, discordant, filled with dislike to everything, can take no comfort anywhere. But the poetic, humane, devout man, who has expelled from every cranny of his being the wicked leaven of selfishness, whose soul overflowing with cordial sentiment, embraces the fair round of nature, .the brotherhood of humanity, and the all blessed Father, he has so learned the lesson of love as to have reached the summit of mortal scholarship, where he clasps the eternal ends of being in their progressive fulfillment. Love will make a heaven of earth, and change all our hells into abodes of blessedness. St. Basil, says the monkish legend, was condemned by the pope to purgatory, to be the companion of devils. But he went among them with so much love and good will in his heart, and such beatific smiles on his face, that the devils all fled from him in dismay. They could not endure the light that beamed from the face of St. Basil. They sent a complaint to Lucifer, their chief. St. Basil was sent to a lower region still. But it was all the same with him ; wherever he went purgatory was changed to heaven ; the devils hid themselves from the light that circled his brow like a halo, and secreted themselves in the deepest caverns of the infernal world. At length, St. Peter, in love to the saint, raised him up to the abodes of the blessed, to be the companion of angels, for it was found that they alone were fit associates for St. Basil. Mt.
