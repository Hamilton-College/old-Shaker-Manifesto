NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. Aug., 1893. There is evidently a strong feeling, prevailing throughout our entire Order, of desire to enter upon a work of self-examination and expurgation of all that is contrary to our principles and hinders our spiritual growth and usefulness Conditions are in many respects at the present time, unsatisfactory, but there is no cause for alarm. Ours has always been a progressive gospel, there is more wisdom, love and virtue among us, as a people to-day, than at any previous period of our history, with a stronger confidence in the value and importance of our mission and a deeper realization of our responsibility. The power that has inspired and sustained us hitherto, will still succour, guide and deliver, as we are individually prepared to take up the cress and move forward in the light of the present day. The call to us is, 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.' This will be a long travel but the end of our faith will be the salvation of our souls. It was suggested some time ago, that yearly, or every two years, a Convention be held to discuss and advise upon points of doctrine and practice. Has the idea dropped? Something needs to be done to engage the interest and enlist the enthusiasm of the progressive minds among us. Our good Sisters, Ann Offord and Catherine Allen have been away from home a little over two weeks enjoying the advantage of sea air. They have just returned much benefited. A company of our Sisters recently spent three pleasant days with Church family Sisters picking blue huckleberries on the mountain. They gathered five bushels. The berries were much appreciated, but the gospel union between the families, was better than berries. The last day they went up to 'Holy Mount' where many a gospel meeting has been held, and upon which a baptism of the power of the Res- THE MANIFESTO. 21') urrection Heavens has often descended. The company joined in song, admired the delightful scenery, and returned home feeling as happy as faithful Believers only can. The homes of Believers are much appreciated as training schools for the young. We have just accepted four boys. 'Cast thy bread upon the waters' is the injunction, and so we think that the good we do in this way is not lost. Health of family good. Crops fair and well harvested so far. Very dry season, and water very low in the brooks. Walter S. Shepherd. Shakers, N. Y.. Second Family. Aug., 1893. We have secured our hay and rye. Oats yet to gather. We have had a severe drought in this section. Corn and potatoes as well as young seeding and pastures have suffered for want of rain. We have now a refreshing rain, two and one half inches have fallen. Have canned some beans. Isaac Anstatt. North Family. Aug., 1893. In reading the testimonies of those royal veteran souls that were the founders of our Communal homes, that at different times have been published in the Manifesto, how puny our efforts seem to be in comparison. We can at least be thankful to be counted worthy to be among the least of the Brethren if thereby we can receive their ministrations. Although arisen, they are still ministering angels, and their blessing is descending upon the faithful ones in this the time of Zion's great need. We are having our first experience in a contest with that persistent foe to the gardener,ï¿½quack. It reminds one of the struggle with the elementary forces of the soul in the effort to bring them under the dominion of the higher law; both can be accomplished, but it requires energetic action. In our more than twenty years experience gardening, the most effectual means that we have found to combat that pest, the cut worms, has been in late fall plowing. Whenever we have faithfully followed that plan they were effectually suppressed. By the time these notes appear our new barn will be finished and ready for occupation. We wish to especially thank Elder Wat| son Andrews, for his clear elucidation and reasons given for upholding t!ie doctrine of the Second Appearing of Christ in the maternil order. It will be a true educator and enlightener of the people. Hamilton DeGr.nr.
