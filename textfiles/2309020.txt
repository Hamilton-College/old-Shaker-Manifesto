Shakers, N. Y.. Second Family. Aug., 1893. We have secured our hay and rye. Oats yet to gather. We have had a severe drought in this section. Corn and potatoes as well as young seeding and pastures have suffered for want of rain. We have now a refreshing rain, two and one half inches have fallen. Have canned some beans. Isaac Anstatt. North Family. Aug., 1893. In reading the testimonies of those royal veteran souls that were the founders of our Communal homes, that at different times have been published in the Manifesto, how puny our efforts seem to be in comparison. We can at least be thankful to be counted worthy to be among the least of the Brethren if thereby we can receive their ministrations. Although arisen, they are still ministering angels, and their blessing is descending upon the faithful ones in this the time of Zion's great need. We are having our first experience in a contest with that persistent foe to the gardener,ï¿½quack. It reminds one of the struggle with the elementary forces of the soul in the effort to bring them under the dominion of the higher law; both can be accomplished, but it requires energetic action. In our more than twenty years experience gardening, the most effectual means that we have found to combat that pest, the cut worms, has been in late fall plowing. Whenever we have faithfully followed that plan they were effectually suppressed. By the time these notes appear our new barn will be finished and ready for occupation. We wish to especially thank Elder Wat| son Andrews, for his clear elucidation and reasons given for upholding t!ie doctrine of the Second Appearing of Christ in the maternil order. It will be a true educator and enlightener of the people. Hamilton DeGr.nr.
