The Classic Literary Mystery The mystery of the authorship of -the famous , 'Letters of Juuius' is still uusfllved.The author surrounded himself with so impenetrable..: veil of secrecy that all the efforts of enquirers, political and literary, failed in dispelling the orlginal darkness. Attributed to Burke' Wilkes, Horn Tookc, Lord Littleton, Lord Shelburne, Sir. Philip Francie, and others, they have never been proved to be the, product of either. Their remarkable compression, point and brilliancy of language, their unrivaled sarcasm, boldness and tremendous invective, not only drew, at the time, such public attention as never before was given to letters of political controversy, but have won them a place at the head of the acknowledged classics in literature. If indeed one's home . library can be considered respectably complete without .thern, they certaiuly greatly enrich any in which they find place. In the exceedingly beautiful and wonderfully cheap (cloth, 45 cents, half-Russia, red edges, 60 cents) ELZEVIH edition, in which they arc just issued by The Useful Knowledge Publishing Company, New York, they will be a temptation to which' thousands of bookbuyers will gladly yield.
