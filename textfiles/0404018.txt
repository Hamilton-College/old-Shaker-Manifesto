POWER OF PRAYER By a young Shaker Sister fifteen years of age. Prayer is the desire of the heart, the breath of the soul. The humblest petition which flows from a sincere heart is more acceptable and effectual than the most eloquent words that may pass the lips without sincerity and true simplicity. Prayer is essential to a true life ; for it is a shield. Jesus said, ' Watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation.' God looks at the heart. He does not measure prayer by the quantity of words uttered, nor take into account the eloquence of those words. David said : ' If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination unto the Lord; and He knoweth them afar off; but He heareth the prayer of the righteous.' The prayer of faith is powerful, as many have proved who have asked Divine assistance in times of trouble and affliction. Jesus said: ''Use not vain repetitions as the heathen do, who think they shall be heard for their much speaking.' If we have faith in God â€” possess childlike simplicity-^are contrite in spirit, and ask with a confiding trust, we shall receive; and shall find the promise true : ' If we knock it will be opened unto us.'
