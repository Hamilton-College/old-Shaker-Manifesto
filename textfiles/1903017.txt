My Dear Youthful Friends:--On coming across... Shaker Village, N. H. Nov., 1888. My Dear Youthful Friends :�On coming across a series of very solid facts recently concerning that very solid material which we call Iron, I purposed transcribing them for you, thinking that you may derive some benefit from read- ing the same. The heading which of itself is suggestive reads :� 'Increase of Value.' Here are the facts : 'A bar of iron worth $5.00, made into horse-shoes is valued at $10.50 ; made into needles is worth $355 ; made into penknife-blades is worth $3,285 ; made into balance springs for watches is valued at $250, 000 !' You, who are somewhat interested in solving pioblems in Arithmetic, can easily discern by a little close attention, what a marvelous increase of value the owner of the five-dollar bar realized after it had been submitted to the manipulation of so many and varied processes. Just try to imagine, if you please, what drilling, beating, rolling, pounding and polishing one crude bar must undergo, to reach the highest state of excellence named ! and how its intrinsic value was increased by every refining process ! Undoubtedly, they whose duty it was to deal the blows, foresaw, that all the varied manipulations mentioned were indispensable in bringing out the finer qualities sought, to fit this single bar for extended manifold usefulness, so that, finally, not less than 250,000 persons were benefitted, rather than one alone. This foresight must have stimulated the artisans to complete the task. The writer, who penned '�Progress is stamped on everything which the kind Father has made,' confirmed a truth which we cannot gainsay. Now, if an object from the mineral kingdom can be wrought into such perfection, who can limit the capabilities of the immortal mind for usefulness, especially when the possessor yields its all 'as clay in the hands of the Potter,' to the moulding and refining processes of gospel truth. 1 trust that you, like myself, will dr w many wholesome lessons from the bare facts quoted. Some of the most important of which suggest to us, patience in trial, humility under reproof, and cheerfulness in self-denial. All of these conditions are necessary for growth in moral and spiritual excellence. Adversity and prosperity are as necessary for mind culture as the sunshine and the rain-cloud prove indispensable agencies, in bringing forward and perfecting the fruits of the earth. Therefore, never yield to discouragement when severely criticised. Remember the lesson of the iron bar and the beautiful passage in Hebrews, xii., 6, 'For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every one whom Hereceiveth.' One more selected story as related by Rev. Martin W. Willis, and I close this somewhat lengthy epistle. lie says, 'Two artists were once engaged to fresco the interior of a lofty cathedral. The swinging platforms were prepared and they commenced their work. They were both ambitious in their professions and spared no pains to render their labor as perfect as possible. One of them had just completed the central figure, and was gazing upon it with intensest delight aud satisfaction. In order to obtain a better stand-point, he moved backward a few steps. The picture gradually swelled into bold relief, and again he receded, entranced with the vision, until he neared the edge of the platform. Another step and he would fall a distance of fifty feet upon the rocks and timber below. His companion, seeing him in such immineut peril, with the greatest presence of mind, grasped a brush and covered the picture with water. The astonished artist, immediately sprang forward to take revenge upon the spoiler, but found him fainting upon the platform. He at once perceived that the painting had been destroyed only to save the life of its author. So our Heavenly Father, when he sees us enraptured with the scenes of the world, and moving backward to danger and death, suddenly casts blight on the fair picture, not in anger, but only to call us back to the arms of Everlasting Love. Please accept these varied lessons with an expression of love and sisterly regard. Kindly ever, ASENATH C. STICKNEY.
