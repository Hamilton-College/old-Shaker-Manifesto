As a guide to peace on earth and goodwill among men, the pamphlet is pre-eminently the book for the times.—Saratoga Co., Standard. 'what strong drink does.' It costs $1,000,000,000 annually in money. It makes 50 per cent of our insane. It makes 65 per cent of our paupers. It is the direct cause of 75 per cent of the murders committed. It makes 80 per cent of our criminals. It sends forth 95 per cent of our vicious youth. It sends one every six minutes into a drunkard's grave, or, 87,600 every year.

To live in a perfect world would be easy. The problem is how to live in this world, and not be one of it; how to participate in its labors and cares, and not contract its taint of moral wrong. . The problem can be solved only in the light of Christianity, which shows us how to live in, and yet above the world; how to be citizens of Heaven and yet sojourners on earth; how to retain a devout temper of mind amid the pressures of worldly duty and difficulties. The Christian restores harmony by bringing Heaven down to earth.— ZiorCs Herald. The truths that we least wish to hear... The truths that we least wish to hear are those which it is most to our advantage to know.—Rural New Yorker. An officer of the Brooklyn Police force...
