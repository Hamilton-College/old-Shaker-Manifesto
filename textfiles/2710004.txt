In Memory of Eldress LOIS WENTWORTH. By Lydia G. Tebbetts. The Spirit world,ï¿½how near! the world we do not see; Yet the sweet closing of an eye may bring us there to be. Its gentle breezes fan our cheek amid our worldly cares; Its gentle voices whisper love and mingle with our prayers. And in the hush of rest they bring, 'tis easy now to see; How lovely and how sweet a pass, the hour of death may be. Scarce knowing if we wake or sleep scarce asking where we are; Death lifts the veil that lies between us and the 'gates ajar.' Sweet souls around us, watch us still, press nearer to our side : Into our thoughts, into our prayers with gentle helping glideLet death between us be as naught, a dried and vanisht stream ; Your glory the reality, our suffering life the dream.
