True Shaker Discipline BY HARRIET BULLABD To be without fault should be the object of every professedly Christian soul. This is at- tained only by severe discipline. To be a full Christian requires a complete subjection of self unto the law of Christ. In the absence of Jesus, the apostles, ancient, holy men and women, we must covenant to accept as our leaders and directors those of our own day who are striving to faithfully represent Christ principles. Having so covenanted, willful dis- obedience on our part is as really rebellion against Christ as though we had said 'I will' or 'I won't' to the person of Jesus. It costs much self-denial always to yield self and selfishness to known and accepted authority, but a cheerful and continued submission there will prove a safeguard from other evils; while to rebel against this is worse than the practice of gross evils, and will even sooner prove the downfall of any unwilling mind. Let those who think they stand uprightly in all else but obedience to their present lead, take heed, or soon they ' Fall like stars to rise no more! '
