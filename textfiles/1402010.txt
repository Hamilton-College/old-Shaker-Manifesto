RELIGION. ANNA ERVIN. Religion is noc ours, until we live by it, in thought, word, and deed, when it goes with us into every place and sits uppermost on every occasion, also forms and governs our hopes and fears our cares, and pleasures. The truly religious person is ever watchful and guarded in spirit; and by a purity of behavior is fearless. Keligion is the name of all that is good, the Angel of Mercy, given to the dwellers of this transient life. It expands and beautifies the affections of the soul. It strengthens the bands of unity. It is the guide of youth in the path of duty, and should be the chosen companion of the inexperienced youth, that its light may illumine their pathway through this life. It is my faith in practical religion that makes my declining years serene with the light that shines from heaven, and a sure refuge is found in Him who watches even the sparrow when it falls. In this faith this consolation is found, that life here is the vestibule of another, bright with immortal hope. En field, Conn.
