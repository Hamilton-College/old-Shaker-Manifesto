Evangeline THAT PRETTY EVANGELINE. VTE published recently under the head of 'A Pretty Surprise' a notice of a now and very charming edition of Longfellow's most cele brated poem 'Evangeline.' Upon examination, the book proves so delightful in every way that we believe it will be a favor to our readers to refer to it again, It is handsomely illustrated, mainly by Birket Foster , one of the most famous of English artists, and bound in exquisite taste in a combination of white and blue cloth, with gilt edges and ornaments, and is sold only by the publishers direct (not by booksellers), at approximately the actual cost of manufacture by the hundred thousand 19 cents a copy, plus 6 cents postage, if by mail. His object is to place an example of his bookmaking in the hands of a vast number of readers. He could certainly choose no more excellent volume, to please all people of good taste. His catalogue of books, covering every department of literature, a veritable feast of good things for book-lovers, and at wonderfully low prices, considerably over 100 pages in size, is sent post-paid for 2 cents.
