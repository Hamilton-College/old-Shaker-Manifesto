The Christian Arbitrator The Christian Arbitrator and Messenger of Peace has entered upon its twenty-fifth year, and removed from Richmond, Indiana, to Philadelphia, Pa. It is a bright monthly, handling the subject of peace and arbitration from a Christian standpoint. A leading article, 'War in the Old Testament,' by the late London banker, George Gillette, puts a new light upon the subject, and is worthy of study by all pastors and Christian professionals. It has a resume of the peace work being done by the W.C.T.U. and other peace societies, both in America and abroad, and much to interest these workers. Takes great interest in the labor movements and should be read by working men, especially Christian working men. It will be the organ of the Christian Arbitration and Peace Society, and is published at the extremely low price of twenty-five cents per annum, education rather than^rofit being its purpose. 209 Cooper St., Camden, N.
