BUILDING AND BEING [An extract from Geraldine. ] The king would build, so a legend says, The finest of all fine palaces. He sent, for St. Thomas, a builder rare, And bade him to rear them a wonder fair. The king's great treasure was placed at hand, And with it the sovereign's one command : 'Build well, 0 builder, so good and great! And add to the glory of my estate. 'Build well, nor spare of my wealth to show A prouder palace than mortals know.' The king took leave of his kingdom.then, And wandered far from the haunts of men.

St. Thomas in dungeon dark was cast, Till the time for his punishment dire were passed. Then it chanced, or the good God willed it so, That the king's own brother in death lay low. When four days dead, as the legend reads, He rose to humanity's life and needs. From sleep of the dust he strangely woke, And thus to his brother, the king, he spoke : 'I have been to Paradise, O my king! And have heard the heavenly angels sing. 'And there I saw, by the gates of gold, A palace finer than tongue has told; ''Its walls and towers were lifted high In beautiful grace to the bending sky; 'Its glories, there in that radiant place, Shone forth like a smile from the dear Lord's face. 'An angel said it was builded there By the good St. Thomas, with love and care,
