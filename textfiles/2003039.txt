POST AND RAIL PEOPLE. [Contributed by E. A. S.] A friend of mine says there are two sorts of people in the world�-'posts' and '-rails,' and a good many more rails than posts. The meaning of this is that most people depend on somebody else� a father, a si.-ter, a husband, a wife, or perhaps on a neighbor. Whether it is right to divide the whole population of the eartli quite so strictly, it is true that we all know a good many rail-like people. Blanche Evans tells me one of the Rail-girls sits by her in school. Miss Rail never had a knife of her own, though she used a sort of pencil that continually needed sharpening; so Blanche's pretty pen-knife was borrc ved until one day the Rail-girl snapped the blade. Blanche was so tired of lending the knife that she was not very sorry. Miss Rail's brother works beside Henry Brown in the office of the Daily Hurricane. They both set type, and Henry's patience is sorely tried by Master Rail. If Henry tells him to-day whether the / is doubled in model when ed is added, he will have forgotten tomorrow ; and Henry has to tell him whether the semicolon comes before or after viz., every time he 'sets it up.' The truth is, the Rail-boy doesn't try to remember these things; he has taken Henry for a post and expects to be held up by him. I met two pretty young ladies traveling together last summer. One was always appealing to the other to know if they were to change cars at Osanto, or not until they reached Dunstable, or if they should not change at all. She asked her companion the time, though her own watch was in order; she 'couldn't bother to remember' names of routes and hotels and people, but she found it very convenient for somebody to do all this for her, and she never concealed her surprise if her friend forgot or neglected anything. Being a post is often unpleasant, but how much worse it is to be a rail! The post can stand by itself�but take it away, and where is the rail? Boys and girls have this advantage over a woode.n fence�if they fear that they are rails, they can set about turning themselves into posts at once, and they will find the post business a far more delightful one.
