A Fitting Rebuke to Fighting Christians (?) Bishop Coxe, of Western New York, recently sent a poem to the Buffalo Commercial Advertise?', brim-full of the spirit of war, calling to arms everyone, to help the Russians and to kill the Turks ! So very unlike the Jesus this poet-priest pretends to worship, the poem has attracted large attention from the secular pi'ess. Hie Albany Express delivers a most denunciatory lecture upon such, so-called, Christianity, and prints the following poem, from The Graphic, by W. A. Croffut, which is so full of rebuke to those who think Christianity admits of any physical violence, that we gladly transfer it to our columns, as an aid in diffusing light upon the character of the Prince of Peace, and to use a whip of large-corded testimony against the Christianity of such a Bishop ! BY A NEWSPAPER HERETIC. Thou man of God (?) who thus implore Thy brother's sacred blood to pour In hateful tides of turbid gore From Dardanelles to Danube's shore, Be still—be still! Blaspheme no more! God help the babes ! God bless the wives ! Shame on the priests that whet the knives ! Shame on the church whose altar thriyes By wrecking peaceful peasants' lives? Be still—be still! 'Tis Hell that drives! How long, O, Lord, before thy shrine Shall men pray, 'Vengeance, God, is thine,' THE SHAKER. 61 Then worship Moloch as divine, And drink the battle's bloody wine? Be still—be still— O, heart of mine ! ***** Come holy Peace ! May Muscovite And Moslem end their wretched fight; Women with songs shall hail the light, And children flock with flags of white— Be still—be still— O, sacred sight!
