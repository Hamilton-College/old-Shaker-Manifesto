WHO WILL THANK YOU FOR IT? JOSEPH WOODS. The above I overheard in reply to an interested person who expressed a desire to finish a certain piece of work that day. I thought what are thanks worth ? They are simply an expression of gratefulness to the donor for some favor received. The Bible teaches us in every thing to give thanks and informs us that, whosoever is unthankful is unholy, but, whosoever does any good deed with no higher motive than the thanks and praise of those with whom they are associated, work for very poor pay and evidently love the praise of men more than the praise of God. It was said of Jesu?, tw his reward is with him and his work is before him. ' He said, his meat and drink was to do his Father's will and his reward, in so doing, was a continual increase in the resurrection, with a constant self-sacrifice of all that constituted the world until he was able to declare, ' my Father loves me for I do always those things that please him. ' He said fcnto his disciples, 'be of good cheer I have overcome the world.' and to the Father he said, ' I have finished the work thou gavest me to do. ' No praise, no thanks of mortals can take the place or be the reward of the rightful heir whose whole soul's interest is in the household of faith and in all the consecrated interests of whatever name or nature. The rightful heirs are not, cannot be hirelings, but are joint heirs with their Lord and Master to an inhe: itance corruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away. When an individual becomes a follower of Christ; all duly becomes a blessed privilege for which they are thankful to do good continually. Canterbury, N. H.
