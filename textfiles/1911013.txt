Articles published in the Manifesto must be referred to the authors for any explanation that may be required. New views and good views may be both pleasant and profitable. Theological notions are of far less value than religion or practical righteousness, and in order to be saved from the sins of the world, one must live a life consecrated to God and to his people. Through the kindness of a friend we are able to distribute several copies of the Manifesto, gratuitously. An}7 person, not able to pay the subscription price, can have the paper sent to them free by forwarding to us their address on a postal.
