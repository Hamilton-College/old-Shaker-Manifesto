Dear Eldress A.: Is the testimony borne by the Shakers of today the same as that borne by Jesus and his apostles eighteen centuries ago ? And, in their daily lives, do their profession and practice agree? These are simple propositions for discussion by those who are interested in the growth and spread of true principles. If the underlying principles of the institution are true, they will bear strict scrutiny ; if they are false, let it be proved by honest investigation. We claim that Shakerism is not only a revi val of Christianity, as preached and practiced by Jesus and his Apostles, and also practically exemplified in the primitive. Church; but that it is the revelation of the Christ Spirit, through the female, which has given new impulse and strength to all its parts. May I be permitted, through the columns of the Shaker and Shakeress, to express my gratitude for the great privilege that I am enjoying in my beautiful Shaker home. Here I can live a pure, chaste life, through which I receive a plenitude of spiritual and temporal blessings. I feel that my life is so free! O that those of my sex who are in captivity could realize this as / do! how gladly would they flee the false pleasures of the animal, sensuous life, and, of their own volition, accept the straight path into which truth would lead them. Then would they know how good is the power of truth that is able to make souls 'free.' My heart is drawn out in love and gratitude to the guardians and teachers of my early days; my thanks are due to them for their timely discipline. By love, they guided my feet in Virtue's paths, and led me in Wisdom's ways, which are safe, peaceful and pleasant. I am now able to see that ' what we associate with we become like,' in a great measure; and, if we would be pure in spirit, we must keep our bodies pure ; for it is impossible that any person can be a true follower of Christ while living in sensual pleasure. Only those ' Who govern their passions with absolute sway, Will grow wiser and better as life wears away.' Betsey Johnson, Tyringham, Mass.
