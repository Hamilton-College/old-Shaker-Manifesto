Dearly beloved Ministry, Elders, Brethren and Sisters... Union Village, O., June 30, 1844. Dearly Beloved Ministry, Elders, Brethren and Sisters :�The feelings with which I sit down to write to you can not be described, and you will not think strange of it, I presume, when you learn the reasons. I arrived at this place in good health and without harm, on Thursday evening the 28th inst. and found the Ministry and people in health and prosperity, so far as I have been able to learn. On Friday morning, the 29th, the Ministry informed me that it was felt best for me to be released from all burden and care, and to make my home at Union Village. Notwithstanding it is the greatest cross that I have ever met in my life, yet you see, I have no choice left me. Yet this is the gift of God for me and I submit to it with as much cheerfulness and fortitude as I am able and trust and believe that you all, my dear gospel friends will do likewise. 1 always believed in going with the gift, in simple obedience to that which was before me. I never found comfort nor blessing in any other way, nor ever expect to, hence, I would sooner lay down a half dozen lives than to oppose the gift of God and rebel against 114 THE MANIFESTO. the same, and this I believe is your faith. It will be very natural for some to think or say, 'If he must be released, why not stay at home ?' My natural reason would be as ready to ask this question as any one of you, seeing that T feel in myself that I could walk in simple obedience in any order then. But these things are not for us to ask or question. And now permit me, I beg of you, my good Brethren and Sisters, to give you one word of counsel in this my last and farewell address :�'Have faith in the gift of God. Be cheerful, knowing that we are God's heritage and that He will take care of his own, and will not neglect, nor forsake them. Do not judge the gift of God, I beseech you, nor cast reflections on any one in regard to this change. Remember, the greater our crosses and tribulation, if we bear them cheerfully, the brighter we shall shine. Do not reflect on any one. Censure no one, for you will be sure to be wrong and on whomsoever the anointing may rest, gather to it in love and respect, and God will respect and reward you in so doing. You may know and feel assured that the hand of God is in it, and who can withstand God? Who can search out his ways? no one;�therefore touch not the Ark nor look therein, lest his displeasure rest upon us as a flaming sword. Receive these my farewell words to you, my love and blessing. I feel a glow of comfort in Qne reflection, that is, I leave you without a single unpleasant feeling against any soul, and I believe you all love me, and O may it never grow cold. I will only add,�I was doing and had done the best I was able in supporting the order of the gospel and work of God while I was with you, nevertheless I do desire in humbleness of body and spirit, to say, that if I ever have said or done any thing, at any time, that has been any loss to any one, or that has hurt the feelings of any one, aged or young, Brother or Sister, I do beg of you to be so kind as to forgive me, and I promise I will be no dishonor to you wherever I may be called. It is not necessary to add more, but I desire to be remembered in your prayers. Farewell, Most Affectionately, Harvey L. Eads.
