PRAYER. [Contributed by C. Jacobs. | ' More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voiceRise like a fountain for me night and day. For what are men better than sheep or goats, That nourish a blind life within the brain, If, knowing God, they lift not hands of pra3rer, Both for themselves and those who call them Mend?' For so, the whole round earth is every way Bound by gold chains about the feet of God. Tennyson.
