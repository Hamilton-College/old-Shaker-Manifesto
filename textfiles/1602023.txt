All the signs of the time... All the signs of the time evidence that the voice of God is sounding on all sides and in many formsï¿½all to the end that man may grow and compass the end for which he was made. All humanity is in a process of resurrection, the moving and Jife-power of which is the Spirit. All are encompassed in this good work of God, as any devout student of true science may discern ;. showing that in Deity we all have a common Father, and hence as we progress in the stages of our resurrection-birth, we see and realize and act on the truth that we are brothers and members of one body. The above from the pen of M. L. Bloom, in the Day Star of Dec. 24th. is another echo of the voice of God among men. It is one of the refreshing signs of advanced thought when one can stop in the whirl of pxcitement that is chasing after gold and glory and calmly tell ns that 'all humanity is in a process of resurrection. That they are coming up into the varied stages of this resurrection birth, to learn of the divine Teacher how they may live and die uo more. Those who accept this view of the subject have entered into a work which must ultimate in the Kingdom of God upon the earth. Jesus ascended so far in the resurrection that he spoke with confidence, 'I and my Father are one. ' It was a glorious work, a far better ascension than that of the old prophet in a chariot of lire. It was a discipline of the mind to that extent that his whole life was in harmony Avith a life in God; and as Jesus lived, so should those live who claim to be his disciples. Accepting this view we can have but little interest in a resurrection of dry bones as seen by the prophet, or in one of corruptible bodies at the anticipated end of the world. God's good work, as the writer says, will encompass all, and we shall realize that we are brothers and sisters, members of one body. Our fortunate remove of more than a score of years from the frightful savagery of contending armies, has given us time to reflect, and to ask the question in all kindness, Are we not brothers ? Should we not learn to treat each other as the children of one Heavenly Father and heirs of immortality ? If a revival of God's work can find a place among men, and the spirit of the resurrection of Jesus Christ call them forth into new life, which shall establish them in practical righteousness, then we may. look with confidence to the advent of the millennium of God's love.
