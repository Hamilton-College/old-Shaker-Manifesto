FREEDOM OF THE HUMAN WILL Know then that ev'ry soul is free, To choose his life and what he'll he ; For this, eternal truth has given, That God will force no Man to Heaven. He'll draw, persuade, direct him right, Bless him with wisdom, love and light, In nameless ways he good and kind, But never force the human mind. Freedom and reason make us men, Take these away what are we then? Mere animals and just as well, The beasts may think of heaven or hell Then let no one their powers abuse, But ways of Truth and Goodness choose; Our God is pleased when we improve And seek for grace and win his love. It's my free will for to believe, ¦ 'Tis God's free will, me to receive; To stubborn willers this I'll tell, It's all free grace and all free will. Then if they take the downward road, And make in hell their last abode • Our God is clear and they will know, They plunged themselves in endless wee. Selected.
