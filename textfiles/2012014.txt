Beloved Elder Henry:--We have, through the past year... East Canterbury, N. H., Oct. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½'We have, through the past year, been both pleased and interested by the Manifesto history of the Church at Mt. Lebanon, and now as the year closes, we would extend our sincere thanks to the Editor and also to the Contributor of this interesting account. We feel certain that an acquaintance with the difficulties overcome and efforts made by our gospel parents to establish the beautiful religious home of which we are privileged to become members will be a powerful incentive to us, as young people, to go and do likewise as much as our ability and opportunity will permit. We would emulate our precious friends in their labor for posterity by doing our utmost to preserve the structure which they built, and to leave to our children an equally beautiful home, both externally and spiritually. We humbly acknowledge 'The blessings rich and many, which are ours to share to-day,' and as a New Year's gift please accept our promise to consecrate ourselves more devotedly to the Cause we love so well and which has done so much for us. Though we have but one talent, we will use it to the utmost and return it to our God with usury. Hoping that the New Year may bring renewed health and comfort to the faithful Editor of our little Magazine I remain one of your many readers. Margarette Davis.
