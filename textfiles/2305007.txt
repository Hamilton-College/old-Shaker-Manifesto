In Memory of our departed Sister, MARY J. LEWIS. Henry W. Fredrick. A Sister whom we all dearly loved, and who ever will be worthy of our kind remembrance. She entered the Community at White Water, O., about forty-seven years ago? and after living there some ten years, she moved to Watervliet, O., which has been her home from that date. Our Sister has always been a faithful Believer, and her kindness was to all without partiality. Her spiritual interest in the prosperity of souls remained active during all of her gospel experience. Although of such an advanced age, she remarked a short time before her death;� 'I believe in doing all the good I can, and I think that is the way to gather souls to the work of the gospel.' She was faithful in every duty. The temporal and the spiritual interests were all carefully considered, and she would say:�'We must not be idle and rust out. We must be interested for the good of our gospel home.' Sister Mary now goes to receive her great reward, and in this there can be no doubt. What is one profited if in gaining the treasures of this world, the soul is lost? We want to save our souls, and assist in the saving of other souls, so far as we are able. The world has nothing for us, and our time is lost in seeking for those perishable treasures. We will search for spiritual treasures that we may enter the kingdom of heaven. Let us keep ourselves pure and clean that we may be able to meet our Heavenly Father, and his chosen flock. Glory to God in the highest. Watervliet, O.
