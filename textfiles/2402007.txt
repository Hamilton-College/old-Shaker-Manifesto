Beloved Elder Henry:--In thinking... Shakers, N. Y., Dec. 1893. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½In thinking what would be a proper spirit in which to start the new year, the subject of thankfulness, for both temporal and spiritual blessings seemed very appropriate. When we look abroad and see the suffering even in a physical sense that is destined to be the lot of thousands of our fellow mortals the coming winter, a just appreciation of those seem in order. We always want to look on the bright side, and 'never cross a stream until we get to it;' but, judging from past history, the most potent factor to arouse the human mind to a just appreciation of its duty to the divine Spirit is suffering; to cause it to yearn for something higher than its present state. We earnestly hope that the present unsettled conditions of human society will be the means of awakening the dormant spiritual energies of the race. We believe it will, and that those who have treasured in their storehouses the truths of the divine life, will be blest with the privilege and enjoy the pleasure of dispensing them to needy souls. Through the kindness of a gospel Sister we were favored with a loan of some of the sayings of Mother Lucy Wright, compiled by Isaac N. Youngs in 1820. The divine truths therein expressed and handed down to her spiritual children, can be transmitted through the ages without any dimunition of their lustre. At present date, Dec. 1st, fall work is about finished on the farm, and we have begun to haul our supply of wood, and are building and repairing fences. The present indications are that we shall have a mild winter. If the prognostications are correct, we can not say that we are sorry, but time will give us evidence of the truth. Applicants for admission into the higher life are few and far between, but we will toil on and not faint; and though the 'harvest is great and the laborers are few,' yet we will with fervor of spirit and in faith pray the Lord of the harvest to send more laborers into the field.
