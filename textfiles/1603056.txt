THE MIRACLE. Two Highlandurai were having a dispute about how a certain minister preached, one defending, the other abusing him. At last one said�'The way he preaches is no as if the Bible were true at all. It is shust like takin' tagoot speerit out of ta pottle an' fillin' it wi' water. There's little pith in that. I'm told that he says that Jonah was an emblem of evil, and the whale was a publichoos, whaur Jonah was taken in, when, after three days, they had stripped everything off the sailor, they cast him out. It is most awfu'. Not but I'll deny there is deeficulties. It has always been a deeficulty to me hoo five men ate, or could eat three thousand loaves. I canna eat more nor ane at a time mysel, put it was that perhaps that was the meeracle. ' ' And did you, in all your travels, ' said another, joining the attack, to the first who had been a sailor, 'ever see a whale wad tak' in a man in sic a manner? That's a question the minister has often put to me, so it's c lear he doesn't believe in it. ' 'No, I never did! put maype the whales in Jonah's time were pigger than noo. But' onyway, I wish you to tak' the lesson the minister gied to John Farquhar, wha was aye asking him hard questions like the whale, and things like it ' 'What was that?' ' ' Weel,' says he, 'if you had a goot pit o&gt; peef put down pefore ye when ye was hungry, its not on the pones ye would pegin first. There's fine, juicy, sappy things in the Bible, an' it would be better to be feedin' on them than to be worrying over dry bones like the whale. '�Scottish American. 'What did the Puritans come to this country for?' asked a Massachusetts teacher of his class. ' To worship in their own way, and make other people do the same,'' was the reply. �Sunday-schoolteacher: 'Why did not the lions touch Daniel? ' American boy (who reads the newspapers) ' 'Cos they were 'fraid to. ' Teacher: 'Why?' A. B. : ' 'Cos they were British lions ! ' What they fight tor.�The writer of the satirical pamphlet ' John Bull and His Isle' has the following; The French fight for glory, the Germans for a living, the Russians to divert the attention of the people from home affairs : but John Bull is a reasonable, moral, and reflecting character. He fights to promote trade, to maintain peace and order on the face of the earth, and the good of mankind in general. If he conquers a nation it is to improve its condition in this world and secure its welfare in the next; a highly moral aim, as you perceive. ' Give me your territory and I will give you the bible !' Exchange is no robbery.-�Exchange. Tourist�'I say, boy, what's the name of that hill yonder?' Boy�'Dunno.' Tourist�'Don't know? What! lived here all your life and don't knew the name of it?' Boy�'No; the hill was here afore I corned.' A local preacher selected for his text the words: ' These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also, ' and presented his thoughts in the following order : '1st, The world is the wrong side up. 2ndv It must be turned the right side down. 3rd, We are the men that can do it.' A story is told of a Protestant bishop in Atlanta, Georgia. He recently addressed a large assembly of Sunday school children, and wound up by asking in a very paternal and condescending way: 'Now, is there a-a-n- y little boy or a-a-n-y little girl who would like to ask me a question?' After a pause, he repeated the question : 'Is there a-a-n-y little boy or a-a-n-v little girl who would like to ask me a question?' A little shrill voice called out: 'Please, sir, why did the angels walk up and down Jacob's ladder when th^y all had wings?' 'Oh! ah, yes, I see,' said the bishop, 'and now, is there a-a-n y little boy or a-a-n-y little girl who would like to answer little Mary's question?' He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all. S. T. Coleridge, in Humane Educator.
