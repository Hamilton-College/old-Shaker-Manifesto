LOVE FOR THE YOUTH. Mary Whitcher. We love the youth Who love the truth And work for Zion's home, And we would ask No sweeter task Than do for them, each one. No matter where Their home or care, They're all our precious youth And we shall pray For good each day For them, while on the earth. Canterbury, N. H.
