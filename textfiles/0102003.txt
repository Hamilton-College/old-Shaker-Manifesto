Spirit Examination What is in thy heart for God ? Search its depths, and see If them hast a place for Him, Kept in purity. 'Mid the treasures of thy life— Treasures without strife— Hast thou ever for the Lord, A willing sacrifice ? What is iiji thy heart for God ? Are thy joys of earth ? Or hast thou deep happiness Of enduring worth ? And art thou a fruitful branch— Of the living tree, Clothed with innocence, with peace And true humility ? What is in thy heart for God ? Do thy hopes ascend Unto truth, and holiness That shall never end? Is thy love a living fount, Gushing, bright and clear ? Doth the image of the Lord Within its source appear ? All /have I give to God, And his blessed cause ; Praying, that my life may be Guided by his laws. Lead me, holy spirit, down, 'Till I see my loss. Strengthen me, to do the work That cometh by the cross. C. D., Mt. L., N. H.
