Ayer, Mass. Aug. 1892. Dear Editor:The drouth has finally ended. For three long weeks, Old Sol poured down his rays with double intensity. Our supply of water which has seldom been known to fail during a term of forty years, has been proven to its extremity this time, and had not nature blest us with a refreshing shower, to-day, before the week had ended, we could have told you a long story of our wonderful spring. However, our crops are looking quite well. More hay, and that of a better quality, has been cut this year, than during any of the last ten years. Potatoes bid fair for a good crop. Indian and ensilage corn are growing finely, and a stalk has been brought to the house that measured in height, more than nine feet. A. D. B.
