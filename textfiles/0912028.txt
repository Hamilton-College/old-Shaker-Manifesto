BE KIND TO THE SISTERS Boys, be kind to the sisters. You may live to be old, and never find such tender, loving friends as these sisters. Think how many things they do for you; how patient they are with you ; how they love you in spite of all your ill-temper or rudeness ; how thoughtful they are for your comfort, and be you thoughtful for theirs. Be ever ready to oblige them, to perform any little office for them that lies in your power Think what you can do for them, and if they express a wish, be ready to gratify it, if possible. You do not know how much happiness you will find in so doing. I never yet knew a happy and respected man who was not in youth kind to his sisters. There is a beautiful song which says : Be kind to your sisterâ€”not many may know The depth of true sisterly love ; The wealth of the ocean lies fathoms below The surface that sparkles above.
