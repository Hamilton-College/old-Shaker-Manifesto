FORGIVENESS. Peter asked Jesus how often his brother should sin against him and he forgive him. Jesus answered until seventy times seven. It seems that Peter thought if he forgave his brother seven times, that was enough, but Jesus taught him, and the lesson teaches us, to forgive seventy times seven, which means we must forgive all our lives. When we forgive a person, we should not do it in the spirit that we will furgive him, if he will never do the wrong again, but forgive in the spirit that we are just as bad ourselves, only we did not happen to do the same thing that our neighbor did. If we have this spirit it will lead us to forgive aright. , 12 yrs old. Canterbury, N. H. Alice Floyd
