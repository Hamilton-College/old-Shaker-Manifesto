To the young men and women... [To the young Men and Maidens in the several Societies of Believers called Shakers. By an outside friend and well-wisher.] DtARLY Beloved ;�Your good home counselors rre much better qualified to instruct you and to guard and restrain you from evil influences than any one else on earth possibly can be ; yet I am [impressed that a voice from without�a voice from one who has had wide and varied experiences in the outer world might possibly engage your attention for the time and be of some service, and if so I shall have performed a pleasant duty which I feel to owe the cause for much kindness extended to me. Not that I thus expect to cancel the debt of gratitude and love I owe, since my life's best service can scarcely do so much, but through love promptings of the Holy Spirit as I humbly trust and believe I feel a lively interest in your temporal and spiritual welfare ; whereiore, if there be any among you, of either sex, who like the Children of Israel (historical and allegorical) are hungering after the ' flesh pots of Egypt, ' to you, and for your, kindly admonition is this my simple epistle written. I know from experience (I am forty two years of age) that the ever momentous and eventful question, 'If not to enjoy the pleasures of this life why was I created upon the earth?' very often presents itself to young persons. Questions of similar import seem to have presented themselves to the man Jesus of Nazareth. Perhaps I might more clearly illustrate my meaning with the familiar fable of a foolish lamb. Through the watchful care of the shepherd the flock were nightly secured against the ravages of wolves ; but this foolish lamb, like many a youth, longed for a 'free' (?) gambol alone on the pleasant green by moonlight, and, so, strolling care- lessly away from the herd quietly retired to a secluded spot until the gates were closed when it sallied forth for a free gambol 'by moonlight alone;' but its short lived pleasures proved the folly of its sportive whim, for a hungry wolf hovering near the fold found it an easy prey to his insatiate lust for joung and tender flesh. Tis thus the tempter seeks the gentlest of God's creatures as easiest to decoy. You ask, what are we created for if not to enjoy the pleasures of life? I would answer, assuredly, that is what we are created for, and not only to enjoy the pleasures of this life but to pi epare us for the enjoyment of continued pleasures through a life of eternal pleasures, far transcending the highest pleasures we can conceive of on the bound less shores of eternity. How common the expression, ' O! I want to move in good society ! ' Ah yes ! so do I. But we have some preparation to make before we can be accepted. We must have suitable apparel with which our deportment must be consistent. We must be 'polite,' we must, in manners, wear the 'polish' of ' refinement' and this requires ' culture.' For better particulars and further explanation see commands of Jesus and Mother Ann as well as admonitions of Paul, etc Yes, my dear young friends, we are pleasure seekers in this mundane sphere and to reach the goal we must adapt means to an end. I shall take the position in this connection that man�the human family, as a subject of God's creation�for a purpose�is, first, a material elementary structure formed of the dust of the ground. That as God, the creator, is immortal, the inbreathing of His life principle into the subject of formation renders that subject immortal also. Thus we have an individualized material structure invested with the principle of life-immortality. This being, in the state of purity as originally designed by the creator, is Godman, or God-in-the-human. And, did death come to an individual thus formed and invested there would follow a state of annihilation or extinction of the individual, while life�the immortal�the investure would return to its author in or through absorption and be lost to identity. Hence the need of a mediator-. Adam the first is of the earth, earthy. The second Adam is spirit;�of the spirit, spiritual. Now, if we ' put on Christ' we have the spirit in its most sublime purity and are redeemed. Put on? Yes, put on Christ! Not to pit passively by the way in waiting for the spiritual or Christ to be put on, the work of preparation is for you I 'Ask, seek and knock. ' Yes, we are seeking to attend a grand entertainment, given by angelic hosts, and we want to be decently clad. Could you ' ask ' any grander array than to be ' clothed upon with the spirit? ' Paul tells us in 1 Cor. xv., chapter that there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and our spirit friends assure us. Paul also tells us in same chapter that when the natural�i. e. physical�body dies it remains in the earth�earthy, while the soulimmortal life thus disembodied comes forth embodied, spiritually, and so retains its individual identity for good or evil as its individual status warrants or demands in final judgment. In this life we are probationers and our needs, both for time and eternity, demand action.�No drones in the heavenly mansions�No drones here if we would weave and prepare that pure and spotless garment (spiritual) which alone can secure our heavenly passport. No time to devote to idle and useless pastime which can bring us no solid comfort here or pleasure hereafter; yet, with a positive knowledge of these facts before us, we would, sometimes, allow the tempter�the world�to pursuade us. Jesus was led of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted. What true believer has not had such an experience? In the wilderness! When a 'seeker' yet undetermined upon a future course of life finds him or her-self standing for the time, disassociated from all human connection, undecided as to what step to take they are in that wilderness state of unguarded loneliness in which the tempter delights to find them. Though not beyond the Shepherd's call, they may fail to recognize the faithful voice of friendly admonition as so distinct from the wily flatterer whose words are words of deceit. In this condition we are shown the gorgeous splendors of the even plane of earth life ; we may he set upon a pinnacle of the temple who e we are offered a pastorate or, perhaps a bishopric in some popular church organization, or we may be taken to the summit of a high mountain from whence we may anticipate the honor of worldly distinction as ruler of nations, and now, to complete the temptation we become 'hungry' having all this while 'fasted, ' for, although we cannot live by ' bread alone ' yet are we forced to concede the necessity of material aliment. Must we, therefore, seek to obtain this by virtue of our authority to command? Choose ye as chose Jesus and obtain the reward of that better part which the world can neither give nor take away. Be assured, by one who would never deceive you, that the so-called pleasures of earth founded in lust are ever found transient and fleeting as are the moments of time they engage, while their fruition brings satiety as distasteful and revolting as their momentary excitation was, before, intoxicating. Mount to the summit or drink to the dregs of worldly pleasures (?) and, still, there are unsatisfied desires demanding more and broader adventure until the restless mind catching wildly at every chymerical phantasy is allured from one extreme of passion�of worldly sensual lust�to another until hope, the day star of destiny, is drowned in a sea of dissipation and the victim is hurled beyond the reach of recovery. 'Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.' His servants ye are to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey. With the lights as you have presented by the? best of friends your lives will be just what you, yourselves, elect; and with whatever 'clothing' you leave this world the same will you begin life in the spirit world with. Wherefore, if you would commence life over there upon a plane of calm contemplative energy able to realize and enjoy the peaceful pleasures of the pure and spotless children of the redemption choose now the even, conscientious course of those who, having consecrated life, time and talents to the kingdom ol leaven, stand firm and unflinching in their daily devotions to the sacrificial altar of all animal affections as preparatory to that virgin state of heavenly purity which, alone, can yield true and lasting pleasure such as shall continue to expand and intensify in. righteousness, in holiness, in love when age on age shall have passed and gone. Worldly society is heterogeneous�made up of all sorts�full of deceit and hypocrisy. Indeed it is absolutely impossible to mingle with worldly society and, at the same time, maintain a true Christian deportment. A congenial element must be maintained even, among thieves. Physical aura is an uncompromising tell-tale�' Murder will out ' is an. old saw but a very true one. You cannot serve two masters. If you determine to ' divide time ' with the world you are gone over. Christ is not divided, Christ is not divisible. Oh! that I could approach you with tongue instead of pen to tell you of the cunning duplicity of the children of the world. Think of the lords of creation revelling in the abundance which labor unrequited is daily heaping up to be thus consecrated to wanton licentiousness! Do these merciless tyrants live without labor? Ah! no, this is impossible. Hence to live without one's own labor is to steal or take perforce the fruits of another'.* labor. How much worse is the highwayman who, without any sanctimonious pretensions, or shield of law boldly takes from them what they grind out of the poor? And you would cast your lot among these? Oh! never! Surely reason would restrain, you though you should spurn the gentle warnings of the spirit Nay my dear young brothers and sisters. Yield not to the tempter. Sell not your birthright for that which can only prove your eternal ruin. Stand by your home counselors and thank God that He has graciously cast your lot among friends�loving guardians, brothers and sisters who can never deceive you. Perfect contentment is never found on earth which yearning of the spirit assures us of .a glorious immortality. ' Learn to labor and to wait. ' Ever your friend in tender solicitude. W. A. J.
