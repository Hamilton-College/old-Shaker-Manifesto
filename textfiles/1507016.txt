BE DILIGENT. GEOEGE BAXTER. As rightful heirs to the inheritance of divine truth which the gospel ministration brought to us and chosen by the highest intelligence from which comes all light and truth, we should ever be diligent at home or abroad and weave the threads of life to bind the spirit and body, that every condition may harmonize. Then advancement in spiritual growth will be untrammeled, the fulfilling of laws necessary for our united gospel home, and the elevation of its occupants will continue, making our life brighter and our associations purer. This purification being our sacred duty to accomplish, gained as it is by diligence in having a care for all laws which have descended to the children of Zion's home. We should use this legacy for the benefit of those with whom we come in contact, and for our own welfare. Those who are blindly walking into danger, caused by negligence, the violation of laws in different phases of life, the influence of deception, lack moral courage or a settled state of the mind. In this they deceive and corrupt the spirit and injure all noble aspirations. Blessed, indeed, are the pure in heart, the peace-makers, for they are the children of wisdom whose light can never be extinguished. Like the altar in Zion's home, incense arises which purifies all surrounding vessels. They receive their reward daily, and may those who accept such as their teachers, who are striving to break asunder all bonds of sin, listen to the spirit call which says,ï¿½'Are you doing- your duty daily? Tell me what of the day, I have passed all earthly trials and entered the light of the perfect sphere. Gladly I bid you continue and hasten over the barren way. Learn to bear all cares and sorrows, and though the way seems dark, remember that open door through which God's pure light appears, and whose rays willTHE MANIFESTO. ltti illume your way, and prove true throughout all time. Be active in your mission here, with a bright and happy heart, giving to all who may need your aid from the harvest to which you have sown, and by faithfully doing your duty you will receive the glorified rest. ' Let diligence be the weapon in the battle against sin and your armor will become brightened as victories crown your life. Canterbury, N. H.
