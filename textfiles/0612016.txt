OUR PROSPECTUS With this issue, Vol. 6 of The Shaker closes. Vol. 7 will begin with an enlarged form, and with a purpose of increased interest and usefulness. Its patrons have decided that it must not rest on laurels won,— that the present is not the time to discontinue efforts put forth for the regeneration of the race. There are multitudes who would seriously miss The Shaker, should it' rest from its labors ;' while with not a few, such discontinuance would prove an unequaled catastrophe. We have large reason to be very grateful to its many friends, for their disinterested efforts in its behalf; and for their words and deeds of cheer to both editor and publisher. We are confident that we will make Vol. 7 even more acceptable than its predecessor. New themes of exceeding interests will be introduced. A department of ' Social Life Sketches ' of the Shakers will be added. The department of Music will be continued with much improvement. A continued notice will appear in every number answering the question: ' WnAT SHALL I DO TO BECOME A SHAKER ? ' We ask for the continued company of our present subscribers; earnestly hoping they will aid us in circulating truth, by assisting in the enlargement of our subscription lists. All may rest assured that no pains will be spared to have every department of The Shaker an advance upon the same of 1876, and that no departure from its main purpose — the illustration of radical, Christian truths — will for a moment be considered.
