Shaker Village, N. H. Lizzie Shaker Village, N. H. Dearly Loved Mother Eunice ;—What could bring more pleasure to one youthful like myself, than to realize the love of a dear good Mother and friend, as I do through the medi um of your epistles, so fragrant with the wisdom and goodness of a long experience in the Christian work. 1 hardly think strange that when I read them to my companions they feel somewhat jealous. Last evening we had an unusually good meeting. The recent anniversary of the birth of our Mother Ann Lee, caused many references to be made of her, and the sacred revelation which makes her children free from the bondage of sin. The following beautiful piece was sung : ¦'I am never forgotten, never forsaken While I trust in my Mother above; She careth for me, and hath set me free, I joy in her unbounded love. 0 Mother ! bright in thy glory 1 see thee, mid halos of light, Crowned in thy victory, bathed in purity, Thy robes are eternally white ' The meeting throughout, breathed the inspiration of a Mother's Angel spirit. My soul enjoyed the season, and I hope my life will be such, that the benefits received in these spiritual seasons may leave its impress upon my character. You will please accept my promise that I will 'never weary climbing,' or striving, until I am just the good girl that I so wish to be. Be so kind as to still love and pray for me. I do so dearly love a good true Mother; why sometimes when I think of it, it seems to me that a Mother is the most beautiful being God ever made. Your Affectionate Daughter in the Lord
