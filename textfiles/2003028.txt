Union Village, Ohio. Feb. 1890. We are cutting and sawing wood, feeding stock and sometimes trying to husk corn and haul fodder, but the mud is so deep that the teams cannot draw more than the empty wagon, most of the time. It will get better after a while. For,ï¿½ 'Ever the right comes uppermost, And ever is justice done.' G. MassieO. C. H.
