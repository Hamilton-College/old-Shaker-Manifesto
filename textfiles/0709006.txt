Physical and Spiritual Harmony ANDREW BARRETT In perusing the well-filled columns four little Messenger, my eyes rested ipon the important article, 'How to ive, and live aright.' Every agitation, or troubling of the waters on this subect, meets my approbation ; and the ame of many more, who are trying to ive out the true manner of life, physially, that in truth we may enjoy the Tuitions of the angel life. If we have found the new life, and are approaching nearer the source of ife, do we not think less of mere husks? ess of the exterior of things and more of the heart of things ? Do we not beieve, more than heretofore, that the hings which are seen are temporal, and he things which are not seen, eternal? If we care for our bodies, is it not that they may become tabernacles other than for sensuous enjoyment? hat they may become the fittest possible instruments for mental culture, moral and spiritual unfoldings? The spirit is the motive power. Its operation upon our physical forms is similar to the steam upon the engine. And how necessary it is to have every part of that engine in proper working order, if there is to be a harmony of movements. But let a cog be broken, or a shaft misplaced, can it perform its office ? So appears to me to be the case with the spirit and body. Can a diseased body have a healthy spirit? Will they work together in harmony ? Can they enjoy the blessings that the Creator has ordained them to enjoy? Is that body fulfilling God's purposes? Then why not make it one of the great aims of life to know how to live ?
