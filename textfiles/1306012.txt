SPIRITUALISM. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. He who rejects modern spiritualism without investigating it, or making a discrimination between the true and the false, may be likened unto a man who rejects gold and cilver coin because some spurious pieces are found among them, or, like unto a man who throws away a field of wheat, because he found some tares growing among the precious grain. How unwise! True spiritualism is something to be sought after. 'Seek and ye shall find.' And when found, it will be the 'pearl of great price.' A key that unlocks the mysteries of the past, inspires the living present and unfolds the brightness of the future. He who believes the Bible to be the infallible word of God just as it is, indorses ancient spiritualism, just as it was, which was no better than modern spiritualism, just as it is, and if the former was true and the Bible originated from it, so is the Eevelation of modern spiritualism equally true, and infallible, and more authentic, because it has never been perverted by translators, and is adapted to the day and age in which we live.
