Lift the gates of heaven... 'Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall come in. Who is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty.' LEWIS MORTON. Lift the gates of heaven, I would enter in, Bearing all life's burdens, Free from taint of sin. Lift the gates of heaven, Angels guide my way; Illume the path I enter, To eternal day. Lift the gates of heaven On the pilgrim's sight; Lead me, guide me, Father, In the way of right. Lift the gates of heaven, Joy and peace are there, Where the soul reposes In His tender care. Bless the King of Glory, The gates are open wide, Everlasting hills sing,â€” Joy on every side. Canterbury, N. H.
