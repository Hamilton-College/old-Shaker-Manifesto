AT SEA. There was a little girl on board Who could'nt stand the constant motion, 'I Wiss, mamma,' she one day said, 'There was some pavements in the ocean.' She watched the heaving billowTs roll, And shook her head and murmured sadly, 'If they'd play still-pond, 'stead of tag, It wouldn't make me feel so badly.' Before her stretched the white-capped waves, Behind, a white-capped nurse-maid followed. 'I'm better now,' she naively said: 'Because, you see, I've justunswallowed.'
