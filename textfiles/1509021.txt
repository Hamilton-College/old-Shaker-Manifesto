THE EASIEST WAY When one gets his hand in a lion's mouth, it is best for him to get it out just as easily as possible. A man who will wrong you, will be likely to abuse you if you resent the wrong. A man who misrepresents you, will slander you all the more if you contradict him; and a man who has damaged you in purse, will damage you in reputation also, if his interests require it. ' In nine cases out of ten the wisest policy is, if a man cheat, stop trading with him; if he is abusive, shun his company; if he slanders you, take care to live so that no one will believe him; no matter who he is, or how he misuses you, the wisest way is to let him alone; for there is nothing better than a cool, calm, quiet way of dealing with the wrong we meet with. ' 'Beware of dogs.' If men persecute you in one city, flee into another. 'If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. ' Selected
