Shakers, N. Y. North Family. Aug. 4, 1895. In reviewing the August Manifesto, and noting the excellency of its contents, knowing that the Brethren and Sisters who contribute to its support give of their THE MANIFESTO. 213 best thoughts, we were reminded of the lines of one of our old hymns, I have thought; the greatest treasure That the universe can sing. There is no material treasure Which can such possessions bring. We may be deprived of the pleasures of the physical senses, but to the being who has advanced in the scale of civilization beyond the boundaries of the barbaric or even the savage stage there is no physical happiness equal to the enjoyment of pure thought. When we read Br. Alonzo's article we exclaimed,Let the gospel fire be renewed in our souls, and let the testimony oi' truth roll through the earth. Only the errors of life feel the keenness of truth's incisive steel. We notice Prof. Edg;\r C. Beali has given us, in the Phrenological Journal for August, a very interesting account o: Swami Vivekananda, a young Hindoo monk who was a delegate to the 'World's Parliament of Religions,' and who is now traveling in this country, as a religious teacher. One of the most favorable signs of the times is that the demon of religious intolerance and bigotry is retiring into the shades of night, whence it emerged in the past, causing so much suffering to the advocates of advanced thought. The unfolding of the truths of the Divine life is not confined to sects or parties; and the different manifestations of it all move harmoniously together. This young Hindoo monk is teaching celibacy, and maintains that for attaining to the highest unfoldment of the spiritual life the perfect and complete renunciation of the emotions and passions of the lower life is imperative. To all such the hand of fellowship is extended of whatever race, color or creed. The weather for July has averaged cool; some times more resembling October than midsummer, but with plenty of rain for the crops, we have no cause to complain, and on the whole the season, up to date, August 4th has been favorable.
