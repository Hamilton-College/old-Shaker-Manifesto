THOUGHTS MARY WHITCHER i-ht, What a fearful thing to know All error is related ! From the look, to word and blow, Murder perpetrated ! What a happy, joyous thought, Good is all connected ! From the smile to goodness ^ Till our life's perfected ! Let us hasten from the wrong, Shut the door 'gainst passion ; Check the feeling, curb the tongue, Live to our profession. Are we poised for good or ill, Each in turn o'erruling? Let us rise to Heaven's will, Highest themes pursuing. If the tempter comes in vain, Finding nothing in us To be tempted, or to claim, He will shortly leave us. We've the germ for either growth, Which if cultivated, Gives us life of highest worth, Or a life perverted. We're allied to angels pure, By the good we cherish ; Or we're slaves forever more To the joys that perish. Canterbury, N. H.
