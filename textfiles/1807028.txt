VALLEY OF HUMILITY. Joseph L. Berne. Oh I will go down into this sacred valley, Of humiliation, of love, and of grace, Where all that is earthly the world and its folly No more will afflict in this valley of peace. O cast away self, and all earthly bubbles, Work out your salvation, O never stand still, This vale of repentance will cure all your troubles, Come drink of its pure living fountains your fill. On love that's celestial your spirits will feed, Around you bright vjrtues like flowers shall grow, My angel of peace will your souls ever lead And fruits to heal sin nowhere else can bestow. Oh let us fall prostrate in this holy valley, Of humiliation, of love, and of peace, Our pride let us stain, let us cast off all folly, Thatthejoys of redemption may ever increase. Little Itoclc, Ark.
