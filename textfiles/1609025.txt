Kind words are the music of the world... [Contributed by Harriet Shepard.] Kind words are the music of the world. They have a power which seems to be beyond natural causes, as if they were some angel's song which had lost its way, and come on earth. It seems as if they could almost do what in reality God alone can do, soften the hard and angry hearts of men. No one was ever corrected by a sarcasm, crushed perhaps, if the sarcasm was clever enough, but drawn nearer to God, never. F. W. Faber. '-
