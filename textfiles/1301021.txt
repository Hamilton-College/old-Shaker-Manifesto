Sept. 24, 1882 Dear Etta;—I am glad you have got all your lessons and I hope that you fully understand them, for remember that unless you fully understand all that you learn, your knowledge will not be of any use. Dear sister there are many good people and we have only seen a few of them. But in order to become like them we have got a great many things to learn and if we are willing to be taught, we may perhaps by fol- lowing their wise counsels grow good like theni. But it will take us a great, great while to gain what they have gained. Those cards were indeed very pretty and we will keep them as a pleasant reminder of the giver. Dear Etta I think you write very well for a little girl eight years old. Dear sister I mean to set out anew this very day and be a better girl than I have ever been before. Will you try with me? With much love I remain as ever, Your affectionate sister, Florrie Foye,—Age, 12
