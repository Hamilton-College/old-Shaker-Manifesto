North Union, Ohio North Union, O. High credit is given of Elder G. B. Avery's public address at this place on Aug. 13. The assemblies on Sunday have very materially increased numerically since. The Shakers met with the 'Men of the Forests,' on 30th August, in Burgess Grove; did several handsome sentiments and sung some delightful songs among others ' Glorious Day.' Mutual Criticism : We incline to a dread of criticism upon our conduct, either from a knowledge of our defects or from a suspicion of others'injustice. That the inclination is, to say the least, an ignoble one, no noble-minded person will dispute. W-herever there is the power of persons or organizations to bear mutual criticism, holding strictly to the rule of ' neither giving nor taking offense,' an exceeding greatness of blessing must derive. Let organizations try it on such principle. Let families try it. Whoever keeps in good temper most strictly is the better Christian; and who does not ' will learn something to his advantage.'
