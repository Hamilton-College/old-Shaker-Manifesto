AGE OF REVELATION AND SEASON. Jason B. Pool. Revelation is given to lead and direct where reason and experience in humanity fail. Hence it becomes necessary to distinguish between true and false revelation. When the Dutch traveler revealed to the King of Siam that at certain seasons of the year the rivers and lakes in Germany became so hard that an elephant could in safety walk over them, the king would not believe in the revelation but banished the traveler from his presence. In this case the king had no means of distinguishing between true and false revelation ; and as frozen water was a condition contrary to his uniform experience, the king rejected the revelation as false. Suppose the king with all his subjects had been suddenly removed to New England in the month of June ; he would still believe that water would always remain a liquid. We will now suppose that it should be revealed to the king or one of his subjects by a spirit that soon the country would be bound in the adamantine chains of the frost king and that it was necessary for the people to prepare for such a state of things by making garments of fur and also they must lay up a good store of provisions for the dearth of Winter. In a natural condition it would be impossible for the people to put any confidence in the revelation and therefore it would be necessary that some state or condition should be brought upoa the people by which they would be forced to believe. I take the impression that whenever God or the spirit world sends a revelation to the people, an inspired feeling is made to rest on the people which causes them to believe. The sa /red Scriptures have been believed in for many centuries and there is some cause for the belief. Now the question arises what is the cause of this belief. The materialists try to make out that the priests have duped the people to believe in the Bible, but a careful investigation of the nature of humanity will convince any reasonable mind that scriptural faith could not have been derived from that source. Men naturally are not prone to believe in the Bible and if they had been left wholly to themselves it would have been out of date long ago. There evidently has been an inspired feeling among the people for ages which has given the impression that the book is an inspired work. The Bible contains much that is incomprehensible to man and consequently some have tried to make out that it is a nonsensical man-made-work and not to be respected. Such become as ' sounding brass and a tinkling symbol.' Others again have endeavored to explain the mysterious parts of the scriptures ; these also as a general thing are as sounding- brass. Leaders of churches who have been makmg deductions outside of inspiration in regard to the Bible are likewise like ' sounding brass and tinkling symbols.' As revelation is founded on reason which is higher than human reason or what human reason has been, there must be an intelligence in the spirit world far greater than what cau be found among mortals. Human reason is of a progressive nature and man has been growing in his powers of comprehension ever since his advent on earth. Perhaps he has arrived at a stage in which he can see quite clearly in regard to spiritual matters but it is not his province to make deductions unless he feels called on to do so. It is an easy matter for many a one to feel competent to make deductions in regard to spiritualism and the Bible, but he is not to be the judge. The case has got to be decided by a superior intelligence. It has been observed that when God has a great work for any one. to do He gives him a peculiar training for that work and that training is what no earthly friend would choose for him, and it is sometimes so long continued that there would seem to be but little time left for work. As all God's works are progressive� commencing small and growing larger� so with respect to the individual who is called to commence the work of making deductions : he will not be much of a demoustrator, he will deal largely in hypothesis and theories but demonstrators will follow in his wake.
