Harvard, Mass. Oct. 4, 1890. Dear Editor ;�October finds us pushing hard at the autumn work. We have finished filling our silo for the second time. Our first ensilage was not entirely fed out before we turnod the cattle out to grass. This yviir vre shall commence the first of Nov. Our onion crop turned out splendidly, very near 100 bushels. We lud almost two acres of* peas and beans which would have been No. 1, had nut the late rains continued so long while curing them. Our yellow field corn is the best we ever raised. Our herb crop which we depend upon to fill the Purse has been good. The herbs are all harvested and dried. This sums up the temporalities. Our Society for the last six weeks has been scourged more or less with the plague. God promised to take sickness away from his people, and by the powerful remedies of God's sunshine and a cheerful spirit guided by a clear conscience we are driving the plague back into Egypt where it is said to have its origin. Elder John Whiteley was greeted with a welcome from his old friends on Tuesday the 2nd inst. He seems to have stood the journey far better than our expectations fancied. Sunday the 31st of August we attended meeting at the south family :�something that had not happened before in Harvard for many years, and truly it was a meeting of heavenly refreshment and good things. Friday the 5th, a company of gospel friends from Alfred, Me., made us a short visit, viz. Br. Henry Green, Strs. Fanny Casey, Mary Ella Douglas and Letta Pinder. They are children of the resurrection order. They bear the fruits gained by a life of selfdenial. When it comes to my lot to be associated with such souls I cannot restrain the prayer that goes out from the deepest recesses of my soul. O that our ranks may again be filled with such examples of God's boundless love and charity. 'Let me wear out in the service. Let me never disgrace one narrow spot of God's beautiful earth by wearing beneath its fresh, growing turf a winding sheet of rust.' A. Barrett.
