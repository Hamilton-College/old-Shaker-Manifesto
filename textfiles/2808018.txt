A Requiem for Sister XIMENA GATES. By Alma J. Shattuck. Farewell, dear Sister, rest in peace, Thy journey here is run, And angels pure have welcomed thee Tp thy eternal home. A faitMul servant thou hast been. Thy labors were well done, And to the mansion thou hast made The angels bid thee come. No monument of honor, fame Will mark thy absence here; Thy purity and sinless life Are virtues which appear. So patiently, our Sister dear Hast waited for the call, That rest, at last, is sweet to thee Which comes to one and all. We feel that joy and peace are thine: No earthly thing doth mar Thy spirit, which has entered now Beyond the gates ajar. And when the summons from that land Shall come to beckon me, Ah may I meet that happy band Which now doth welcome thee. I patiently will watch and pray, Until the close of life Doth bring me nearer to that home Where ceases worldly strife. Farewell, dear Sister, fare thee well Until we meet again, Thy spirit now doth sing at last Sweet restis the refrain. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
