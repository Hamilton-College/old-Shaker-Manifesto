On account of the many articles received, having reference to the life work of our beloved Elder Giles B. Avery, it was thought more appropriate to publish them in a memorial pamphlet. In this number we record the death of our beloved Elder Robert Aitken, of Enfield Ct., whose many virtues are pleasantly presented by Br. Thomas Stroud. A residence in the same family for a long term of years, affords Br. Thomas the privilege of expressing his mind with full freedom on the subject.
