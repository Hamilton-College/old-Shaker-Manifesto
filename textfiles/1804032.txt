A REMEDY FOR SLANDER. J. W. asks for a remedy for slander, I take pleasure in sending one which I believe to be nearly, if not quite, infallible. Take equal parts of moral purity arid love of truth, and steep with them a large bunch of the savory herb commonly known as mindyour-own-business. When sufficiently steeped sweeten well with Christian charity. Flavor, if you choose, with a pleasant and harmless subject of thought. One residing in an infected district should take the mixture inwardly each 'day as a preventive; and if when in company with one afflicted with the disease, you will also apply it carefully and thoroughly to the lips, all danger of contagion will be avoided.ï¿½\_S.
