MY HOME. 'Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth.'Psa. xxvi., 8. Canterbury, N. H. 1891. Bright Elysian fields of truth! Gardens of God's gifts divine! Fountains of his boundless love! Here's my home forever. Sacred home! all other climes Pale before thy wondrous light. These will change as works of time, Thou wilt fail me never.
