War BY DANIEL ORCUTT Those who defend war, must also defend the dispositions which lead to war. Now those dispositions are absolutely forbidden by the Gospel. Our Saviour said, 'put up thy sword,' and ever since that time true Christians must not, cannot go to war. The safety of a nation is not to be found in arms; and morality and true religion forbid war, both in its motives, and consequences. 'From whence came wars and fie-htinss among you ? ' asks the Apostle; ' Come they not hence even of your lusts, that war in your members ? ' If these warlike passions were effectually subdued, all wars would cease. Those who are governed by these passions, are blind to their own interest; they are blind to their own best good, both for time and eternity. ' Wisdom is better than weapons of war.' Eccl. ix, 18. Warlike passions are hard masters; and they should be subdued betimes and thoroughly. Otherwise their power will increase over that of reason, and will in the end lead to ruin. A.t the advent of our Saviour was published the glad tidings of ' Peace on earth, good will towards man; ' and Peace was his last gift to his disciples. ' Peace I leave with you, mj Peace I give unto you.' 'Blessed are the peacemakers.' Christ is the Prince of Peace, and his kingdom is one of Peace. But war belongs to the Prince of this world. War is contrary to all Christianity; but wars will continue, as long as that policy is maintained, which is calculated to promote a warlike spirit. The power to overcome warlike passions is found in the Gospel. It imparts a peaceful, holy influence, which enables those who submit to it to conquer their passions, and even to love their enemies, and thus to conquer them. Many have conquered kingdoms who could not conquer themselves, and manjr crowns have been given to conquerors of ancient and modern times; but God himself has prepared a crown for all the self-conquered, bearing this inscription : ' He that overcometh shall inherit all things.'
