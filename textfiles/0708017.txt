WHAT SHALL I DO TO BE A SHAKER? ANSWERED BY BRO. THOMAS SMITH Mt. Lebanon, July 3, 1877. Esteemed Friend John B. Bishop.-. Your favor of the 1st inst. is at hand, and reply to your questions in the order they are presented. 1 st. Shakerism offers no inducements to the average man or woman; but to those whom the 'Father' hath drawn hither, it offers peace, joy and rest, coupled with the active duties of life. 2d. If yourself and companion, etc., are happily satisfied with surroundings, let Shakerism alone. If looking for something broader, more unselfish, more permanent, Shakerism will yield it, after much toil and labor; as it gives you a close relation to many brethren and sisters, whose interest and care, love and affection, are centered upon and cjrawn out by those things which tend to universal peace. 3d. It depends upon what you consider degrading. Physical labor in contact with the earth is a requisite in this case. I know of no exalted offices in the institution. 4th. Practically, yea; comparatively, nay. The members of each Shaker family fare and share alike, as per first answer; different families in Shaker communities may have local differences in these respects as per second answer. 5th. All eat at one common table, dress similarly, and feel interested in hand labor according as they are more or less unselfish. 6th. Lords and ladies form no component part of Shakerism; but strict obedience to constituted authority, for order's sake, is required. 7th. Shakerism is a better religion than is found outside of it; but it would take some time for me to ascertain whether it would supply your demands. 8th. You need have no scruples as to the Covenant being faithfully carried out toward you; our main trouble commonly proceeds from the opposite direction. 9th. Yourself and companion must come to a mutual agreement am the subject. All just debts and obligations must be fulfilled. LTpon entering the order, each heart must open the book of life to the order's representative ; in other words, confess all its sins. 10th. Frankly, I am sorry you have been a minister so long, because of the tenacity with which this class adheres to dead issues. But no answer of mine would be equal to your mingling with this people, and seeing for yourself. Do not change your opinions until you are satisfied. nth. lam aware that many seem ripening up for the harvest, but no covenant, creed or promise will cover the case. Human nature, is the same to-day as in the past; and only as the fire of Pentecost touches the human heart, will it forget its selfhood, and break its bread from door to door. 'Can we have these?' Are j'ou numerous? If so, select some of j'our best; let them come and investigate rigidly, and report as they comprehend the case. 12th. Wherever you are the best acquainted and are the most attracted. Finalljr, I write you, not as by authority, but from the basis of my own experience and belief. I am yours for the investigation of truth, Thos. Smith
