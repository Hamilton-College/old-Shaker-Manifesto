Watervliet, N. Y. It is some time since we have written any Notes. We took the gentle hint in the Manifesto to do better. The summer is past, but the harvest is not ended. While hay and grain are secured, fruit and vegetables are not. Hay, fair crop. Oats very good. Eye fair. Beans rusted badly, consequently few cans filled. We are busy canning pears, plums and tomatoes, also drying corn. Fruit is plenty except peaches in our locality, of the latter we have enough to make us comfortable. Have had considerable wet weather, which has hindered work, but we keep moving as there is always plenty to do. We have had good, refreshing meetings, and if the spiritual atmosphere has not been cleared it is not for the lack of gospel testimony,�delivered not in a cooing, lullaby style, but in trumpet tones, that wakens into life the true-hearted Believer, if it does not effectually arouse the slumbering, or more properly the dead soul into newness of life. Our motto is, Fear not�'Cry aloud spare not,' neither the wrongs in ourselves nor others. We have also had beautiful ministering spirits in our midst the past season. Not only the loved ones who have gone before, but the loved ones still living with us in earth-life. Beloved Eldress Joanna Kaime, whose beautiful influence is with us yet, and her precious words will long be remembered. All the good Sisters from Enfield N. H. each one of whom we remember, and shall always feel drawn nearer to them for their beautiful testimony and life. Nor must we forget our dear Sister Amelia Calver and the two Sisters with her; also Br. Watson Andrews who seemed to possess the life and power of the gospel in his soul. We have heard rumors of an accident that befell him, but trust it is not as serious as reported. Health of Society good with few exceptions.
