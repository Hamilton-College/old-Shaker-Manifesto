HE DOETH ALL THINGS WELL. Maude Wentworth. FOR THE MANIFESTO.God sent his own beloved Son, Upon this earth to dwell; To calm all sorrows, heal all wounds : He doeth all things well. Upon the cross his life was spent, For sinful mortals here ; In ignorance we knew not then : He doeth all things well. Upon this wicked earth, he left, His chosen few to tell; Of sure redemption, bounteous grace : He doeth all things well. Weep not fond Mother, At the death-bed of thy hopes ; God hath but taken his own again : He doeth all things well. He'll calm your sorrows, heal all wounds, His love to you will tell; Accept the grace he freely gives ; He doeth all things well. Ye wicked sinners, here on earth List, to the sad death knell; You'll suffer e'en as they who mourn : He doeth all things well. And as the floods swept o'er the earth, And vengeance on sinners fell; He'll cleanse with fire this wicked world : He doeth all things well. He'll take the good, the chosen few, With him on high to dwell; God help the sinner, on that day, He doeth all things well.
