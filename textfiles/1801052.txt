Of all the interesting subjects which men and women study there is none more interesting or important than the studying of the characters of each other; therefore, if you want something to read that will interest you more thoroughly than any book you ever read, send for a copy of Heads and Faces. It will show you how to read people as you would a book, and to see if they are inclined to be good, upright, honest, true, kind, charitable, loving, joyous, happy and trustworthy people, such as you would like to know; or are they by nature untrustworthy, treacherous and cruel, uncharitable and hardhearted, faultfinding, jealous, domineering people whom you would not want to have intimate with yourselves or your families ? A knowledge of Human Nature as taught in this book would save many disappointments in social and business life. It is sent by mail, postpaid, on receipt of price, as above.
