KIND WORDS. Dear Sisters:--I was much pleased... Sabbathbay Lake, Me. Nov. 1895. Dear Sisters:I was much pleased with those two lovely pictures of Sister L. A. S. that you so kindly sent in my little package of Manifestos. If you should reprint the 'History of the Shakers' I would like to be informed. I have but very few of the books left and shall soon send for more. Accept many thanks for your interest in the Missionary labors which are appreciated by every true and devoted soul in our Zion home, and also by the angels in heaven. Your Sister, Aurelia G. Mace.
