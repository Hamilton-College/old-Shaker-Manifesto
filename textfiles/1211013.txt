WISDOM SARAH A. COLLINS Few and sweet are the words which the lips of wisdom utter.' How true and how full of meaning is this thought of the poet. All would do well to bear this in mind, and especially in the presence of children. Then, more than at any other time, our words should be choice and sweet; as children are so susceptible of influences, that they accept and retain that which may dwell with them through a long life. We are often led to regret the temptations that are open to their views, and to find that their immature minds are so wide awake to see and hear all that is passing. It would give us great pleasure to have our children grow up in paths of wisdom, in that innocence which harmonizes with their age and experience, which will afford them a foundation, upon which to build an honorable and a spiritual manhood and womanhood. Great care should be exercised lest we awaken their minds to unprofitable matter, by carelessly repeating before them that which they should never know. Rather let us study the preservation of their innocence, that their youthful days may be as bright and beautiful as the month of June, and by this means avoid the experience of the preacher, 'lest the evil days come and the years draw nigh when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.'
