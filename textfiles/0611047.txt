EVERGREEN SHORES Notice is given, with some very affectionate comments indeed, of some of the dear, departed aged. Among the very bright stars that have set in this world, to rise on the ' evergreen shores ' of ' the better land,' few have surpassed in virtue and value, some we mention in this issue. To say that we love them—their life and Christ-like demeanor—but faintly impresses the general reader. Did we not, as gospel relation — having no bloodties to speak of — have_ such immovable faith in fact of their removal to brighter, happier spheres, we should very much mourn their departure. Our farewells are kind, yet they are realized by the pure in heart beyond our expression.
