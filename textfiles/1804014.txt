Kind friends:--Just received three last issues of Manifesto... San Francisco, Jan. 14, 1888. Kind Friends :ï¿½Just received three last issues of Manifesto. Thanks to sender. The letter from Louis B. iu Nov. No. fairly made my heart jump with delight. I felt like extending my hand across the Continent with a hearty grasp. Well done etc. The right and truthful spirit is there. Would ;-7ou could spare a score of fully matured souls to carry the light over to this coast. Nowhere in the world is there a people with such few bigoted isms as here. The gospel was established in the east while general society was yet in a formative state and the majority of men wore broad brimmed white felt hats as they do here now. We are in that formative state here, only people are more enlightened and ready to receive anything that promises progress and a higher better way of living than they were then. -No prejudices here except against iguorance and dogmatic religious cant. O for more such faithful souls as I can mention, tc form a nucleus and a seed that would promise a growth like the giant trees we have here. It is yet time to light other candles from a flickering one. Success here would more than doubly ensure your revival in the east. It would repopulate your partially neglected lands with the best, and the universal cry of 'They're dying out'twould disappear like a puff of smoke in the evening air. Since I have been here I have answered numerous queries about the Shakers and have chased away many a cobweb of misunderstandiug. Fully one half of the population is celibate from choice and as population nearly doubles every generation, their numbers must necessarily increase. They are mostly under the impression that the Shakers are a trembling, paralytic, semiidiotic helpless old people, Free lovers or a kind of Mormons. I would think the full title 'Shakers of evil' (angelic social) or some title in one or two words that would express the real soul of their battles would drive away these false impressions. The word 'Believers' covers all mankind and has no specific meaning. In my wanderings over the world, In my moments of greatest unrest. By the sorrows of being depressed, I still yearn for the purest and best. With the flag'of my freedom unfurled. Or with peace of the mind I am blessed, If the wealth of the earth I possessed, I would yearn for the sweetest and best. From my spirit all evil I've hurled, And I've set all my passions at rest; And of all the beliefs I've addressed The angelic and social is best. I expect to meet all the friends I have made, in the east again if not here at least in another higher sphere where there will not be quite so much evil to contend against both in ourselves and others, I am Your friend and brother, Leopold Homan.
