Brethren and Sisters of the Highest Life... Sabbathday Lake, Me., Feb. 1893. Brethren and Sisters of the Highest Life : ï¿½From victory to victory, in the path of purity you have walked from youthful days until the present time, and now, as said the beloved Apostle so can you say, 'We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.' Elder Giles B. A very once said, 'Zion is the working hands of God in the world.' It then becomes the duty of Believers to 'sow light till the world is aglow.' If we fail to do this, others may arise to take our birth-right, and it is now evident that light is greatly needed to shine abroad over the earth. Whenever we come in contact with those outside, we find that we are very imperfectly known unto them. The questions which meet us at every turn, are like these; ' 'What is your religious belief?' 'What is the difference between you and the Quakers?' 'Have you books that will inform us of your history and manner of life ?' To be sure, we tell tnem, we have books, large and small, and we have let them have a great many, written by those of long travel and deep theological study and experience. Thousands will yet arise to call our good father Elder F. W. Evans blessed for the labors from his brain and pen, and also others who have toiled in the same field. But 'Variety is the spice of life,' which gives it all its flavor and one outside of our homes has written an interesting series of articles, in a very friendly spirit, giving the history of the Order from its commencement, of the organization of the Societies, and the foundation principles by which they are governed; also biographical sketches, and pleasing reminiscences, together with illustrations of nearly all our villages and some of our leading members. These articles have appeared, during the last two years, in the Manufacturer and Builder, a magazine published in New York City. The work has been revised and very kindly given to us, with the use of the plates for the illustrations, by the waiter of the series, our good friend Charles Edson Robinson, who, it seems has made the lives of God's people a study, and is, himself, not far from the kingdom. At a sacrifice of time and labor, the work is now being printed and put into pamphlet form, by our beloved Elder Henry C. Blinn, Editor of the Manifesto. His reward is with him, to give unto the people 60 THE MANIFESTO. according as their subscriptions to the pamphlets have been. In our correspondence with our Brethren and Sisters of the different Societies in regard to the work, the kind spirit in which we have been answered has filled our hearts with thankfulness. We are particularly grateful for the approval and help of the Elders of the North Family, Mt. Lebanon. It is our hope and trust that in the future, new editions of, and additions to this work may be made, until 'the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth, as the waters cover the sea.' Those of our Societies who, from adverse circumstances, which they could not control, found it impossible to render that aid to the enterprise, which they otherwise would gladly have done, will want some of these books for distribution in a future day, when the tide of adversity rolls back, and prosperity's waves roll on. 'For the Angels are coming down from heaven, To bless the people anew, They are coming with rich and beautiful gifts For every one of you.' Aurelia G. Mace.
