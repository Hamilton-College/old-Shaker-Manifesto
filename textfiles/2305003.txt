REMEMBRANCE. Julia Russell. 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves breakthrough and steal.' Matt., vi, 19. The things which perish not With the using, I crave, A substance enduring, A power that will save. Take from me earthly idols, With all their pomp and show And lead me in the valley, Where healing waters flow. An echo from the above sweet refrain through the mediumship of our loved Sister Asenath now gone on to spirit realms, where a fuller realization of her soul's desires may be met, even now is wafted to our inner consciousness, meeting a response; that of a truth nothing is worthy to cherish save the immortal treasures gained through a perfect surrender of all earthly interests, and while we toil to make these our portion we invoke the continued aid of our spirit friends whose benign influence sheds light and hope in hours of burden and trial.
