RESURRECTION. BY REV. S. D. ROBBINS. We hail the rising Christ! not as of old When from the sepulchre the stone was rolled, Not as the dead recalled to earth again To make his promised resurrection plain, lie rises now from cerements of creeds, Whose service is not rituals, but deeds; Whose litany was love, who came to teach The soul through truth eternal life to reach ; Whose God was not a tyrant moved by prayer, But goodness, immanent and everywhere; Whose heaven is not some unseen distant sphere Of future bliss, but present now and here. He rises daily : as the morning beams, llis light upon the world in beauty streams : As flow the spring tides in on every shore, lie rises on the nations evermore. As the fresh blades and tender, fragrant flowers Weleome the advent of the vernal showers, llis truth is quickened in the hearts of men, And in their lives he lives and loves again. So one by one the evils of the earth Are fa.ling: with his resurrection's birth, The blind receive their sight; and from their prison The erring are released; the dead are risen!'
