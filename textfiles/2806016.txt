MY HOME. By William Bird Take me home to the place Where I first saw the light, To my dear Shaker friends take me home, Where they sing with delight, And praise God, day and night, To my loved Shaker friends take me home. In that good Shaker Home Where they learn to serve the Lord, Where they do his holy will And praise in one accord. Here they live as SisterBrother And serve the Lord together Rejoicing in his work all the day. East Canterbury, N. H.
