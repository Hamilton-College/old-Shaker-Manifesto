THE SKEIN WE WIND. GEORGE KLINGLE. If you and I, to-day Should stop and lay Our life-work down, and let our hands fall where they will— Pall down to lie quite still— And if some other hand should come, and stoop to find The threads we carried, so that it could wind, Beginning where we stopped; if it should come to keep Our life-work going; seek To carry on the good design Distinctively made yours, or mine, What would we find ? Some work we must be doing, true or false; Some threads we wind; some purpose so exalts Itself that we look up to it, or down, As to a crown To bow before, and we weave threads Of different lengths and thickness—some mere shreds— And wind them round Till all the skein of life is bound, Sometimes forgetting at the task To ask The value of the threads, or choose Strong stuff to use. No hand but winds some thread; It cannot stand quite still till it is dead, But what it spins and winds a little skein God made each hand for work—not toil stain Is required, but every hand Spins, though but ropes of sand. If Love should come, Stooping above when we are done, To find bright threads That we have held, that it may spin them longer—find but shreds That break when touched, how cold, Sad, shivering, portionless, the hands will hold The broken strands and know Fresh cause for woe.
