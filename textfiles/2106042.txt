WOMEN AS PHYSICIANS. During twenty-three years of association with, women students and practitioners, writes Dr. Phoebe J. B. Wait, in The Ladies'' Home Journal, I have known of but few failures. On the contrary, I know of many who have achieved fortunes, and who are enjoying a lucrative practice. Prejudice? Yes, there is prejudice against them. But it is the same prejudice that does not allow women to have political suffrage; the same that objects to women being anything but housekeepers or butterflies. There is no foundation for it whatever, and it will pass away in time. I h'nd that foreigners, Germans especially, who have been accustomed to niidwives in their own country, take most kindly to female practitioners. It is the American people that stick to the old exploded theory of woman's inability to own and manage property, to buy and sell, or to follow a learned profession. During the last quarter-century thirty-eight medical colleges have been opened to women, and seven others', are exclusively for women. In the West they are more liberal than in the East. There are to-day upwards of three thousand women practitioners, where, twenty-five years ago there were but a score! It is argued that women dislike the sight of blood. Of course they do. So do men. When I commenced the study of medicine I was fully convinced that women would not make good surgeons. But a long experience has reversed that conviction. Many of them undoubtedly possess the nerve to perform any surgical operation. They do their work in a masterly manner, and without flinching. The theory that woman's nervous temperament and sympathetic nature militates against her in this connection, is absolutely false.
