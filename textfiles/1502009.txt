BELIEF. F. W. EVANS. Aftkk the crucifixion of Jesus, lie came to his bereaved disciples in a temporized body that they could see and touch, through which he reproved and instructed them. He said to them, bl Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that belicYeth shall be saved, he that believetli not shall be damned. Was that a threat, or a statement? .Some who disbelieved at one time, subsequently believed. They are not saved as a reward for believing, but they are saved by believing, because belief leads them to deny themselves of every evil indulgence. That is salvation. '' Jesus was risen early the first day �of the week, and he appeared unto Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils. ' When she told those who had been with him, they believed not. Then he appeared in another form to two of the disciples as they walked into the country. These told it to the rest. Neither did they believe. Afterward he appeared unto the eleven disciples when they were all together at meat, partaking of the Sacrament, and Jesus upbraided them for their unbelief and lmrdness of heart. Then all of them believed. They believed they had seen a dead man who was arisen from the dead, come to life again, as did Lazarus and the widow's son. De was the first begotten from the dead, had broken the chains of death. In a word, the physical resurrection was the first established Christian dogma, aud that dogma was not scientifically true, yet a vast amount of good Avas done with it. lie appeared. What appeared; The identical body that had been removed from the sepulchre? Could that � assume different forms? Or did Moses, Elias, Jesus, perform what in 1885 is becoming common for disembodied spirits to do, to wit, create a temporary body that all persons present can see and handle�-%a body that could eat, drink and talk with logical power and rational understanding? The laws, under which, and the modus operand), by which this appearing was effected, were not then mown and understood as at this present time. Belief was an act of faith in, and obedience to authority, rather than of facts and demonstration. Now Spiritualism is being reorganized and treated as a science, as Geology and Chemistrj are treated. The secular scientific world attach to it nothing sacred or religious. And the theological religiou.s world either deny it as a fact and denounce it as a fraud, or admitting undeniable phenomena, outside of the possibilities of their encyclopedia of sciences, they ascribe it to Satan and his invisible but powerful hosts. In the end each party will learn to respect the other. The scientific will become religious and the theologians will become religiously scientific. They will come together. Then the scientific law will be put into their minds, be intellectually understood, and the religious law, of love, will be written in their hearts. Religion and science will unite as one. Rational understanding and religious spiritual faith, that lays firm hold of the invisible world of intelligent beings, will unite to constitute a practical life motor. Then it will be evident to all that some things can be done as well as others, and that the millions of spirits who have hitherto walked the earth, unseen in Christendom�Babylon�and who have been regarded as phantom Ghosts, or as Angels, making visits very few and centuries between, can now make themselves appear in bodily form, to talk and act like other people ; as really as did Moses, Elias and Jesus. Not ouly do they appear to souls hungry for scientific knowledge of any kind, either mundane or spiritual, but also to those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, making the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, that arc in the Christ Spirit, subservient t� the one thing needful�to wit, that they sin not against their own mortal bodies�the Temples of the Holy Spirit,�nor yet against their own immortal God endowed souls.
