Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1899. The past few weeks we have battled with humanity's enemy, La Grippe, who crept in among us and placed his debilitating power upon many of our folks. At date of writing, Feb. 8th, La Grippe has less weight and ve are seeking his speedy banishment. On Jan. 80th, the bell of Immortality pealed forth its notes of 'Come up Higher' for our loved Sister Zelinda Smith, who for many years honored our North family with Christ]y culture and faithful work. In her life we have an example of nobility safe to imitate. On the following day, our valued Brother Thomas Steadman, responded to the higher summons. Sixty years of noble consecration to our cause, forms his priceless diadem. As overseer of our large barn and stock, he ranked the best. In that realm where man is judged, not by scholarship, position or profession, but by his life acts, Brother Thomas will reap a rich reward. Two more vacant places. Upon the horizon of coming events, we perceive the on-coming messenger for others who must soon pass beyond Eternity's curtain that obscures from our sight the 'Land of Souls.' Even death has its message to us not only hope for better things, but also as old laws and materiality pass away work for the readjustment of society's conditions to the new changes less individual strength createth. 44 THE MANIFESTO. If we as a class are to keep our Godgiven estate free from the monopolizing greed of the world, and are to pass on God-ward, we must work as the heart of one for the good oi all. Waste no time soaring in the heaven of sentimentalism, predicting evil and debating upon non-essentials, to the neglect of the spiritual and industrial parts of our body politic. Let us train ourselves to greater endurance in fulfilling the responsibilities which the honor of our Church demands. George II. Baxter.
