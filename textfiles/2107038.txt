Beloved Elder Henry:--I owe much to the Manifesto... Enfield, Conn., April 10, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½I owe much to the Manifesto for the benefit I have received by reading it. It is to me spiritual food. Its fearless yet charitable spirit in condemning wrong, and its unqualified appreciation of the right, teaches me to distinguish between right and wrong likewise. From a desire to see mankind disciplined in Christ's gospel so pure and redeeming, I say the Manifesto should be in every home. Its healthy moral and spiritual tone, its able articles, its valuable editorials, its wholesome, virtuous teachings would act as a safe-guard from the poison that is now circulated so widely in the shape of light, trashy literature. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
