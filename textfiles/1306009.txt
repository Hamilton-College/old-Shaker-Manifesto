TO AN ERRING ONE. OLIVE F. CHANDLER. Dearest youth, why dostthou wander, Far away from friends and home; Wilt thou sever ties so tender, And away in deserts roam? On the sea of life there's danger. Pause, dear pilgrim, as you move ; Trust in truth, her ways are grander And she's ever near to soothe. Heed thou not the Syren tempter, Let her charms ne'er touch thy heart; Nor refrains from this vile songster, Cause thee from the truth to part. Virtue's charms are e'er enduring She will ever cheer thee on; These, dear youth, are worth securing Gather these, while in life's morn. Does the tempest round thee thicken, Threat'ning clouds their shadows cast. Every earthly love seem stricken, Chilling winds, thy -hopes to blast. Turn to Jesus, he has power, He will hush the troubled sea; Trust him in the darkest hour, And his love shall make thee free. Harvard, Mass
