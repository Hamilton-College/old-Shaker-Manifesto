JEALOUSY! WHENCE COMEST THOU? Abigail Crosman. Cruel tyrant! basest fiend that roams at large In every clime! What was thy origin? Whence the germ, could gender every ill! Uncovered be! Speak! speak from the source, However low, that some strong power Divinely used May smite thee dead! Destroy thy haunts! Thy wand destructive! blight to vital life, Strikes hardest where superior will resolves To rise in virtue's cause! Maker of mischief! Miscreant vile! Coward! Too base to face the foe, Bather in ambush wound with scandal's dart! E'en shame no covert can bestow or honor claim From thy intrigue! and why the wise with science Rife, the monarch's power, the peasant's life, Stoop to thy shrine? To ope anew the martyr's grave And close a peaceful home! Haste! haste thee! Flee! truth will disclose thy fell design! Thy wily walks the wise disdain! vain hollow show! Thy thin veneer of seeming worth, assuming garb of Sordid pelf, despised with all thy arts! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
