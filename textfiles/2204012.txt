LITTLE THINGS OF LIFE. [Contributed by Amelia Tait.] Little words, not eloquent speeches or sermons; little deeds, not miracles, nor one great act, nor mighty martyrdom make up the true Christian life. The little constant sunbeam, not the lightening; the waters of Siloam, 'that go softly'' on their meek mission of refreshment, not ^'the waters of rivers, great and mighty, rushing down in torrent noise and force, are the true symbols of a holy life.' The avoidance of little evils, little sins, little inconsistencies, little weaknesses, little follies, little indiscretions and impudences, little foibles, little acts of indolence or indecision, or slovenliness or cowardice, little equivocations or abberrations from high integrity, little bits of worldliness and gayety, little indifferences to the feelings or wishes of others, little outbreaks of temper and crossness, or selfishness or vanity; the avoidance of such little things as these go far to make up at least the negative beauty of life. And then attention to the little duties of the day and hour, in public transactions, to private dealings, or family arrangements, to the little words and tones, little benevolences or forbearances, or tendernesses, little self-denials, self-restraints, and thoughtfulness, little plans of quiet kindness and thoughtful consideration for others; punctuality and method, and true aim in the ordering of each daythese are the active developments of holy life, the rich and divine mosaics of which it is composed. What makes yon green hill so beautiful? Not the outstanding peak or stately elm, but the bright sward which clothes its slopes, composed of innumerable blades of grass. It is of small things that a great life is made up.
