In Memory of ELDRESS LYDIA ANNAS. By Elder Isaac Anstatt. Jj and anon, we are called to part with our loved ones. Death, the 1 'J great Harvester, is no respecter of persons, nor of loving hearts and even tho we know that Death must come to us all, expecting and knowing this, might reasonably lessen our grief, yet when called to part with those who by their faithfulness have won love and affection, our loss is nevertheless hard to bear. No one was more sincerely mourned by those who knew her best, than was our precious Sister and Mother, Eldress Lydia. Not alone in her own home, but by all who knew her. She had lived a Shaker life for seventy-five years and had filled all positions of trust and care with that evenness of hand, and kindness of nature, that motherly feeling, all could realize that came in contact with her that she was a practical Christian. To those under her care, she was the wise counselor, the kind mother and the loving friend. She was ever ready to extend sympathy and relief to those who needed it and by loving words and kindly acts proved that her interest in all was sincere. As one writer in an obituary in one of our local papers exprest it; ' 'Eldress Lydia Annas was a remarkable woman.' Possest of a cheerful, loving disposition by nature, by living the Christ life she became more so in her advanced age. Altho she had reacht the ripe old age of fourcore years, she maintained that youthful, cheerful spirit to the close of life. Perhaps it was the selfishness of our human hearts that made us unwilling that her precious form should be taken from us and laid in the cold grave hidden from our mortal vision and made us unwilling to give her to the loved ones waiting for her on the other side, and perhaps this same spirit for our beloved Mother makes us still reluctant to say, 'Thy will O God, not ours be done.' May her Christian life example ever be a light, a guiding star to lead us to the home she has made and gained in heaven. We know she will meet friends who will welcome her with those sweet words,ï¿½'Well done thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' May her mantle rest upon us, is our prayer. Shakers, N. Y.
