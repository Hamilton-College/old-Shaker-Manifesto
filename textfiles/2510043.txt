Dear Children:--'Out of the abundance of the heart... Shaker Station, Conn. Dear Children:'Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,' and, 'As a man thinketh in his heart so is he.' To be able to speak true and noble words, you must think the thoughts and live the life of which virtue and truth form the basis. To make your words pure and true your heart must be pure and true. If you think good thoughts words expressive of those thoughts naturally flow from your lips. If you sow impure thoughts you will reap sorrow and grief. Thoughts produce actions. The more you strive for virtue the better. Purity of thought is the best safeguard against impurity of action. Guard your soul from every snare, that leads to ruin. Sinful pleasure brings no rest. Be true, beautiful in character, faithful in duty, careful not to deviate from the path of virtue. Watch in little things. Often it is the little faults, little carelessness in conduct, little blemishes in character, the 'no harms' that bring trouble and woe. The little things tell on the endless life beyond. Think of that. It is the attention to details that insures success in the self-denying work. What an infinitude of details there are, and how much depends on these little things. It is the little moments well improved, the little deeds well done, the little crosses faithfully borne, that make up the sum of a holy life. Daniel Orcutt.
