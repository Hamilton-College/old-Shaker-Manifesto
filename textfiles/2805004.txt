A Tribute to Sister FRANCES GILLEPIE. By Marion Johnson. There is no death to the true Christian, His sun goes down to rise upon a fairer shore, Bright in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father He lives, where earthly sorrows come no more. There is no death to the true Christian, What we call death is but the dawn of life, Immortal life, in bliss expanding ever, Beyond these scenes of conflict, toil and strife. There is no death to the true Christian, He only passes from our mortal sight; Love's golden chain, death has no power to sever When called lrom earth, to dwell in endless light. THE MANIFESTO. There is no death to the true Christian, Our Sister has been calLd to draw aside The veil which hides from us the bright forever, And pass within, safe to the other side. Enst Canterbury, N. H.
