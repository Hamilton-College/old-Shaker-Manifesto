Popular monthly Frank Leslie's Popular monthly for August is a brilliant midsummer number. It is a beautifully and elaborately illustrated work of some 130 large, quarto pages. The extended Index includes not less than thirty four interesting articles and on such a varied list of subjects that every one, young or old, will be amply compensated for obtaining the number. Even those who do not care to read all that is published, will find a fund of information and a great deal of pleasure in studying the beautiful illustrations. Frank Leslie's Pub.
