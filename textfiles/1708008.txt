Beloved elder Henry: I enclose another letter... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., July, 1887. Beloved Elder Henry :- -I enclose another letter received from over the waters. We have also received letters from Manchester and London, all of which go to show that there is a state of preparation for the establishment of our order in England and Scotland. I should like to see the Shaker Order started in England and Scotland on a strictly vegetarian basis; the people over there are ready for it, and without hired help. The hireling system in a community is antagonistic to the growth of Christian Brotherhood ; hence destructive of our Christian Community. It seems to me so rational that a people living a spiritual, angelic life in thought and imagination, should have a diet that corresponds with their soul food, and a business that is in harmony with the angelic life of the gospel we are called to live. Everything about the slaughtering of animals is repulsive to the finer feelings of the soul, and a fruitful source of disease to our mortal bodies, which should be full of health without a mark of Egypt upon them. Then should we truly honor and glorify God in our bodies. We are called to look to Jesus, as the captain and pattern of our salvation. Was he ever sick? He gave his disciples instructions to heal the sick. This power over physical infirmity, belongs to the gospel of Christ and must be in our possession before we shall be perfect in the divine life. The July MANIFESTO is good, came all right, but rather late which we attributed to your waiting the printing of the letter from Glasgow. Hope the enclosed will be in time for the August number. In kindest love, Daniel Offord.
