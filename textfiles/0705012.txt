Enfield, N. H., March, 1877 My gospel daughter, Alice : I assure you your kind, neatly-written letter was not only acceptable, but fondly appreciated. It seems you have been reading the good book; many excellent and saving truths are hidden there. It pleases me that j'ou search for them. If you persistently and confidently seek truth, you will find it to your salvation. It is a resurrecting, saving power; it contributes both peace and love, and ministers to our wants of every gospel grace. Dear child, in your character make this principle conspicuous. Be open to conviction, and truth will abundantly flow in, and the treasures of heaven will be your inheritance. You mention regrets that you had not been earlier called and gathered into the Shaker church. When the door was opened for your admission, you stepped in; that was your time,—the right time; it could never have been better. It was so in my case. It is equally true with all who hearken and obey when the call of God reaches them. Your ears are blest; do not close them; continue to hear, and be as faithful to obey; and your cup of blessing will be full. No advantage will ever avail any soul who is found in opposition to the laws of God, or to the plan of salvation as revealed to the lost family of Adam. When we mur 36 THE SHAKER. mur, or complain of the cross, we act as the adversaries of heaven. We should realize that the order of heaven is divine. It is too often the case that those who feel the testimony of the cross bearing against their carnal lives are found speaking ill of divine order and throwing obstacles in the way, thus preventing the beaming of light, obedience to faith, and submission to the dictates of. conscience. Every soul should make this a point,—never stifle emotion, never allow an .influence whose tendency would cause another to act contrary to religious convictions. These are basic principles of success in life. By the'k'ts of another, no one can be justified nor condemned. Remember, the voice of God has reached your soul; you have heard it. It now remains with you to make your election sure. And now, dear child, accept my thanks for your interesting report to me of meetings, companions, etc.; remembering me in kindest love to them, to vour elders, and to all my friends; and accept for yourself my love and prayers forever. Yours truly, Abraham Perkins
