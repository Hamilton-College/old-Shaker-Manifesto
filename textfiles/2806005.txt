A FRIENDLY WARNING By Virgie Breedlove. EVEN tho there should exist in every Community, one or more of that . very unpleasant class known as mischief-makers, our duty to Society becomes more imperative, as we walk among them to see that we are not brought under the same influence. As we would avoid a scorpion through fear of its deadly poison, so we would avoid the influence of an habitual mischief-maker, who destroys the happiness of Society Some have compared these unpleasant busybodies, to the 'Stormy Petrels' of the ocean, as their presence is quite certain of a forth-coming storm. But while the little bird is innocent of doing any harm, the man or woman who engenders strife by exaggeration, or by false representations is a sad affliction to any society. By some eminent minds this is clast as a disease, and sanitary means should be used to bring about the return of a better state. Sometimes their very presence is an indication of trouble. Their word is not reliable, they twist and contort the simplest remark, till it becomes entirely changed. Sometimes these persons are known to misrepresent even their best friends, and in this way not only injure others, but bring great harm upon themselves. Truly 'the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison,' especially if it becomes the medium of the social mischief-maker. South Union, Ky.
