To ascertain the weight of live cattle To Ascertain the weight of Live Cattle. Take a string, put it around the breast, stand square, just behind the shoulder blade; measure on a foot rule the feet and inches the animal is in circumference; this is called the girth; then, with the string, measure from the bone of the tail which plumbs the line with the hinder part of the buttock; direct the line along the back to the fore part of the shoulder blade; ta*ke the dimensions on the foot rule as before, which is the length; and work the figures in the following manner: Girth of the bullock, say six feet four inches; length, five feet three inches; which multiplied together, make 31 square superficial feet; and that multiplied by 23 (the number of pounds allowed to each superficial foot of cattle measuring less than seven and more than five feet in girth,) makes 713 pounds. Where the animal measures less than nine and more than seven in girth, 31 is the number of pounds to each superficial foot. Again, suppose a pig or any small beast should measure two feet in girth, and two along the back, which multiplied together, make four square feet; that multiplied by 11, the number of pounds allowed each square foot of cattle measuring less than three feet in girth, makes 44 pounds. Again, suppose a calf, a sheep, &amp;c, should measure four feet six inches in girth, and three feet nine inches in length, which multiplied together, make 15 one fourth square feet; that rcmltiplied by 16, the number of pounds allowed to all cattle measuring less than five feet and more than three in girth, makes 265 pounds. The dimensions of the girth and length of back cattle, sheep, calves, or hogs may bo as exactly taken this way as it is at all necessary for any computation or any valuation of stock, and will answer exactly to the four quarters, sinking the offal, a sum which every man who can get even a bit of chalk can easily figure.
