The editor of Sunday School Times... The editor of Sunday School Times, in an article on Brigham Young, says: ' It is possible for a man to be sincere, and as far from right. There is hardly any limit to the wild fanaticism of a deluded, religious enthusiast.' Then he goes on to name, as such, several of the most prominent reformers, beginning with Mohammed, ending with John H. Noyes, and including Ann Lee ! We looked in vain for the name of that distinguished religious enthusiast, Jesus of Nazareth! but it was not there. Again, we must assert: Ann Lee's zeal,wild, fanatical, deluded, religious and enthusiastic as it may have been, never exceeded the same characteristics in Jesus; lor ever aimed at any purer life, through any more self-denials, than were practiced by Jesus. We would ask Editor Trumbull, wherein did Ann Lee's testimony differ from that of Jesus? Wherein, her Christian life? Wherein, the testimony she has left for her children, or their lives when obedient to it? Wherein do the lives of true Shakers differ from the lives of those composing that model churchâ€”the Pentecostal ? Until the differences are declared, we ask the consideration of all men* whether, because we are good enough to follow Jesus and his immediate disciples so literally, we should be maligned and ridiculed? And what a testimony the living Shaker is to the whole unchristian world !
