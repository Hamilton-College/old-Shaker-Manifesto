FOOTPRINTS. ADA S. CUMMINGS. Many times some poor traveler would be lost were it not for the footprints that have been left, which he sees and strives to follow, knowing that others have been there before and he is not the only person who has traveled that road. Perhaps he is forsaken and solitary in a barren desert and has lost his way. The scorching sun beats down upon his head, and in vain he looks for some shady tree where he may be rescued from its rays. The hot sands burn his feet. He finds no fountain of pure sparkling water where he can quench his thirst. After all these afflictions no wonder that he is about to despair. Poor traveler � there seems to be nothing but death before him, when suddenly what does he see? Footprints! indicating that some one has been there before. He is led by those visible signs and is soon conducted to an oasis, where he finds shady trees, and a cooling spring of water. Certainly he must know that those blessings were sent from God. After obtaining rest and nourishment he is able to pursue his journey, strengthened to meet dangers and difficulties ; in thankfulness that he found those footprints which guided him where his languishing spirit was revived. Just so with our spiritual journey. Ofttimes we would feel discouraged were it not for the footprints of noble souls which we find all along our way, infusing new hope and strength into our spirits, to fight bravely the battle of life. Those footprints were left as a guide to keep our feet from wandering from the right path. When we are about to faint and become weary with the conflict, those footprints, if carefully followed will surely lead to the fountain that giveth to the thirsty, cooling drinks. Like unto those footpriuts that caused the traveler in the desert to rejoice, we, with renewed vigor, keep on our course in those spiritual footprints until we arrive at a never failing spring. Jesus, the Christ, left an example for the children of men. All who live that perfect life of purity which he lived, will never be left in the trackless desert to perish, nor alone upon the mountain of temptation, nor in the 'Valley of the shadow of Death.' He has promised to be with those who walk in his footsteps, and the promise remains sure. If we trust in Him He will sustain us. So we will take heart knowing that his footprints are still 'On the sands of time. ' We, also, must leave ours. Let us be careful that they lead in the right direction.� 'Footprints, that perhaps another Sailing o'er life's solemn main, A forlorn and shipwrecked brother, Seeing shall take heart again.'
