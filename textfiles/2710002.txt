TEACHINGS OF MOTHER ANN LEE ALPHABETICALLY ARRANGED. By Belle Rullhausen. Arm yourselves with meekness and patience. Be clean and prudent, and always be kind to the needy. Cry thou to God that He may give thee true desires. Dress modestly and as becometh the followers of Christ. Every soul can not be dealt with alike, some must be drawn to God through love; some through mercy, and yet others must feel the judgments of God. Faith is the anchor of the soul, and holds it in times of trial and temptation. God will answer the prayer of those who call upon his name in faith. Hate covetousness, be joyful, cheerful and diligent in doing good. If you wilfully do that which is wrong you debar your soul from the Kingdom of Heaven. Just in proportion as you heed the cries of the needy, God will heed yours. Keep the word of God and do Ms will and all that you do will be blest. Labor to feel the life of Christ in your soul, make Ms way your way,�let it be your inheritance,�your occupation. Man must first be redeemed from 'the fall' before the animal creation will be subject unto him. No one can enter the kingdom of heaven with hard or unkind feelings toward another, for the law of this realm is Love. Only through prayer and suffering are the gifts of God obtained. Put not your trust in man, but in the power and gift of God. Quell the spirit of fault finding; do not complain of the way of God until you have proved it, none ever thought it hard who really were in it. Remember the poor and suffering, feed the hungry and clothe the naked. Speak not harshly, but let your words be few and seasoned with grace. Those who through faith and obedience find a just relation with Christ will of all souls be most blest. Under trial be not discouraged, for your Heavenly Father seeth your soul in its adversity, and sendeth succor in time of need. Voluntarily bear the cross of Christ and faithfully endure to the end and ye shall become kings and priests unto God. Whoever follows Christ in the re-generation will be cleansed from all unrighteousness. Xact of no man more than is your due. Your lives should be godly; your conversation after the pattern of Christ. Zealously strive to do good, as if you had a thousand years to live, and as if you knew you should die to-morrow Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
