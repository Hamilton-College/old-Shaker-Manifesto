Pleasant Hill, Ky. Jan. 1898. So far our winter has been quite pleasant. Only a few days since the mercury fell to 10 degrees above zero. Our first snow fall was about Christmas, of some two inches, but in a few days it was all gone. During the autumn we had two months of severe drought, but subsequently the rain and sunshine revived and gladened the fields with a lovely carpet of green. Our apples were almost a failure, but of small fruits and vegetables we had a good crop. During the past season the West family made some needed repairs on several of the buildings, and after the painting had closed a decided improvement was manifest. We have many blessings for which we make many expressions of thankfulness. Nancy L. liupe.
