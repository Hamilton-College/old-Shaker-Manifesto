FORGIVENESS ' Father, forgive them ! ' The waves of the air Bore the sweet music of this holy prayer; When in keen pain and anguish he writh'd, Drinking of gall this petition he breath'd. ' Father, forgive them ! ' O, heaven inspire My soul to breathe forth the same pure desire ! Let its sweet music float down to my soul, Waking to being the same self-control. Whence came this pow'r, this strength to control Waves of temptation, that peril'd his soul ? While in the wilderness tempted with wrong, Kissed in betrayal, and mock'd by the throng. Here, down the aisles of my heart's home, I find Essence of this love —forgiving—resign'd ; Life is as sweet as the dew the bee sips, When words of kindness are found on the lips.
