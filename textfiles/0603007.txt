DIET Elder J. S. Prescott calls our attention to an experiment in dieting, which a person in Medina, O., has practiced with increasingly beneficial effects. As an economical experiment it certainly is forcibly interesting. We condense : ' For breakfast, five graham gems with butter; no inconvenience nor hunger followed — cost three cents. Dinner, % lb. rice, one ounce each of sugar and butter — a good meal — cost five cents. Supper, % lb. corn meal, % pint milk, cost three cents. One day's cost 11 cents. For a change, one gill of beans which, by the quart, cost less than half a cent.' The correspondent claims to have worked hard, ate nothing between meals, is renewing his age and youthfulness,and only dreads the lonesomeness to be experienced by living to a very great age.
