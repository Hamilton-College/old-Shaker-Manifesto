Eld. F. W. Evans, Dear Sir:--In coversation this evening... Smith &amp; McNeil's Hotel, New York, March, 22, 1888. Eld. F. W. Evans, Dear Sir :�In conversation this evening with a gentleman who seemed to know much of your Socie'y, I was pleased, beyond my ability of expressing my admiration of its aims and qualities. It is just such an organization as it would be my desire that the whole world might become, of its knowledge and belief. I have a great longing to know more of its aims. If you have books or pamphlets on bye-laws and constitution, that set forth your teachings, please send me such as you have, that I may know who and what you are, and ' how it is that such a Society can exist and be so little known of. I thought I had heard of almost every kind of belief and existence of societies ; but I never heard of yours till to-day. Hoping an early answer, and success to your noble undertaking� I am, with great respect, E. M. Trowbridge.
