How to Prevent the Ravages of Moths .— The destruction caused by these little pests can only be counted by millions yearly, and they are the plague of every housekeeper. Unless you hermetically seal a cask or box, you can scarcely keep the miller out, as she will crawl through a goodsized pin-hole. Therefore we must use something offensive. Nothing is so effective and cheap as petroleum paper, or even the common tar-roofing paper will answer. Buy the paper in rolls, cut ii into sections long enough to cover inside, the bottom and the sides, and lap over on the top of the box. All of the inside of the box must be covered, and on the inside of this again place wrapping paper, so as to prevent contact of the nice clothing with the petroleum paper. Use a large box— no matter about being very tight, as the paper will cover the holes—and pack in all your woollen, and furs, filling it full. Bring the paper up which has been hanging over the sides of the box and let it cover the whole, so that the miller cannot enter the box without crawling over the petroleum kpaper, which she will never do. Nail on the cover of the box and your clothing is safe for three years if you want to leave it that long. This is a specific against the ravages of the moth ; it is much cheaper and does not evaporate like camphor, and the carbolic acid in it seems to act like an antiseptic on the animal fibre of the wool to preserve it and make it healthful. In securing clothing against moths, if linen is used for wrappings, no moth will molest. Paper bags are equally good if they are perfectly tight, and so are trunks and boxes closed so tightly that no crevice is left open for the entrance of the moth fly. As the moth loves darkness, it will not molest even furs hung up in light rooms open to air and sunshine.
