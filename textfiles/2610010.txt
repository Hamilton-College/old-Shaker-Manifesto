Shakers, N. Y. ^ortli Family. Sept. 1896. We render thanks to the writer, for the inspiring words of, 'When to speak and when to keep silent' in Sept. Manifesto, Such gifts ministered to the soul causes it to feel that life is more than the mere seeking for wealth and social position. Above all of those sordid influences that THE MANIFESTO. 165 appear to dominate human life there are gifts that minister to the spiritual desires and cause the soul to strive for that passport which will give admittance to that temple where 'nothing that defileth or maketh a lie' can enter. We have received leaflets from our Brother Arthur W. Dowe, 948 Mission St. San Francisco, Cal., dealing with the much discussed and long expected 'Day of Judgment.' The subject is well handled and an intelligent view taken of that important event. They are in a form suitable to circulate in missionary work and all who desire can by application receive them. While reviewing the past season with its hopes and labors, our anticipations in some respects have not been realized; but nevertheless we have many things for which we can render thanksgiving. To those who are lovers of that tropical fruit water melons, we would ask them to try Cole's Early. Of all the varieties that we have tested this has proved the most satisfactory in quality and early growth. The 5th of August we had ripe fruit. We waited very patiently with the hope that the Editor would call around and share with us, but we will be ready when the time comes. Hope we will not be disappointed. Hamilton DeGraw.
