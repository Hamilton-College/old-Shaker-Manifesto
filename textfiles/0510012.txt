AVERSION TO MANUAL LABOR The practice of educating boys for the professions, which are already overstocked, or for the mercantile business, in wliich statistics show that ninety-five in a hundred fail of success, is fearfully on the increase In this country. Americans are annually becoming more and more averse to'manual labor; and to get a living by one's wits, even at the cost of independence and self-respect, and a fearfui wear and tear of conscience, is the ambition of a large proportion of our young men. The result is, that the mechanical professions are becoming a monopoly of foreigners, and the ownership of the finest farms, even in New England, is passing from Americans to Irishmen and Germans. Fifty years ago a father was not ashamed to put his children to the plow or to a mechanical trade; but now they are too feeble ' for bodily labor, one has a pain in his side, another a slight cough, another ' a very delicate constitution,' another is nervous, and so poor Bobby, or Billy, or Tommy is sent off to the city to measure tape, weigh coffee, or draw molasses. It seems never to occur to their foolish parents that moderate manual labor in the pure and bracing air of the country is just what these puny, wasp-waisted lads need, and that to send them to the crowded and unhealthy city is to send them to their graves. Let them follow the plow, swing the sledge, or shove the foreplane, and their pinched chests will be expanded, their sunken cheeks plumped out, and their Iung3, now 'cabined, cribbed and confined,' will have room to play. Their nerves will be invigorated with their muscles; and when they shall have cast off their jackets, instead of being thin, pale, vapid coxcombs, they shall have spread out to the size and configuration of men. A lawyer's office, a counting room, or a grocery is about the last place to which a sickly youth should be sent.â€”Colorado Republican.
