Harvard, Mass. Oct. 1894. As the papers have given a very distorted account of the fire which recently occurred in this village, we thought that a more detailed statement might prove acceptable to the readers of The Manifesto. On Sept. 20th at about 11-45 a. m. the cry of fire was heard, and we soon learned that our large barn was in flames, and no possibility of saving it. Several animals were in the building, but fortunately, these were driven out. Some of the farming implements were also saved. In about forty-five minutes after the alarm, the fire engine company from Ayer were on the ground and doing effective service in saving a large pile of cord wood, as at this time the barn was beyond being saved. We also lost one hundred tons of hay three hundred bushels of potatoes, two horse power machines, one new cart, also a quantity of farming tools, and five hundred gallons of vinegar and cider. A smaller barn, an ice-house, a store-house for lumber, and several sheds were all consumed. WTe succeeded, however, in saving our cider mill and the shed attached, and shall soon be able to engage in the making of more vinegar. Our loss can not be less than $15,000. and having an insurance of only $4,000 This is our first experience, in Harvard, of so destructive a fire, and although we feel our loss greatly, yet our hearts overflow with gratitude that our home is left to us. We have many thanks to render to the timely assistance of the fire department of Ayer, and to every one who afforded us aid in this time of our great need. The cause of the fire must have been from some undue carelessness, as no engines, stoves nor lamps were in use about the premises. Marcia M. Bullard.
