LIFE MARY WHITCHER I would not be a blithsome leaf, While I have feet and hands ; By wind and wave so tossed adrift That life hath no commands. I would not be an idle spell, And know no journey home, To do, to be, for good or well By which I could be known. Life, what is life? what doth it mean But action, work and thought? Not merely breath, or life to seem, With no attendance wrought. Then up, my heart, my loins agirt With valor, kin to steel, To do the little in thy work Which doth thy life reveal. Canterbury, N. H.
