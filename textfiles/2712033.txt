Almanac We are informed that the 1898 Almanac of Prof. Irl R. Hicks is now ready, and judging from its past history, it will not be many weeks in finding its way into homes and offices all over America. It is much larger and finer than any previous issue. It contains 116 pages, is splendidly printed and illustrated on fine book paper, having the finest portrait ever given of Prof. Hicks. It can no longer be denied that the publications of Prof. Hicks have become a necessity to the family and commercial life of this country. His journal Word and Works, aside from its storm weather and astronomical features, has taken rank with the best literary, scientific and family magazines of the age. Do not believe hearsay and reports. See the Hicks Almanac and paper for yourself. You will then know why they are so popular. They are educators of the millions, and unrivaled safeguards to property and human life. It is matter of simple record that Prof. Hicks has foretold for many years all great storms, floods, drouths and tornadoes, even the recent terrible drouth over all the country. The Almanac alone is 25 cents a copy. The paper is $1,00 a year with the Almanac as a premium. Send to Word and Works Pub. Co., 2201 Locust St., St Louis, Mo.
