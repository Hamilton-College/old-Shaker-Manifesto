NOTES This Number. — We present in this issue of The Manifesto many valuable contributions, for those capable of thoughtful engagements. Few but will be struck by the tone of the spiritual thunderbolt among antichristian 'orthodoxies' found in 'The World a Stage, etc.,' by Elder Evans. The ' Correspondence ' department suggests several ideas — among others, one in which we fully coincide—that on the temperance subject, demanding as a cure for inebriates a radical, physiological change of habits. Let those who question this conclusion, get Elder F. W. Evans' opinions upon it. The balance of the department represents some very important and kindly queries and answers. 'Catholicism'. is almost severe; but it will do good to have the Shaker idea understood. ' The Philosophy of Shakerism,'— we almost need to apologize for its plainness— shows that well-regulated relations of Marriage are 'not far from the kingdom of' Shakerism! Let those who will to marry, keep the laws of nature, and they will choose Shaker life in preference to the onerous, yet righteous rules of reproduction. Let every one who breathes, study Respiration; and likewise remember that these views, the results of experience, come from a Shaker girl, whose sweet poetry and song, education and training have all come from the Shakers. ' Return of the Wandered,' sequel to ' The Ways of the Wanderer,' is an especially pretty contribution; and speaks so truly and feelingly the real truth of so many lives as turn from self and self-indulgence, to the self-sacrificing, life-example of Jesus, the Christ. u Saviours ' is a valuable theme, and happily rendered by our first novitiate Eldress. ' The Real and Ideal' speaks much of truth to us. What a pretty spirit pervades 'the Indian poem ! The original poetry is pretty THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 161 and means something every time. Oar music for July will sing its own praise, and it is worthy of its accomplished author. On the whole, may it not be called a Banner No. ?
