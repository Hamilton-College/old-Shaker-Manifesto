CONSOLATION West Gloucester, Me. Watching and praying I find you, O my beloved, my own, Trusting a Father's rich promise, I will not leave you alone, I will not leave you alone. Tho' thro' the desert I lead, Or a part in the mountain ye pray For strength in the hour of need, I never will answer you nay, I never will answer you nay.
