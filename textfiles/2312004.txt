Beloved Editor:--I thought perhaps... Ballston Spa. Oct. 1893. Beloved Editor :�I thought perhaps some of the dear friends of our Order whom I have not as yet met, might take an interest in my expressions of pleasure and satisfaction in reference to a recent visit I enjoyed with kind Gospel friends at Mt. Beautiful, as I term our lovely home at Mt. Lebanon. I had quite a tedious journey from Ballston, being obliged to wait at the stations for connecting trains. I arrived at New Lebanon depot at seven o'clock p. m. just as the dusky shadows were creeping over hill and valley, and there I met a kind Brother in waiting with a comfortable carriage, to convey me up the rather rugged hill that leads to the quiet, home-like village that nestles on the hill-side just west of the Massachusetts line. It is a lovely, picturesque spot which always seems like an oasis in my memory, partly because of hallowed associations; it is the spiritual home of my soul's deep love and tender affection, from whence I receive strength, comfort and consolation. 280 THE MANIFESTO. On my arrival, I met several of the dear Sisters who gave me a kind welcome and a loving greeting. I received the generous hospitality accorded to friends and strangers, and soon found myself engaged in agreeable conversation, with many to whom I am devotedly attached. After a comfortable night's rest, I was awakened by the five o'clock signal, and was soon aware that busy hands and feet were actively engaged in the performance of daily duties. Breakfast was promptly served at six o'clock. With free hearts and happy expression of countenance, all moved contentedly to their various employments, with unselfish devotion to each other's welfare that impresses one with a feeling that here is exemplified the true Christian brotherhood and sisterhood. I see here the results of co-operative labor on the basis of the Altruistic life. One would have to travel far to find such beautiful homes. I was interested in walking over the premises ; cleanliness and order prevailed everywhere. I admired the neatly laid out flower beds in the centre of the door-yard, which were bright and attractive with fresh bloom and beauty. These belong to the young Sisters, who care for them, aside from doing the sale work,�shirt making. I wish every shop girl had some such agreeable and elevating employment aside from daily moil and toil. There would be less dissipation in frivolous pleasure and a higher standard of morals. I find a high-toned, ethical and spiritual culture here. Their thoughts do not centre on fashion, folly, society gossip and conventionalities. There is an air of moral wholesomencss to breathe, and a spiritual aspiration which is uplifting to the soul who is weary of the hollow mockeries of the world. It seems to be a season of temporal blessing, a good return for the husbandman's honest toil, and now these industrious people are gathering the fruits of the season, securing the winter's supply of fruits and vegetables. They tell me they have had many intelligent inquirers this season; they are glad to tender to all who seek the higher life and light, the truth and knowledge that is embodied in their religious system. True Christianity finds here its genuine expression, broadening the minds and hearts of all in intelligent and consecrated service. With spiritual growth in each individual, comes contentment and peace of mind, and a unity of heart and purpose ; also a kind forbearance and consideration of the feelings of others. I had the pleasure of visiting the Church family, in company with Eldress Anna White, and was pleased to meet once more our venerated and beloved Eldress, Eliza Ann Taylor, wl'ose refined and beautiful spirit shines through her countenance. Her wise and encouraging words impress one with a feeling that they have received a benediction through contact with such a Christly presence. Eldress Dorothy and Sister Amelia, showed me great kindness. I was conducted through their large dwelling, saw a choice collection of plants, among them, was a night-blooming Cereus THE MANIFESTO. 281 which blossomed the same evening, and I was presented with the blossom the next morning. It was as lovely and fragrant as the spirits of those who kindly presented it. I had a visit with several of the precious Sisters, and also with the little girls, twelve in number, under Sister Amelia's care. They entertained us with singing and recitation. The children receive a thorough, industrial education, along with other studies, which require even more patience on the part of instructors, than the usual routine in the school-room. The excellent moral training of the young people is invaluable, as laying the foundation of upright and reliable characters. I was much pleased to notice the courteous behavior and gentle manners of the young Brothers and Sisters, and take pleasure in mentioning it to friends outside. I was much interested in those who have lately come to make their home at the North family. I saw several new faces, and met in pleasant conversation with some who had come since my visit a year ago. I had a beneficial visit with Brother Walter Shepherd and his company of six boys, who were congregated in their large, airy room at the top of the dwelling. I particularly noticed that they accorded respectful attention to an interesting account of Br. Walter's early experience. The young Sisters presented me with a book of beautiful pressed ferns, grasses and flowers; each leaf had an original design and a verse accompanying it. They tenderly inlaid one page in loving memory of their deceased companion, Ada Wayne, whose face I missed from the youthful group. I greatly appreciated this loving token of kindly regard. I was privileged to attend the Sabbath morning services. A number of strangers were admitted; all seemed reverently impressed with the worship. I was the humble recipient of a benediction of love and blessing, from the Ministry, Elders, Brethren and Sisters. My heart was too full of feeling to respond; but I felt grateful for all the good bestowed, and I am blest in the renewed strength of the divine life which is my support every day. ~ On Monday morning, I took my leave of spiritual kindred and was assured of continued remembrance and sisterly companionship, which for several years past, has been inexpressibly dear to me. With the opening lines of Sister Rachel MacDonald's verses, I will close my lengthy letter. 'God bless the Mount of Lebanon We say with one accord, Though mountains high divide us, We are one in the Lord.' Your Gospel Sister, Sophia Wayne.
