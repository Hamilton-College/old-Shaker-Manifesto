VISITING THE SHIRLEY SHAKERS. Something About the Life and Surroundings of an Interesting People. Hotel Ponemah, Milford Springs, N. H. Aug. 1889. A carriage drive through the countryï¿½this I have always regarded as the pleasantest and most satisfactory way of traveling in the summer seaso::. Today we reach this lovely spot. Much might be written of many places and points of interest in our trip since leaving home, but I will confine myself to the visit we made yesterday to the Shirley Shakers, near Shirley Village, Mpss., giving a little of their surroundings and history. T have had the pleasure of au ac quaintance for inauy years with John Whiteley. the elder arid deacon or temporal manager of this family of Shakers. Mr. Whiteley often favors the Christian Union with a call when in Boston on business. We were most cordially welcomed as we drove to the front door of th^ headquarters by Elder Whiteley and Sister Mary Elston, who soon after took great pains to show us through the several departments and buildings devoted to their work. Neatness, order, cleanliness, quiet, with busy industry, impressed us on every side. This family of Shakers was gathered in 1793. The chapel waa erected iu that year, a neat, pleasant room. It now has the same paint on the walls and ceilings as put on so faithfully in 1793, and has never been touched by the brush since that time, nearly 100 years. The farm contains 2500 acres. Hay crop this year from 150 to 200 tons. They have a herd of Guernseys, Jerseys, Ayrshires, in all about forty. Their principal barn, 120x42, is built near the foot of a high hill. The loads of hay are driven in at the tipper part of the barn, the hay thrown off down the sides, the team having space at the front end to be turned and then driven out at the entrance. They have beautiful apple orchards; last year they gathered 1000 barrels. John Whiteley was born in Yorkshire, England, not far from the birthplace of Rev. Robert Collyer. He was in Manchester the day Queen Victoria was crowned, and joined in a temperance procession in her honor. After coming to this country he engaged in wool-pulling. What led him at first to take any interest in the Shakers was in the fact that one day his employer told him to buy for him in the village some garden seeds, and to be very particular to buy thost^ put up by the Shakers, as those they could always depend upon for a crop. This led him to look into their religion, that he might learn ''why they were so honest in their dealings with the world.'' After much thought and study he gave up his work and became one of the Shirley Shakers. This was forty years ago. Sister Mary Elston gave up her home at Lowell, and has for 40 years been of this family at Shirley. Isaac Bailey is the eldest man of the family, being 84 years of age, has been a member of the family 52 years (since 1837.) He said to us, ''I came from my home in England to America before any steamer ever crossed the ocean ; was on a packet nine weeks from England to Boston, and was settled here with this family of Shakers 'before the Queen was crowned.' ' The old house now stands in which Ann Lee was hidden away in a closet when the furious mob assembled, determined to carry her away. This was in 1783. Mr. Whiteley read to us a very interesting and thrilling account of the cruel and inhuman doings of that wild mob of men who seemed to be filled with the very evil spirit of destruction to this, then, small body of peaceful and orderly men and women.
