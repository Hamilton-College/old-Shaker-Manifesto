Tip Lewis and his Lamp Tip Lewis and his Lamp. By Pansy. Price 25 cents. Boston : D. Lothrop &amp; Co. This capital story was one of the first from Pansy's prolific pen, and so bright was it, so pure, and so healthy in tone, that it sprang at once into popularity, and since that time it has been in steady demand. It was an excellent idea on the part of the publishers to begin their new series of cheap editions of good books with one which is already so widely and favorably known. It is a book powerful for good, and one that no boy could read without feeling its influence. The story itself is deeply interesting, the style is fascinating, and the lesson it teaches is skillfully mingled with the incident. By this reduction in the price it will find a multitude of new readers, and particularly among those who need its teachings most.
