In Memory of Sister CATHARINE WALKER. By Sara Williamson. Thv spirit rests in peace 'neath angel care, The angel ones who with thee unaware Did all thy days with watchful wisdom guide; With love and wisdom, all thy steps beside. Thou hast gone from the dream of toil and And turmoil, called the earthly life; [strife And awoke to the new and sweet surprise, That in gladness met thy wearied eyes. And thou hast found, that kindness and love And justice, weave in the realms above The spirit robes of radiant light That enfolds each soul that doeth aright. And thy faith sincere, and thine earnest zeal, Are set in thy crown to ever reveal In its gems of light and beauty rare, Each deed of duty and watchful care . And to all who are faithful in deed and word, In immortal life comes the rich reward; When the Mother saith, 'My child, well done, Enter into thy joy, and receive thy crown.' Harvard, Mass.
