WHY IS IT SO? Some find work where some find rest, And so the weary world goes on; I sometimes wonder which is best,� The answer comes when life is gone. Some eyes sleep when some eyes wake, And so the dreary night-hours go; Some hearts beat where some hearts break, I often wonder why 'tis so. Some hands fold where other hands Are lifted bravely in the strife ; And so through ages as through lands Move on the two extremes of life. Some feet halt while some feet tread, In tireless march, a thorny way �, Some struggle on where some have fled; Some seek, when others shun the fray. Some sleep on while others keep The vigils of the true and brave; They will not rest till roses creep Around a name above a grave.�Anon.
