ARTIFICIAL STIMULANT I have a stimulant within, Which supersedes all other. It is not coffee, tea, or wine ; It is to love each other. This love does stimulate the mind— Inspires to keep good order: In this I daily comfort find ; My conscience the rewarder. I have a stimulant within. It is a living spirit, Which shuns the ways of guilt and sin This blessing I inherit. Yea, I have food some know not of,— Not always need of stuffing: I keep my conscience undefiled, And have no use for puffing.* *The filthy, poisonous weed— Tobacco. Lord, stimulate me to do rightBe ever in my duty ; Make thy commandments my delight: Thy ways are ways of beauty. I want this stimulant within, And be alive in spirit; Not satisfied to live in sin ; That I thy care may merit Be thou my guide in all I do ; O prosper and protect me, Until at length I travel through ; And through my head direct me. This stimulant I'll still retain,— Be wide awake, and stirring : True, and thy subject will remain, Nor be among the erring. Let me not be a sleepy drone, Half dead whilst I am living : Nay! with the saints I will be one, And all I have be giving. No artificial stimulant Is needed to enliven The soul who has forsaken all— Who for the truth is striving. J. S. Kulp, Pleasant Hill, Ky.
