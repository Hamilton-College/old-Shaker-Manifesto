AFTER MANY DAYS. Annie E. Stephens. 0, toilers in the vineyard ! 0, workers for the Lord! Think not your efforts fruitless, Because of no reward; We sigh when winter lingers, : For the bright and smiling Mays, Yet the harvest ever cometh, Though 'after many days.' O yearning hearts ! look upward, In patient trusting wait, The seed we sowed in spring-time May often blossom late. And the good that we have scattered Along lifu's weary ways, Will yield a glad fruition, Yea, 'after many days.' Go work with ardent courage, And sow with willing hand The seed o'er barren deserts, And o'er the fertile land. And lo ! earth yet shall blossom, Though the brighter morn delays ; For God perfects the harvest, Yea, 'after many days.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
