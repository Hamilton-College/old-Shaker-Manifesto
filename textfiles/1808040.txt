DO BIRDS HAVE PHYSICIANS? Nancy G. Danforth. One day a little bird flew through the open window into the room where we were at work. In trying to get out again, it struck the window with such force as to fall to the floor perfectly stunned. We carried it out and placed it in front of the house where we could see if it revived. Presently another bird came and hopped around it, then going a short distance, would return as though seeking to induce it to fly; but all of no avail; the poor bird remained motionless. The well bird then went away, but soon returned with another bird. They both went directly to the little senseless bird and began to peck its head vigorously. This continued a few seconds, when the unfortunate bird seemed to recover, arose, and all three flew away, apparently quite happy. Canterbury, N. H.
