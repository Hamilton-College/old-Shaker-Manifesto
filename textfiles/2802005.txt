A PRAYER. O Koly Spirit of God take me as Thy disciple : guide me, illuminate me, sanctify me. Bind my hands that they may do no evil; cover my eyes, that they may see it no more ; sanctify my heart, that evil may not dwell within me. Be Thou my God; be Thou my guide. Whithersoever Thou leadest me I will go; whatsoever Thou forbiddest me I will renounce ; and whatsoever Thou commandest me in Thy strength I will do. Lead me, then into the fullness of Thy truth. Amen.
