Shakers, N. Y. Second Family. Apr. 1893. 'In the midst of life, we are in death,'' is a saying we often realize, and it is as truly applied to earthly existence. Though seed-time is here, still we are in the midst of winter, the ground being cold, frozen and unyielding, like too many of mankind, unwilling to receive the good seed, and if sown will not grow. But as the Lord sends his rain as well as sunshine to the just and unjust we shall have to abide in patience, for the sun's rays to warm the earth and make it fit for the growth of vegetation. Our good Ministry are still with us, but will soon leave for Mt. Lebanon. We are doing all we can to forward our spring work. General time of health in Society. We are striving to keep the spirit alive in our meetings and all through the week. As the laborers are few, and the harvest is great we have to struggle to keep the separation, for there are always some that seek for self-ease and selfish comfort, rather than sacrifice all for Christ's sake and the gospel. Perhaps there are too many anti-shakers that expect to get to heaven through the labors and exertions of those who have gone on before, and by their good works beg St. Peter to let them in. Let us so work and live that we shall not have to hear the unwelcome sound, 'I know you not.' If in Jesus's day they were thieves and robbers will they be any better at this day? Isaac Anstatt.
