LOVE. ABRABELLA SHEPARD. This simple word is the foundation principle of our happiness, and shall we shut it out of our hearts, and deprive ourselves of its blessed influence ? Shall we close up the avenues of our souls and prevent its bright rays from beaming upon us, or shall we by divesting ourselves from every thing impure allow it to shine with its benignant mildness and be the ruling principle of our lives ? Oh ! could we, instead of indulging in the natural propensities of a fallen nature which is death to the soul; contrast the difference between love and hatred, could we realize how beautiful the one and how odious the other, we would not, I think, hesitate for one moment which of the two principles should be the predominant dictator of our lives. Love is a silken cord which entwines around the heart and draws with magnetic enchantment and cementeth hearts together in bonds of indissoluble union. How sweet it is to love and be beloved. Pure love is a plant of heavenly origin, and shall we not cultivate it with care, and repel the opposite? I believe there are oceans of love to bathe in Fountains and Rivers of the same whose streams make glad the city of God anl will satisfy every thirsty soul. I am thankful for friends that are in possession of a large share of this beautiful virtue and are calculated to minister to the needy. Oft have I felt the influence of loving spirits which have breathed love into my sorrowing heart. O how much call there is for the circulation of love. It will save the poor needy children of earth. In loving we shall be loved, in comforting avo shall be comforted. North Union, Ohio.
