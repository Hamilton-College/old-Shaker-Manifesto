LIFE'S FOUNDATION. [Contributed by Sarah Ann Collins.] THE foundation of life is truth. It is the foundation of home life, business life, Church life and of society. Without it there is no stability because there is no confidence. Even careless thinkers admit this, and those who least regard it in practice, sometimes in their innermost souls value it most highly. The value of truth as a basis of living is acknowledged, 'Buy ihe truth and sell it not.' With upright, straightforward dealing comes a good conscience. It is a strange and solemn power which conscience wields. Jn secret a wrong is committed, one feels guilty and wretched and is in his own eyes degraded. This feeling does not pass away ; at times it revives. Conscience speaks most forcibly in lonely hours. It awakens one at night by the side of the bed, and says wake up, listen to me, and holds with a remorseless eye. Wrong-doing comes from the grave of the past and marches by in melancholy procession, in terror one looks at it and goes forth to business, trying to smile, but conscience has its revenge. It pays to be upright in small as well as great matters. ï¿½Selected.
