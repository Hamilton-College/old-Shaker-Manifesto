Elmira E. Hull At Canaan, N. Y., March 26, 1877, Elmira E. Hull , aged 24 years. [Crippled from birth, life here was of little worth to her. The following lines were found on her slate written two days before her departure. Ed.] 'Ah ! can ye tell me what is death ? Speak sacredly, and say it is a real And solemn thing to die; and say you that it Comes alike to all, the just and unjust Must answer to its call? But what is it? Is it when the heart shall cease its beating, And the pulse is stilled ? when the eyes are closed, When the lips refuse to move, and the tongue To speak, as it was wont to do before ? The spirit leaves its tenement of clay, And soars from pain and sorrow free, above! Aye, this is death, and yet 'tis life and loveâ€” No night, but peace and happiness.'
