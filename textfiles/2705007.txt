How Would a Union of Church and State Effect our National Liberties? By Catherine Allen. UNDKR the present development of the race, that which we understand by a reunion of Church and State would prove disastrous to our national and individual liberties and rights, because it would inevitably give control to trie strongest religious party, which in our nation, is the Roman Catholic,�the best organized and most powerful religious association of which history gives record. The religious sentiment and the love of power, are the two strongest factors in human nature. No matter what the beliefs or enlightenment of a sect or body of people, there would always be danger in making it possible for these two factors to combine and serve each other. If Protestants were as powerful a body as the Catholics, their denomination in the affairs of State would be equally objectionable. In either case the union of civil with ecclesiastical power would mean the loss of free speech and free press ;�the warping and narrowing of all educational efforts, public and private, to the standard of creed-bound minds;�the conversion of all thoughtful people who have not the courage to endure physical torture into hypocrites and slaves, for a legal creed, must in the nature of things create these. Its tendencies are to stupify the conscience, and stultify all the diviner qualities in humanity;�to wither genius and paralyze every progressive movement. In short no influences are so powerful, no tyranny so oppressive and destructive to the highest interests of the race, as supposed religion backt by unlimited political power. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
