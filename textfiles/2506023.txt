Enfield, N. H. May, 1895. The four seasons as they come and go, each in their regular course, bespeak a powerful force in the law of the universe, of uWondrous truths, and manifold as wondrous.' Gladly we welcome the advent of summer with its newness of life. Verily a change in the aspect of nature is productive of varied lessons of thought, beneficial to mind and body. In these days of religious skepticism, reference to rules, creeds and ceremonies of the past fail to benefit mankind, or perpetuate the gospel of Christ. Active Christian works in daily life, speaking words of comfort to the needy if consolation is the leaf needed from the tree of life; educating, if knowledge is the gift necessary from the mind's store-house; these are the practical works of righteousness which are to raise our fellow beings from theological error into an atmosphere of universal love and moral activity. Whatever be our lot, may we be givers as well as sharers of the goodness and mercy of God, thus doing his will and making our lives sublime. We are pleased to add to the list of our blessings of to-day, the pleasure we are deriving from having our reverend friend, 140 THE MANIFESTO. Elder Abraham Perkins with us. As he visits the field of his former labors, may he realize that the good seed he has scattered by the way is bearing the fruits of righteousness, and may the golden sunshine of peace bless his life as he glides into the courts of heaven's joys. On the evening of the 24th of April, our North family met with the loss of their mill by fire; cause unknown. Loss estimated at $2,300. No insurance. Farming and gardening progressing finely and usual prosperity throughout the Society. We offer our thanks to both divine and human powers of good for all blessings realized, with renewed prayers for God's children in all the earth. George II. Baxter.
