Christian Consistency To hold high principles, and live on low ones, is Christian inconsistency. We are all more or less inconsistent. There is no man whose practice is not worse than his profes- sion, no one who does not live below his own standard. But absolute inconsistency is when a man's life, taken as a whole, is opposition to his acknowledged views and principles, if a man says that it is more blessed to give, than receive, and is forever receiving, scarcely ever giving, he is inconsistent. If he professes that to please God is the only thing worth living for, and his plans and aims and contrivances are most to please men, he is inconsistent.â€”The Guide.
