TRIBUTE To Eldress Sarah Small. By Jane Cowen. Eldkess Sarah spent seventy-two years of noble service in this Society, being twelve years of age when her mother with several children, embraced the testimony of Christ's Second Appearing, and she remained a faithful pillar in the temple of our God. The mother received faith through the first missionaries who came to this state in the year 1809. Joseph Small who received faith at the same time embraced the gospel and was a faithful member. For nearly half a century Eldress Sarah was engaged in the care and educating of children, for which she showed a marked capacity and fitness, but during the last twenty years of her life she officiated in the capacity of an Eldress. She was tireless in her efforts to support the cause of righteousness and truth, and to implant a living faith in the minds of those who had less experience than herself. She ardently desired above all things that they might come up to the help of the Lord and sustain the cause of truth. She willingly passed to the summer shore to join with kindred spirits. We now bid our dear mother, a loving farewell, with a desire to meet her in the heavenly home, where her purified spirit has gone. When our summons comes to quit all terrestrial scenes we may be prepared for her association. In the language of the prophet, we can but exclaim,'Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my last days be like his.' South Union, Ky.
