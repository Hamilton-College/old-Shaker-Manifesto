ISSACHAR BATES.-NO. 8. [ Aic incident connected with the Life of Issaohar Bates, at the time that he was sent as a missionary to Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Ed.] ' On our arrival at Busro we met with some enemies of the cross and suffered much persecution at their hands. We met one man, a preacher, by the name of Devan. His home was at Patoka creek in Pike Co., He had a congregation at that place. His zeal against the Shakers was certainly very active even if sadly misplaced. At one time he preached a long sermon to his people, warning them to beware of 'them Shakers, ' and of their cruel orders. It so happened that I passed through that settlement, in company with one of the Brethren, and called at the house of one Humphreys, to warm us. Humphrey informed us that he had joined the church, and had been baptized. We said we were glad of the change, and he might need to be baptized aeain. On our return Humphrey came out to meet us and invited us to call at his house as a great meeting was to be held in the place and three preachers would be present. If we would stop he would take the best care of our horses. We told him we would attend if we could leave the meeting just when we pleased without giving offence. He said we might have that liberty. Soon after our arrival quite a company collected to see and hear .the Shakers. H. 'Well, I don't know but we shall all have to go up to Busro and get our sins pardoned ; we understand that you can forgive sins. ' I. Yea, we can, said I. Can you not do it here? H. ' No, ' said he, ' we don't attempt sr.ch a thing.' I. Well, I had no expectation that there was charity enough among such Christians to forgive sins. How do you expect to be forgiven, if you do not forgive one another? Eead the Lord's prayer and read what he has said about the forgiveness of sin. Devan did not like this illustration and when the meeting was opened he took for a text:ï¿½'Who is on the Lord's side?' First he explained it negatively, to show who was not on the Lord's side and he rejected every honest soul on the earth. Now, said he, we come to the positive. Who is on the Lord's side? I will tell you. It is that man or that woman who has set out to serve God, and after a while slips back and after their time of back sliding, and when the Lord calls them back again, this is positive evidence that they are on the Lord's side. At the close of his speaking he opened a wide door for any one to speak and to correct his errors. With such liberty I had a feeling to speak my mind, for I never before heard that God esteemed a backslider before a good, honest hearted soul, that stands fast, but that he has always cursed them ever since the fall of Adam, and I believed all that the speaker had said was wrong end foremost. Devan rose again, in haste and said. I move that this Shaker man and I have a talk together before you all instead of brother McKoy's preaching. Voted and agreed. After we had been engaged but a short time some of the people cried out. Reconsider that vote and let brother McKoy preach. They did so. Now, said Devan, I am determined to talk with this man and all who have a mind to hoar brother McKoy preach may stay, and the rest follow me, and out he went, and the people all followed, save four. We sat on an old block shed and began our talk. After some plain remarks on both sides, Devan says, I). Well your doctrine is more wholesome than I thought it was, but I shall ask you one question, which I know will sting you. I. AVell never mind that. D. I shall ask it then but I know it will sting you. I. You need not be afraid, as I have no fear of your sting. D. He proceeded. Don't you have ten thousand wicked thoughts in a day? Now what do you do with these thoughts? I. Shall I answer yon in Scripture language? D. That is the best of all. I. The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God to the bringing down of the Gl strong holds ; casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringeth into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. D. You have answered well, but I cannot do thac. I. It is because you have not received the gospel. 1). Well, we will shake hands in good will. After this all the people came and shook hands with us very kindly and peacefully. ( The End. )
