SACREDNESS OF CONFIDENCE In Russia, many years ago, two men, engaged in an angry conflict, only desisted when one drew a dirk and killed the other. The murderer ran, knife in hand, into the presence of a priest, to confess his terrible crime. While delivering himself in confession, the lawful officials entered the dwelling of the priest, in pursuit of the murderer. Hearing them coming, the wicked man, dropping the bloodstained dirk, leaped from a back window and escaped. The officials demanded of the confessor the name and confession of the criminal. The priest kindly and candidly repeated to them his vows to maintain the sacredness of secresy; but, still urged, he positively refused. Placed under arrest, he was tried by the presiding magistrate for partieeps criminis, or preventing the arrest of the culprit, by refusing his name and confession. Still refusing to divulge one word, he was sentenced to banishment for life in the cold and barren wastes of Siberia, or to remain there until willing to reveal what had been required. The emperor approved the sentence, and it was executed. For more than two-thirds of a score of years he has endured the terrors of such banishment, remaining true to his vows â€” and this was his crime The emperor has lately listened to an appeal for his pardon, and has granted it. He is soon to return to his native city, and we have it upon good authority that the entire populace of the city, regardless of religious persuasions, purposes going without the limits of the city to meet a man so heroic and conscientious as was this priest. Who hath eyes to read, let them so use them; 'who hath ears to hear ' confessions, let them be as true as this despised but truly noble Catholic priest. Can we learn any useful lesson from his integrity?
