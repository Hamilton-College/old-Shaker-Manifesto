Shakers, N. Y. April, 1898. The leading article in the April Manifesto has our unqualified indorsement. The latter half of the essay where it directly deals with conditions in our communal homes is strong but wholesome diet. It can not but do good if accepted in a right spirit and should be read and reread and well digested that the full benefit may be realized. Hope there will be more presented, dealing with the same subject, and in conjunction with it we are reminded of the remarks made by one who was considered a leader among the legal fraternity of the West; he said ,'The danger with you is internal; keep your covenant and no external power can break it.' While our earnest prayer is that the arbit rament of war may not be resorted to in the settlement of the misunderstandings that have arisen among the nations, yet if they as well as individual entities must reap what they have sown, how can that nation which has had its soil soakt in the blood of martyrs, and has caused in this enlightened (?) age the last decade of the nineteenth century over three hundred thousand suffering colonists to perish by starvation, whose only crime is struggling for the rights of man, evade the hand of the avenging angel when directed by the law of stern justice? As Believers in the divine law of peace and good-will toward all we can hope that the right may prevail, but also must recognize the fact that there are conditions existing in human society that at present will not be settled right because of the selfishness of man which is a barrier to the operation of the law of love. The result of these mighty conflicts the coming of which is inevitable will be the cleansing of life's temple and preparing it for entertaining a higher order of life than is now admissible. We will gather into the Lord's pavilion till the storm passes by. Hamilton DeGraw.
