BEAUTIES OF AUTUMN. Amelia J. Calver. The day is fair; there lingers scarce a breeze, To fan the height, or murmur in the trees, No cloud is seen to dim the sun's bright face, As promptly he is on his downward pace. The earth is clad in autumn's graver dress E'en richer than a summer's loveliness : And though it marks a sure and quick decline, It casts a thoughtful impress o'er the mind. The landscape has been swept by winter's breath, For many a tender shrub now sleeps in death, While tougher leaves and more tenacious, too, Have decked the trees with many a gaudy hue, While to complete the picture so sublime, 'Mid splendid ruin stand the fir and pine, Whose verdant foliage only waves anew, And fearlessly defies the frozen deMr. These are the gay environs of our home, The beauties of the hills of Lebanon, And as I these survey in grateful mood, My soul exclaims, 'O Father, Thou art good ! ' in winter's ermine raiment I delight, The spring is lovely, with its blossoms bright, And summer scenes, enchanting we may call, But autumn's golden reign is best of all. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
