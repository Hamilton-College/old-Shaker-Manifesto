Books and Papers. The Ladies' Home Journal MAGAZINES ARE COSTLY THINGS. Albert Lynch, the famous French artist, who received the Salon prize for his panel of 'Spring,' has been engaged by The Ladies' Home Journal to draw a series of designs for the cover of that magazine, which as the reading public knows, changes its cover design each month. Lynch is, perhaps, one of the best-paid artists in France, and these covers will cost The Ladies' Home Journal nearly $1000 apiece. But this only demonstrates the enormous expense, to which magazines are put in the production of their numbers.R. H. Stoddard, in New York Mail arid Express.
