Anti-Tobacco Crusader 'There is a time to laugh,' says the wise man, and in the 'Diary of the Rev, Solomon Spittle' in So. 13 of H.L.Hastings' Anti-Tobacco Crusader, which has just come to our table, we recognize and heartily welcome a new departure in dealing with the tobacco problem. We have had the heavy artillery. Call out now the reserve forcethe light infantry of fun and ridicule. Statistics and scientific facts are all useful in their way, nay, indispensable, but often a good laugh does more to shake the foundations of an evil custom or a vicious habit. Every tobacco-using pastor should be presented with a copy of this book, that he may see his own portrait; and the tobacco-using deacon or Sunday School superintendent should not be forgotten. Send ten cents to H. L Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass., for a copy. You will find it just the thing to circulate. On quantities, special terms will be given to tract distributors, churches, temperance and reform clubs and Sunday schools.
