Enfield, N. H. North Family. March, 1893. As we meet and mingle in the duties of life with the busy multitude of human beings, how varied our experiences; there are persons, who, like pleasing theories or some fine toned poem, make deep and lasting impressions upon us; they enter into our lives with precept or good examples, as noble ministers of true Christianity. While we may be able to gather valuable matter from abroad, we can also find much in our own homes equally as interesting and useful, in our intercourse with those united to us by like ideals and life works. True love for our fellowbeings creates Christian service, 'to try all things, but hold fast to that which is good,' and give of acquired soul wealth to others, with the devotedness and sweetness of spirit which characterized the late Phillips Brooks, who helped to make the the field of religion bloom with flowers of virtue and to eradicate from society that corruptibleness which destroys noble manhood and womanhood. 'Lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime; And departing leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time.' Awakened to the realization of moral responsibility, thus leaving life records proving that virtue pays, is the connecting link that binds the pure in spirit on earth and in heaven. As each flower adds beauty to earth's garden, so each mind with its individual aroma, should add to society, honor in its special sphere of action, nurtured and sustained by the spirit of godliness; for conscience, without Christian culture is mammon's servant, while the Christ garnished, make practical God's laws, and form the solid fabric of his Church, which the moth of lust or the rust of selfishness cannot soil. And what purer work is there than to uplift fallen humanity, and give to society that culture which makes all free and equal, intelligent and happy? At present we are walled around with huge banks of snow, remnants of the 20th and 22nd days of Feb., at which date snow drifts measuring from five to eight feet deep could be found in nearly all directions. Sisters not only proving indispensable in the domestic departments, have been well engaged in working on sale hosiery, throughout this cold season. We were much pleased with the March Editorial; please accept our thanks for the same, with love for all. George H. Baxter.
