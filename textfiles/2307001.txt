'I BIDE MY TIME.' Annie R. Stephens. 'I bide my time,'ï¿½O lesson sweet In patience e'er to wait; God's mercies like fair autumn flowers May often blossom late. What though to-day my feet must tread Dark Alpine vales of woe, Perchance to-morrow's sun will shed Its brightness where I go. If all life's streams with joy would flow Our hearts were always glad; That rarest bliss we'd never know Of being sometimes sad. 'I bide my time' in patience strong, In hopes that ne'er abate; God's promises to those belong Who daily work and wait. 'I bide my time' through shade and shine I wait for God's decree, Assured that in his own good time There's something sweet for me. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
