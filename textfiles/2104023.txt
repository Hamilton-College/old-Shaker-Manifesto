Dear Editor:--I thought I would, again, venture to write... Mar. 1891. Dear Editor:ï¿½I thought I would, again, venture to write for the Manifesto. Since my last, we have been called upon to pass through much tribulation in the loss of dear souls. Those who have been an example to us for many years, and been anxious through faithfulness to have us made happy. I have no doubt but that they are still with us in spirit, and will act as messengers of love, through any affliction that may come upon us. For the young Brethren and Sisters we have an anxious prayer, that they may be able to become steadfast in gospel truth, and willing advocates of the purity of the testimony of the word of God. In well doing your reward is as sure as God is sure. Keep a faithful watch over the course of your life and keep your souls unspotted from tl.e world. My thankfulness increases with my privilege, for the relation which I hold with my beloved Brethren and Sisters, and I wish to encourage all to be faithful to the light which God lias given them. Accept the promise of the pure in lie.'.rt, and it will be a beautiful treasure. Your Brother, L. P.
