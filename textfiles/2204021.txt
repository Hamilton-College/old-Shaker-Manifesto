Shaker Station, Conn. 'Praying always with all prayer,' saith the Apostle. When we pray to our heavenly Father, it is an acknowledgment of our dependence on Him. We should live day by day in the spirit of prayer. How blessed is the thought that we can be engaged in prayer when performing our daily duties. Our supplication can ascend to God without moving our lips. No matter how earnest or zealous we may be, without prayer and watchfulness we shall be overcome by the Adversary of souls. Watching and prayer is a safeguard each hour. Let us strive to attain to this prayerful spirit, and commit all our trials and burdens to One, who has promised to guide and protect those who trust in Him. 3417 spaces of cream were sold in Feb.
