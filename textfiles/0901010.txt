Correspondence Shaker view New Garden, Chester Co., Pa., Oct. 26, 1878 [From The American Socialist.] THE SHAKER VIEW. Dear Socialist.—Our Shaker friends assume, or believe (as I understand them) that theirs is a higher life — that they are ' upstairs ' (as our friend Eads expresses it) because they are celibates. I cannot understand their position, and would feel obliged to them, and no doubt many of your readers would feel the same, if they would throw more light on this extremely important subject. Yours truly, Communist. The American Socialist.
