HOME AND FRIENDS. Orren N. Haskins. A home in the hearts of friends we love, A home where friends are true; We seek to live and rise above, A partial, selfish few. We want our friends another class, We want our union pure, We want a treasure at the last, Both permanent and sure. We cannot live on selfish gain, We cannot live on trust, We must have the solid grain, We cannot live on husks, Give us the bread and wine that's new, And waters pure and fresh, That we the journey may pursue, Till we reach the eternal rest. O may we never weary grow, Or think the way too hard, The higher up the grade we go, The greater the reward. And brighter scenes appear in view, As onward we progress, Eternal blessings ever new, And robes of righteousness. We see beyond this veil of tears, A happy peaceful home, Away from earthly toil and cares, They beckon us to come. And while we hear the gentle call, O may we strive to be prepared, And to our God to give our all, To receive a just reward. In silent hours of calm repose, We wander to that home above, And have a partial glimpse of those, We once so dearly loved. What peace and rest and joys sublime, Are treasured for the wise, Who leave all earthly joys behind, And seek the heavenly prize. Where sweet humility and prayer, Love, peace and joy abound, True charity is ever there, And watchers guard around. No enemy can enter there, To mar our inward joy; Our long eternal home is where No tempest can destroy. May wisdom ever guide our way, In thee our all-we trust; May we our sacred call obey, For it is true and just. True meekness and a gentle hand, May we in truth extend to all, And aid the youth to firmly stand An honor to their sacred call. That when life's journey here shall end, We may depart in peace, And leave a blessing with our friends, That will eternally increase, In faith and hope and love divine, And every blessing given, To give us strength while here in time, And lead us safe to heaven.
