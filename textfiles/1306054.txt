Danger of handling domestic pets DANGER OF HANDLING DOMESTIC PETS. Dr. McCall Anderson in a paper on 'The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Skin,' in the Medical Times and Gazette, (p. 601), traces the development of the disease known as 'Favus' in human beings to mice suffering from the disease. Cats, which eat the mice, catch the disease, and communicate the same to children who handle them. The danger of allowing children to handle domestic pets which are suffering from skin disease is probably often overlooked, and deserves to be made known more widely than it is at present.
