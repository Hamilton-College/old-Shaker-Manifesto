[The following kind letter is from a life-long friend to the Shakers. Ed.] North Falmolth, May 10, 1893. Sister Aurelia :ï¿½It has been a long time since I wrote you, but you may be assured that I have not forgotten my Shaker friends, nor your kindness in sending me the Manifesto. How many of the aged pioneers of your families, who have lived wellrounded, consecrated lives, have passed happily away in the last few years. What a community of saints they now form in their spiritual homes. They are not alone, for souls like Channing, Brooks, Whittier, and others who have made the world-redeeming creeds of Christ their rule of life, have now joined their ranks, and are singing harmoniously together their song of praise. They have passed from sight, but 'have left their foot-prints on the sands of time, that another, seeing, may take heart again.' Such souls never die and are still ministering spirits to earth, with an influence more potent than while in their earthly bodies. The light of their ministrations is dropping through the broken clouds of ignorance, selfishness and inhumanity, and is cropping out through the civilized nations, and its beams are darting into the dark corners of the earth. We see it in the spirit of humanity that is now so prominent ; we see it in art and science, and its light shines conspicuously in the best literature of the day. It shines in the bright pages of the Manifesto, for while its essays and editorials teach the necessity of a virtuous, spiritual life, there is blended with it a 162 THE MANIFESTO. spirit of charity that never fades or grows old; and the poetry of its singers is so pervaded with the sweet spirit of the mother love as manifested in the life of Jesus, and exemplified in the life and teachings of Mother Ann, that it awakens the soul to higher and holier aspirations, and to that humility which leads to the baptismal waters, 'Where broods the Dove.' With love to all good Shakers, Your Brother, A. Lewis.
