BOOK TABLE Mark Twain has invented a Scrap-Book! Twain says very many funny and foolish things; but in adding this invention to the library, desk, counting-room, etc., he has done us all a remarkable favor. It is gummed on every page, ready for the scraps, no past being required; and is, all in all, a unique desideratum, difficult to be spared after once seeing how very nice it is. For this indispensable, send Woodman, Slote &amp; Co.. 119 William street, New York. The Evolution comes to our table very acceptably. Its aim is to fill a space made void by extensive growths from old political parties and theologies, made by numerous individuals who demand something better than now is. Its appearance and the subject matter of the copies we have seen speak very highly for it. J. D. Bell is its editor, 34 Dey street, New York. Plain Talks upon Practical Religion : Is now ready, containing an epitome of Shakerism. We anticipate an extensive circulation for it. It contains the names and addresses of all the novitiate elders. Sending one of these pamphlets to inquirers answers the purpose of many letters; and replies to an hundred questions naturally and constantly recurring to the minds of any who are at all interested in the Shakers as a people. By mail, six cents. Address either the editor or publisher of The Shaker.
