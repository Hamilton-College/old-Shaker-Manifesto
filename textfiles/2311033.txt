Alfred., Maine. Oct. 1893. This morning we awake and find a refreshing rain, for which we return thanks to the giver of all good. We have been in need of this rain for many weeks. Our springs have failed us and we have had to pump the water for the Laundry. It reminds us of days gone by when there were no aqueducts; and makes us more thankful for the present blessings. The harvesting is over. Not very large crops this year, but enough to supply our needs, and when we think of the thousands that have nothing to sustain them through the coming winter, but are dependent on the charity of others, our souls are filled with gratitude to God for his loving kindness and ever enduring mercy. Let us remember that we are to give an account of the use we make of the blessings bestowed upon us. Be prudent and saving in all things, was Mother Ann's counsel. A few weeks since four of our young Sisters spent a few days at New Gloucester. They enjoyed the visit very much, and gained good. Two days after their return, four Sisters from New Gloucester, came to spend a few days with us. We enjoyed their presence and felt that love, strength and union which betokens the children of Mother. Fannie Casey.
