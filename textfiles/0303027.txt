LINES ADDRESSED TO ELDER DANIEL HAWKINS, A SHORT TIME BEFORE HIS DEMISE By Hannah R. Agnew Thou worthy disciple, time's journey is ended, Repair to thy treasure above; Bright angels are waiting in triumph to meet you, With songs of rejoicing and love. With patience and zeal, you toiled in the vineyard Of Him, who will justly reward; In health and in sickness, in joy and in sorrow, Devoted your all to the Lord. The rising and falling of many in Israel, You witnessed, and firmly you stood; 'Mid rough, beating surge, like a rock in the ocean, You braved the tempestuous flood. In times of affliction,the Lord has been mindful, His angels to guard you he sent; His hand was not shortened, his ear was not heavy, When humbly in prayer you have bent. Now hear the glad sound of ' Well done faithful servant,' Rejoice with your Savior and Lord ; His cross you have borne, and His yoke you have taken; Receive your most glorious reward. Go meet the dear friends, who have toiled for the gospel, And suffered on earth with you here; Go rest where the wicked shall never more trouble, Nor sorrow's dark shadow appear. Your crown is prepared, and your mansion is ready, Bright angels invite you along; Go join in the choir, and sing the sweet chorus Rejoice with the purified throng. O, grant a free blessing to those you are leaving. Give love that will banish their tears ; Exhort all to trust in the Lord, and remember The prayer of the righteous He hears. And now, fare you well, loving father and brother, With full length of days you are blest; Like a well-ripened sheaf that's prepared for the garner, So you are prepared for your rest. Mt. Lebanon.
