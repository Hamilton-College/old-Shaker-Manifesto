The things that a man's real life consists in... The things that a man's real life consists in are not the things that can be seen witli the physical eye. Truth, purity, love,ï¿½these are the only enduring possessions ; and these are beyond the reach of our senses. Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the imagination of man, the things which God hath prepared'for them that love him; but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. llath revealed them, not will reveal them. The great verities of the kingdom of God are made known to men in this world. All that makes heaven precious is bestowed on us here, but it is not revealed to our senses. They who are always looking for marvels never see it. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. The faith that cleanses the hearts and gives us an inward and abiding hope of immortality is nourished neither on materialization nor on miracles. Not in looking on strange sights nor in listening to unearthly noises is its vision cleared and its grasp of things eternal strenghtened. It is with different faculties that it lays hold on eternity.
