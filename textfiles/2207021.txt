Ayer, Mass. June, 1892. After a week of disagreeable, rainy weather, which has hindered outdoor work and travel for that length of time, we have a chance to welcome again the rays of old Sol, as almost a stranger. The faces of the farmers are brightened as they feel assured that their hard work for the summer is not to be cut off by untimely frost. All hail to the faithful worker of the soil, as he follows his plough and turns the sod, that will give to us our corn and potatoes. The farmer's life is one of labor, if there would be success. The life of a Shaker is a life of industrious toil and if we live aright we must labor; and as this is the home of our choice, why not put forth our best life efforts to make it a beautiful home. It is said that the outward is often an index of the inner man, and if we would convert others to our faith, we must have our premises neat and orderly. There is but little hope for the sloven, but God will bless the intelligent and persevering worker. June 1st. finds our crops all in. We have about thirty acres under cultivation, and shall look forward to a fruitful harvest. Our orchards give evidence of a bounteous crop of apples, and that will make the whole family feel joyful as they anticipate the coming of another year. Warm weather has driven away nearly all the sickness. A. D. B.
