Discharged for Honesty. â€”A country gentleman, says a Boston paper, placed a son with a merchant in-----street, and for a season all went on well. But at length, the young man sold a dress to a lady, and as he was folding it up, he observed a flaw in the silk, and remarked, 'Madame, I deem it my duty to tell you there is a fracture in the silk.' This spoiled the bargain. But the merchant overheard the remark; and had he reflected a moment, he might have reasoned thus with himself: 'Now I am safe, while my affairs are committed to an honest clerk.' But he was not pleased; so he wrote immediately to the father to come and take him home; for, said he, 'he will never make a merchant!' The father, who had brought up his son with the strictest care, was not a little surprised and grieved, and hastened to the city to ascertain wherein his son had been deficient. Said the anxious father, 'And why will he not make a merchant?' 'Because he has no tact. Only a day or two since, he voluntarily told a lady who was buying silk, that the goods were damaged, and so I lost the bargain. Purchasers must look out for themselves. If they cannot discover flaws, it will be foolishness in me to tell them of their existence.' 'And is this all the fault?' 'Yes : he is very well in other respects.' 'Then I love my son better than ever; and I thank you for telling me of the matter; I would not have him in your store another day for the world.' Selected.
