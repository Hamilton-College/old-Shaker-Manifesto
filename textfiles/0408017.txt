TEMPERANCE Editors of the Shaker and Shakeress : Knowing that you take an interest in every degree of moral and spiritual reform going on in the world, which has for its object the elevation of our race, we thought we would let you know how the temperance cause is progressing in Cleveland. This institution seems to be conducted almost exclusively by women, and has, ever since its inauguration, except being backed by some clergy of all denominations, and these two elements combined are giving the temperance cause an impetus hitherto unknown, and these again backed by the invisible, are very fast becoming a power in the land against the demon intemperance. That the Temperance cause in Cleveland is gradually gaining strength every day, is evident from the following resolutions passed at a mass meeting held recently, published in the Cleveland Herald of the 16th inst., from which we make the following extracts. ' Resolved, That this movement be continued as it was begun, animated only by the spirit of kindness, and guided only by the law of love, toward those who sell intoxicating liquors. Resolved, That we manifest warm interest in those who habitually drink, and we will not cease to labor for their reformation, by prayer, by personal kindness, and by proper attention. Resolved, That through grace, the success attending the women of Cleveland, in their work of the last eight Aveeks, is most gratifying, and is without a parallel in any previous history of moral reform. Resolved, That we favor the establishing of drinking fountains (water of course) in our streets, at suitable intervals, throughout every section of our city.' When a praying band of women visited a saloon on the road leading from the city to our settlement, we felt to say in our heart, ' God bless the women/ ' This is their peculiar mission â€” because they are chosen for this purpose, and they have our union, sympathy and prayers.
