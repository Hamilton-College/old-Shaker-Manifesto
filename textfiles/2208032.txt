INQUIRY. No. 6. If parents with children join a Shak-er Society, how long can the parents retain the care of their children? This will depend wholly upon the condition of the parents and children, as an agreement would be entered into with the officers of the Society, for the benefit of both parties. No children are ever taken under the immediate charge of the Society, except by the request or free consent of those who have the lawful right and control of them, together with the child's own consent. No parents are required to give up their children. Indeed we think it more proper for parents to take care of their own children and bring them up in the admonition of the Lord.
