THE GLAD NEW YEAR! mp 1. A long the shadowy aisles of time, there floats a murmur soft and low, Now swelling in harmonious chime, sweet notes in measured numbers flow. With joy we catch the glad some strain, which fills our hearts with loving cheer, 2. 4. Our hopes on starry pinions rise. High aspiration thrills our soul, We tread the vale of time and sense, Amid its phantom fleeting dreams, A nobler life to realize, Ascending to perfection's goal. Still longing, with a hope intense. For something that enduring seems; The past with joy and sorrow fraught, Shall from our vision disappear; Yet duty's path we will pursue, Without a doubt or cringing fear; The present claims our earnest thought: All hail the bright, the Glad New Year! With lofty aim and purpose true, We'll toil throughout the Glad New Year ! 3. 5. Like angels from the realms unseen, Light-wing'd the moments come and go, The tender cords of purest love, With peace entwined, shall stronger grow; The shining links of life, between Ethereal spheres and earth below; We'll bear the spirit of the dove. And kindness to the erring show. They bear a record of the deeds That cloud, or make our pathway clear : With gentle words, and Christ-like deeds, A monument of good we'll rear; Broadcast they sow time's precious seeds, And usher in the Glad New Year! While bliss, that fills our spirit needs, Awaits us in the Glad New Year
