SOULFUL PRAYER. 'Lord, send I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send.'ï¿½Ex. iv., 13. Mount Lebanon., N. Y. 1. O God, Thou art my hope, In Thee I trust and live, 2. As bloom the pearly flowers, Which to the sunlight turn, 3. Yet still O God, I yearn For more divinity, 4. Like silv'ry stars that glow, And crown the ebon night. Thou knowest ev'ry need, As rises incense pure, For light, and truth, and grace, So shine thy gifts O God, And freely Thou dost give. From each sweet nectar urn, To search and cover me, Thro' darkness unto light. weak I feel Thy strength, When faint Thou givest bread, When fills my soul with praise, So rise my faith and pray'r, So new my heart today, With holy life baptize, That peace and purest love, My soul's adornment be. O blind, Thou sendest light To show the path I tread, To show the path I tread, gratitude ascends, For all the good I share,For all the good I share, from the pow'r of sin, Triumphant I may rise, Triumphant I may rise, send by whom Thou wilt, That I may dwell in Thee, That I may dwell in Thee.
