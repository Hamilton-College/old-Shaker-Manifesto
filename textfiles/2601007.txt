GETHSEMANE By Cora Vinneo Theke was a garden where the Savior prayed Id agony of soul. Dark was the night, The stars refused to shine, the moon to light The deep seclusion where the Master strayed. Alone he suffered, while his soul was swayed With throes of pain endured for truth and right. Our minds retire, night hides from us the sight Of God's blest Son by wicked man betrayed. And O, our Father ! bend thy listening ear When we to our Gethsemane retire, We agonize, we bow in reverent fear, Or satisfy our longing and desire. And in these hours send angel helpers near, To lift our stricken souls to regions higher. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
