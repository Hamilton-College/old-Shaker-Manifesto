Enfield, N. H. Aug. 12. As the question presents itself, what can we say for this month, (and the months march on with greater rapidity, than before we engaged in this enterprise,) the answer comes, Write, or rather attempt to write our thanks, to the good people of Mt. Lebanon, for sparing from their ranks, the lovely souls who have recently sojourned with us. So we formally, but sincerely tender our thanks to the household that sent out these ministers of blessing, as added burden must have been borne by other willing hands in their absence. Words can never tell the amount of good such angel visits accomplish, and every time we are thus blessed, we question afresh, why must they be so 'few and far between?' On Aug 1st. we had the nearest approach to a cyclone, which the people in ti.is vicinity ever witnessed, and although pea vines, which our faithful brother Simeon Childs, had spread before the kitchen piazza fo dry, were the only things that were lifted bodily, we were perfectly satisfied, not to experience a full blown one: clouds of dust filled the air at intervals before the rain fall which came in torrents at first, but subsided into a refreshing summer shower, that brightened the face of nature wonderfully. Br. Thomas Stedman who ought to be authority in the hay line, reports the harvest one third less than usual in quantity, but superior in quality. Cereals a failure. On Aug. 6 th. the Anniversary of our Mother's landing ï¿½n American soil, the sisterhood of our Society enjoyed a profitable meeting, indeed, the spirit of these gatherings, can never be placed upon paper, but the pure, hallowed influence realized therefrom, is a power for good, and we believe every effort to bear the standard high, is recorded by angel messengers. We sang '' God's Love is at the Helm, ' in unison with our dear sisters elsewhere, thanks to the author of this suggestion. E. B.
