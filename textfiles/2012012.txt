SELF-ATONEMENT. Sophia Wayne. O ye who rail at self-atoning faith, And all your burden on another cast, How will you feel, when in the hour of death, Self-condemnation judges you at last? Mistaken ones! atonement must begin Within the soul, now. e'en this very hour, No one should put it off and live in sin, And then depend upon another's power. T'.iis is the season that the world calls Lent, When all, religion's holy vows renew, ind think of him, who into exile went To make a self-atonement deep and true. The law of Moses ancient Israel blest. And they who faithfully its rites obeyed Brought to the temple of the Lord, the best; Gifts of atonement on the Altar laid. And what did faithful Abraham of old When he went forth to sacrifice his son? He offered his best treasure we are told, A life he loved far better than his own. But some depend upon another's power, And feel secure to live in vanity; The clergy tell us, in the latest hour, 'The Savior's grace sufficient isforthee.' But while these doctrines, ministers will teach, We ask if Christ such sentiment approves; Or would he bless the worldly creeds they preach, Which bring no change of heart, nor sin remove? We see them live in pride and fashion's style, Then think of the humility they teach, And as we hear, remember all the while, They do not even practice what they preach. Yet some look up to them as the elect� The embodiment of all that's good and pure;� They pay large salaries, and thus expect The greatest bliss in heaven to secure. When ministers, the Christ example set, With truth eternal, feed their chosen flock, Then shall our spiritneedsbe met [rock. With living springs from revelation's Baltston, N, �,, Feb. 19.
