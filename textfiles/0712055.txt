Mistakes in managing horses... Mistakes in managing horses, even when fan apparently trivial nature, are often the ause of much needless suffering and permanent injury. Of these a fewr that are common ust about this time are : bathing the feet of iorses to cool them off when heated by hard work; watering them immediately after meals when about to start on a journey, instead of vaiting a while, or letting them drink before eeding; giving them, through mistaken kindness, an extra feed before driving them at a apid pace, and so forcing them to travel on an overloaded stomach; starting to fair or market at a swinging trot, while the animals are fresh and full of feed, instead of letting ;hem settle slowly down to their work; and cruelly omitting to cover them when heated after a rapid drive, and so exposing them to much suffering while the reckless driver is enjoying himself.â€”Rural, N.
