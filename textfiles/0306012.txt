Every good desire and feeling... Every good desire and feeling, whether uttered or unexpressed, is prayer. It is converse and communion with unseen guardian friends by which we are spiritually educated, and we feel a tranquillity while in this element that the tumultuous waves of passion cannot reach, for our hearts, through prayer, are lifted into angel spheres.
