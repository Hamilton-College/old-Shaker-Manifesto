Plain Talk from a Public Paper The diversion of thought and energy toward these dreams of a king coming in the clouds is a waste of spiritual force which the community cannot afford. The community just at this time needs all the service the Church can give in training men in fidelity to their duties here and now. The sober fact that should force itself on religious men is that the churches have largely failed in training their members in the virtues which are most essential to a society like ours. . . The hard fact which every week's news bring home, is that church membership is no guarantee that a man is faithful in public life or upright in business. But it ought to be. The Church is bound to show that it does not hold devotedness and liberality to be in any sort substitutes for integrity. Its teach- ers are bound to preach honesty and faithfulness, not merely in general propositions, but in practical, searching demands. What does honesty require of a salesman? How far ought one to consider his customer's interest in a bargain? Does a man owe his creditors anything beyond what the law will exact? What are the moral obligations of a holder of trust funds? How far are the accepted methods in politics consistent with high prin- ciple? These are the things the ministers should concern themselves and their hearers with, for these are matters of daily duty,â€” vital if Christ were coming to-morrow, vital if He should never come at all among clouds and angels.
