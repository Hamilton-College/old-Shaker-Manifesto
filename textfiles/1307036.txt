Sheepskin Mats. Wash while fresh in strong soapsuds, first picking from the wool all the dirt that wilt come out. A little kerosene, a tablespoonful to three gallons of water, will aid in removing the impurities. Continue to wash the skin in fresh suds till it is white and clean. Then dissolve a half pound each of salt and alum in three pints of boiling water, put into it water enough to cover the skin, which should soak in the solution twelve hours, and then be hung on a line to drain. When nearly dry nail it, wool side in, on a board, or the side of a barn to dry. Rub into the skin an ounce each of pulverized alum and saltpetre, and if the skin is large double the quantity. Rub ior an hour or two. Fold the skin sides together, and hang the skin away for three days, rubbing it every day or till perfectly dry. Then with a blunt knife clear the skin of impurities, rub it with pumice or rottenstone, trim it into shape, and you have a door mat that will last a lifetime. If it is to be dyed, have a shallow vessel as large as the skin in which to prepare the dye, so that the skin can be laid wool-side down smoothly into the vessel that all parts may be equally immersed in the dye. This should not be more than an inch deep, otherwise the skin might be injured by the hot dye. After coloring again stretch the skin to dry, and then comb with a wool or cotton card.â€”For 'D.'
