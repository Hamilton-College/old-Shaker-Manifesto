A MOTHER OF CRIMINALS Some of the most curious and remarkable criminal statistics ever obtained have just been given to the public by Dr. Harris of New York. His attention was called, some time since, to a county on the upper Hudson which showed a remarkable proportion of crime and poverty to the whole population—480 of its 40,000 inhabitants being in the alms-house — and, upon looking into the records a little, he found certain names continually appearing. Becoming interested in the subject, he concluded to search the genealogies of these families, and after a thorough investigation he discovered that from a young girl named 'Margaret'—who was left adrift, nobody remembers how, in a village of the county, 70years ago, and, in the absence of an alms-house, was left to grow up as best she could —have descended two hundred criminals. As an illustration of this remarkable record, in one single generation of her unhappy line there were twenty children ; of these, three died in infancy, and seventeen survived to maturity. Of the seventeen, nine served in the State prisons for high crimes an aggregate term of fifty years, while the others were frequent inmates of jails and penitentiaries and alms-houses. The whole number of this girl's descendants, through six generations, is nine hundred, and besides the two hundred who are on record as criminals, a large number have been idiots, imbeciles, drunkards, lunatics, prostitutes and paupers. A stronger argument for careful treatment of pauper children than these figures could hardly be found.
