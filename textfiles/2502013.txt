Shakers, N. Y. Second Family. Jan. 1895. We are experiencing snug winter weather, with the thermometer around the zero point: 14 below was the coldest. We are busy securing our supply of wood for next winter. Sleighing has been poor. We felt a slight shock of earthquake Dec. 17th between the hours of 3 and 4 a. m. The writer and several others were awakened from slumber by the rattling of doors and windows, and could not imagine what was the cause. It was felt, we learn, in different parts of the state, although our neighboring city Albany doubted the report. Christmas, the Society met for worship at our family, and we enjoyed a spiritual feast. In the evening all the young people were invited by the Church family to share with them a social entertainment prepared for the occasion. It consisted of singing and speaking, with refreshments at the close. Many that were older turned the dial of time back to youth, and graced the occasion with their presence. All were well pleased and each performed the part allotted, well. New Year's eve, we returned the compliment and invited all to come and enjoy a similar entertainment, which our young Sisters and children had planned. We had singing and speaking. All had learned their pieces, and spoke them well without any hesitation, very much to their credit. We enjoyed the entertainment; and the last act was not t'se least, refreshments, not winebut pure lemon-juice from Florida, with cake. We also had a surprise to find numbered in our midst Beloved Elder Joseph Holden. So in blessing we were blest. Isaac Anxtatt. North Family. Jan. 1895. The festive seasons of Christmas and New Years are past and we are introduced to the varied panorama of the new year. Christmas was observed by a Society meeting at the Second family at 10 o'clock a. in. Many good and earnest thoughts were expressed and resolutions to obey more faithfully the inner light that is calling higher, and we felt the presence of that cloud of witnesses which attend the Pentecostal season. It was an hour of holy communion. In the evening a social entertainment was given at the Church family in which the Society was well represented. This included dialogues, poems, and original essays in which the youth and children took part with great credit. 42 THE MANIFESTO. The following is the programme; Opening Address. 'The Purest Pearl.' 'Playing at School.' 'Guilty or not Guilty.' 'The Three Wishes,' or 'Visit to Fairyland.' 'Why do you Fear?' 'The Happy Child.' 'An Address to the Young.' 'Voice of Silence.'

We were favored with the company of our Beloved Elder Joseph Holden who at the close gave a very instructive address, followed by remarks from different Elders bearing upon our duty the coming year. The counsel fell upon good soil and time will show that it has borne fruit. Our fine, mild winter was rudely broken on the 27th ult. when we had almost a foot of snow with heavy winds. On the morning of the 28th the mercury registered 8 deg. below zero. Hamilton DeGraiv.
