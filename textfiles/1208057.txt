Value of Refuse. The value of the refuse of the starch and glucose factories for feeding cows is about half that of corn-meal when it is dry; but as it contains a large portion of water—90 per cent.—the estimated value is only 15 cents per 100 pounds. When it has been partly dried its value is proportionately increased. The starch has been nearly nil taken out of the corn-meal and the gluten left. It is an excellent food for producing milk on account of the albumen it contains, and which is similar in composition to the casein of milk, or rather that one is changeable into the other in the animal system.
