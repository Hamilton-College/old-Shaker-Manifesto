I want the day to come when women will vote... Bishop Simpson said: ' I want the day to come when women will vote. Without their vote I fear we will never be able to put down the houses of infamy and liquor saloons of our country. Nothing is so ruinous to the country, it is true, and it is my opinion that we can't get along without women voting.'
