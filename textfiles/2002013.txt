Dr. Caroline B. Winslow of Washington, D. C., very kindly writes us... Dr. Caroline B, Winslow of Washington, D. C, very kindly writes us,�'I am deep in the 'Precepts and Testimonies of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders.' I am nearly through the book and deeply interested. Poor woman, how terribly she was persecuted and what sufferings she endured for truth and righteousness sake. It strikes to my heart�I feel that she suffered for me. For without her faithful testimony I never could have pursued my Alpha work openly and boldly for thirteen years. How much I owe to her Godly inspiration and her steadfast faith and courage. How the world hates any truth that rebukes its secret sins ! I have had a taste of its persecuting spirit, enough to know its bitterness and its cruelty�But oh, my sufferings were not a flea-bite, to what that blessed woman endured. I know something of the power of the Spirit of God, for I have had experiences. I believe every word of the record I am reading. Tell Eldresses J- - - - - - and D- - - - - - that this blessed book, their gift, will cause me to do more and better work, as the fruit of Mother Ann's sufferings and tribulations. She was the first inspired woman to preach that all sin and defilement must be purged from the heart, before we can enter into our Eternal inheritance; and lust is the deepest and most damning sin of all. Let us praise God continually for his mercies.' Lovingly Yours, C. B. Winslow.
