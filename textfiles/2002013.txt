Correspondence. Beloved Eldress J--;--To-day, I have been looking backward... Enfield, N. H. Dec. 25, 1889. Beloved Eldress J� ;�To-day, I have been lookiug backward, counting the milestones I have passed, and trying to forecast the horoscope of the future. As we take these glances, how small the trials of life appear ; and how unsatisfactory is the recollection of the moments spent in those shady arbors where we tarried to cull the flowers of self-pleasure and folly, unmindful of the demands of our gospel call. 1 do uot believe in needlet-sly regretting misspent hours, but find it profitable frequently to recall my own failures, that I may have charity for those who, perchance, may find themselves on the edge of the flower-crowned chasm and have uot even the power of resistance that I possessed. Is not this one of the purposes of life that out of our own strength or weakness, we gather that which serves some other life? Thus in part fulfill our mission. As we are not called to bear the burdens of those on the natural plane, should not all our strength be given in support of the higher life? I would rather be known as one who stoops to raise the fallen, than to belong to the class whose attitude is, 'Stand by thyself, come not near to me for I am holier than thou.' Dear Eldress J� I send you these rambling thoughts, knowing that you will read between the lines and there find that my courage is strong, my purpose true, to endure the testing and honor Z;on, as I have been favored to be one of her inmates. 1 enclose love and kindly greetings for yourself and Order. May the blessings of the Christmas-tide and the joys of a happy New Year be yours to a fuluess. Lovingly, Your Sister, Mary Basford. My Dear Sister M--:--I was most agreeably surprised with... East Canterbury, N. H., Jan. 1, 1890. My Dear Sister M- - - - - -:�I was most agreeably surprised with the reception of your good and interesting Christmas letter which came duly to hand. Good, because of the kindly impulse which prompted a si.-stcr's greeting to tin.- absent�interesting, as I traced through every line, the comprehension ami consequent appreciation of tlie gospel graces, so essentially requisite to all who are aiming toward the perfection of a Christian character. The proper development and symmetrical giowth of mind, from the plane of nature into the spiritual atmosphere of light and love, has ever been one of peculiar interest to me. Th're are many stepping stones by which the height attained can be correctly measured ; and when the eminence is gained, even above one selfish inclination, by obedience to the effective principle, which underlies all patient effort, we are thankful to give the honor due. So with 'Hope the anchor cast within the vail,' Faith combined with living works, Charity or Love, the greatest gift of all constitutes the mainspring which coutrols the life purpose. Whoever is blest with this incentive, paying no more tribute to worldly honor, approbation or pleasure, cannot fail in duty. Their success is insured. This power can only be gained by culture ; and as one writer aptly expresses it, 'There is nothing by which culture cau be wrought out and made effective, except practice. And practice, though the steps be slow, can lead us to the accomplishment of almost anything.' Then let us keep the soil of our hearts uuder such cultivation, enriched by our life experiences that we. can say with the poet, 'My mind to me a kingdom is.' This royal kingdom even a peasant may inherit. Now my dear M� wishing you all the happiness that the New Year can bring, and who can estimate its possibilities, by the fulfillment of the beautiful promise conveyed in your letter, I close with the united love arid thanks of our Order, for the entire household in our Valley Home. Kindly, Your Sister, J. J. Kaime. Dr. Caroline B. Winslow of Washington, D. C., very kindly writes us... Dr. Caroline B, Winslow of Washington, D. C, very kindly writes us,�'I am deep in the 'Precepts and Testimonies of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders.' I am nearly through the book and deeply interested. Poor woman, how terribly she was persecuted and what sufferings she endured for truth and righteousness sake. It strikes to my heart�I feel that she suffered for me. For without her faithful testimony I never could have pursued my Alpha work openly and boldly for thirteen years. How much I owe to her Godly inspiration and her steadfast faith and courage. How the world hates any truth that rebukes its secret sins ! I have had a taste of its persecuting spirit, enough to know its bitterness and its cruelty�But oh, my sufferings were not a flea-bite, to what that blessed woman endured. I know something of the power of the Spirit of God, for I have had experiences. I believe every word of the record I am reading. Tell Eldresses J- - - - - - and D- - - - - - that this blessed book, their gift, will cause me to do more and better work, as the fruit of Mother Ann's sufferings and tribulations. She was the first inspired woman to preach that all sin and defilement must be purged from the heart, before we can enter into our Eternal inheritance; and lust is the deepest and most damning sin of all. Let us praise God continually for his mercies.' Lovingly Yours, C. B. Winslow.
