The Ladies' Home Journal If we desire children to be courteous we must treat them with respect, says Klizabeth Scovii in The Ladies' Home Journal. They will infallibly copy our manner? ; so we must take care that they are the bestLet us be as careful of their feelings as we wish them to be of those of others. When it is necessary to administer reproof, let it be given in private. Many children are very sensitive on this point, and they feel acute, although they cannot put their emotions with words. To tell a child in public that it has been rude, or lacking in good breeding, is as unwarrantable as it would be to tell a guest so. It is no excuse to say that we are trying to teach it to do better; we (�:�-. do tiis with greater effect if we take � it aside at ti.e first convenient moment and gently point out where the error was, and what should be done the next time. New England Magazine One of the most interesting articles in the November magazines is Frank B. Sanborn's, 'The Home and Haunts of Lowell,' in the New England Magazine. Mr. Sanborn was for many years an intimate friend of Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, and Lowell, and he possesses a knowledge of the men which those who read their books can never attain. The personal element in this article is charming. The illustrations from pencil and pen and ink sketches made on the spot by Sears, Gallagher and William Goodrich. Beal add. to the attraction of the article. .

Frederick Bly, the blind phrenologist, well known thirty-five years ago, follows: Lines of Beauty is a classical study in the physiognomical line. Illustrated. The Fifth Prize Essay is by a lady known up in Maine for editoral capacity, and is a very readable sketch of experience and observations that will give the reader much useful information. Identity and Imitation. Practical Mental Science in Education is a well written article for skeptics to ponder. The Essential of Early Education is from the pen of an eminent teacher, and in the same department the Journal's English correspondent, Jennie Chappell, pleasantly describes a very well managed nursery and child's hospital in London. The always welcome, because well furnished Health Department has its full complement of practical suggestions. Common Sins Against Health is by the author of The Talent of Motherhood, an article that received not a little attention a few months ago, and Father Kneipp's System of Cure tells of a famous Bavarian Sanitarian. A good paper, Is Hypnotism Harmful? comes from a subject of thirteen years' experience and is unique in its way. The editor discusses somewhat ironically That Criminal Type that some scientists are trying to create, and also Convict Labor and Mutual Life Benefit Associations. Price of the number, 15 cents.
