LAWYERS AND DOCTORS A litigation once arose in- the university of Cambridge, whether doctors in law or doctors in medicine should hold precedence. The chancelor asked whether the thief or the hangman preceded at the execution, and on being told that the thief usually took the lead, 'Well then' 'let the doctors of the law have the precedence, and let the doctors in medicine be next in rank.'
