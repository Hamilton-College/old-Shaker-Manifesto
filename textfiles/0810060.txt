HOME TOPICS Parched Rice — We have used parched rice in hot weather to check bowel complaints, and find it very effectual. • Parch till well done, and then boil it in water for half an hour. Eat then slowly, and it will check the most violent diarrhoea. It is a good diet with boiled milk, in case of flux.
