PREACHING. Francis of Assissi once stepped down into the cloisters of bis monastery, and laying his hand on the shoulder of a young monk, said: 'Brother, let us go down into the town and preach.' So they went forth, the venerable father and the young man, conversing as they went. They wound thuir way down the principal streets, round the lowly alleys and lanes, and even to the outskirts of the town, and to the village beyond, till they found themselves back at the monastery again. Then said the young monk, 'Father, when shall we begin to preach?' And the father looked kindly down upon his son, and said : 'My child, we have been preaching; we were preaching while we were walking. We have been seen, looked at; our behavior has been remarked; and so we have delivered a morning sermon. Ah! my son, it is of no use that we walk anywhere to preach. unless we preach as we walk.'
