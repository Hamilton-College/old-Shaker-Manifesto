Dear Sister:--We received yours... Providence, R. I. May, 1894. [Beloved Editob;Please favor the publication of the following letter. Having been recently received from one who is in spirit a Brother with us, we think it may do good to others, who maybe persuaded to 'do likewise.'] Dear Sister :We received yours, which brought joy and blessing with it, as it was full and laden with good things. We were glad to receive so large a letter with such extended friendship, for it came from and covered the whole family. These remittances are like 'angel visits' to our home ; they bring with them blessing and cheer. It would be useless for me to attempt to frame one to equal it, but if we do our best, that is all we can do and all that is required of us. You have had years of experience in the Christ life and have traveled farther in the way, for we have only just started on the heavenly journey, barely left the shore, and we have had to 'lay aside every weight' that beset us. How great the load, and how sharp the briers that pierce our feet! My Sister, we were steeped in sin, for it was years we traveled therein, when we thought we were in the right way ; and to 'come out from among them,' and walk in the shadow of the cross, seemed to be more than we could do. But a careful and prayerful stepping has enabled us to reach thus far. We used to sing when in the Salvation Army, 'I have been in the Army so long, and have not grown weary yet,' but when the new light of higher truth broke into our soul, we soon found we did, for we became so tired, the way seemed so strait to us, yet our souls longed for more of Christ. Having now tasted and learned that the Lord is good, we find ourselves in water that we can THE MANIFESTO. 181 not wade in. We must swim or fall back into the old nature, which we pray may never be the case. Give our love to all the Brethren and Sisters. The advancement we have made has been due to the untiring efforts of our true friends at East Canterbury. We shall never be able to recompense them, but our Heavenly Father will do this in full measure, we know. The times remain about the same, but God has blest our home, in our souls and also in our 'basket and store.' We have been blest with all things needful through the long winter, and G-od will not forsake us. That we do know. Our kind love ever. Your Brother, Wm. Elam.
