PETITION Lord, give me power myself to know ; I seek not earth's delusive show, But all I ask, while here below, Is what the Gospel gives me. Inspire my heart with love supreme, That flows from Zion's living stream, Whose virtues will my soul redeem, Of every fault relieve me. Though friends should fail, or foes betray, There's light enough in this pure way To lead my soul to realms of day, And thither I'll be going. I'll brave the breakers, stem the tide, Though billows rise on every side ; Iti God's sure promise I'll confide, While boist'rous winds are blowing. O God of heaven, hear my prayer, And let me rest beneath thy care, My soul from judgment never spare, Let holy Angels guide me. Assist me to be just and true In all I say, and all I do ; Each day my vows to thee renew, Whatever may betide me. O, help my soul to stand the test Of this pare Gospel's high behest, That I may be by angels blest For every good endeavor. O, grant me wisdom, strength, and power, To guard my spirit every hour, To toil in sunshine, shade and shower, To keep the truth forever. O holy Saviour, pure and just, Thy sacred name I love and trust; To follow thee, I know I must Accept each gift that's given. Thy soul redeeming power I crave, To bear me o'er life's rolling wave, As Peter cried, O Lord, do save, And guide me on to heaven. Earth's children find a vale of tears, But Virtue's pathway bright appears : It leads the soul to higher spheres, Where flows life's healing river. O, there with myriad saints I'll be, Adorn'd with virgin purity; And there, to all eternity, Bless God the boui.dless Giver. Harriet F. Chamberlain, Pleasant Hill, Ky.
