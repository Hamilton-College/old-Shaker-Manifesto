Elder Frederick : Respected Sir.—Although it is about two years since I left your family... New York City, July 5th, 1879 G. B. Elder Frederick : Respected Sir.—Although it is about two years since I left your family, after a short experience, I have never changed my Shaker faith. I feel assured if you had understood my motives you would never have written me such a severe letter to Oneida. I had known nothing of Oneida or her community until informed by one of your family. He told me he did not know the principles, but heard they were a good people. As I had felt that your separating me from my wife was more than was actually necessary, I determined, while settling my affairs, to investigate Oneida. I did so, and found principles to which I would never desire to be reconciled. Before I could see you and endeavor to pray you to allow me some concessions, you wrote me to take away my wife. I have conversed with many Shakers since, who all gave me words of consolation and wisdom. They tell me, with my belief and convictions, there is no reason why my wife Frances and myself should not become * members of a Shaker community. I understood from them, that a family, man and wife, professing Shakerism, could be taken by a community without separating them— allowing them to live in the same house together, providing they abstain from carnal pleasures, or sexual gratification. Dear Elder Frederick, Frances and myself view each other with a pure unsullied love. We are willing to abstain from sexual and other indulgences. We think we have the energy and ability to make ourselves good Shakers. Frances staid with you long enough to prove her willingness to work. We believe in Shakerism. We respect you as a father. Why will you not save us from the temptations and vileness of this world ? Two years ago I was disgusted with the wickedness of the world's people, and my disgust increases as I live. Frances and myself have now been united for some years. We agree that we are a happy couple, and do not feel justified at present in separating. We want to live a pure, good life together, and the only place to do so, that I know of, is a Shaker community. Dear Elder, I never felt in my life as I did when you placed your hand on my head, and said : ' George, we will endeavor to live a just and good life together.' Frances and myself want to do what is right. In our opinion, that means to be Shakers, but we fail to interpret the bible requiring us to separate ourselves from each other. I cannot write just what I mean, but would be happy to come to Mt. Lebanon and see you, providing you might give me some encouragement that we might become members of community without separating. Knowing your boundless virtue, I hope you will write me a favorable letter of advice and consolation. Yours, respectfully,
