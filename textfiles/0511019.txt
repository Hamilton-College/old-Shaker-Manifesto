Theodore Parker — one of the most fearless thinkers of the age — is reported assaying : 'There is not now a path, where men walk with ease and safety, which has not been worn smooth, from cragged rock, by the bare and bleeding feet of martyrs.' Such has been the method of all human progress. And such it always must be. As humanity has'not yet ascended to the top of the hill, there remains still abundant field for the exercise of that laudable ambition which prompts noble souls to devote themselves to the cause of humanity. Whoever, in this age of the world, devotes him, or herself, uncompromisingly to a life of virtue and usefulness, is no less a martyr —than they, who in more barbarous ages, went to the stake, or the chopping block.
