OUR WANT OF FAITH JOHN L. MORRISON When skies are clear and winds are fair, And flowers bloom, and fields declare The bounties of a fruitful year; Tis then without one doubt or fear, We trust in God.. But let the clouds in anger frown, Torrents of rain come pouring down, . That harvest fruits may be despoiled, For which we've watched and cared and toiled, And then we faint. We cannot penetrate the gloom, Our faith all dies, and there's no room For hope ; so in despondency We sit and brood, and fail to see The hand of God. 'Tis often thus along life's road, If we're compelled to bear a load, Forget the blessings of the past, Because they will not always last, And fret for more. If we could but remove the veil, When sorrow doth our hearts assail, And see how near the Master stands, Still guiding with his loving hands, We'd never doubt, But sing amidst the deepest grief. His hand will bring us sweet relief From all our sad, distressing woes, Deceitful friends and deadly foes, And guide us home.
