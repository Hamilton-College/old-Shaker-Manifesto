South. Union, Ky. Oct. 1894. Autumn is here with its soft, mellow light, and gorgeous coloring of russet and brown, yellow and scarlet, emerald and crimson, all so richly blending in one harmonious whole. The yellow corn will soon be ready for the crib and the baldwin, pippin and gennet apples are ready to be gathered, to be THE MANIFESTO. 265 canned, dryed or stored away for winter use. We have some good Brethren and would appreciate more. The farm hands are drilling in the wheat. The first two weeks in October, is the best time to sow it, in this climate. The little ridges and furrows that run across the level of a hundred acre field, looks very pretty to the eye. Then to think of how the little grains of amber-colored wheat that are dropped so regularly in the ground by the drill-mill, first through the chemic force of heat and moisture burst its hard covering and start a little rootlet in the ground and then a little stem upwards for light and air; then comes the stalk and blade and full grown grain ready for the harvest. We had a picnic in the woods the past summer. The place was one within easy reach of home so that the young and old enjoyed the recreation of a day. We went also to the County Fair and to the dedication of a Methodist Church which bordered on our own lands. James Carr.
