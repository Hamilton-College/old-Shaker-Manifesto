THE LANGUAGE OF BELIEVERS. One language Believers in union proclaim, That Christ in his kingdom, in triumph does reign, And in true Believers his glory displays, As prophets predicted in primitive days. The substance, predicted by figures and signs, lias drawn the attention of all the divines; And many have labored with earnest desire, And looked for a kingdom that's revealed by fire. The time has expired, the book is unsealed, The kingdom to thousands is truly revealed, And many, like gold in the furnace, are tried, And brought into union with Christ and his Bride. These two were anointed and suffered on earth, And travailed in union, and found the new birth; They conquered the evil which Satan devised, And firmly established the Kingdom of Christ. The language of all in the Kingdom is one, And by it are faithful Believers well known, Xor can a deceiver, though many have tried, Dissemble the voice of the Bridegroom and Bride. The true gospel language cannot be expressed, But by the Believer, by whom 'tis possessed, 'Tis spirit and life, and can only be known By such as have gained it, and made it their own. When infinite Wisdom unfolded her plan, Then Christ in his glory revealed it to man, Here man by obedience, salvation obtains; And this is the language on Mount Zion's plains. Now 'ell me, ye learned, ye noble and wise, What natural wisdom could ever devise A plan so effective, and bring it to view, To slay the old man, and give life to the new? The work is effected, the Kingdom's begun, And in it the language and spirit are one; We bless the great work, and we own the first cause Which gave to Mount Zion her language and laws.
