We should be exceedingly slow to conceive of God as having a body... We should be exceedingly slow to conceive of God as having a body ; we should beware of any imagination that anchors Him down to a spot, or that makes Him a kind of colossal man. In the earlier stages of our Christian experience it may help us to conceive of God as on a throne, like a king, and having a human figure ; but the prayer and wish of a Christian, and the tendency of Christian growth, should be toward deliverance from such childish conceptions of Deity, and to have an idea like to Stephen's, that God is not body but Spirit, that heaven is not a big house or palace with a monstrous throne and an outlying city of splendor round about it, but that God is the universal and all-pervading fashion, and habit, and energy of it. â€” W. H. H. Murray
