BELIEVE AND TRUST S. C. HALL BY A childless widow, seemingly forsaken, Gave words to wrathâ€”rebellious, fierce, and wild; Wrath that the gift The Giver gave was taken ; And would not pardon God who took her child. She had a wakening-vision, saw a band Of happy children; there she knew her boy; Each held a lighted lamp in his young hand ; And, as they passed, each sang a hymn of joyAll but one mournful child, hu solemn tread,* And face, were gloom ; his lamp, it had no light; When, sobbing through her tears, the mother said 'How comes it, dear, your lamp is dark as night ? ' ' Mother !' he said, 'you, mother, make me sad, Your tears put out my lamp; and stay my voice; I must be mournful when I would be glad, And silent when, in soul, 1 should rejoice.' ' Up rose the mother from her knees, and smiled ; Her sobs were stilled ; of tears remained none; As, bending low, her head towards her child, She clasped her hands and said ' His WILL BE DONE.' Out burst the lamp, with a wide-spreading light ! 1 b Out burst from all that group, a joyful hymn ! 'Twas a change to perfect day from night, When heard and echoed by the Seraphim.
