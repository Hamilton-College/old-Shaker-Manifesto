The Christ's Gospel brought was love and peace... The word Christ's Gospel brought was love and peace, A reconciling word to sinful men ; That they from enmity and strife should cease, And as one family should dwell again. But, still estranged, behold the nations stand ! While over Europe hangs the cloud of war, Which but of late made desolate our land, But now in mercy driven from us afar. But still do enmity and hate remain, One nation still we are, but not one race; From human limbs have fallen slavery's chain; When from the mind shall vanish, too, its trace, And in our hearts truth's glorious power be known, And self, and sin, and hate be overthrown ?
