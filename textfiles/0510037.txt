FOR YOUTH The 'evil days (alone) come nigh,' When youth has beep in folly spent; For riper years will bring the sigh, Hearts must o'er wasted time repent. Dark clouds will ever be too small To dim the blessed light of God From those who humbly give their all. To walk the path the Saviour trod. As much as fruit exceeds the flower, Maturity is more than youth, In excellence of strength and power, When souls are nurtured in the truth. Mary Whitcher, Canterbury, N. H.
