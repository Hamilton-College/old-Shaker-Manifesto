THE SHAKER REMEDY AM. SOCIALIST One of the editors of the Albany Morning Express, has visited Mt. Lebanon and held conferences with Elder Frederick W. Evans. When the editor asked the Elder to propose a remedy for the political disease 'which threatens the very life of the nation,' the latter said : 'In all seriousness, I ask you to look at the material laws and lives of Shakerdom. Here is a village of several hundred people. For fifty or a hundred years wre have lived here, prosperous, contented, happy. We have tilled the land, and year after year put back upon it that which necessity and comfort did not require. Now it blooms like the fairest garden During all these years of our existence, we hav never spent a penny for police, for lawyers, fo judges, for poorhouses, for penal institutions, or any of the other 'improvements' of the outside world We have our quarrels, our differences, our ambi tions, like other men, but we settle them in a loving brotherly manner, by gentle arbitration, by cruci fixion of the spirit and unselfishness. Therefore, w find police, courts of law, and jails, not only useless but degrading. We never have used them, and wit God's help, never shall. But we claim to be no be ter than other men or women. Not a bit. We ar just the same as^ny other six hundred you will fine in any part of the country. What we claim is, tha our system is better; and it is that which gives u content, prosperity, happiness. If, then, this villag of six hundred can exist for a century in peace anc plenty, why can not any other village of six hundrec any town of six thousand, any city of six hundrec thousand? We have demonstrated it to be possible, and what are we better than any other men?'
