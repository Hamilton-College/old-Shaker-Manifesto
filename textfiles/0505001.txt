Child thought they had a 'fee simple' on spiritualism and the Katie King 'business,' but it has slipped through their fingers. That there has been humbugging is doubtlessly true, but it turns out favorable to the mediums, the Holmes ; for Owen and Childs have been humbugged to believe that they had been humbugged. Let them and the public get their lessons out of it and be ready to move on to the next ' beat in the bar.' Kingdom of Heaven
