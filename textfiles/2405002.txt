Spoken in the Church at East Canterbury, N. H. by Elder William Wilson of Enfield, N. H. Feb. 17, 1894. 'VTTHEN I was eight years of age, I received faith in Jesus as the SavVV ior, and at twelve years, became impressed with the mission of the Christ spirit, with which Jesus was baptized. At fifteen, I received faith in Mother Ann Lee, as being an instrument in God's hand, through whom, the second manifestation of Christ upon earth was revealed. Though I never had particular belief in woman's rights, I was convinced that she was the first to assert the right of woman to all the offices and privileges of man in the New Creation. I searched ancient, ecclesiastical history, beside more modern works, in order to convince myself that I had made no mistake. As the result of all this research, questioning and prayer, I found that I was not mistaken, and from that time forward, have done all in my power to uphold the life and testimony of our Mother. Since this revelation, many women have stepped forward to assert their rights in governmental as well as social life. It is my firm belief that the light which has directed them in their noble work of redeeming woman from the tyranny of the flesh, proceeded from the divine revelation and the righteous example of Ann Lee and her followers. Through this revelation, the Shaker Church was established in perfect order. It is based upon the principles of Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ and 108 THE MANIFESTO. Mother Ann ; here, woman is made equal with her brothers in all the relations and regulations of the Community. I also believe that the light and power of this revelation, will go out to the world and cause many souls to accept the gospel, leading them to renounce a life of bondage to come into the freedom of a spiritual life. We read,�'They that are accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection, neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.' The clause,�'as the angels of God in heaven,' impressed me much as a youth, and in order to become one of this number, I renounced the life and relations of the world and joined in spirit as well ss in body, the company who lived the virgin life. There has been a peculiar ministration which has followed me all my life, which I am confident, has proved a saving power. Often, when taking a false step, it has arrested my attention with these words,�'William, you are wrong, go no farther,' and obeying this admonition, I was led in the path of right and dut}'. From early days, I have found it safe and have established as a principle in my mind, to seek counsel of those godly persons who are able to guide me aright. Having proved the benefit of following their advice, I can recommend the same course to the youthful and inexperienced. All souls may not be able to accept a call to the Higher Life, in time, they live too near the animal plane to appreciate the joys found in a selfdenying life. This having been my call, Brethren and Sisters, I will with you, through all time, be a consecrated worker for Zion and her interests.
