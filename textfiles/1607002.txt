SHAKER SPIRITUALISM. No. 2. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. Fifty three years after Ann Lee's translation, her spirit, and the spirits of her comrades and successors in the ministry, returned to her disciples in the body in a special and continuous ministration of four years duration, not only to bless, encourage and comfort them for sacrifices made, and for steadfast integrity in obedience to faith, but to baptize the younger class raised among them, with a like faith and spiritual understanding of the work of God in this day. This work, which was marvelous and strange, the like of which we had never heard before, a soul refining, rectifying work, in which the most holy purified themselves still more, they fully accomplished iu all the* branches of our communion, as mamliving witnesses can testify. This was followed in 1843 and 4, by an extra^dinary visitation and manifestation through the living bodies of the Brethren and Sisters, of spirits of the departed of all nations, of every rank and description, comprising the learned and unlearned, celebrated and obscure, civilized and barbarian, rulers and ruled, the just and unjust, no partiality being shown. It seemed for a time as though Hades was breaking up and pouring its dead back into this world to be quickened into the resurrection of the judgment. For we were told from a high spiritual source, that those spirits were sent to us, to be taught the gospel�the ' everlasting gospel of the hour of Judgment, which we proclaim.' JRev. xiv., C, 7. Many were faithful to do this, for �which spirits manifested their gratitude in succeeding visits. In 1848, one speaking in the name of Mother Ann in a meeting of the first family at Mount Lebanon, said that her work at that time, called her to leave us, and she was going to prepare the way, that souls may be in preparation to receive the gospel when the Lord's time shall come to gather His harvest. Again, after bestowing her blessing upon all, she said 'I must leave you and I know not when I shall return * * * I must leave those who love me and go where I am not wanted, an^. stay with those who do not own nor love me. When I am gone you must remember and pray to God for me, and I will pray for you. ' We have no desire in this matter to -exalt a personality, but to invite attention to the movement of which that personality was the center, and to ask the wise and thoughtful to consider whether it be not the same power and intelligence which raised up and supported Aon Lee and her disciples, as instruments of good to mankind for a century past, that is now directing and controlling the phenomena of spiritualism. Both movements are despised and feared by the world, which shows that they are not of the world, for doth not the world love its own ? Both are in their infancy though one has somewhat the start of the other,' and it can be no more intended for them to remain so, than that a child should always remain a child. Of all professedly religious bodies, the writer believes that the disciples of Ann, 'the remnant of the woman's seed who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ, are the only ones that have from the beginning extended a fraternal sympathy to spiritualists, and the only body also whose doctrinal teachings of man's relation to God, to the spirit world, and of progressive spiritual unfoldment, do not conflict with the facts and fundamental principles made known to the common mind by spiritualism. The Order of the United Believers in Christ's second appearing, is itself a revelation of the Order of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, and its members are built up and nourished in continual growth by spiritual gifts. That part of Ann's testimony relating to her intercourse with spiritual beings, and knowledge of conditions in the spirit world, was less verifiable and less likely to gain credit with unbelievers fifty years ago, than her teachings of morality, and the practical duties of life. Because there was at that time such dense ignorance on this subject, and so little phenomena of the kind currently believed in, with which it could be compared, or to which it bore analogy, that such as partook of that character was judged to be so much the effect of phantasy and superstition, that only feeble, diseased, or untaught minds were supposed to accept them. To witness the immense revolution in public opinion on this subject, which has taken place within four decades, and the vast increase of lijjht shed abroad by 'ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to them that shall be heirs of salvation,' brings cheering reflections upon the progress of spiritual knowledge and understanding. It also opens an expanding view of the power and resource of the Almighty Parentage for accomplishing that strange work which the spirit promised to perform in the latter days, and which those who draw nigh to God with their lips while their hearts are far from Him, will in no wise believe, though it be told them. Isa. xxix., 14. We see the wide gulf that formerly existed between us and the world in the matter of doctrinal belief, continually narrowing by the operation of a power above and beyond us, without change on our part, except that of normal growth, and increase of understanding on the same foundation, reminding us of a vision related by Ann, wherein she saw a great gulf fixed between God and the world of mankind, and she had two great wings given her, and her work was to go up that gulf and fan it away. The word lost, may be objected to in this connection. But an appeal is made to the personal experiences of readers, if a large majority of you were not lost, so far as knowing where the true light of man's spiritual destiny shined, or where to look for it, until you found spiritualism. And how did you find it; by delving, or was it brought to you ? So far as one is lost from the knowledge and practice of their highest and eternal interest, he is lost from God, though he may not be beyond the reach and cognizance of God, nor of His messengers. The great gulf of ignorance which divides man from his future inheritance with saints in light, can be bridged by knowledge. But the far wider, deeper, darker gulf caused by sin and transgression, can only be removed by works of faith and repentance, aided by these messengers of God, who having conquered sin in the flesh while clothed with earthly tabernacles, and overcome all inward antagonisms, have risen to that state of power and life which no fires can burn, no waters quench nor drown, nor bottomless gulfs defeat nor swallow down. This mission belongs as much to woman as to man. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
