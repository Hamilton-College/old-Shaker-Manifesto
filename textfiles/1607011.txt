THE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER FOR IT. If men cared less for wealth and fame, And less for battlefields and glory ; If writ in human hearts, a name Seemed better than in song and story : If men, instead of nursing pride, Would learn to hate it and abhor it; If more relied on love to guide� The world would be the better for it. If men dealt less in stocks and lands. And more in bonds and deeds fraternal; If Love's work had more willing hands, To link this world to the supernal; If men stored up Lcve's oil and wine, And on bruised human hearts would pour it; If ' yours ' and ' mine ' would once combine, The world would be the better for it. If more would act the play of life, And fewer spoil it in rehearsal; If bigotry would sheathe its knife Till good became more universal; If custom, gray with ages grown, Had fewer blind men to adore it; If talent shone for truth alone � The world would be the better for it. If men were wise in little things� Affecting less in all their dealings� If hearts had fewer rusted strings To isolate their kindly feelings ; If men, when wrong beats down the right, Would strike together and restore it; If right made right in .every fight� The world would be the better for it. M. H. Cobb.
