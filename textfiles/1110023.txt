REFLECTION CATHARINE ALLEN Alas ! the precious hours of morn, how soon they vanish, never, never to be recalled. Steadily the sun of advancing years courses its way onward toward the meridian sky. Every day brings its duties to be performed, its burdens to bear; its lessons to be learned, and its conflicts for the soul, in conquering 232 THE SHAKEK MANIFESTO. the ever present, strong and active forces of selfhood. Each day is fraught with circumstances in which we may strengthen these forces by self indulgence, or subdue them by self denial. The sun never rises in the orient sky, but, to our waking consciousness are proffered new privileges for eternal gain ; new opportunities to sow in life's garden the seeds of bitterness or peace ; and its golden beams never fade in the purpleing mists of evening, as it sinks behind the hills, but our accountability to the Great Giver is increased proportionate to the gift bestowed ; and an unerring impression of every passing thought and inmost motive is photographed on memory's immortal tablet. O precious Time ! how swift and sure the pinions that bear thee from our grasp! And with thy flight our ship keeps pace, whose course with thee is onward to Eternity's vast shore. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
