RELIGIOUS TEST ' It might with truth be said that there are a thousand different religions in the world ; but as to their ' equality' in the sight of God, each will judge for himself. 'By their fruits ye shall know them.' That religion which develops the whole human being, enlightens the intellect, sanctifies the social feelings, and makes every man accountable for himself to his God; that makes him a selfgoverning, self-regulating, and self-sustaining human being; that emancipates him from superstition, and from self-indulgence, comes nearest to the requirement as we understand it.' To hear the discourse of wise men delights us, and their company inspires us with noble contemplations. Never, when you see a thing to be right, stand shaking and quaking, and say: ' But then.' That 'but then' is a devil damned. If and hut have destroyed more souls than any other fiend in hell.
