NOTHING TO DO? 'Nothing to do! ' in this world of ours, Where weeds grow up with the fairest flowers, Where smiles have only a fitful play, Where hearts are breaking every day. ' Nothing to dol ' thou Christian soul, Wrapping thee round in thy selfish stole? Off with the garments of sloth and sin, Christ, thy Lord, hath a kingdom to win. ' Nothing to do ! ' There are prayers to lay On the altar of incense, day by day; There are foes to meet, within and without: There is error to conquer, strong and stout. ' Nothing to do! ' There are lambs to feed, The precious hope of the church's need : ' Strength to be borne to the weak and faint, Vigils to keep with the doubting saint.' ' Nothing to do! ' and thy Savior said, ' Follow thou me in the path I tread. ' Lord, lend thy help, the journey through Lest faint, we cry, ' So much to do!' Baptist Weekly.
