A POEM ON THE DEVIL. Alfred J. Hough. Men don't believe in a devil now, as their fathers used to do ; They've forced the door of the broadest creed to let his majesty through. There isn't a print of his cloven foot or a fiery dart from his bow To be found in earth or air to-day, for the world has voted it so. But who is mixing the fatal draught that palsies heart and brain, And loads the bier of each passing year with ten hundred thousand slain? Who blights the bloom of the land to-day with the fiery breath of hell? If the devil isn't, and never was, won't somebody rise and tell? Who dogs the steps of the toiling saint, and digs the pits for his feet? Who sows the tares on the fields of time, wherever God sows his wheat? The devil is voted not to be, and of course the thing 5s true ; But who is doing the kind of work that the devil alone should do? We are told that he does not go about as a roaring lion now ; But whom shall we hold responsible for the everlasting row To be heard in home, in church and slate to the earth's remotest bound, If the devil, by a unanimous vote, is nowhere to be found? Won't somebody step to the front forthwith, and make his bow and show How the frauds and crimes of a single day spring up? We want to know. The devil was fairly voted out, and of course the devil's gone; But simple people would like to know who carries his business on. Jamestown (N. Y.) Journal.
