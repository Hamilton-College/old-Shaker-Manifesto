Don't Dawdle —The word ' dawdle ' means to ' waste time,' to ' trifle.' When a boy does a thing in a ' poky,' lazy way, he 'dawdles' over it. It is a bad thing to fall in a dawdling habit. It helps to make a boy unmanly and a girl unwomanly. The dawdler's life is apt to be a failure. He does little for himself or for others. ' In books, or work, or healthful play ' he doesn't amount to much. Don't dawdle. Do things with a will and do them well. You must not splutter or be ' fussy ' over your work. The fussy fellow can waste time in liis haste as well as' the dawdler in his slow trifling. Have a quick eye and a ready hand and patient heart, always. If you have an hour in which to do a half hour's task, do it in that half hour. Get through on time ; then play with briskness and sparkling enjoyment. Do your errands promptly. Brush your hair with a lively hand. Sweep your room with decision in every motion of the broom. Take one ' degree ' in a useful line of ' D. D.'s'—Don't Dawdle.—8. S. Advocate.
