FORGIVENESS. ' And Jesus said unto her, 'neither do I condtvtn thee, go, and sin no more.' John, viiA, 11. Benignant Savior! 'Twas not thine To spurn the erring from thy sight, Nor did thy smile of love divine Turn from the penitent its light. O then, shall we, who own thy name. A brother's fault too sternly view, Or think thy holy law can blame The tear, to human frailty due? May we, while human guilt awakes Upon our cheek the generous glow, Spare the offender's heart, that breaks Beneath its load of shame and woe. Conscious of frailty, may we yield Forgiveness of the wrongs we bear: And strive the penitent to shield From further sin, or dark despair. And when our own offences weigh Upon our hearts with anguish sore, Lord ! let thy pardoning mercy say Like Jesus, ' Go, and sin no more. ' Selected.
