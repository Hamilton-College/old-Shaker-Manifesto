FRAGMENTS. Chancy Dibble. We are often looked upon as held by some authority that usurps the free agency. Credited with being industrious, consequently self-supporting, some suppose this to be the sole object of our association. We do not see, how temporal considerations could hold a people in Farmony. It is vital Christianity that purifies the heart that keeps us together. This was the origin of Shakerism. Over a century ago, a revival in England separated many honest souls from old church dogmas. Among these were the Puritans, Quakers, and a few who aspired to a life of virgin purity, after the order of Jesus and his Disciples. Ann Lee was leader of this little company. Being persecuted they repaired to America in the year 1774. Soon religious revivals sprang up in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York. In each of these States Societies of Shakers were formed which are still in operation. After this, extensive revivals prevailed in Kentucky and Ohio. From these in 1805, gprang five .Societies, two in Kentucky and three in Ohio which still exist. This shows that Shakerism follows the track of religious awakenings. We own that power which turns men and women from their ruinous habits. From bad to good. When worship is merely ceremonial, satisfied without liviug inspiration, such churches need to awaken, whether it be Shaker or any other. Ma) love purify us, place our feet in virtue's paths, open our vision to fruitful fields, where the spirits are advancing to enjoy the society of each other in innocence. This will satisfy our longings for happiness. May we all be nearing this condition. ' Peace on earth good will to man.' Watervliet, N. Y.
