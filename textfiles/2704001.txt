If the Whole World should become Shakers, What then? If�and that diminutive word�if�admits of so much doubt. It is surprising to see upon how small a pivot some of the greatest works in this world will so readily turn. Other vital questions like the above might be raised with equal propriety and yet they would vanish as the morning mist. No one would care to give them a second thought. If all men should insist upon following one occupation, what then? An 1 if the whole world were anxious to live on some special island in the Pacific Ocean, what should we do? These are very singular interrogations, and yet about as momentous as the first. The Shakers are not particularly interested in holding a controversy on the subject of marriage. As it is a civil right and is held under the law of the civil government, every person of lawful age can enter the marriage relation if he so chooses. If and if�it should honor God's law, through nature, God's law will evidently honor that relation through the laws of nature. Jesus when he referred to the kingdom of God, and defined very particularly what all must do to enter this abode, closed by saying,�'All men can not receive this saying save they to whom it is given.' He knew quite well that his testimony would not be received, except by those who are prepared for it. Mankind, as a whole, care but very little about what may become of the world, if it can be made subservient to their selfish ends, and the plea so often and so carefully presented for their maintenance of God's laws, is used only as a convenient quibble. God's laws are carelessly thrown aside whenever they are found to enforce a disciplinary order of life, and the sins of indulgence among the pleasure seekers of one generation are without reserve transmitted to the generation which follows. It is not especially necessary that we enter into lengthy details upou this subject, as all professors of Christianity, as well as all readers of the New Testament must unavoidably come to the same conclusion. The subject of generation and re-generation are so distinct one from the other, that there need be no danger of confounding the terms. The first is universally understood as belonging to this present life, and that it forms the foundation pillars upon which the world stands. The other is 'the entering into a new, spiritual life, a principle of supreme love to God and his law,' through which the sons and daughters of the New Creation become heirs to the Kingdom of Christ. Adam and other sons of God, lived in and encouraged with eommeudable zeal the order of natural genei'ation. It has been, largely, the life work of all races of men, and continues unchanged with those who hold a relationship to the old inheritance. So far generation may have been honorable, in that it conformed to the laws of nature. At the advent of the Christ a new and living way was opened in which all souls were invited to walk. The kingdom of God was establisht among men. A new heavens and a new earth were formed wherein should dwell righteousness. In this kingdom, old things would be done away and all things become new. The voice of Jesus was heard to say, 'Follow me and you shall find rest to your souls.' How should we follow him? Not in the order of generation, for he never walkt there, nor did he encourage others to walk there. Not among the military heroes, for he deprecated war. Then how shall we follow him? We can follow him by entering the order of the spiritual resurrection and rising from dead works to serve the living and true God. By becoming a disciple of the Christ and under the discipline of the testimony be made able to care for the things that belong to the Lord. By living in that ministration, that the world may be crucified unto the world. Among the many who are called to step forward into the elements of a new, spiritual life, but few avail themselves of the privilege. The cares of this world have so absorbed their minds that they have no time for religious contemplation. Again the Christ speaks to us;�'Ye that have followed me in the regeneration and have forsaken houses and lands, or brethren and sisters, or father or mother or wife or children, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundred fold and shall inherit everlasting life.' 'When Jesus Christ came among men, he promulgated not the work of generation but of regeneration. It was the resurrection to a new and spiritual life. This life was brought to light by his gospel, and the laws of nature with regard to this generative work were clearly denned. The children of this Christian resurrection neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels. They are not called into the work of generation. That mission belongs to another class.' Altho the Gentile Christian church have tried hard to amalgamate the two orders, that of generation and regeneration, they can never succeed so long as the testimony of the cross of Christ is maintained in the soul. That which is born of the flesh, is flesh, and following the testimony of Jesus through the apostle, 'They that live in the lust of the flesh can not please God.' And 'that which is born of the spirit, is spirit,' and these conditions will not be very likely to amalgamate.
