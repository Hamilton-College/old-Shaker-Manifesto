THE GOOD BELIEVER. Mary Whitcher. Content at home, content to be A help, wherever need we see And happy in our place. Up in the morn at early call, Prepared for duties that may fall Upon us through the day. No face awry, no feeling sad, But for our call so very glad, Makes all things move in peace. No turning to the world for ease Or anything the sense might please, For ours is measure full. A peaceful manner for the young, A cheery word for those who're strong And kindness everywhere. The bliss within, is bliss without, That we are right, we have no doubt, And with a trust we pray. Canterbury, N. H.
