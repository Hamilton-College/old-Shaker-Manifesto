Gathered Gems of Song and Story Gathered Gems of Song and Story. It is not every day that we are so fortunate as to obtain this form of treasure by the expenditure of a little sum of money. A book of gems is far more valuable than a necklace of gems, as one may beautify the immortal mind, while the other can only afford a transitory pleasure in adorning the body. It is a treasure-house of stories that every boy and girl will want to read, and in which more mature minds will be intensely interested, among which may be found 'The Little English Drummer Boy,' 'Kittie's New Song,' and 'The Wooden Indian.'
