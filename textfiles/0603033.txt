NOTICE. We would very kindly request of our subscribers and agents, in sending names to The Shaker, that each name be written plainly and spelled correctly; also that the county, in which the subscriber's Post Office is located, be, in every instance, designated. Careful attention to these directions will avoid much complaint for non-delivery of papers. — Pub. The ' Shaker,' for February, which is now out, is a credit to Elder Lomas. the editor, and also to the house which publishes it, for its make-up and general typographical appearance are admirable. — Ktpreas.
