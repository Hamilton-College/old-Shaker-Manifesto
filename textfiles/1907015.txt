WHO ARE THE INFIDELS? Hamilton De Graw. Let us analyze the word, Fidelity.ï¿½ Honesty, veracity, adherence to truth. Then Infidelity must be the opposite. The question, who are inn'dels? The reformers of the world who in all ages have been branded with the epithet of Infidel or the reactionists who have assumed to themselves the ho lor of Fidelity. Was Jesus an infidel? Let us examine into his record ; while a child he was faithful to his parents and grew to manhood imbued with the principle of fidelity to truth, and loyalty of soul to that grand central truth of the final consummation of the brotherhood of man ; while his bigoted persecutors were the infidels and he was forced to exclaim, ''Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, ye devour widows' houses and for a pretence make long prayers.' Those who have stood on the danger line in the advance guard of human progress have always been hounded with the cry, 'Infidel, Crucify him.' Moving down the ages we meet the grand army of progre.-sive thinkers that have sealed their devotion to the truth with their lives. Which were the infidels, Polycarp, Huss, Bruno, Servetus or those who so fiendishly sacrificed them to satiate that lust for dominion over the souls of men and could not tolerate Fidelity to the truth ? When through the spiritual evolution of tve race it became possible for that highly spiritualized and inspired woman Ann Lee to announce her mission as one of the advauced reformers of the world ; when her announcement was flashed upon the world that woman must be free to work out her own redemption, a mingled howl of rage and terror arose from the advocates of the Pauline doctrin3, that woman must be subject to man, fearing that their idol would be destroyed, the cry of infidel, fanatic, arose ''Crucify her' she did not merely stand on the danger line but was advancing with dangers besetting her on every side, she sealed her Fidelity to the truth with her life, while her persecutors the Christian clergy ( ?) could profess to be shocked at the sight of a woman preaching. When that grand man, one of nature's noblemen, William Loyd Garrison thundered his protest against chattel slavery and in demanding immediate abolition made his ineffectual appeal to the clergy what was the result? While standing in their pulpits and quoting the Bible to uphold the infamcus system could hiss Infidel, while they were the infidels to those principles of truth that were working for the emancipation of the race.
