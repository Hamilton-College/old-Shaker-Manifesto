Dearly Beloved Elder Abraham:--It gave me very great pleasure... Shirley Village, Mass., Oct. 1890. Dearly Beloved Elder Abraham ��It gave me very great pleasure to receive your kind favor of the 8th. inst., giving me welcome to our hospitable shores�the home of my adoption and especially my Shirley, Shaker home, from which no outside beauty or splendor hath power to charm me, longer than duty, or liberty in the gift of God will allow. In answer to your first question will say that I found much improvement in the condition of the great body of workingmen, generally. They have better homes, are better clad and fed, have much better means of learning the things that pertain to their physical, moral and religious conditions. There is still intemperance, a great tendency to enjoy sports, and considerable gambling in connection. But so far as I could observe, in traveling nearly the full length of England and quite a 'piece into Scotland, I was pleased to notice evidences of culture and thrift on every side. I was talking with a good Methodist sister, an old friend, and said to her,�Hannah, your Chapel is very much improved in size and appearance. Is the religious element equally so? She replied, 'I fear not.' Perhaps she was justified in her fear. And possibly it is there as elsewhere, there has been too much yielding towards worldly tastes, fashions and customs. I heard some of them telling the Lord what 'miserable sinners they were,' perhaps so. I would not wish to dispute their words in the matter, though if I or any one else had accused them of being such, the probability is, they would have resented it. This shows the need of the life-giving testimony that will show them they must be saved from their sins and not, as the natural man would desire, in their sins. As you say, there have been great changes since I first left England, forty-eight years ago. Very few are left that I knew then. I found a very few, and I am happy to say, some noble specimens of men. Onu the present Mayor of the Borough; another whom I met in the Mayor's parlor, had been Mayor four terms. These two were intimate friends. Another with whom I had great hopes of having a pleasant visit, and to whose house I made my first call, had been buried two weeks. I mention his name, J. H. Walker, as he was not an entire stranger to the Manifesto readers. He was formerly one of the Aldermen in Manchester, England, but spent a few of his later years in Canada, and once made an extended vi.sit at Shirley. He loved the Shakers, and spoke of his love for tliem many times in his last sickness. I appreciate what ycu say in regard to the succession of earth's generations. Generation to the natural, worldly mind, is of the first importance, while regeneration, that will fit us for the eternal, heavenly conditions, is put off in too many cases for an indefinite, or more convenient season. Still with this, there is a spirit of inquiry and of a very candid, courteous nature. On our way over, while there, but more especially on our return by steamship 'Servia,' there were on. board some two hundred delegates to the Iron and Steel Convention. Quite a number, men of title, and much above the average of men in intelligence, by their frankness and freedom from ostentation, and their manifest earnest desire to learn the truth, opened a way for the sowing of gospel seed, that I trust may be seen in a fruitful growth, when 1 too have laid a^ide the mortal, for a home in the land of souls. I respond heartily to your prayer, that the time may be hastened when Zioa shall put on her beautiful garments, and shall take her place fearlessly as the agent in God's hands in unfolding to the world, Millennial lives and Millennial blessings. Why are we not more in earnest about it? Does some spell bind us that needs to be broken? My prayer is, come Love, Light, Liberty, with that savin? power and victory that shall make Zion shine in the glory of God. j I liave written hurriedly and just as my pen would seem to run, and trust it may in some way satisfy your desire. Hope I may hear from you again, as I used to long since. I love a truly good Believer and mean to be such in truth and sincerity, believing it will, in the end, pay best for time and through eternity We have much to be thankful for. Would all were more worthy of the great blessings with which we are favored. Kind love to all at your peaceful home. From your brother, John Whiteley.
