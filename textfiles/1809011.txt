J. H. Walker, Friend:--Your very interesting letter of the... Shaker Village, N. H. July, 1888. J. 11. Walker, Friend:�Your very interesting letter of the 2nd. iust. to our beloved Elder John Whiteley has been forwarded to us for perusal. It cannot be thought strange that we find in your communication, a common bond of sympathy, as we so clearly see the present state of society,�such sad departures from righteousness, and then allow ourselves to anticipate what it might be under the redeeeming influence of the cross of Christ. It is quite too true that there is a strong tendency in the mass of mankind to cling to the earth, and to become absorbed in its relations. Self-denial is not congenial, so that in the ruling of the animal propensities, over the moral faculties, many, very many pass on to destruction. We are not surprised that you see these things so distinctly, or that you should acknowledge yourself as becoming a convert to the testimony of Jesus Christ, which dwells so forcibly on the benefits accruing to those who follow after righteousness and who work diligently ' to become pure in heart. But there is a difficulty to get men and women to accept this better view of life. One of the great barriers is found in the fact that many of those who assume to be the guides on the highway to the kingdom, are quite as blind, or as unwilling to practice self-denial for the good of mankind, as are those before whom they stand as teachers. 'If the blind attempt to lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch,' and certainly, none are so blind as those who live in selfishness and sensuality. Just here the marriage question finds a place. That there is biblical authority for mar- riage is quite correct and Paul in his zeal to become all things to all men, that he might partiall) save some, admitted this life of the flesh in his Gentile, Christian Church, and then tried hard to justify it. There is biblical authority also for war and bloodshed and for slavery and for polygamy,�but it would be hard to find an authority for these things in the teachings of Jesus. There can be no truer saying than this, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that v/hich is born of the spirit is spirit.' We firmly believe, however, that any departure from the pure testimony of the Christ, would, at once, destroy our religious order and make us emphatically, as are the children of this world. As witnesses for the truth of God, the Shakers should, with their light and privilege, be able to speak with as much confidence as did St. Paul, when he said, 'They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.' 'God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.' Our success in maintaining our order and our prosperity as a Community must be by our faithful continuance in welldoing. Our duty is to 'preach the kingdom of God and its righteousness.' We appreciate your very kind remarks, having reference to our little journal, and only hope that it may be able to do much good and no harm. Accept with this our prayer for your prosperity in this life, and the blessedness of peace in that to come. Respectfully, H. C. Blinn.
