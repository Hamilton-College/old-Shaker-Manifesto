East Canterbury N. H. Sept. 1895. Now we are quite ready for the Harvest song, Summer has given place to autumn and the singing birds have taken their flight to more southern climes. If for the bounteous blessings daily received from the hand of our Heavenly Father, we break forth into songs of joy and gladness, we shall only do what may be expected of those who share so freely those multiplied gifts that are always to be found in 'God's holy mountain.' Two silos of an hundred tons each have been built for the benefit of the Milch cows, and these are now being filled with the best quality of ensilage. A steam engine of eight horse power, a machine for cutting the corn stalks, and a company of active workers to haul the corn from the field makes active work for several days, for a large company. The fall term of school for girls has just commenced. The school Commissioners are becoming more exacting in their examination of the teachers, and in this way anticipate better results in the schools. We must state that one little humming bird visited the flower beds on the 19th inst. The reason for this extended visit after the migration of the other birds is a matter of special interest. H. C.
