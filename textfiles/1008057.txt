Judge Choate recently ruled... Judge Choate recently ruled that a Chinaman cannot be naturalized under the laws of the United States. The application was made by a Chinaman known as Charles Miller, who has lived in New York for twentyeight years. He was guided by the decision of Judge Sawyer, of California, in the Ah Yup case, when thirteen hundred Chinamen petitioned that schools might be provided for them, as for Indians and negroes, and showed that in San Francisco alone they were paying $42,000 in school taxes. Judge Sawyer refused their petition, though it asked only that he would carry out a provision of the Constitution of the State.
