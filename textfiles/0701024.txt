Celibate does not sufficiently define shakerhood... Celibate does not sufficiently define Shakerhood. By a SHAKER, we mean a virgin celibate, one who either never has lost virginity by carnal contact, or one who, having been so unchristianly unfortunate, is redeeming that virtue by dint of an extreme self-denial, equaled only by the example of Jesus, the Christ. It is a matter of importance only, not whether an individual SHAKER has ever been a virgin celibate, or of recent conversion; the importance lies in the fact whether he or she is living the life of a virgin celibate now, 'to go no more out forever' Jesus was more than celibate; he was virgin.
