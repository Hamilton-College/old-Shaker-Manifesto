FAITH'S VISION Affetuoso. North, Mt. L. it 1 To the spirit land we're hastening, Golden moments flit before, While each sunset brings us nearer To its seeming, distant shore. 2 Oft its pearly gates are opened, Hoods of glory thro'them come; And we catch a glimpse of beauty, Juat a foresight of our home. 3 Yet we ask their ministration While we tarry here below, And that ever round our pathway Light in creasing still may glow. Yet up on her snowy pinions, Faith will lift oar hearts to see, In the life that is before us, Blessed immortality. O it is by holy living That we gain an entrance there; For communion with the Angels, Spotless robes we must pie pare. If our lives are fraught with goodness, And the seeds of love we sow, We shall reap a bundant blessing, And the joy of Angels know.
