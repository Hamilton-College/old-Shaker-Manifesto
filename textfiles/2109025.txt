Canterbury, N. H. Weather Record, for July, 1891. Highest Temp, during the mo. 86. Lowest ' ' ' ' 50, Mean ' ' ' ' 68. Rainfall 4.50 in. N'. A. Briggs. Aug. 6, 1891. Since our 'Notes' of last month we have been greatly blessed in many of the precious, temporal gifts. Climatic influences have been such that general, good health has prevailed most of the time, which has enabled us to relish our food, so amply provided,ï¿½to engage in the manual duties of our consecrated home, and to take an interested and active part in all the religious exercises that are arranged for our spiritual prosperity. The life of man is so extended, interesting itself as it does in demands for the support of the body and then for the greater demands of the cultivation of the mind, that there is no time to be lost through idleness. Up to date several hands are still engaged in the hay-field. Those who worked by the day have been dismissed after securing some 250 tons of most excellent clover and Timothy hay. The meadow or flat grass that grows in wet lands is not of much value and may be-cut and taken to the barn the same day. The gathering of small fruits as raspberries, blueberries and blackberries, occupies ever.' considerable time by small companies, and has been engaged in as pleasure as well as profit. Not less than twelve or fourteen persons from this Society left home this morning for the high bush blueberry field, a distance of some four miles. Showers are falling most beautifully, and we can well imagine the forlorn condition of those among the bushes, and their more than rural appearance on their real, rural, rainy ride toward home in an open carraige. The rain falls equally as unmindful on the silks and satins of the large companies that are passing over the premises of the Community, as the visitors of to-day. Many of these are wonder seekers who have come from a distance of twelve or fifteen miles to see the Shakers, and are wondering what they shall see, and then go away wondering at what they did not see. Many of our little migratory, tree top singers have already gone to their more southern home, and there is a perceptible difference in the music in the air. The Baltimore Orioles left us some ten days since, and it is a great loss to lose their sweet song. All the Eave swallows, and last week there were hundreds of them, are to be seen no more for several months. Although this class of birds are without song, yet their presence is one of pleasure, and their service in the destruction of insects, invaluable. The song of the Bobolink has also ceased, although the birds will stay with us for two or three more weeks. The male bird seems obliged to change his gay suit of feathers for one of dull gray, and at the time of leaving, the whole flock, old and young, are all of this sombre hue. The first offering of green corn was made on the 3rd. of August, which was a very acceptable foretaste of the good things that are to come. Beautiful specimens of tomatoes are being gathered, and from present prospects we shall have a bountiful supply. The eating of tomatoes seems to be an acquired taste, with most persons. Some two decades since, and a few hills of this plant, produced all that our family would care to use, but at the present time an hundred bushels could be utilized with profit, and even then we should want more. With all these temporal blessings we have great cause for thankfulness. Our spiritual blessings are also of great value, and to harmonize with the teachings of the New Testament we must 'seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness.' Our prayers in the morning and at evening should be beautifully anticipated offerings to God. These will help wonderfully to lighten the burdens of the day, and aid us in carrying forward our gospel work in the interest of humanity. *
