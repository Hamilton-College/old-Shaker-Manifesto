Alfred, Me. May, 1892. Beloved Elder Henky:The days pass so swiftly that I can hardly keep pace with them. It seems but a few days ago I was writing 'Notes' for May Manifesto and it is now time for June 'Notes.' There does not seem to be much of interest to write about. All are busy wTith no time for idleness. if we remember our Mother's injunction, 'Hands to work and hearts to God,' I believe a blessing will come to us, and we shall realize fully that God is good, and his mercy endureth forever. Warm spring weather has not reached us yet, even yesterday a few snowflakes fell, followed by a cold rain. Potatoes and peas are all that the weather permits of planting as yet. Spring term of school commenced the 10th. inst. Housecleaning almost finished, and the Sisters are very glad. We read in the good book that it is first pure and then peaceable, and if our hearts are as clean and pure as our dwellings, surely we ought to live in peace, love and union, with never a word to mar our happiness. This cleansing work must and will go on, and every soul that is willing to endure the cleansing, will come off victorious in the end, and be numbered with the hundred forty and four thousand. Let us keep in the way, for we know that 'God's work will stand, It cannot, will not fail; 'Pis founded on eternal truth, Enduring as the heavens are; It cannot, will not fail. F. C.
