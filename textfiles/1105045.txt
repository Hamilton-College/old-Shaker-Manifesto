Commercial Advertiser of New York The Commercial Advertiser of New York, lately enlarged, and with new dress, is certainly the best newspaper that hails from the metropolis. Besides being as enterprising as any of its contemporaries in the line of news, its editorials are surpassingly valuable and instructive. Our old and kind friend, H. J. Hastings, is editor and proprietor, and is one of the wisest of nature's noblemen. Send for a sample copy.
