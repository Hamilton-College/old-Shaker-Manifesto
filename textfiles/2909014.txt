Enfield, N. H. July, 1899. Nearly four'months have had their time since six of us were transferred from the Church order to this family, and our time has been fully occupied with the duties incident to the prevailing conditions, thus debarring us from some of the pleasantries and duties pen and mind has enjoyed. With the abundance of fruits and grains, coupled with the remembrance of the many joys that are ours as we live in nearness of thought to the Christ spirit, we rejoice and 'Our heart's breathe the old refrain, Thy will be done.' Not according to any world levelling process, nor by any pagan conception of life, impeding expansion of individual and society life toward a higher degree of existence, but by the power of mind that will expand in duties and uprightness of spirit, valuing principle above human favor or material gift. It may not be essential that we echo end reecho the same remarks the founders of our societies heralded, but it is necessary that we give full consecrated lives to the principles that bind us together. 'Our fathers to their graves liave gone; Their strife is past, their triumph won, But sterner trials wait the race Which rises in their honored place.' A careful inspection of our true condition will apprise us of the fact that 'hands to work and hearts to God' is the imperative law of to-day that we may remain able to hold fast that which is good. Our Church family have shone with new lustre; three buildings revealing very artistic dressing. With our kindred there we gather each Sabbath and exchange gifts of the spirit. With us change from family to family can not mar the ties of affection or withhold the aid each one is capable of giving. New voices may sound the gospel news and different themes inspire the lips; but never can new friends or modes of life take the place of old ones bearing the seal of Christly approval. George H. Baxter.
