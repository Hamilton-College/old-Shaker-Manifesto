NOTES. Ask and you shall receive, Seek and you shall find, are equally as true and as potent in their influence, at this day as when they were first uttered. Those who do not ask are very likely to remain ignorant, and those who neglect to seek will in all probability become a burden upon the world. It is no less true in religious matters than it is in the acquisition of a temporal interest. The active man asks, when, where and how and then diligently seeks for the place and opportunity, that is best to acquire wealth. Day and night, through sunshine and storm, he forces his way that he may accomplish the desire of his mind and accumulate to himself the treasures of this world. He has learned most assuredly, that 'God helps those who help themselves.' On a certain occasion, Jesus was led to say, that 'The children of this world are wiser in their generation, than the children of light.' The first ask and seek persistently to acquire worldly treasures ; the latter are very willing to allow God and the holy Angels to call men to repentance, while they sit by and see the work go on. It is indeed wonderful what a soothing influence this religious anodyne has upon the mind. Zealous in prayers, and in church ceremonies and yet look on with indifference while the world inarch by to certain destruction. 'Fear not,' said Moses, 'Stand firm and see the salvation of the Lord that he will do for you this day.' Excellent counsel of 3000 years ago ! and yet how very much, we are, like the tribe of Reuben in standing firm to see what will be done for us.
