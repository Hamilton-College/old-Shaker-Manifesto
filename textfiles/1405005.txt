LET US REFLECT. OLIVER C. HAMPTON. If bastiles and dungeons could never repress The faith of the saints in the past, But under the cause they could earnestly bless The God of the Universe vast; In Inquisitorial tortures and fires Could cling to the promise of God, And calmly restrain all their yearning desires To parry the pain of his rod; If prisons and sickness, starvation and stripes Their confidence never could shake But as the grim miser his heritage gripes They joyfully welcome the stake; How should we the called of the Lord in this day Our privileges duly esteem, And carefully walk and persistently pray Our talents and time to redeem ? How instant in labors, in season and out, The seal of the cross to maintain, How quick to dismiss all discouraging doubt And each grov'ling passion restrain. How blessed to live in the light of this day How can we such blessing neglect, Or willfully�carelessly run the broad way And all saving counsel reject? O, bless'd in our basket and bless'd in our store, Sweet Home and good friends to enjoy, How could we of God the Eternal ask more Or travel with less of alloy. The 'Winter of sorrow and dark discontent Be banished from every sad heart, In view of conditions, with mercies so blent! And from the vain world set apart� To sit in the Heavens in union and peace, Our labor each other to bless; Our progress in Holiness never to cease, And more and more joy to possess; O let us commence with the dawn of the Year Our manifold blessings to view With da)'s that are over and gone to compare When fierce persecutions did brew; When Martyrs and saints to the dens of the earth Were driven and hunted to death, And only could claim their immaculate birth By yielding their fugitive breath. Lord, fill us with charity, peace and good will Toward sinners as well as to saints; Bid jealousies, enmities, all to be still And silence their wicked complaints; O let us be God-like and freely forgive, Let sympathy conquer revenge, In this fervent furnace we must learn to live And dwell in its agony strange. The horoscope bright for the swift rolling Year We'll draw, in the glorious now, Our faith and our hope and our courage to cheer As still to our travail we bow. How good and how pleasant it is to increase In love to our friends and our foes By doing good actions in kindness to these And just as devoted to those. O Heavenly Father, we earnestly pray Thy blessing may rest on the year, O help us to merit thy favor each day By striving each other to cheer, To cheer and encourage in work and in word In blessing and kindness to all, That union and peace and the sweetest accord May sorrow and blanting forestall.
