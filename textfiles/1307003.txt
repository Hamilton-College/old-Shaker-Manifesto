LIFE IS PROGRESS ELVAH F. COLLINS. From the seed bud to the blossom,— From the blossom to the fruit, We perceive the growth of nature, So, for good, the soul's pursuit, Starting on the stage of action, With the inward germs of good, We're continually unfolding, Standing not, where once we stood. Never resting! Life is onward !! That 'the grave is not its goal;' Still is sung by Bard and Poet, Still is felt within the soul. For the evidence of further, And still further op'ning spheres, Strongly urges us to action, Now, a« for a thousand years. And from thence through time unmeasured. By the sun's revolving light, On and on, where toil and recompense, Shall never meet a blight. Who can comprehend the ending, Or beginning of our life? Of the powers of good and evil, Which, when meeting cause the strife? Or a God whose laws and statutes, Stand as fixed in earth and heaven; We may reason, think and wonder, But to whom is knowledge given? Of a future we are certain, And of soul's immortal wealth ; Knowing too, through lives of virtue, Wisdom yields us joy and health. And while 'biding in these shadows, Of a substance yet to be, We can strengthen one another. In our faith's leaiity. Then, let love reciprocated, Draw us near in union's bond, Which assures us of re-union, On the shore that lies beyond. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
