PURITY OF LIFE. Charles Julius Preter. We are living in an enlightened age. Priestcraft, superstition and sectarian dogmas have in a great measure lost their power over the minds of intelligent people. They want to see an exemplary, pure and holy life. They are getting disgusted with preaching. They begin to believe more in good works, than an outward profession of religion. If there is only 'Oue Lord, one faith and one baptism,' it must be admitted, that those who live the most godly, righteous and upright lives are truly in possession of it; for ' not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven,' Matt, vii., 21, and every one shall be judged and receive according to his works, not to what he believes. Therefore it is so difficult to convert the Hindoos and Chinese to the Christian religion. They canuot see it, that by the cruel death of one man all transgressors could be cleared from the penalty of sis by merelv believing on him. They expect a compensation or reward to the good and righteous, and a retribution, remorse and punishment to the wicked and evil doer. The Buddhists number about 400 millions ; one third of the inhabitants of the earth. What a libel to a just and impartial God, to consign them all to eternal perdition, considering that he is 'No respecter of persons ; but in every nation, he tliatfeareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with Him.' Every rational person must come to the conclusion, that all those who were not favored with Christ's teachings on earth will have an offer of them in the spirit world, aud they have to accept or reject them, the same as those in this mundane sphere. The Shakers do not believe in a great outward show of sanctity, much preaching aud boasting, not in the wind, earthquake and fire, but in the still small voice. 1 Kiugs, xix., 11. They consider themselves to be�the little flock, whose Father's good pleasure it was to give them the kingdom. Luke,xii., 32. They glory in the cross of Christ, by which the world is crucified to them, and they to the world. Gal. vi., 14. They believe that nothing short of a life of strict chasti'y, humiliation, self-denial, love and charity, will ever save them. The Shakers are established in the United States more than 100 [years, and wherever they have settlements, or Societies, those who are acquainted with them, generally honor and respect them very much, on account of their honesty, uprightness, sobriety and fair dealings, charity and benevolence. If the tree is known by its fruit, and the true people of God by their works, all intelligent men and women must come to the conclusion, that the � Shakers are not so much in the dark, and out of the way as they formerly thought they were, and many who despised them, have now become their best friends and well-wishers ; but, like Nicodemus, for fear of losing their great name and standing in the world do not openly acknowledge it.
