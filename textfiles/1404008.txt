PLEASURE. MARTHA J. ANDERSON. Can pride and sensuality rejoice? From purity of thought all pleasure springe, And from an humble spirit all our peace. ï¿½ Young. O, vain and empty is the human mind That seeks for happiness in sensuous things; That drinks of pleasure's bubbling surface springs, And thinks therein to satisfaction find. True joy is born within the soul's calm deep, Where lofty aspiration plumes her wings; Where wise reflection all her treasure brings, And sweet contentment ever dwells enshrined. Gay throngs and giddy crowds may onward sweep Along life's path with passion's blinding force; But ihey who in love's lowly valley keep, Shall join with angels in an upward course; The rich reward of conscious blessing reap, And draw their pleasure from a heavenly source.
