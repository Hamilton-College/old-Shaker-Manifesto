Notice to Believers The Shaker, under its present patronage of subscribers nearly or quite sustains itself. We would consider it a personal favor, if any interested in its success, would write us their opinions, by answering the following queries, or their equivalent: 1. Does The Shaker pay as a missionary enterprise ? if not, why not ? 2. Would it be sustained, if its size and price should be doubled ? 3. Are you in favor, or not, of its suspension for 1873 ? 4. What substantial encouragement do you feel to assure to it from your locality? 5. Are you in favor, or opposed, to the insertion of modest advertisements ? 6. Wherein could The Shaker, in your opinion, be improved ? Remark : We circulate 5,000 copies monthly, among the best classes of society, over an extensive territory; the benefits to advertisers are clearly apparent. Please reply. G. Albert Lomas
