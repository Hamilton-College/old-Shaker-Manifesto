PARASITES We wonder, sometimes, whether the admirers of the idea, that man is as a tree, while woman is best represented as a clinging vine, have sought for the wisdom as well as beauty of the arrangement. To any who have ever attempted to remove from a valuable and thrifty tree, a vine, which seemed bent on taking full possession, the experience must have been suggestive. Tendrils, which once were soft and pliable, have become like rings of steel, and in every direction, are girdling the limbs with such tenacity, that as the tree grows, they almost cut into its marrow, and thus, by preventing the flow of its life juices, are hastening it on to certain destruction. Are they not parasites, or too near akin to them ? Mutually enfeebling each other, instead of blessing — while if the vine could have been, by favoring circumstances, provided with a suitable trellis, where it could have luxuriated in the sunshine and air—the natural life and stimulus of all God's animal and vegetable creation — rich and luscious fruits might have crowned both their lives. ' Created upright'— by leaning, and thus losing the individuality she should have retained, she has not only failed to develop her own powers, and those of her supporter, but dwarfed her own strength and womanhood, beyond the ability for present uprightness. She must have time to put on the solid growth, which comes of healthy, harmonious conditions, ere she rises to her true glory and usefulness. E. H. Webster, Ayer, Mass.
