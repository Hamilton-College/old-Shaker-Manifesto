CHRISTMAS SONG FOR 1881 OTIS SAWYER Down through the ages comes a voice,— Israel's Shepred teaching; That then, as now and now, as then, That love's the truest preaching. By this, said Christ, shall all men know Who are my true Disciples ; 'Tis by their fruit, nor high, nor low The Thorn ne'er yieldeth Apples. The Angel with the Keed he bears, To measure human greatness; Declines the selfish soul, who wears These marks of human weakness. Whose hearts bear malice, spite and hate Towards a fellow brother, Nor on his tablet this be found; '0 love ye one another.' When Mother, Oh! most precious name, Begun her holy mission; Her gentle love diffused abroad,— Inspired a heavenly vision. The Angels caught the sweet refrain, And forth to man they hasted; Good news, glad tidings, from our God,— Heaven and earth are wedded. Come, woman in your strength arise, For your Eedeemer cometh ; Fill ev'ry space from earth to skies With songs of love that charmeth. Let echo and re-echo roll From valley, over mountain; The tender love of God is known By this new, open'd fountain. The Mother-hood of God's revealed, 0 blessed revelation; The mystery so long concealed, The healing for the nations. The comforter to earth has come With healing wings, to bless, And this the name whereby she's called, 'The Lord our Righteousness.'* The New Creation's now begun, The Parentage complete; Sons of God, and Morning Stars, Make harmony replete. So we this day will celebrate,— Renew the Sacred Story; 'Peace on earth, good will to man,' And unto God give glory. We'll bless our consecrated home With blessing that's perpetual; Bless the aged and the youth, And call this place Emmanuel. Those other Sheep not of this fold, Are ours with special blessing; Whose loving hearts and lib'ral hands, Are blest, ten fold, in giving. Alfred, Me.
