HAPPINESS. BY BISHOP HEBER. One morning in the month of May, I wandered o'er the hill; Though nature all around was gay, My heart was heavy still. Can God, I thought, the just, the great, These meaner creatures bless, And yet deny to man's estate The boon of happiness? Tell me, ye woods, ye smiling plains, Ye blessed birds around, In which of nature's wide domains Can bliss for man be found? The birds wild carolled overhead, The breeze around me blew, And nature's awful chorus said No bliss for man she knew. I questioned Love, whose early ray So rosy bright appears, And heard the timid genius say His light was dimmed by tears. I questioned Friendship : Friendship sighed And thus her answer gave :The few whom fortune never turned Were withered in the grave. I asked if Vice could bliss bestow? Vice boasted loud and well, But, fading from her withered brow, The borrowed roses fell. I sought of Feeling, if her skill Could soothe the wounded breast; And found' her mourning, faint and still, For others' woes distressed. I questioned Virtue : Virtue sighed, No boon could she dispense ; Nor Virtue was her name, she cried, But humble Penitence. I questioned Death,â€”the grizzly shade Relaxed his brow severe; And 'I am happiness,' he said, 'If Virtue guides thee here.'
