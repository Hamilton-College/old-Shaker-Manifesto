AUTUMN. By Ada S. Cummings. Come friends who love the autumn time And take a stroll with me; Down on the shores of S. D. lake, And view the scenery. The leaves are turning brown and gold, Combined with green and red; While every tint of color bright Seems waving over head. The trees, so grand and beautiful Are mirrored from the shore, When the waters of the lake are still, And the sun is shining o'er. We'll linger here a moment now, To us 'tis great delight, For everywhere we turn our eyes The woods are gay and bright. The scenes of autumn beautiful We love them in their prime With zephyrs sighing thro' the trees In indian summer time! And as we gaze enraptured thus On wood and lake so gay, One thought unbidden comes, how soon The beauty fades away! THE MANIFESTO. 267 And trees enrobed in loveliness Must then be stripped and bare For even now the wintry blast Is lurking in the air. These autumn days are warning us Of winter sure to be, When all the leaves have fallen off From every branch and tree. Thus earthly friends are leaving us Their autumn being past; And thus the winter of our lives Will come to us at last. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
