RESIST BEGINNINGS TO EVIL. Argument for Total Abstinence. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. It is a settled conclusion among well informed people that the brain is the organ of the mind. As such, its tub stance is necessarily quite soft, that it may easily respond to the thought or will of its ethereal occupant and control, whose instrument it is. Chemical analysis shows that it contains near the same proportion of water, as the blood, which is fluid, aud the reason the brain is not fluid is because of the organized and fibrous texture of its solid constituents. According to Fremy, about one third of its solid matter is albumen. The white, or transparent, jelly like substance of eggs, is albumen and water. Alcohol, in contact with soft albumen, coagulates or hardens it, somewhat as strong heat hardens the white of an egg. Aud though alcohol may not render the albumen as hard as a hard boiled egg, it will make it harder than it is in its natural state in the brain. It is reported of a noted anatomist, that he said he could tell a drunkard's braiu in the darkest night, the moment he stuck his knife into it, by its unnatural hardness. How was this produced, and what effect does it have upon the manifestation of mind ? Beverages that contain alcohol, when habitually drank, yield their alcohol to the blood, in which it displaces a certain amount of water. It is carried by the blood to the brain, which it serves to harden, and render impermeable to the finer aud nobler sentiments of the mind. The religious faculties, of reverence, conscientiousness, firmness, hope, spirituality, brothel ly and sisterly kindness, and ideality, so far as the latter relates to culture, refinement, aud good taste, though pleasurably stimulated at first by the increased effort of the vital organs to expel the poison from the system, are ultimately paralyzed, killed at the top, like a tree whose central top having died, is smitten with decay at the heart. A blight also gradually settles upon the intellectual and reasoning faculties. Thus a kind of vivisection is performed between the rational, aspiring faculties, located in the crown of ^the head for the government of the soul, and the coarse, strong, selfish, brutal propensities, located in the base of the brain to furnish power for the use of the higher, which were ordained to contro' and direct, same as an engineer controls steam and directs it to accomplish use ful ends. In the case of the hard drinker, the engineer is- thrust out, and the basilar faculties which were made only to serve, assume entire control, because these alone have sufficient strength to impress the brain in its hardened and enfeebled state. The truth of this statement is constantly being demonstrated by the conduct of inveterate topers toward family and friends. If a long course of excessive drinking produces this result, moderate, drinking of alcoholic stimulants, is oil the road to it, and after the natural barriers of the system to the introduction of intoxicants, are broken down, the effects differ only in a degree. Moral. If you have not begun to use such beverages, abstain forever from the first draught. He who avoids the first ï¿½step in a wrong course, will never take the second nor auy that would follow. If the habit is already formed, or the taste acquired, resolve instantly to break off immediately. Be thou henceforth a total abstainer, for the good of your friends, for the good of your country, for the good of humanity, and for your own best good now and ever after. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
