The Children's Grotto A LESSON FOR BOYS One day a fine Newfoundland dog and a mastiff had a sharp discussion over a bone or some other trifling matter, and warred away as angrily as two boys. They were fighting on a bridge; and being blind with rage, as is often the case, the first thing they knew over they went into the water. The banks were so high that they were forced to swim some distance before they came to a landing place. It was very easy for the Newfoundlander; he was as much at home in the water as a seal. But not so poor Bruce ; he struggled and tried his best to swim, but made little headway. Old Bravo (the Newfoundlander) had reached the land, and then turned to look at his old enemy. He saw plainly that his strength was fast failing, and that he was likely to drown. So what should that noble fellow do but plunge in, seize him gently by the collar, and, keeping his nose above water, tow him safely into port!
