Shearing Sheep .â€”Early shearing is considered best by most flock masters, and the rule is to begin the operation without delay as soon as the weather will permit. Sheep are usually relieved of their coats by handshearing, tedious and hard work for both man and beast, but care on the part of the operator greatly reduces the inconvenience and suffering to which the animals are subjected afterward. It pays in every sense of the word to handle the sheep carefully and to avoid slashing into flesh as well as wool. There are machines in the market which cut the fleece evenly and shear about ten sheep per hour. Before shearing, all dirt and straw should be removed from the sheen's feet, and any matted tags and locks of wool that require washing, cut off. Shearing is sometimes done on a bench or platform, but the usual plan is to set the sheep on the rump on a smooth, clean floor. The wool is now sheared from its neck and fore-shoulders, then the animal is laid upon one side and the upper side sheared, then turned over and the wool removed from the other side. Good sharp shears are necessary to a rapid and perfect performance of the work, and great care is required to shear the wool reasonably close without cutting the skin. A good shearer does not make second cuts ; the fact that weol had been left by the first cut is evidence that the shears were not properly held, and the wool removed by the second cut is worthless. It therefore is to the farmer's interest that skillful shearers be employed for this important work. When a sheep has received injury by unavoidable cuts in shearing it is advised that tar be smeared over the injured places to prevent flesh flies from depositing their eggs. The loss of their woolly coats is seriously felt by sheep for the first few days, and then it is that many diseases are incurred.
