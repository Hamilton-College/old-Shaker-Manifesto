LITTLE ALLAN'S SELF-JUDGMENT 'Allan ! Where is Allan V' A moment ago he was playing with his little cart in the yard, hauling dirt to the currant bushes I cannot tell how many cartfuls he carried. He was as busy as a little man. But Allan was gone ; there is his cart. 'Allan! Allan!' ' I'se here,' at last said a small voice from the back parlor. 'What are you therefor?' asked his mother, opening the door and looking in. Allan did not answer at first. He was standing in the corner with a very sober look on his face ' Come out to your little cart,' said his mother, ' it is waiting for another run.' ' I'se not been here long 'nuff,' said the little boy. ' What are you here for at all?' asked his mother. ' I punishing my own self. I picked some green currants, and they went into my mouth,' said Allan. 'Oh! when mother told you not to! Green currants will make my little boy sick,' said his mother, in a sorry tone. ' You needn't punish me,' said Allen, ' I punish my own self.' 'His mother often put him in the back parlor alone when he had been a naughty boy, and, you see, he took the same way himself. ' Are you not sorry for disobeying mother?' she asked Allan. ' I sorry, but sorry is not 'nuff. I punish me. I stay here a good while and thinks.' Is not Allan right ? Sorry, if it is only sorry, is not enough. How often children say they are sorry, and yet go and do the same thing again. That is a very short, shallow sorrow. Allan felt this, so he was for making serious work of it.
