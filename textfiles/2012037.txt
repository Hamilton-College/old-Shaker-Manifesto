To My Dear Brethren and Sisters, As far as I... To My Dear Brethren and Sisters. As far as 1 have the power and ability to do good, in tilings spiritual or temporal 1 will devote it to the cause of truth and right. To be faithful and true, in all things according to the best of my understanding. I seek not tor worldly honors nor for fame, but ahove all things 1 desire the love of my gospel companions, with these I delight to dwell; they are my light, my love, my all, May I have and share their love in this life and take it with me to the great beyond, is my prayer. George B. Price.
