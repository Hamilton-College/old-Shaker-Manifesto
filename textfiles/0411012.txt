The advocates of vegetarianism make out a plausible case... The advocates of vegetarianism make out a plausible case for their theory. They say the Scotch and Irish contrive to breed some of the finest specimens of men and women in the world on vegetable diet, and we have heard it stated that the Scotch have shown symptoms of degeneration in cases where they have abandoned the oldfashioned oat-meal porridge in favor of the modern dietary of butcher's meat and tea. Again, the Finns, who are mostly vegetarians in ttieir diet, are a well-grown race, while the flesh-eating Laplanders, inhabiting the same climate, are almost dwarfs. Further, it is claimed that vegetarians enjoy especial immunity from sickness, and are rarely if ever attacked by epidemic disease. The adoption of vegetarianism puts an end at once to much of the torture inflicted on the brute creation, the bleeding of calves, the crimping of cod, the skinning of eels, the boiling alive of shell-fish, besides all the more legitimate butchery of the slaughter-house ; and it saves people from the risk of illness produced by eating tainted or diseased meat.
