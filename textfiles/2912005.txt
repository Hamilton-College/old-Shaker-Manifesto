OUR MOTHER ANN HISTORY informs us that Mother Ann Lee, landed on the American shores with her band of loyal volunteers, one hundred and twenty-five years ago. From that event we date the birth of religious freedom for woman, in this, our favored land. Although we love to read the history and life of Mother Ann Lee and her labors of love, a century of events can hardly cancel from thought the memory of the cruelties she suffered, or repress the rising tear as we realize she was only a woman like ourselves by nature, but who by the grace of God, became a marvel of goodness to her people. We revere her memory ! 'Many daughters have done virtuously ; but thou excellest them all.' Many are her followers who have perpetuated in their lives the principles which she taught. Many spiritual mothers have arisen during the last one hundred years whose posterity to-day, rise up and call them blessed. THE MANIFESTO. 181 Those who embrace and live according to the universal principles upon which the virgin church is founded, are able to perfect a spiritual fatherhood and motherhood which far transcends in wealth of affection and genuine love that of which a mere child of nature can boast. Let us faithfully perpetuate their practical Christian teachings that the youth of the dawning century now so near may realize from our life consecrations, other Mother Ann's who will walk the same highway of Christian excellence and thus continue to perpetuate the kingdom of heaven life here upon the earth.
