Elder Henry:--Your favor of the 6th... Bangor, Me. Aug. 7, 1894. Elder Henry:Your favor of the 6th inst. came to my house to-day. I am working in my Master's cause to help set free his erring children of earth and I have no time of my own to go and see you. Work, eternal work, not prayers, is what is going to free the captives bound in chains of darkness, and in prison. We can not bring in the Millennium in any other way than by working for it, and it is my opinion that we shall not have to work one third as long, if we go to work in earnest, to bring it in, as the people have been in praying for it. Faith and prayer are of but little account without works. We must plant and cultivate in order to have a harvest. The Shakers have been praying for nearly fifty years for an increase, and all this time have been growing less. Now let them go to work in real earnest regardless of dollars and cents, to bring it about, and I believe their efforts will be greatly rewarded. 'Perpetual vigilance is the price of liberty.' All that is worth having is worth laboring for, and the article of our good brother, A. W. Dowe, in the July Manifesto is right to the point and if all the Believers of the several Societies would act up to it they would become a power in the land for the liberation of mankind, from ages of errors and superstition. Your brother forever, to spread the light of truth, Simon Emery.
