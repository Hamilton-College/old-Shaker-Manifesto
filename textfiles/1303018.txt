EFFECTS OF CHRIST'S WORK. The effects of the work of Christ are even to the unbeliever indisputable and historical. It expelled cruelty; it disbanded passion ; it branded suicide; it punished and repressed an execrable infanticide; it drove the shameless impurities of heathendom into a congenial darkness : There was hardly a class whose wrongs it did not remedy. It rescued the gladiator; it freed the slave; it protected the captive ; it nursed the sick ; it sheltered the orphan; it elevated woman ; it shrouded, as with a halo of sacred innocence, the tender years of the child. In every region of life its ameliorating influence was felt. It changed pity from vice, into a virtue. It elevated poverty from a curse into a beatitude. It ennobled labor from a vulgarity, into a duty. It revealed, for the first time, the angelic beauty and purity of which men had despaired, and of meekness which they utterly scoffed. It created the veiy conception of charity, and broadened the limits of its obliga'ion from the narrow circle of a neighborhood to the widest horizon of the race. And while it thus involved the idea of humanity as a common brother-hood, even where its tidings were not believed, all over the world, wherever its tidings were believed, it cleansed the life and elevated the soul of each individual man. And in all lands, where it has moulded the characters of its true believers, THE MANIFESTO. it has created hearts so pure, and lives so peaceful, and homes so sweet, that it migh seem as though those angels who had herald ed its advent, had also whispered to every despairing and depressed sufferer among the sons of men; 'though you have lain among the pots, yet shall ye be as wings of a dove that is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.'
