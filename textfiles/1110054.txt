PUT DOWN MOURNING The wearing of mourning for departed friends is a terrible mistake. Our descendants will smile at our infatuation, when it will be understood that the going away should be as lovable as the coming. When our death will be a healthful passing, and ending, we shall look eye into eye, grasping hand to hand to the last, and go with joy and cheerfulness. If it is nature's law, it is nature's design ; if it is nature's design, it has a purpose in it, and why should we be mournful at that ? Off with those poor, worldly, black clothes; put on white and blue or rose and see that best beloved to the grave. There is no need to mourn ; why ? Why go about quarreling with divine plan ? These black, heavy clothes on frail, delicate women in our burning streets are really terrible indications of short-sightedness and want of real love for the divine ordinances. They make one shudder to think of the poor over-burdened body under them, and the weary soul that must be there too. When one has passed away, let the other be up and doing, but not go about mourning and feeling as if he or she had not gone, because go they must. The thought of death is lovelier than that of birth. We never know what the latter may bring to that new-born child ; we are sure, quite sure, that the former will bring us ' time's completion.'â€”Health and Home.
