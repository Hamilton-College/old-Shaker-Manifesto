Oyster Pie The Religious Telescope asks us: 'Will you have some oysters ? ' and treats us to the following : .â€”Line a dish with puff-paste or a rich biscuit-paste, and dredge well with flour; drain one quart of oysters, season with pepper, salt, and butter, and pour into the dish ; add some of the liquor ; dredge with flower, and cover with a top crust, leaving a small opening in the center.
