ERECTION OF THE SQUARE HOUSE, NO. 2. By Eunice Bathrick. MOTHER ANN and those who came with her from Niskeyuna, now Watervliet, arrived at Harvard in the latter part of June, 1781. They soon came to the 'Square House,' but were coldly received by the followers of Ireland, in consequence of having been disappointed in their former leader. They said they did not want to be deceived again by a people, whom they had heard held corresponding doctrines to those advanced by Ireland. Before the setting of the sun, Mother and the Elders had gained their love and were made welcome, and ever after found a home and firm supporters in that place while they remained on earth. The house and farm were deeded to Shadrach Ireland and he kept it without conveyance to any one, but as most of the doners or contributors embraced the gospel, no trouble was experienced on this account, till David Hoar made known to Shadrach's lawful heirs the state of the case. The heirs accordingly came and made their demands, putting Mother and the Elders to much trouble, from which they could not get free except by paying a large sum of money. Mother Ann wishing to retain the right of the place paid as her share $144. (one hundred and forty-four dollars.) The other Believers united by their contributions and secured the residence. Some thirty other Brethren and Sisters made contributions to the fund. It appears that the testimony brought forward by Ireland, and manifested by his disciples to the world had served to arouse a spirit of bitterness against it so that when Mother Ann came forth with a greater light and testimony against sin the spirit of bitterness was prepared to oppose it to its fullest extent. While the preceeding work had prepared a people for the gospel who received it with gladness, it had also prepared others to oppose the same testimony, and rather than be annoyed by a testimony which condemned them for their sins it is no wonder that there should be formed a combined force to drive the subjects from the town of Harvard. It appears that these people were prepared to persecute and were one generation older in bitterness than were to be found in any other place where the gospel was planted. By their united exertions they desired, if possible, to overthrow the work of God. The Square House was raised in August, 1769, in the night, and in so quiet a manner that not even their children knew it at the time of its erection. Jemima Blanchard, an adopted daughter of Isaac Willard, who was then living in his family, said she frequently carried refreshments to the workmen, but some one always met her when half way there, so that she never saw them at work but once. Jemima was then about twelve years of age. The principal builders and proprietors were David Hoar, Isaac Willard, Abel Jewett, sen., Zacheus Stevens and Malabar Bean. Several others made small contributions, but the above named persons resided in Harvard and its vicinity. Everything in relation to Ireland was conducted with the greatest secrecy. His followers seldom used his name before each other, but called him 'The Man.' Abigail Lougee, Shadrach's spiritual companion, was still living at the Square House when Mother Ann arrived. Mother manifested a very tender care for Abigail, who died before Mother Ann left Harvard. The money paid to Shadrach's heirs for the Square House and farm was added to their other property and laid out in building a large and spacious house, which was not long afterward burned to the ground. The Square House was not fiuisht, until done by Believers after Mother Ann's arrival. The South west chamber has pannel work in it now which was done by Shadrach Ireland. The present stair-railing and posts are supposed to be his work. The deed of the house and farm was given to Shadrach in confidence, to be held as a united and consecrated property for the use of those who consecrated it, and for their security in the faith which they had espoused ; but for lack of such specification in the deed, they lost it. The following are the names of the persons who paid toward the purchase of the Square House and farm ;ï¿½ Mother Ann Lee. $144.19. Jonathan Clark. 2.00. Amasa Turner. 10.00 PMnehas Ames. 9.00.

In the year 1805 the Square House was repaired, re-shingled and clapboarded ; the porch on the north side taken away and a new one b.iilt. In 1835 the roof was altered and slated, the chimneys taken down and rebuilt, and considerable work done inside the house. The building, however, still retains its former name, 'Square House.'
