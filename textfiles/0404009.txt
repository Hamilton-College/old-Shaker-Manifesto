The Terror of the Inquisition Gone The Inquisitorial halls of Rome have rung lately with words that contrast marvelously with the entreaties, cries and groans which they have heard in other days. Father Grassi, the priest who was recently converted at Rome, has appeared before the Tribunal of the Holy Inquisition, and in the course of an exultant justification of his course, he uttered the following words, which must have burned into the very hearts of some of the priests present. 'In this room, to-day, I come to bear witness to the truth, and you no longer have the power to touch a hair of my head; you have lost all authority; the work of God has commenced; and soon these walls, these chambers, these instruments of torture and this tribunal will be ground like so much dust under our feet. Now listen to what God has promised to do here in Uoine against the enemies of his church. Here is the infallible order that God sends to the Roman believers: 'The God of Peace will soon grind Satan under his feet.' Do you not tremble at these words of the Lord? Is it not Satan who has imposed and directed so many judgments, so many tortures, so many butcheries and massacres in these very rooms? But already Satan begins to be conquered; the torch of the dog of the Inquisition is forever extinguished, the breath of God has blown upon it, and from this time forth it can never more be ignited.'
