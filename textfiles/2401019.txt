Enfield, N. H. Dec. 1893. Already we have turned the last page, bearing record of the grand old year of 1893, and while we witness its departure, rife with the wonderful events that have marked its progress, our hearts are made glad in the realization that so much is being done by the noble workers throughout the broad universe of God, to spread a knowledge of the truth that maketh free, bringing as a result, righteousness to the hearts of the children of men. Let us awaken, who are called to be the sons and daughters of the resurrection, lest we be found lacking that power which alone gives victory to the soul. We would return our grateful thanks to all who send greetings for the New Year, while we would express the same to our kindred everywhere. Since December came in we have expe- rienced a real touch of genuine winter weather; quite a big foretaste as we view it. We have sufficient snow to make sleighing practicable. Our winter's supply of wood is being drawn to the sheds ready for use, and if the weather-wise have made no mistake, we shall find need for its consumption, before the balmy days of spring visit us again. Our Brethren are in the mill at work on the corn planters; they have a contract for six hundred the present season. Sisters find employment in the various places where duty calls, striving to make the home with all its surroundings an honor to the profession we make, trusting that the blessing of heaven will rest upon every effort in the cause of good.
