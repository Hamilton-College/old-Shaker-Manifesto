NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. The past month has been anything but peaceful and quiet with us. Have made quite a revolution in our laundry and laundry building. Taking out two old boilers, replacing with a steam boiler and fixing over some store-roonis into work-shops. In our Second House have taken down one chimney and built a larger one in its place; set a boiler in the cellar and are now engaged putting in pipes and radiators. Well, just after we got fairly under way, what should come along but his i-f-r-n-1 majesty La Grippe. He soon tried to take hold of every one but there were a few that could not be gripped and he was given such a hot watery reception, inside and out that he had to flee. If we had known of his coming we probably should not have had our chimney down ; this opened the avenue and made it easy for La Grippe to seize on those, who with mop and broom were fighting amidst dust and dirt in the draughty hall and rooms. We got started and could but go on. And the weather, oh the weather! the like was never known before. What a story we that are younsr will have to tell in the next century. If this world and the weather are only the effects of spiritual causes, what reformation in the world of cause will have to take place before our earth will be a paradise. W' need not wait to die, (leave our mortal bodies) before we enter the spiritual world of cause. There are many now upon the earth who are laboring to remove spiritual causes, that the direful effects manifested on earth in human conditions may cease. When this is done, no doubt the weather and all other unprofitable conditions will be greatly improved. The Feb. Manifesto was right on time, we were thinking it would be behind on account of La Grippe. It is good, and some articles very excellent; there is one word in 'Glory to the Eighteous,' that is a mistake. It should read who can know their worth; not work. In kindest love, D. O. Enfield, Conn. Our home market for stove and furnace wood is excellent. Wood means warmth, and so dots food. There is life in heat, and. all life must have food of some kind Then there is a food of the mind and soul as well as of the body. It wont do to forget that. Growth is the law of life, and all growth must have something to feed on. To grow good and do good, to well perform our duties the brain must work as well as the hands. As a rule, the best disciplined people will do the best work at the best time and in the best way. Most farmers cultivate too much land for the amount of manure applied. Less land with the same amount of manure will produce almost the same quantity of crops with a great reduction of labor. When sulphur is added to the soft feed for hens during the moulting season, it makes a good tonic. It purifies the blood and is the principal property in the growth of new feathers. Sulphur is a useful article. In orthodoxy it is said to be 'the purifier of sins.' The poultry man may not need sulphur so much as the hens, and therefore it is recommended for the latter. D. Orcutt. Harvard, Mass. I gratefully acknowledge the mutual benefit derived from 'notes about home' through the medium of the Manifesto. The results of experience and experiments in every department of life interest all�are aids to help keep abreast of the improvements of the times. Success and failures are our educators. Lessons of warning should prevent running our heads against the same post�the post of 'ill luck' too often. So we may all profit by information, investigation and observation, often saving time and trouble. There has been some changes and improvements in Society recently. And had we the experience at the start, that we now have, we might have done better with less expense. We have painted nine buildings in the Church family, four at the South family. Have put up a wind-mill for pumping water at the Euial Home. Piped the house and barn, enlarged the ice house, repaired and painted the buildings. Put in a new stone dam, layed in cement at the saw mill. Built a silo, and repaired the barn generally. Have laid a new system of sewerage for the main dwelling, with six inch Akron pipe. Have utilized the hitherto useless room in the basement of the Herb House, by putting in a twenty horse boiler, and a six horse engine, for heating dwelling, shop and bathroom, and power for the herb business, and laundry. Have arranged two bath-rooms closets, &amp;c, &amp;c. The laundry drying room is a highly appreciated success. The room is 8x8 feet and 8 feet high has seven double clothes racks. The drying is done by exhaust steam, with an eighteen inch fan to produce circulation, and carry away the moisture. The clothes are all dry soon afier the washing ii done. I wish to express my gratitude to my many kind and solicitous friends, some of whom came to see me in my late illness. Elijah Myrick. [The above is the last contribution that Elder Elijah sent to the Manifesto, only a few days before his death. Ed.] Shirley, Mass. Eeb. 3, 1890. If, 'Wh^re the heart feels most, the pen moves least,' will stand for a truth as well as of the 'lips,' the Brethren and Sisters at Shirley Mass, may perhaps be given credit for a great deal of feeling. We know there are a few faithful souls here who have a great deal of feeling for the welfare of all their gospel kindred, and would join gladly in kindest and heartiest greetings to them, in all the heights of Zion. Jesus said of his disciples�'If ye were of the world, the world would love his own, but because ye are not of the world, the world hateth you.' If the world of to-day, loves Believers, what does it mean? Has the world improved, or is the other result inferred, proved to be a fact? In any case we ought to love each other, and not neglect all opportunities of making it manifest. Hence these few lines. Winter thus far very mild, with slight exceptions, though from Jan'y 28th. to Feb. 1st. inclusive was well improved in drawing logs to mill. A large portion of next season's wood sawed, split and partly under cover. Apple Sauce, one of our specialties, in very good demand. Not more than one well defined case of 'La Grippe' among the Brethren and Sifters, while all around us, the people have suffered greatly. J. W. Canterbury, N. H. Feb. 1890. Elder Oliver Hampton of Union Village sends us a sprig of blooming myrtle, taken from the plant in front of their dwelling. We fear the little flower will regret its mid-winter advent. H. C. 13. Ofjr Beloved Elder Henry :�Did you ever tell a straight forward honest story and while it was even fresh with printers' ink need to tell another exactly opposite, both equally true�halves of one great whole? Such is our case. When we reported good health for Canterbury last month, we wrote truthfully. Close upon the same, however, came an attack of the prevailing 'epidemic.' S-i:h a serio-comic experience! We will not say much about it, as we do not believe in transmitting disease even at the point of the pen. We confess to have been taken by surprise. Luckily for us, however, that we are all on the upward grade, without serious or fatal results, is truth for to-day. Sin u!d a similar attack ensue, profiting by our last lesson, we hope to show better tactics in parrying the blow or dealing with the unwelcome visitor. Our sisters at the North Family, meanwhile, pursued the 'even tenor of their way' at shirt-making for a firm in Boston, enjoying uninterrupted health. This gave us who live a little lower down the street, much pleasure and satisfaction in looking up to the North as bearing away the palm. Winter with us singularly open. But little snow, sleet and rain predominating. Ice harvest occurred on the 6th. and 7th. inst. Amount stored, 100 tons solid. Ice cut bymachinery into cakes 22x22 16 in. thick, supplying our S iciety and neighbors at the same time. Elder Alexander and company are sawing wood with the 'Cleveland Engine,' sixhorse power, averaging twenty-five cords daily. The ring of the saw fills the air with pleasant music. More devoted hearts or willing hands are rarely found. Hosiery knittHg by sisters progressing. Machines in successful operation. Our Distiict School closed its winter term the 14th. inst. Examined by S. S. Committee of the town. Good work by both teacher and pupils. Accuracy and thoroughness the leading characteristics. Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1890. Beloved Elder H :�We like the idea of each Society being represented in the Manifesto, indeed, it is one of the pleasant means of knowing more of the home life of our gospel friends. We should be better satisfied, however, if we could be favored with a real visit from the dear friends, and share a union of the spirit that would assist both parties to feel better able to continue in the good way of peace and righteousness. In our morning service on the Sabbath we were invited to speak of the good in each other, and of our many blessings, so that when the beloved Ministry visit us, you may find that we are on the right road to the kingdom of our God. The cutting of the supply of fire wood for next winter is nearly finished, and from our estimate, we think it is consumed faster than it grows. The ice harvest for this season was early and satisfactory, and the houses have been filled with a good article from the Mascoma Lake, fifteen inches thick. Kindly, Ella Briggs. North Family. All are hurrying to make the most of the good sleighing. Some of the teams are hauling logs from the woods, which may be fifty feet long. The butchering of animals for food is still continued and attended to promptly. Several hands are at work in the factory, and are making some very nice pails and tubs. As yet the influenza wave has not disturbed us. Groveland, N. Y. Feb. 3, 1890. We are thinking just now, what manner of report we can give of home proceedings that will most interest the reader. While we are pondering and exchanging one idea for another, this ''happy thought' reaches us. Make out a programme of the evening's entertainments. So here we give them. Sunday evenings are devoted, alternately, to Prayer and Singing meetings. Monday to family Readings and Recitations. Tuesday to Vocal and Instrumental music. Wednesday, Bible Class, conducted by Elder Alexander L. Work and Ella E. Winship. Thursday, Readings and Recitations by William H. Bussell. Friday, Vocal and Instrumental music. Saturday, Religious Service. Thus closes each day in some profitable way. The Society supports a 'Select School.' Winter term commenced Nov. 26th. Scholars manifest a general interest in their studies, much to the pleasure of the teacher and credit of the school. Number of scholars in attendance, 12. School taught by Ella E. Winship. Arrangements have been made for renovating the reservoirs, which action was promptly responded to by some of the enterprising members. A few days labor completed the whole. We are now rewarded with cisterns well supplied from the copious rains that soon followed. Our principal source of water for laundry and all domestic purposes is that which ''cometh down from above' and with filters for purifying it we find the most refreshing life-giving and healthful beverage that can bless humanity. Our herdsman commenced feeding ensilage to the stock January 1st. The creatures appear to relish it, and seem to think (if they do think) they are living sumptuously. We are having plenty of weather, but are puzzled to know the kind. Whether it is Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall. We experience each day some of them all. G. D. G. Union Village, Ohio. Feb. 1890. We are cutting and sawing wood, feeding stock and sometimes trying to husk corn and haul fodder, but the mud is so deep that the teams cannot draw more than the empty wagon, most of the time. It will get better after a while. For,� 'Ever the right comes uppermost, And ever is justice done.' G. MassieO. C. H. White Water, O. Feb. 6, 1890. Southern Ohio has shared extremely mild weather, for winter, thus far, except four or five days which were tolerably cold. One morning the thermometer was down to 10 degrees above Zero, at present 63 degrees above. Little prospect for the luxury of ice for next summer. The measles have prevailed some among the children and a i'rw cases with a lults. The La Grippe continues in rather a mild form. We have built an engine house with sides and roof of iron, and have put into our family dwelling a Da) ton Furnace Go's Challenge furnace, No 2. So far it does good service. We have diied upwards of 3500 lbs. of apples and pears, and have sold nearly the whole lot at 7 cts. per lb. II. B. B.
