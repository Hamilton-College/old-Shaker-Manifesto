White Water, O. Feb. 6, 1890. Southern Ohio has shared extremely mild weather, for winter, thus far, except four or five days which were tolerably cold. One morning the thermometer was down to 10 degrees above Zero, at present 63 degrees above. Little prospect for the luxury of ice for next summer. The measles have prevailed some among the children and a i'rw cases with a lults. The La Grippe continues in rather a mild form. We have built an engine house with sides and roof of iron, and have put into our family dwelling a Da) ton Furnace Go's Challenge furnace, No 2. So far it does good service. We have diied upwards of 3500 lbs. of apples and pears, and have sold nearly the whole lot at 7 cts. per lb. II. B. B.
