Our sister's gone to join the throng... Our Sister's gone to join the throng Of saints and angels bright, To roam with them 'mid fadeless fields, All robed with love and light. To rest with them beneath the shade Of life's fair, blooming Tree; With placid waters rolling by, And sing of liberty. J. Emily Smith.
