Only Only a seed—but it chanced to fall In a little cleft of a city wall, And taking root, grew bravely up, Till a tiny blossom crowned its top. Only a flower—but it chanced that day That a burdened heart passed by that way; And the message that through the flower was sent, Brought the weary soul a sweet content. For it spake of the lilies so wondrously clad ; And the heart that was tired grew strangely glad At the thought of a tender care over all, That noted even a sparrow's fall. Only a thought—but the work it wrought Could never by tongue or pen be taught; For it ran through a life, like a thread of gold; And the life bore fruit—an hundred fold. Only a word— but 'twas spoken in love, With a whispered prayer to the Lord above; And the angels in heaven rejoiced once more; Fora new-born soul ' entered in by the door.'
