WITH CARE We find the following in the History of Cumberland Co., Me. 'In the book of written rules for the observance of the members of the community, the first one, written in a bold hand, is the following. ' 'Believers (Shakers) must not run in debt to the world, and any one, even a Trustee, who departs from the rule is held personally responsible for the debt so contracted, and the Society will not hold itself responsible ; and of this fact the Leaders keep the public well informed, by frequently publishing it in the leading Newspapers that circulate where the Shakers do business in the form of a Declaration and Caution to the public.'
