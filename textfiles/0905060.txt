Care of the Orchard 'Young orchards should be cultivated and manured for the first ten years, when they will bear good crops if properly handled,' wrote M. C. Baldwin, of Chemung, N. Y., in a letter to the Elmira (N. Y.) Farmers' Club, on the management of orchards. For twenty years he left the wormy fruit that dropped from his trees on the ground, when the apples became so wormy and small that he was obliged to change this practice. For the past three years he has turned in sheep and hogs; they have eaten the drops, and, he thinks, destroyed the worms. For trees that need cultivation he throws manure or coarse mulch around them, and the hogs root it up and turn it over and over again until it is thoroughly mixed. He stacked his stalks and coarse fodder, and fed all in the orchard, and also draws coarse manure there, such as tobacco stalks, straw or mulch. Leached ashes is considered first rate, and a little lime is pronounced beneficial. The result is, that his fruit is clean, free from worms, smooth and handsome, and the trees bear great crops. President Hoffman said that many of the orchards of Western New York are treated as Mr. Baldwin treats his. Mr. Barry thinks that the ravages of the coddling moth are materially lessened when pigs and sheep have been allowed free run. Joseph Harris, he believed, also approved of this practice. Some farmers leave their orchards without cultivation, but keep the surface of the ground well scarified by using sharp drags freely. If the land is set with grass, President Hoffman had no doubt but that good results would follow such treatment.
