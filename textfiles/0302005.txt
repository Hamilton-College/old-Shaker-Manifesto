We receive requests like the following : ' I should like to see some of the internal workings of your Order published in your very excellent paper, if consistent with your rules, etc. I feel satisfied that your mode of life has a purifying tendency, producing a contentment and love that the world knows not of.' In this number we shall somewhat minister to this demand. Novitiate experience ofT. Stroud, of Enfield, Connecticut. He thus writes: ' December, 1871. On the 6th inst., thinking to confess what I believed to be the last of my bad sins and thoughts, and feeling that, in my own strength, it was impossible — that, indeed, it was like taking my life — I entered into such a labor of prayer as before I had never been able to bring myself to. I knelt, in strong cries to God, was absorbed in intense abstraction ; and there fell upon me a remarkable power, as of a wave of electricity flowing through me. It came and went suddenly, and another succeeded. * * * I went in all earnestness, and confessed in deep humility. At night, a few minutes after retiring to rest, this power returned, filling my muscular system, as though charged from a strong elec- tric battery. I remember that I lay and speculated upon the nature of this spiritual operation. The shocks lasted in full force for two and one-half minutes, and the effects for hours. The charging process commenced in my breast, and proceeded upwards to the top of my head, and downwards to the tips of my fingers and the ends of my toes. ' Knowing that there was no visible agency to create electricity, I was forced to the conclusion that it came from an invisible source. But, whether directed by some intelligent beings or agents, under some general law or otherwise, I am unable to determine. It has been often repeated, but always when my mind and feelings have been earnestly engaged in endeavoring to gain power over some evil passion or propensity of my fallen nature.'
