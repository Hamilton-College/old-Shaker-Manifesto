DIARY. No. 2. A Trip to Sodus Bay, N. Y. BY ELDER BENJ. WHITCHER. Junk 21st. We visit the school. The teacher is a sister from the Society and has under her charge thirteen active pupils. We are interested in their exercises and listened with pleasure to their recitations. At the Center Family we find some twenty two members. Leaving this place we visit Bisco Cove. Here we see a Birch tree that stands as a monument bearing this inscription. ' William Bisco. Died, May 21, 1791. ' The circumstances attending this singular case are these. At that date three men were employed by the government of the U. S. to run a line due north from the city of Washington, D. C. to the shore of Lake Ontario. They had proceeded as far as Thornton's Point, or near that place when one of their number died very suddenly, and the two survivors being in the wilderness, and thirty miles from any inhabitants, were obliged, by necessity, to sharpen sticks with which to dig a grave. The body was enclosed in some bark which they peeled from the trees, before placing it in the earth. The grave is still visible and the inscription legible. We return to the settlement of the Believers at six o'clock, P. M. and are invited to see some Cat fish, weighing eight and ten pounds, also a fish called a Sheep's Head, that weighed four pounds. June 22nd. This is the Sabbath. We attend public service. Some two hundred persons, not of the Society were present. These with the Brethren and Sisters formed a large congregation. A very appropriate address was delivered by Br. Joseph Pelham which occupied about an hour. Several others gave short exhortations. The season spent in this place was spiritually profitable and we are very thankful for our privilege. At three o'clock we attend a meeting of the Society, which continued about two and one half hours. In it were the manifestations of the spirit of God. June 23rd. We visit the quarry where the Believers are obtaining building stone. It is not like the granite stone of New Hampshire but a curious combination of sea shells, insects, and vegetables. We are shown a white wood tree, that measures twenty feet and six inches in circumference. At their mill they are using a spiral vent water wheel. It seems to give good satisfaction but requires more water than an overshot wheel. June 24th. We accompany the Brethren and see them draw a fish net that has been cast in a large pond. Among the lot caught we found a pickerel that weighed eight pounds. There are also some nice specimens of bull heads. This being our last day in the Society, we meet in conference with the Ministry, Elders and Trustees and expressed to them our thankfulness for the kindness and attention that has been shown to us, and receive from them corresponding expressions of love and gospel care. We leave the Believers of Sodus at three o'clock, P. M. and ride to the village of Glide, where we remain over night. June 25th. At an early hour we visit a glass factory, and are very much interested in the blowing of glass. It is a curious sight and a novel feature to all of our company. We wait till eleven o'clock A. M. for a packet, but as the anticipated boat does not arrive, we place our baggage on board the line boat, Equity, Captain Vansiver, and move along slowly. June 26th. At 7.30 A. M. we find ourselves blockaded by boats, and are obliged to stop. At this place we very fortunately met the captain of the packet ' Swan, ' in which boat we sailed from Utica to Lyons on our journey to Sodus. We soon make arrangements with him to take our company on board his boat. Captain Wellington is a gentleman as well as a captain, and gave us the invitation to accompany him to the village of Syracuse, as he thought the drive would be pleasant. We visit the village of Celina where the largest spring of salt water is found that supplies the evaporating establishment at Syracuse. We are informed that the Salt Works cover 180 acres of land, and :hat the salt water is brought to this place, a distance of two miles in wooden aqueducts. These are supplied from a reservoir in the top of a building where the water is forced to a height of eighty feet by powerful machinery, at the rate of 300 gallons per minute. This machinery is propelled by a water wheel, thirty six feet in diameter. We visited the boiling house where there are twenty eight kettles, placed in two rows, and a fire at one end of the range heats the whole number. Four cords of wood is a supply for twenty four hours. The salt when taken from these kettles resembles snow for whiteness. At twelve o'clock we are again on board the ' Packet. ' At 4.30 P. M. we start from the lock at Syracuse. After sailing one mile we reach another lock where we find fifty four boats waiting for the opening of navigation. June 27th. On Friday morning we pass Oriskany, seven miles above Utica, having traveled thirty three miles since nine o'clock last evening. At Utica we leave the 'Swan' and take passage on the 'Delaware. ' In the P. M. we reach the 'Fall Hill Ravine, ' where the walls of rocks are from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in almost perpendicular height. June 28th. We arrive at Schenectady at three o'clock, A. M. and find a carriage ready to take us to Watervliet, and at �.30 A. M. we are once more in company with �our gospel friends. June 20th. It is the Sabbath. A rainy day. We have no public service. At 1.30 P. M. the Church Family hold a religious service in the Meeting House, which was a manifestation of good gifts. June 30th. We leave Watervliet at 5.30 A. M. in company with the Ministry, for New Lebanon, N. Y. and arrive at four o'clock, P. M. July 1st. The Elders of the First Family make us a visit at the Office. We then accompany them to the Family Dwelling and make a general inspection of the building. The rooms are all numbered. The meeting room is well lighted, having three windows on each end and six on the north side. The house is furnished with large, convenient clothes presses, adjoining each room. In the attic are one hundred and seventy drawers, nicely arranged for the storing of clothes. At the mill we see a planing machine which does good work. Nothing of the kind has ever been seen in New Hampshire. The boards are passed through the machine on the edge. In the shoe shop we saw a machine for crimping the legs of boots. It would do the work, for one piece, in two minutes. At the school house we saw twenty five pupils. Most of them are quite young, but gave very good recitations. July 2nd. We visit the Society in Hancock and return to New Lebanon on the 3rd inst. July 4th. Visit at the Second Order in the A. M. and at the Second Family in the P. M. July 6th. Sabbath. We attend the Public Service. Believers from several families were present and a large number of persons not of our order. Proctor Sampson is the speaker and addressed the assembly at length. Several other persons made short exhortations. At 1.30 P. M. we attend the service held by the First and Second Order. It is a beautiful season. The singing and speaking is a gift of spirit life, and the hour of worship is an hour of spiritual devotion. July 8th. Leave New Lebanon for Enfield, N. H. We bid our gospel friends a kind farewell at three o'clock, A. M. and arrived at Shaftsbury, Vt. at five o'clock, P. M. a distance of twenty six miles from New Lebanon. The next day we drive thirty two miles and reach Landgrove, Vt. July 10th. We reach Windsor Vt. at five o'clock P. M. a distance of twenty nine miles. July 11th. We leave Windsor at four o'clock A. M. and arrive at Enfield, N. H. at ten o'clock, A. M. and are made welcome to our own gospel home.
