VISIONS. Seen by Elder J. G. RUSSELL. In the early part of 1888, while lying unconscious of surroundings, I suddenly felt myself gently raised to such an elevation that I seemed to be amid the stars, which appeared more brilliant even than on any beautiful starry eveuing I had ever beheld. I continued to be thus borne upward by the same invisible agency till I reached an indefinite height, where I stopped. Here, the stars appeared far brighter than before, though I fancied that I still heard the hum of industry below me. Presently a voice attracted my attention, addressing me as follows; 'It appears that your work on earth is done and perhaps you feel that you are now ready to enter your spirit home.' I could not respond audibly, but mentally pleaded thus :� 'I was taken ill so suddenly that my work on earth is left in a very unsettled condition, especially my books of account, from which I fear much loss will be realized, unless granted a little more time. If I cau be permitted to return to earth long enough to adjust my business affairs, I shall then be reconciled to enter my final home.' Response to this plea was not given and I remained in anxious suspense. I was then lowered by the same gentle agency. The stars were lost fo view and I was on earth ouce more ; after which I immediately heard a voice saying, ''Permission is given you to remain yet longer on the earth.' This was a comforting assurance. Here the visi�u faded. ****** Several weeks subsequent to the vision mentioned, my mind seemed suddenly forced into a direction so uncertain that; I could not define my position, neither did I know my silent attendant. All was absolutely dark, until I reached a point where the stars again came into view, and I then knew that I was in the same place that in my first vision I learned was to be my spirit home. No sound greeted me here. Soon after realizing my situation, the bright stars apparently vanished and I was again left in darkness. Meantime, these solemn and forcible words came to my mind, 'JN'ouebut the pure in heart can ever find an abode in these heavenly mansions.' Instantly a very bright light shone upon me and I saw directly by my side my true oelf, which I knew at once portrayed my spiritual condition. I compared my standard of purity with the assertion made in the solemn text noted, and found that I was far from being wholly pure. After meditating awhile on this condition, these words were forcibly impressed on my mind, 'Whoever cherishes a spirit of revenge or even an un- kind feeling toward any individual, finds not an abode in the mansions of the blest, until the sin is removed by personal sacrifice.' I again reflected and again heard, 'None can enter in save those who have overcome the world.' This caused me to take a thorough survey of my spiritual attainments, and I found that I was indeed a ' child of wrath.' I now sincerely promised my heavenly attendant that if I was permitted strength and length of days, I would prepare for this lovely abode, by doing that work on the earth which canuot be wrought in spirit life. This light then vanished and when I returned to consciousness I was weeping. Permit me to add that after duly considering the two visions narrated 1 commenced a review of my life, and have made a frank acknowledgement of every error, whether of word or act that I did not consider worthy of the full blessing of the light of God, as revealed to my understanding. I now feel the confidence of the spirit and am sure I shall be able to complete my duties on earth or those connecting me with persons whom I am soon to leave. I am strongly impressed by spirit influence that the work which I have had time to do and do not finish on earth, cannot be as acceptably done in the spirit world, also that I cannot dwell with those who overcame in the form, as did Jesus the pattern, without fully acknowledging my faith in the present revelation of God and leaving a record with some appointed witness that I passed out of this sphere with full reconciliation and forgiveness with all. I wish to leave this testimony on earth and take the spirit of the same with me as my passport to the next phase of life. Enfield, N. H.
