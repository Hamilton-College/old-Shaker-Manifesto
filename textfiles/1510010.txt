DISCIPLINE. NANCY G. DANFORTH. Webster defines discipline as, ' instructing in correct principles and habits. ' Self-discipline is, to so control the natural passions and impulses, as to form good habits of thought and action. If, in the natural order, cultivation is necessary to enable one to pass through life respectable, inasmuch as the kingdom of heaven is higher than earthly kingdoms, so will it take higher degrees of culture in order for the soul to stand free from the clogs of an earthly inheritance. One may pass through life bearing a good moral reputation, still be coarse and rough in manners, speaking in loud harsh tones; may indulge in many unseemly habits, and still be respected by acquaintances. But the gospel of love calls for that discipline and purification of life and affections which will bring more than merely a good reputation but will lay the foundation of character deep in the Christian virtues and graces. This will teach the tongue to utter kind words in gentle tones; the feet to walk softly as in the fear of God; the hands will handle all things as being consecrated, will close doors with care, also be careful not to mar or injure anything that will require time and labor to restore to its former beauty and excellence. The soul that is thus disciplined for Christ's sake and the gospel which he taught, and not for worldy fame or ap)lause will find sweet peace and combrt while dwelling in this clay tenement also the blessed assurance of an increase of happiness as the eternal ages roll on their way relaxing not the discipline till redemption is complete.
