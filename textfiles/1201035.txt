Pork versus ethics From Dr. Foot's Health Monthly. PORK versus ETHICS. By Dr. J. H. Haxaford. Is it right to eat and drink as a depraved appetite may suggest? I claim that no Christian, certainly, has a right to be a glutton, or a winebibber, eating pork, or any article forbidden in the scriptures, any more than he has to lie, swear, or steal. This will seem evident from the command; 'Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.' This is a good illustration of the 'higher law' and must seem strange to those who disregard Lev. II, 7, &amp; 8, and other similar passages. Is it said that such were intended for the Jews? I suppose so, but not for them only, any more than the ten commandments, or any more than the epistle to the Romans was intended for the disciples at Rome only. I suppose that the whole Bible was intended for the whole world, and equally obligatory on Jews and Gentiles. I suppose that the moral laws relating to the diet, cleanliness &amp;c, had sanitary applications and relations, on the principle that the soul is reached through the body, measurably, that physical soundness and purity are necessary conditions and aids to the moral growth. That pork is among the most corrupt and diseased of all meats, no intelligent person will deny, and that it is so difficult of digestion that few, if any, can use it with impuni- ty, is equally certain. As such, it is unfit for human food, while the wild beast scavengers, unless driven almost to desperation by hunger, will not devour the dead hog! The Jew, as a part of his religion, avoids pork as we do profanity and falsehood, and this fact we should infer from his personal appearance and physical purity. He is free from the taint of scrofula, cancer, and 'hu- mors' in general, while the female is as 'fair as a Jewess.' These are significant facts, and give force to the Divine command, and well illustrate its moral appropriateness. Dr. Gibson, of England, medical officer, states 'there is no doubt that a Jew's life in London is worth twice as many years as a Christian's.' The medical officer of one of their large schools has remarked that their children do not die in any thing like the ratio as the Gentile children; and, in the district of White Chapel, the officer has reported that on the north side of High St., occupied by the Jews, the death rate is 20 per, cent, while on the south side, occupied by English and Irish, it is 45, per cent, per 1,000.' This startling fact must find its explanation in the physical condition and habits of these people. Dr. Foot's health monthly
