From the Little Children. Dear Sister D.; Perhaps you would like... Shaker Village, Mer. Co., N. H. June 1886. Dear Sister D.�Perhaps you would like to know about our ramble in the woods. One evening some of us went out to see the apple blossoms. It was a pleasant evening and we all enjoyed the walk very much. The trees looked beautifully�some blossoms were entirely white and others were tinted with pink. They grow in little clusters five or six in one bunch. They all grow to be little tiny green apples, then drop leaving one, and that grows to a nice round apple which I am sure all like to taste. We found some very pretty violets in our walk also. We enjoyed the pleasant evening and the walk very much. I am very much pleased with my garden and will try to keep it from weeds, which grow up so fast. I have planted some Candy Tuft around the edge, and I think it will look very pretty. Once I found a piece of quitch-grass with a root twenty-six inches long. It is very troublesome because when you try to pull it up it sometimes breaks off in the centre and then it grows again. I am very much interested in Arithmetic. The class are to go from page 181 to 207, which takes us over to duodecimals. I will improve the time given to learn and in this way learn to become a good and useful sister. Your cliiid Lizzie. HOW TO MAKE TALLOW CANDLES. First we get some candle wicking and double it and twist the lower end and put on little sticks; we then take some babery tallow and beeswax and melt it. We then take these sticks and dip them, they then must cool before dipping again. This process has to be repeated until the candles are the size we wish them. Some candles are made by turning the tallow into moulds and letting them harden. E. B. K. Dear children: Take care of the.... Enfield, Oct. 188G. Dear Children :�' Take care of the minutes and the hours will take care of themselves.' Your time is flying, Oh so fast! Let each hour and moment in virtuous work be passed. So live that you can look upon a record in the use of time that will be pleasing and consoling. Spare moments wisely improved will bring durable riches. It is what you have in your hearts that makes you rich. Every hour has its wealth, and wise are you if you can gain it ere the hour is lost. Each moment of time is valuable. Each moment lost cannot be regained. Nothing can compensate for time misspent. To-day can never return, and tomorrow cannot hold the opportunities gone forever. 'To-day is God's time to-morrow is the adversary's. ' Time present is the only time for you. ' You have a little moment, it's given you just now, to do the work before you, the best that you know how. ' The past is gone. The present is here ; its duties and opportunities are yours now. By fulfilling the duties of this moment while you have it, you will be ready for the duty of the next moment when it comes. Do and be as near right as possible now, and strive for higher wisdom and achievement. Minute after minute hour after hour, your lives are being built up. Build on truth and virtue and you are safe. Your brother. Daniel Orcutt.
