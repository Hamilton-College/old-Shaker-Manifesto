Tomatoes .â€”Baked tomatoes are very nice when prepared in the following manner; ' Place solid, large tomatoes in a deep dish; open each tomato at the top and put in a few bread or cracker crumbs, pepper, salt, and a little butter. Bake for about one hour in a moderately hot oven until the crumbs and tomatoes are a nice brown.' To broil tomatoes, take solid ' beef steak ' tomatoes, cut in rather thin slices, broil them until brown, season with pepper, salt, and butter; serve plain or on toast.
