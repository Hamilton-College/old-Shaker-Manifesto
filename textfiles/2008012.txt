SOLILOQUY. Oliver C. Hampton. Well, here I am, and this is the year 18yO. What is my standing? For about th^ee score years I have faithfully and strenuously abjured all worldly pleasures. Through much tribulation and strong cries and tears I have so far fully triumphed over all sin and impurity and have lived a self-sacrificing, communistic life. And what of all that? Nothing at all, if I propose to stop there. I have gained a victory over an impatient, irascible and very high temper. But if I am to do no more than that, I might as well never have begun a pilgrimage to Heaven. For how about that sublime charity 'that suffereth long and is kind, that envieth not, vauuteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth. Beareth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things?' Surely when I look over this bright constel* lation of perfections I feel that all boasting is not only utterly excluded, but that I have scarcely commenced to walk in the way of holiness, and the words of the rapt poet fill me with unspeakable solemnityï¿½ 'The gospel now salutes mine ear, Like thunder from the skies; Bids me commence my journey here, And to perfection rise.' Nevertheless, 'This bright, this pure, this holy way, For ages hid from mortal eye, I'm thankful I can walk this day With saints of the Most High. For prophets, Kings, and Holy men, Did long to reach this light, Yet lingered out their days in pain, And died without the sight.' In view of all this what remains to me but the most profound humility? Surely nothing. So let me now set out to be a follower of Christ and Mother, commencing the present year to fill up that amazing hyatus between myself and that glorious state required by the Holy Savior (viz.) 'to be perfect even as our Heavenly Father is perfect.' So long as any motions of self remain I am far from having filled up the sufferings and discipline in Christ which are yet behind, and which when completed will enable the spirit to say as Jesus did, 'I and the Father are one.' So long as any injury, neglect or unjust estimate by others, has the least tendency to afflict me, I am far enough from a heavenly state, of atonement with God. So long as the least mite of unforgiveness remains iu me, I lack just so much of being forgiven of God or my own conscience and caunot be in a state of at-one-meut with Him. So long as I fail to recognize the lowest scullion in creation just as worthy as myself of salvation and peace, 1 am still ''in the Gall of bitterness.' Because Jesus came eatiug and drinking they said ''he had a Devil' aud so he had, but he subdued aud overcame it, ''being tempted in all points as we are and yet without sin' and ''who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto Him that was able to save him from death, was heard in that lie feared.' So I solemnly and sacredly resolve, this new year to re-commence the work of self-abnegation and devotion to the good of others more faithfully than ever before 'forgetting the tilings which are behind and pressing on to the prize of my high calling,' iu God's service aud all human weal ; remembering for my consolation that 'He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves witht him.'
