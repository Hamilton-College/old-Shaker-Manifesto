Alfred, York Co., Me. Otis Sawyer Alfred, York Co., Me. November 12, 1881. Dear Brother Albert: The Manifesto must live ; it is indispensable. Every number comes to us laden with rich offerings and contributions from those who live the Christ-life and know whereof they speak ; added to these are choice selections and gems of thought, while the editorials are ' meat of the nut.' These are combined in attractive form so as to make the monthly visitor a most welcome guest. At home it is an educator, while it is diffusing a broad knowledge of the truth as the waters cover the sea. Taking 'the sense of the meetings,' at Alfred and New Gloucester, it was the unanimous expression that the Manifesto was ably and satisfactorily edited, that it must be continued, and that the'present talented editor be requested to continue his services. Now if it be that ' the voice of the people is the voice of God,' then we are sure that Brother Albert will continue as in times past to do the will of God. Both the editor and publisher are deserving and do receive the thanks and share the gratitude of all Zion for their unwearied labor and pains in making the Manifesto one of the best periodicals of the day. Receive freely the love and blessing of your gospel friends in Alfred and West Gloucester. Yours in the cause forever,
