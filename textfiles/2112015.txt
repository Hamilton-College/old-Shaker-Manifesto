Quite soon, all the good and bad conditions that belong... Quite soon, all the good and bad conditions that belong to the twelve months of 1891 will be barred out, so far as date is concerned, and while some of the old things may pass over the barrier and attract the attention of a few of the w7ondering thousands of pilgrims, a new series of the good and bad ways of mankind will be inaugurated. Some of these may possibly work their way into the life of the world, till the dawn of the great millennium, or until the prophetic day of Wm. Miller or Prof. Totten conies to close the scene. So far as we have learned, all the big and little sinners of 1891 are still at work, as interested as ever to accomplish what mischief they can before being forced to make a very radical change in their programme. Very few of this class will be brought to believe that so soon as 1899 their little games of wickedness will suddenly collapse, and their homes be far less congenial than was that of Daniel among the lions. But what shall we say of the Christians ? The would-be guardians of the gates that lead into the Holy City. Their mission of peace and good will on earth, can never grow old, even though sadly neglected bv negligent minds, as the principle of being good, and doing good haa something in it that savors very muck of what might be called everlasting. Ezekiel, the prophet, designated those who were the guardians'of the City, as the watchmen. They were expected to give immediate notice if any one was discovered committing a trespass. The keening of the Law was the promise of peace. It was the school-master of that dispensation to lead souls to Christ. All Christians should be guardians or watchmen and as faithfully give notice as did the Jews, if anything should be known to injure the harmony of our spiritual or moral life, in or out of the church. It is always the privilege of the Christian watchmen to invite themselves and then to invite all others whether professors or non-professors to share in the present and no lees in the blessings of a better life. What beautiful privileges are offered for consecrated workers in the Lord's vineyard ! Every faculty can be brought into requisition ; every ministration for spiritual life can become an exaltation, and every form of God's love to man, a song of endless praise. Christians will make themselves to be very unprofitable servants of God if they fail to follow the calling of their divine 'Teacher in his mission among mankind,ï¿½'Come unto me,' said he, 'all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,' and promises them, at the same time, an abundance of the blessings of this life in the hundred-fold reward. If the Christian watchmen are not earnestly engaged in their duty in the teaching of others to think better and live better, that they may become the friends of humanity, as was Jesus, then as Christians they are of but little account only so far as their borrowed name makes them a speciality. To leave this simple form of evangelizing and enter into a speculative theory seems to be the 'one essential' with many minds. Through this theory they would save the world from its sins. While we might hope that the whole world would come to an end even so soon as 1899, when all that is good may be saved, and all the wicked ways of mankind be burnt up : yet we quite fear that when the fire is over, the seed of Cain will be found on the earth, as prolific as it was at the close of the flood. Now we would kindly propose, even at this date, that those who expect to be good in 1899 and be prepared for the heavenly ascension, would begin to-day and show their faith by their works. 'Depart from all iniquity.' Prophetic calculations in the hands of the mathematically wise, like Miller and Totten may warrant all the mystical statements which time and ability can produce : but in the development of practical righteousness, will be about as sure and as effectual, as it wTould be for a pilgrim to reach the Holy City by marching through the labyrinth of Arsinoe.
