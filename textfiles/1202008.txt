WATCH, TRUST AND WAIT While yet one star shall glimmer in the sky With soft, pale gleaming light: Continue thou to watch, with wakeful eye Throughout the night. And if the darkness deepeneth, watch on. Faith will be sight, [ing Soon comes the morning; then the questionWhat of the night? Though like the mouldering embers of afire, Which long hath ceased to burn, Doth lie thy hope, thy love, thy pure desire. Still trust, still yearn. Trust God, humanity,â€”trust gentle Love, Her constance learn, And by thy trusting, unto thy dear Hope Shall life return. Afar may seem the longed for, precious goal, But let not toil abate ; [soul, Let patience, meekness, prayer possess thy Ah ! learn to wait. Weep not though hearts unsympathetic grow, God's love is great, And He hath promised that all things shall be For those who wait. Canaan, N. Y.
