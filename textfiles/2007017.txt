OUR SHAKER CHURCH. Sophia Wayne. A century has scarcely passed, Since on fair Lebanon, Our Church arose. Yet in that time, What glorious work it's done, From a few faithful followers, Who chose their path aright, It numbers now its thousands, Who receive its Spirit light. For many souls have joined our band, To learn the true salvation, And hold the faith that's built upon The rock of revelation. And it will stand from age to age, Its mission to fulfill, And shed abroad its beacon light, From Lebanon's fair hill. Church of our faith ! tho' far away, Fond memory recalls How I have with thy converts sat Within thy hallowed walls And heard them teach a glorious faith, By spirit influence given, To guide us in the better way, And point our course to heaven. Our Zion Church, far, far abroad, Thy blessed light doth shine, To guide the stranger on the way. To hear the truth divine. 0 may I always hold the faith, I now depend upon, And praise the One that guided me To glorious Lebanon. Ballston, N. Y.
