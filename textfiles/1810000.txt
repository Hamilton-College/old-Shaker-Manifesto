THE DIVINE PROCEDURE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN. Daniel Fraser. In creative acts there is progress. Every step is a sure foundation for the next. This holds good from a nebulous globe, till it reaches a state, when plant and animal life is possible. Turning to creations of a higher order, the moral and the divine, we find from* the ''Burning Bush' on Mount Horeb, to the giving of the Law from that mountain, that every intermediate step led to that event�to an Epoch, within which, an orderly, personal, and social life became possible. All outside of said life, is heathenism. What are the essentials of an orderly life? ' Do no harm to yourself through lust. Do no harm to others.' In other words, keep hygienic and moral law. These two requirements run through the Old Testament. The glories of the ' Latter Day' of which the prophets sung, were predicated on the actualization in human life and conduct, of but these two ideas. They constituted the 'First Dispensation.' There had been minor revelations, but this was the most inclusive. It embodied the whole circle of duties incumbent on the Adamic man. It left not a single human animal emotion unregulated. Hence the 'Law was a schoolmaster,' teaching the elements of self-denial. The second step, or Dispensation, was the Revelation of the Christ in Jesus of J^azareth�of a divine human life ! constituting him the son of man, and the Sou of God�the first born of many brethren. Here the inquiry arises, Where is the first born of many sisters? The importance of the 'First Dispensation'�the revelation of a true hygienic, and moral life, specifically defined, has not yet been duly estimated, nor duly opened in our day. The present conditions of society, show it to be wholly out of joint. Those who are the most industrious, and the main creators of wealth, are poor, ill-housed and fed. On the other hand, those who do the least for themselves, and for society, are the best provided for. Hygienieally, the rich and the poor, oppress themselves with bodily ailments. Humanity groans under ages of wrong living, and wrong-doing. To correct and prevent the existence of these evils the First Dispensation was given. Its requirements were brief and definite. Hygienieally, ' Do not eat of the product of the dairy, and animal foods at the same meal.' Avoid animal fats, and the flesh of ravenous beasts. Be clean in person, and in surroundings ; cover up, or burn every unclean thing. Morally, be just and kind. In the fullness of the Third Dispensation, all animal foods will disappear, the divine man and woman, will not kill and eat; but will be at peace with the beasts of the field. Morally, a just form of social life was given. Every family had access to land�to the elements of subsistence. Hence no Jew was under the necessity, ' To beg a fellow worm To give him leave to toil, ' As is largely the case to-day. Usury being forbidden, the rich Jew had to get his last dollar, as he got his first, by labor. Rich men in heathen life�the world at large ; their dollars, grow dollars of themselves, and the more of them they have, the more of the products of human toil they can get without any personal exertion. Hence in the Epoch of the 'First Dispensation,' human evils were reduced to their minimum. In heathen life, men and women eat as they list, and diseases are multiplied unto them. Socially, a similar course is pursued, and social troubles threaten society with destructive upheavals. In all coming dispensations, not a jot of these essentials of the Law .should pass away. Should the Alphabet pass away, where would literature be? The idea that we of heathen origin and descent, can pass into, and remain in Christian life, and retain heathen habits, personal and moral, is a mistake. To be purged from every thing that loveth, or maketh a lie, is a great blessing. The fulfillment of all human duties are included in, 'I and my Father are one.' All the relationships^ of life, hygienic, moral and divine, are included in that affirmation. In this Oneness, all human troubles are obviated. The object of all the Dispensations is? two-fold. First, ''to put an end to sin, and finish trausgressions.' ^ecoud, 'to bring in everlasting righteousness.' Jesus took the first step, and went to John to be baptized as a righteous Jew. Here he presents himself as a keeper of hygienic, and of moral law. Standing on this God given step, he was called to assume the Messiah^hip. To manifest Angelic life ; aud to die to the Adamic, the lower emotional life, and to its relationships ; and thus be enabled to lay the foundations of 'the New Creation' �the divine form of human life�the kingdom of heaven. The subjects of which, make it the business of their lives to unfold the God-element in themselves and in humanity ; ever keeping in view, that the lower life embraces the selfish, the sensual aud the devilish. Jesus, feeling the great burden laid upon him of introducing heaven to men, and of manifesting in himself the spirit of divine life�the Christ of the ages, retired to consider the solemn responsibilities to be borne, and also to feel and endure the repuguance, the Adamic man and woman has to die to self, to animal emotions, and to the ties of earthly relationships, and to be tempted most searchingly in all points like unto his brethren whom he came to redeem. Finally, the inquiry arose withiu him whether he would be obedient to the divine call. First, to be baptized by fire, destroying within himself, not only the outgrowths of animal emotions, but the life also, from whence they spring. To be unearthed�to be born again ! Second, thereby be prepared to be baptized by the Holy Spirit, which creates all things anew. Resolving to be one with the Fathers, Jesus left the wilderness and went home to Nazareth. Little did his family and the native villagers know that upon that young man the spirit of God was poured without measure. He entered the synagogue as was his wont, and opened his mission. 'The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach deliverance &amp;c.' And said, 'this day is this scripture fulfilled.' The eyes of his hearers were set upon him as he opened to them the way of the 'Higher Life,' and of course, the hollowness of theirs. Then arose a storm of feelings, and a clash of words. 'Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother with us ? Humph ! His friends and companions would not receive him; they became enraged, and led him out to a steep place near which Nazareth stands, with the intent to throw him down headlong, and put an end to him and his mission. He quietly walked away from the mob. A few days afterwards, he uttered that memorable sermon�'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see G-od. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.' 'Bless them that curse you. Pray for them which despitely use you' &amp;c. In Christ there is no political dodging, no shirking of responsibilities. He goes unerringly to the work allotted him. The leading emotion of his spirit, is to be beneficently useful. He cures the sick, gives sight to the blind, and cleanses the leper. His fame goes abroad, the common people hear him gladly. Herod desires to see him ; he does not stoop to gain his favor. A ruler of note seeks an interview : he comes by night. Such words are uttered as never before entered a ruler's ear. 'Except ye be born agaiu'�be unearthed, 'ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.' To the ruler, there is no change of attitude. The simple dignity of a son of God is maintained. On entering his mission, Jesus drew upon himself the hostility of the villagers of Nazareth, those with whom he had been on friendly terms. Their lower self-hoods became stirred up with murderous intents. In the further fulfillment of his work, he also met the hostility of the priestly class, and of the upper portion of Jewish society generally. The same murderous spirit was found in them. He told the priests, as was his duty ; 'ye make the Law of God of none effect through your traditions.' 'Ye have taken away the key of knowledge ; ye entered not in yourselves, nor suffered others to enter.' That they were whitewashed sepulchers, fair outside, but within, iull of rottenness. In his disciples, he also found a murderous spirit. 'Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil.' Another wanted fire to come down and consume his enemies. Two of them had no objections to have choice seats in his kingdom. The spirit of who would be the greatest, had a place among them as it has among men to-day. To destroy the works of the devil, it is necessary they first be made manifest. The Jews were an intense people. Their priests, scribes and pharisees were essentially no worse than the same class of men are to-day. The presence of Jesus Christ stirred up, and brought to the surface, a life and its emotions, common to us all. Showing plainly, that if we will stand on solid ground ; be able to manifest God to one another, we have got to die to self, to lust, to revenge and to '�who shall be the greatest.' No halfway work will answer. There is no safety for any of us, except in newness of spirit. He or she who in the least degree seeks to save their lower selfhoods, seeks to save the whole of that life ; and most certainly will be unable to unfold the life of God, and of heaven, the germs of which are within us. The failure of the many attempts to live, having goods in common, are due to the action of said lower life. The lower and higher lives, are organically antagonistic. Were it not so, it would be impossible for a man to be able to choose to be a son of God. The dignity of manhood and womanhood, is in bearing a daily cross. The extraordinary works, and the divine teachings of the man of Nazareth ; his denunciations of the leaders of the Jewish people, and his driving the traders from the Temple, fixed the eyes of all Israel upon him, and gave significance to all he did or said. He emphatically declared, 'My kingdom is not of this world.' The kingdoms of this world are the kingdoms of 'the Beast;' they operate by force, therefore, his kingdom must be that of the higher�the divine life in man. In that kingdom, 'No work is menial, and no state is low. No talk is ever heard of mine and thine, For everything is every body's there.' Such a state of things with Jesus Christ was not a flash of transcendental ideas from some 'Summer School of Philosophy,' but an even daily life. With his disciples he lived in common, and personally cared for them. Hence he was able to say, 'Blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear.' &amp;c. As the labors of Jesus Christ were drawing to a close, he reviewed them saying, 'I have finished the work my Father hath given me to do.' Without a trace of ill-feeling towards those who sought to entrap and destroy him; he exclaimed, 'O Jerusalem, Jerusalem ! how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! ' Here we find in Jesus the Christ, the express image of the Father�a divine man, the first-born of many Brethren, the First Appearance of Christ on our planet. The inquiry arises, where is the first-born of many Sisters?�the first Divine Woman. Has She yet appeared? Let us look for Her. 'The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nest-, but the Son of Man hath not whert to lay his head.' In the nature of things, his work was introductory, and necessitated a Second Appearance, wherein that prophecy would be fulfilled; My people shall dwell in sure habitations, and in quiet resting places. And also the prayer, 'Give us this day our daily bread.' &amp;c. The Revelation of the Christ in woman, will fulfill that prophecy, and answer that prayer. In the homes created by Ann Lee, that prophecy, and all the essentials of that prayer are answered. Deliverance from temptation. Trespasses are forgiven, and daily bread is equally supplied to all. In Her, and in her Institu- tions, is thy Revelation of the Second Appearance of Christ, the first-born of many Sisters. As such, She stands the Mother, as does Jesus Christ, the Father of the New Creation. lie the express image of the Father. She, that of the affectioual and organizing Mother-hood in Deity. It is the woman, not the man, who organizes human homes. Christ was despised and rejected of men�the stone the builders rejected. Yet he, through faithfulness is to-day the head of the corner. The builders in our day, reject Ann Lee with contempt. Yet she through faithfulness in bearing a full cross against all the emotions of her lower self-hood, as did Jesus, is to-day, the cap-stone of the highest form of social life on this earth. 'Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit saith the Lord,' has she brought forth the cap-stone of the New Creation. All who are able, may say, 'Grace, Grace unto it.' In Ann Lee there is no myth. All women may be divine as she is. The noblest of minds will yet do her justice. Before those who know her, she stands ' The Avoman clothed with the Sun'�divine light. 'A crown of twelve stars upon her head'�the Christian virtues. 'The moon under her feet'�all secondary things, the philosophies of earth, and all man-made systems in abeyance. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
