An Iron Bar .—A bar of iron worth .$5.00 worked into horse shoes is worth .$10.50, made into knife blades, is worth 832 85, made into balance springs for watches, is wortli $250,000, What a drilling the poor iron bar must undergo to reach all that; but hammered and beaten, pounded, rolled, rubbed and polished, how was its value increased! And so all the drilling and training to vhieh you are subject, all the trials and hardships, thumps and pains which often seem so hard to you, serve to draw out the finer qualities, and fit you for greater and more responsible posts in the world.—N. H. Statesman.
