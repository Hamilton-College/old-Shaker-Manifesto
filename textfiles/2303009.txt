ENCOURAGEMENT. Moore Mason. * '�For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.�1 Peter, Hi., 17. There are many persons who reject Shakerism, and some have attempted to throw doubts on its gospel history, but now for over one hundred years they have never explained in what way Mother Ann and her disciples, circumstanced as they were, succeeded or could have succeeded, in propagating as we know they did, such a religion as ours, supposing it to be not from God but from man. If we look to human transactions we will find portions of history even those which no one has any doubt of, full of such strange events that difficulties might be pointed out and objections raised even when it rests on such satisfactory evidence as to be believed in spite of these objections. For instance in the wonderful rise and overthrow of the Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte it might be easy to convince some persons that the history could not be true, were it not so well attested as to be believed notwithstanding all the difficulties. Persons should not think themselves bound to renounce our faith if every objection that may be raised can not be answered to their satisfaction, because many things must be believed, against which there are strong objections that have never been completely answered, but let us think of the comforting words of Jesus. 'If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God.' The whole tone of Shakerism differs so widely in every particular from all other religions that much difficulty must be expected to make converts, as it is unlike all that has been described or imagined in-as-much as it practices and teaches all mankind to be pure and upright, kind and humble, gentle, patient and self-denying. When we show the world how suitable our life is to the needs of mankind, how it supplies such guidance, hope and consolation as human nature requires, then we may expect a readiness on the part of many to follow, not their own will, but the will of God and to receive whatever shall appear to come from Him however contrary to their owa expectations or wishes and when in sincerity we have embraced the Gospel of the second appearing of Christ and labored for that spiritual travail without which our lives here are but as 'sounding brass or a tinkling symbol' then we will perceive that it does suit the real wants of man, as it quickly enlightens his judgment and THE MANIFESTO. 65 improves his moral taste and makes him lead a life that will secure him the truest peace and comfort because 'He that is Christ's, hath crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.' Sometimes God leads us by a path that at the time we think rough and thorny, but we find out afterwards that it is one of the short cuts to happiness hereafter and is it not better, if the will of God be so that we suffer for well-doing, even if in dark moments we may think we can not trace his hand, still trust Him for 'all things work together for good to those that love the Lord.' It is well to remember that all the objections which have been brought forward against Shakerism are so far evidence in its favor, and whatever scorn may seemingly be felt towards a religion whose founder was a woman and whose follows were persons of obscure station, it might be well to exercise a little calm thought on the similarity between the first Shaker, Jesus, our Elder Brother and his followers, and yet in spite of all this, Shakerism prevails and that it has made its way as it has against so many obstacles and objections, is one of the strongest proofs of its divine origin. Pray for what passeth human skill The power God's will to do, Read thou that thou mayest do his will And thou shalt know it too. Watervliet, Ohio.
