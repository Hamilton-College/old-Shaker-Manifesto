WILLING SERVICE. 'Teach me thy way, O Lord-'�Psalm xxxvii., 11. Canterbury, N. H. 1. In Thy wisdom, Father, guide me, In the way that seemeth 2. When alluring paths have opened To beguile the wayward best; Wheresoe'er I'm needed choose me,�To Thy goodness I'll attest. In the brightest, darkest step, Thou hast in Thy loving kindness Angels sent to intercept. Having guided thus far hour Thou hast not forsaken safely, Led me over dang'rous me; For beyond the gloom has risen Just sufficient light to see. ways; Recognizing Thy sure mercies I would serve Thee all my days.
