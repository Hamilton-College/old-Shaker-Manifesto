HOME OF THE ORACLE. O. C. Hampton. Otje Inmost Divine is the Kingdom of God Where spirit serenely walks safely abroad Mid flowers of fruition in Gardens of Love Far, far from the wilds where the fierce passions rove. 0 this is the world whence creations sublime, Are photographed forth on the mirror of time; Whence lights and perfections and glories and all Upon the Arena of Destiny fall. To this silent region of peace I aspire, And in meditation full often retire; And sooner or later my home shall be there Remote from delusions of sorrow or care. When sickness, menaces or sorrow or sin, 1 haste to commune with the silence within; For there I find God on his glorious throne Declaring that '1 and my Father are one.' And can it be possible sickness or sin A victory over the spirit shall win? Nay�these fell delusions I quickly dismiss For time and eternity, yon world and this. In soaring o'er regions of silence forsooth, I seem to return to the days of my youth; And most Divine mysteries ope to my view 'Mid the deep solitudes of the good and the true. In rapture of silence I wait for the word, And peacefully walk in the Oracle heard; When I and the Father in spirit are one How pleasant to iterate 'Thy will be done.' From out the deep silence the Oracle lifts, Like the sun-clouds of eve with their splendor and rifts; From the gates of the west as the great sun retires, And garnishes Heaven with many hued fires. And there's thunder in silence could we only hear, To awe the dark sinner in his mad career. And there's music in silence the sad to console, And melody soft that will passion control. THE MANIFESTO. 59 There's healing in silence from sickness and fear, And joy in the Inmost the lonely to cheer; For sorrow and sin are not found in that � world, But happiness on its escutcheon impearled. Forever adieu to the negative state, Which once I believed was the Fiat of fate; My pilgrimage opens, the trumpet has blown, And I'll go on my journey afoot and alone. Then farewell to sickness and sorrow farewell, To sin and all throes of a negative hell; Whose shadows the spirit can never content With passions dull surfeits and vagaries blent. Union Village, 0.
