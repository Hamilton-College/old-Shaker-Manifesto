LOOK AT HOME Should you feel inclined to censure Faults you may in others view, â€¢ Ask your own heart, ere you venture, If that has not failing, too. Let not friendly vows be broken, Rather strive a friend to gain ; Many a word in anger spoken Finds its passage back again. Do not, then, in idle pleasure, Trine with a brother's fame; Guard it as a valued treasure, Sacred as your own good name. Do not form opinions blindly, Hastiness to trouble tends ; Those of whom we've thought unkindly Oft become our warmest friends.
