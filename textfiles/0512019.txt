We will sing of eternal progression, Till its joy the whole earth can fill, earth can fill, We know the gift of our parents, And its virtues our spirits thrill, spirits thrill. Over mountains and wide rolling rivers The sound of its glory will roll, glory will roll, The wings of freedom will bear it onward To meet a response in each soul, in each soul.
