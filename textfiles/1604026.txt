Sanitary SHOULD WE SLEEP WITH OPEN WINDOWS? This question introduces a subject upon which there is a diversity of opinion. 'I have had no bad colds since I learned to sleep with my windows open, ' remarked one gentleman to another recently. ' The only hard colds I ever suffered from were contracted by sleeping in rooms to which the night air had free access, ' replied the other. The bodily temperature sinks slightly during sleep; all the physiological functions act with diminished activity; the resistance of the economy to morbific influences is lessened proportionately. But it is also well known that at night these influences are far more potent and noxious. The air is charged with greater humidity; in unhealthy places miasmatic and malarial poisons arise to higher levels and extend with greater rapidity; the chill of damp night air is penetrating and dangerous; the emanations from organic decay are more perceptible. Against these the sleeper is less protected than in the daytime. He has divested himself of his woolen external clothing to put on cotton or linen, and lies between sheets of the same material, between which, at the tops and sides of the bed, the air gains ready access to his unprotected surface. If he is restless he renders such access yet more easy. A sudden fall of temperature at night is no unusual occurrence. In summer a thundergust, in winter a shift of the wind to the north, often reduces the temperature 10 or 20 degrees. The sleeper is unaware of this, and so remains exposed to it with no further protection than he found agreeable at the higher temperature until he awakes chilled and stiff, and feels the effects of it all day long. With these points to be considered, what rule should guide us? Certainly we need pure air by night as well as by day, and this we ought to proA'ide. If the bedroom is very small there is more danger from draughts than if it is very large. If the person is delicate and sensitive he cannot bear draughts so well as one more hardy. So there can be no fixed rule for all persons ; eacli must fix a rule for himself, only bearing in mind that fresh air is important and must be obtained in some way. The strong, and those who bathe every morning, may sleep with windows open more or less at nearly all seasons. The weak, and those who do not keep their skins healthy, may admit air by doors opening into other rooms, and by openings into the chimney for the exit of foul air. Several small openings may be made which will admit fresh air without creating a draught. A screen may be used to break the force of the current. A little ingenuity will enable every one to provide fresh air, without injury, for their sleeping apartment. The Herald of Health. AMONG THE SHAKERS. NO. 2. ' You say you eat no meat. Is that because you think it harmful? ' ' I think it unnecessary. It has been many years since I have tasted meat. The ingredients of flesh are all in the soil; beef contains nothing that vegetable diet does not afford us. Still, it is not the fact of eating meat that I object to so much as it is the murder. All animals have a right to their lives. ' ' Suppose you encountered a rattlesnake.' ' Kill it. One must use common sense in such matters. The Orientals carry that thing to excess. You remember there was an Eastern monarch who did not wish to destroy the animalcule in water by drinking it.' 'You believe, do you not, in spiritual communication ? ' 'Certainly. We live under direct inspiration of spiritual influences. A man may realize that late in life, but to most men the knowledge is sure to come at some stage. I was a materialist until I was converted, as Paul was converted. My eyes were turned inward upon myself and I saw my folly. It is only through a knowledge of spiritualism that many obscure things in our Bible are made plain. For instance, we find the Jews praying for help and guidance to the ' god of Israel' when they start on their expeditions of plunder and massacre and outrage. The ' god of Israel' was not the God of the universe, but a national spirit or tutelary genius, like that possessed by every nation. ' ' But you do not 'take stock' in spirit rappings and cabinet manifestations and all that kind of thing?' ' 'Why not? We cannot tell in what manner a spirit may choose to manifest itself. It may be by influence, or by knockings, or by personal revelation. At the time of the great Kentucky revival John the Baptist was distinctly seen for several minutes in our meeting house, and led our people in the dance. Then the motions of the spirit may shape our conduct. For many years our men and women held no communion with the world's people, but after a time the spirit moved differently.' ' In what way does the spirit usually manifest itself?' ' It would not avail to tell you now. 'Cast not your pearls before swine'�which means,' continued the Elder, with the vestige of a smile at my startled expression 'give not your truths to those who are not prepared for them. You cannot receive them now, but some day your eyes will be turned in' ward, and the truth will be revealed. You have already had experiences in your life that could not be explained through the agency of physical or psychological laws, ' which was true, as it probably is in the case of a majority of adults. ' Do you not find your life here monotonous at times?' 'Nay. It is peaceful and we are bound together by brotherly and sisterly love. This is an earthly heaven. I could live here forever.' The Elder presently withdrew, after committing me to the care of Daniel Eraser, a ruddy cheeked brother verging upon ninety years of age, who must at some time have quaffed the elixir of life. The passionless, methodical existence of the Shakers lengthens their lives an average of a dozen years beyond that of other men and keeps them in health, likewise; but Daniel Fraser is as a ' world's man' of sixtv, and while he expresses his willingness to die whenever he shall be called, he has a store of life and strength that ought to last him a round score of years to come. It has been said that communities do not foster intellectual growth and independence. I know not how that may be among .the mass of a communal fraternity, but I must do Frederic Evans and Daniel Fraser the justice to say that, in their case, plain Jiving and high thinking go together, and that in extent of reading, in mental vigor, in ready use of logic and in sincerity of utterance they are at least the equals of any two men of my acquaintance in the world. They have convictions, and live up to them. The Shakers and Mohammedans are the only people who do so, and their lives stand out in singular contrast to the mass of those whose religion is lip service and whose lives are guided only by self interest. 'Brother Daniel'� there are no ' Misters ' or titles of any sort among these people�took me through the gardens adjacent to the dwelling, and walked with me along a height from which a glorious sunset view was had, with the fires of the sky glowing in the reflections of a river down the valley. I asked to see the grave yard, but he said there was little there of interest. The graves were barely marked^ and for his part he would as lief be buried without a mortuary token at his head. Of what use were a few handfuls of dust, and what honor need attend them? The life and deeds of a man were not interred. Had they much illness there? Nay, very little. Great care was taken to keep the sanitary condition of the grounds and buildings perfect. The appliances, not only of sanitation, but of agricultural and domestic work, were the latest and best that had been devised. What hours were observed in work? The men and women arose at half past four�he thought another hour of sleep would not hurt them�or at five in Winter, and their duties occupied them until about sundown. The wonderful cleanliness of everything was maintained at a cost of no more labor than the care of live stock or the working of the fat acres we looked out upon. The stables, where a large herd of cattle is kept, are cleaner than most of the New York tenement houses, the stone walls are the best laid and most solid that can be seen in the country, and in the houses, barns, sheds, orchards, shops and fields there is order, economy, skill and neatness. Domestic animals for pets there are none, except a few canary birds, though cats are encouraged .to dwell about the premises ' as a menace to another class of domestic animals, rats, ' explained Brother Daniel. On returning to the room we had left I was informed that I was to consider myself at home there, and was invited to stay all night. The invitation was accepted when I was assured that my pedestrian costume was not amiss and that I would be thought the better of for my blue shirt and rough clothing. The condescensions of fashionable people who visit Mount Lebanon, parading their silks and jewels before its simple folk and exhibiting such well bred amusement at their ways and appearance as might be in place in visiting a poorhouse or a menagerie, have made entirely excusable the reluctance of many of the Shakers to be pitied or patronized. Condescension is singularly misplaced on the most prosperous and contented people in this country. It would be more in order for Shakers to patronize the worried, dissatisfied, ambitious, fast living citizens who visit them, people overtaxed, overdressed, slaves of fashion, insecure and fearful of the future, unresting, distrustful of their business associates and devoted either to their empty pleasures of society or to individual aggrandizement that perpetuates those false social relations against which, from shop and tenement, comes an ominous mutter of protest. Were these serene Shaker settlements scattered plentifully about the world, where all men might profit by the examples therein set of economy, right dealing, fraternal helpfulness, order and content, I am convinced that the world would be the better for them. I was bidden to supper in due season and had it served to me by a smiling Shakeress in an apartment adjoining the family dining room. From the cheerful rattle of fumirine tongues in the kitchen, the occasional humming of an air and from the fields a whistle, it was apparent that the strict life of the community was not inconsistent with cheerfulness. Most of the faces one sees in the village are to some extent spiritualized, but glumness is not their habitual expression. The supper was abundant and satisfying, and presented a variety of dishes. If one wishes to know how he can fairly luxuriate without meat let him sample Shaker cookery. Daniel Fraser told me that he had not eaten meat in thirty years, I think he said, and in that time he had subsisted joyously without eggs, milk, cheese, butter, lard, spirits, tobacco, soda, saleratus, tea or coffee. Farinaceous food, fruit, vegetables and water he had found sufficient. Meeting me after supper in the room that was temporarily mine lie made a vigorous presentation of his communistic theories and of the scheme for land nationalization made familiar by Henry George. He had, also, in his mental keeping strange scraps of fables and legend that Hawthorne would have caught up eagerly, to base a romance on. He had even met one or two men who thought they had solved the mystery of life and had been guaranteed an earthly existence of indefinite length. These men had joined the Shakers in the belief that their simple, healthful modes of living were most conducive to unlimited length of days, but Daniel made light of their hopes and bade them look at the gray hairs of their heads and beards and asked them if the world to come were not a better one than this? In the evening there was a 'reading meeting' in the gathering place or hall of the house, the men sitting on one side and the women on the other, the seats being arranged in crescent form with the reader beneath a bright light in the center. Some hymns were sung without accompaniment, although a cabinet organ stood in the room, and Heber Newton's sermon on 'Religious Communism ' was read aloud with the preface from Elder Evans that it was ' rather a remarkable thing to come from the world. ' The company listened in silence, and two boys of the family were distinctly observed to slumber. Elder Evans interrupted the reader twice or thrice to explain and comment on passages in the discourse, and shut it off before its conclusion had been reached by stating that it was perhaps too lengthy for a single reading; a view that was endorsed by one of the sisters, who demurely said 'Perhaps we have had as much as we can digest. ' About nine o'clock the Shakers were in their rooms. I saw lights burn briefly at their windows for a time, a few windows were thrown open and contemplative figures were seen there gazing at the beauty of the night. The moon mounted the sky, shining on the high, white walls of the houses and bringing them into striking relief against the dark hills. Then fell a silence when even Nature hardly stirred in her heavy sleep, and the serenity of Mount Lebanon was reflected on earth and in the sky. C. M. S.
