OUR LOVED ONES. [Contributed by Genevieve DeGraw.] What are our loved ones doing to-day? Those who have crost o'er the chilling tide, And landed safe on the other side, Those who have left in the shrouding's fold Beautiful clay for the grave to hold, What are those dear ones doing to-day? I who must deal with sorrow and care, I who am hoping the crown to wear, I with a heaven to lose or win, I who am tempted and tried within, Long to step over the bounds of time, And see what is done in that glorious clime. Waters of life untroubled are there, Life's fair tree hath its fruits to bear, Songs far sweeter than poets dream, Angels sing by the flowing stream, Folding their snowy wings they glide Over the sands by the river's side, Welcoming those who pure and white Enter the beautiful gates to-night. Oh, to be with them! Oh, to be there! Oh, to be free from this cumbering care! THE MANIFESTO. 159 Oh, to be safe in the heavenly fold, Out of the gathering storms and cold Only to know my sorrows all past Jesus has loved me and crowned me at last. Soul be content, thou must labor and wait, Toiling and trusting both early and late, Jesus knows when to call thee up higher More than his will dost thou ask or desire? Called in the morning or called in the night Called from earth's darkness or called from its light, Patiently wait thou and all will be right. ï¿½Selected.
