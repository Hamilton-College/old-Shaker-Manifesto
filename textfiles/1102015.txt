MY SKEIN OF YARN EMMA A. LENT [Written for The Manifesto.] . BY Long years ago the skein was wound, And careless hands had tucked away The ball, so hard, and smooth, and round, On which my thoughts have chanced to stray And I have taken out to-day. The threads are finer now, than when The knots and tangles vexed me so, I wonder if life's errors then, Recorded in the long ago Will ever any fainter grow. This ball brings back an anxious night, When silently I watched alone, Beside the bed, and shaded light, Till startled by the sleeper's moan, I solaced her with touch or tone. And yet my thoughts were far from sad. As busily I wound this skein, A glad, sweet hope, all fear forbade, I knew she would be well again, Because His prayers would conquer pain. His potent prayer, for me and mine Were such support, I could not faint, I did not lean on love divine, He had become my patron saint, Through Him, the Lord would hear my plaint. Fierce furnace flames, my heart have tried, And sorely smitten from the heat, My soul in sack-cloth feign would hide, 'Till I all broken at His feet Can cry, dear Lord, ' Thy will is sweet.' While in the fire, I could not make An out cry, for I knew God's hand The bruised reed would never break, The smoking flax His love hath fanned, Until I see my fatherland. The sick one lived, the strong one fell, In one short week the crown was won ; And now I know that it is well, Though all are taken one by one, Dear Father let ' Thy will be done.' Bexford Flats, N.
