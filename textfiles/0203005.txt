Trust in God O'Lord, in thy temple my soul shall abide; Though sorely afflicted, in thee I confide; Though stripes be my portion, intensely to feel, The hand I will bless, that hath power to heal. Lord, fashion me, subject to thy righteous will; Yea, search me, and try me, I will love Thee still. Deprived of treasures and friends dear to me. My soul must be saved, and I'll still cleave to Thee. Though early companions have sought the broad road, Yet nearer, still nearer, I'll walk with my God ! The way may be narrow, the passage be straight, Yet the city of God lies through the straight gate; The weak and world-loving, may quail at the fire, That's kindled in Zion, for a purifier; In this cleansing furnace of God I'll be tried, Though intense be the heat, yet in it I'll abide. The gold will not perish, though dross be consumed; The purified only, by heaven are owned; t Prepare me thus Lord, for that rest which remains For the people of God, without blemish or stain. In the first resurrection let me have a part; Impressed be the image of Christ in my heart; Inspired by Angels with meekness ami love, Endowed with wisdom that comes from above. O what avails pride, or the pleasures of sin, Their fruits are all bitter, remembrance a sting ! A justified conscience, a heart that is pure, Yield pleasures abundant, and these will endure. Heart and voice all attuned, grateful praises I'll sound, On the Zion of God, where salvation is found. Bright Angels bear witness, my vows I renew, Of a full consecration to God I'll be true.
