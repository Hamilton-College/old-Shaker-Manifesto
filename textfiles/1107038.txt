IMPERFECT RELIGION Very much of the religion of the day is an easy-minded religion, without conflict and wrestling with self-denial and sacrifice — a religion which knows nothing of the pangs of the new birth at its commencement, and nothing of the desperate struggle with the flesh and with the devil, day by day, making us long for resurrection, deliverance, for the Lord's return. It is a second-rate religion — a religion in which there is no largeness, no grandeur, no potency, no noble-mindedness, no all-constrain 162 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. ing love. It is a hollow religion, with a fair exterior, but with an aching heart—a heart unsatisfied, a soul not at rest, a conscience not at peace with God ; a religion marked, it may be, by activity and excitement, but betraying all the while the consciousness of a wound hidden and unhealed within, and hence unable to animate to lofty doings, or supply the strength needed for such doing. It is a feeble religion, lacking the sinews and bones of harder times, very different from the indomitable, much-enduring,stormbraving religion, not merely of apostolic days, but even of the Reformation. It is an uncertain religion ; that is to say, it is not rooted on certainty ; it is not the outflowing of a soul assured of pardon, and rejoicing in the filial relationship between itself and God. Hence, there is no liberty of service, for the question of personal acceptance is still an unsettled thing ; there is a working for pardon. All is thus bondage, heaviness, irksomeness ; there is a speaking for God, but it is with a faltering tongue ; there is a laboring for God, but it is with fettered hands ; there is a movement in the way of His command, but it is with a heavy drag upon oar limbs. Hence, the inefficient uniniiuential character of our religion. It does not tell on others, for it has not fully told upon ourselves. It falls short of its mark, for the arm that drew the bow is paralyzed. —Rev. Horatius Bonar, D. D,
