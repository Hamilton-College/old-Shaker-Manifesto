If I had 'IF I HAD.'-' If I had another life to live and two thousand letters to write agnin ; with God's good help, I would not hurt the feelings of the humblest of all God's creatures honestly trying to do good. He might be as big as Daniel Lambert, and I would not call him fat and unctuous;â€¢ Ire might be as lean as Calvin Edson, and I would not call him a bag of bones. I would count each day lost on which I had not made some hearts gladder than they were i~l the . morning j on which I had not plucked up some thorns, or planted some flowers on the path of human life. No man can so Iive without enjoying life. Dogs will snarl at him, but angels are around him. He may' never have riches or fame, but better than both are friends and God.'-S. Irenaenus Prime.
