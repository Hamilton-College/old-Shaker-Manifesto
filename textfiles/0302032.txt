BLESSINGS FOE THE FAITHFUL Enfield, N. H. 1. Saith God, Unto those who keep my way pure, I'll open my fountains above; On those who are faithful, my blessings I'll pour, And comfort their souls with my love 2. A cloud in the day I'll spread o'er my flock ; A pillar of fire, by night, Shall lead them, and show them I am their sure Rock, And they my peculiar delight. I'll be unto them a kind Parent and Friend, And they shall be children of mine; My wings of protection shall o'er them extend, And make them in glory to shine. Then, be not dismay'd nor yet be ye cast down; Tear not, though some trials you meet; But wing your way through to my mansions in heaven: You'll there have a beautiful seat.
