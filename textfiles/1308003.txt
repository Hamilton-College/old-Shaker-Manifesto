ART THOU, INDEED, A CHRISTIAN? AGNES E. NEWTON. To the worthy name of Christian Dost thou hold an honest claim? Art Christ's follower in practice, In thy life, as well as name? Dost thou store and fill thy garners With the best that earth can give,— Can the love of gain control thee And the Christ-life strictly live? 'Go sell all!' was Christ's injunction, All forsake, and follow me ! I'm the Way, the Resurrection I'm the Vine, the Living Tree. He claimed those as His relation Who obeyed the will of God; Do ye copy this example, Pattern Him ye claim as Lord? He in tones of living fervor This assertion did declare ; Whoso loveth father, mother,—¦ More, my blessing cannot share. Broad the basis of his friendship, Love, embracing all mankind In a universal kinship, Not to just a few confined. He that seeks his life to cherish, Loses the eternal gain; THE MANIFESTO. 175 He who freely gives the selfish, May the priceless pearl obtain. Christ proclaimed the resurrection Of the soul from death of sin; And revealed the Virgin order,— 'Narrow way,' few enter in. To his Father's will and diction, Humbly He resigned his own; Drank the bitter cup, nor murmured— Trod the wine-press all alone. Drink his blood, and share his suffering If ye'd also with Him reign; Live his life of crucifixion Life Eternal to obtain. Ye may follow in the foot-steps Of earth's heroes gone before; But to follow Christ, thy Savior, This, requireth something more. And the cherished name of Christian, Worthily can be applied To him only, who like Jesus, To the world, is crucified. Canterbury, N. H.
