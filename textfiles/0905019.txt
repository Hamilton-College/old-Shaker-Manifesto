A Shaker Life demands self-denial; more — self-renunciation and Christly substitution. All that we have, which can harmonize with Christ's life, is saved; thus Christ saves us. This self-denialj and renunciation of self are not to be indiscriminately applied, but most consistently applied, for the correction of our selfish loves and lives, and resurrection of the human life up to the divine pattern. Thus, the passionate loves and lusts of the generative, worldly man and woman are lost in a new creation or habitude of life, wherein these selfish considerations are become dead, or, at least, dying in the soul, and upon whose dying ashes there rises the saintly character of unworldly, unselfish Christians—followers of Christ. No lusts ; no selfish ends to accomplish ; no love of the flesh nor of money ; no appetites for the normal nor abnormal habits of the worldling — bat a Shaker, so nearly representing the Christ to the world that the relationship and identity will be easily and generally remarked upon.
