NOTES ABOUT HOME West Pittsfleld. Mar. 1893. We are bounded and surrounded bysnow. The blizzard which probably originated in the boreal regions, found its way hither on the 20th ult. After displaying his mighty blowing powers for two consecutive days, he took a short respite or journeyed to other localities, but returned after a day's absence with renewed fierceness. For several days it was a constant strife with Brethren and workmen, to keep highways and pathways in a condition that made traveling possible. We wonder if some of those Arctic explorers have not opened a channel through which those furious storms find their way into more temperate regions. Yet in the midst of storm and tempest, sunshine and calm, our trust is in an over-ruling Providence, believing that if we rely steadfastly on Him, working with patience the works which he requires, he will 'temper the wind,' give the promised seasons for sowing and reaping and in his own good time bestow every needful blessing. A company of loved friends from the happy land of Canaan, while enjoying a day's outing, kindly called upon us and spent a few hours in social converse, greatly to our satisfaction. Bless us again with your presence dear friends, a cordial and welcome greeting will ever be extended to all our gospel kindred from afar or near. On the 2nd inst. a company of young people from our place reciprocated the call and notwithstanding the bad condition of the roads were enraptured with their day's enjoyment. Another brave veteran, Elder Frederick Evans, a loved and revered Father in Israel, has passed on to the glory awaiting him in the heavenly life, full of honors and full of years. 'Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord,' who have nobly and faithfully wrought the work assigned them. And so they continue to leave us those consecrated worthies, whose presence was like a benediction, and whose countenances beamed with the light of purity. While biding our time here, may we wisely copy their Christian magnanimity and emulate their virtues. We fully concur in the opinion so warmy expressed in the March No. of Manifesto, regarding the increasing richness and growth of each succeeding publication. Julia L. Sweet. Shaker Station, Conn. The experience of many persons has shown that it is by united effort that all progress has been made and lasting good accomplished. We should work in harmony with others and do all we can to progress in the right direction physically, morally and spiritually. There is strength in union. We should have a noble aim in view, and try to come as near the mark as possible. * * * When selecting eggs for sitting we should have the 'ideal hens' in mind. They should come from a prolific ancestry. We ought to know their past record and breed with all the care we take to get the choicest stock in animals. We have solved the problem of how to obtain plenty of eggs when they are forty cents a dozen. Warmth and a varied diet are indispensable. Hens must have the care that comes from a love of poultry, and it must be a regular and not a spasmodic attention. Daniel Orcutt. March 1, 1893. The stormy March with its winds and clouds is now reigning supreme, traveling is impeded with the snow drifts and many roads impassable. To reach the Depot from our place is quite difficult, and the fields are resorted to, and the aid of townsmen is required to keep any roads at all, as the wind fills up the track as fast as it is opened. The cream gatherer could not get through for three days the past week. The cold is not as severe at present as has been the past two months. Water is more plenty, which is a great blessing. Our new heating apparatus is now in working order and will be THE MANIFESTO. fully appreciated. We have ten Radiators with coils in upper and lower halls which warm the house perfectly comfortable with one small furnace which is heated with coal, doing away with stoves and wood which required so much attention to keep warm at all. We are now released from the burden of providing wood which is quite an expense, and it will also be a saving of labor for those who provide it. These improvements are desirable to make home comfortable. We are truly thankful for the many blessings which are ours to enjoy. Health prevails in our midst. Bountiful Father praise to thee for thy unfailing goodness. The past I leave alone with Thee, My guardian and my stay; And with a spirit calm and free, I onward take my way. Maria Witham. Enfield, N. H. North Family. March, 1893. As we meet and mingle in the duties of life with the busy multitude of human beings, how varied our experiences; there are persons, who, like pleasing theories or some fine toned poem, make deep and lasting impressions upon us; they enter into our lives with precept or good examples, as noble ministers of true Christianity. While we may be able to gather valuable matter from abroad, we can also find much in our own homes equally as interesting and useful, in our intercourse with those united to us by like ideals and life works. True love for our fellowbeings creates Christian service, 'to try all things, but hold fast to that which is good,' and give of acquired soul wealth to others, with the devotedness and sweetness of spirit which characterized the late Phillips Brooks, who helped to make the the field of religion bloom with flowers of virtue and to eradicate from society that corruptibleness which destroys noble manhood and womanhood. 'Lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime; And departing leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time.' Awakened to the realization of moral responsibility, thus leaving life records proving that virtue pays, is the connecting link that binds the pure in spirit on earth and in heaven. As each flower adds beauty to earth's garden, so each mind with its individual aroma, should add to society, honor in its special sphere of action, nurtured and sustained by the spirit of godliness; for conscience, without Christian culture is mammon's servant, while the Christ garnished, make practical God's laws, and form the solid fabric of his Church, which the moth of lust or the rust of selfishness cannot soil. And what purer work is there than to uplift fallen humanity, and give to society that culture which makes all free and equal, intelligent and happy? At present we are walled around with huge banks of snow, remnants of the 20th and 22nd days of Feb., at which date snow drifts measuring from five to eight feet deep could be found in nearly all directions. Sisters not only proving indispensable in the domestic departments, have been well engaged in working on sale hosiery, throughout this cold season. We were much pleased with the March Editorial; please accept our thanks for the same, with love for all. George H. Baxter. Canterbury, N. H. Weather Eecord for February, 1893.

M A.RCH, the lion month of the year, came in just as we expected from the rough experiences of stormy February, but although storms and tempests have outwardly raged, the inward peace of the band of faithful Believers within our gospel home remains unbroken and undisturbed. Peace and plenty, temporally, and especially 95 96 THE MANIFESTO. spiritually, being the order of the days as they come and go with no thought for the morrows. We are all glad to welcome Eldress Eliza Stratton, of the North Family, to the renewal of her former duties in the Ministry. Some fourteen years ago she removed from the Ministry and became an indefatigable Trustee, afterwards succeeding to the duties of Eldress at our North Family. The order of Ministry requiring her services once more, our Sister comes in again with a hearty and general welcome. As one comes, another goes, for the removal of Eldress Eliza to the Church necessitates a corresponding removal from it, and we bid God speed to our Sister Elmira Hillsgrove who leaves us for the North Family to become associate with Eldress Harriet March. Amid the various changes of life the uppermost thought is constantly with us that the purity of life lived by all souls, compose the Zion of God, and not houses, lands or a multitude of people. This thought leads into another, that of all the papers in the land, our little Manifesto should be the most spiritual in its'aims, from north to south teaching the use of all things as not abusing them, with the constant injunction that all our treasure-stores are being laid up in the heavens where neither moth nor rust can corrupt. This should bear the stamp of the united effort of a united people, to render to God all things with equal gospel non-reservation. With this full spirit of resignation, we become more united and receive from the heavens a deeper baptism into the spirit of Christ, receiving with meekness the power of God into our souls, we need never be afraid of becoming worldly or too deeply engrossed with the various business duties that await our willing energies. Our Sweater business affords us, by a steady receipt of orders, as much work as is desirable for our spiritual growth. Sister Lucy Ann Shepard has temporary charge in the absence of Sister Dorothea Cochran. Br. William Briggs finds scope for all his various resources of mechanical ingenuity to keep the machinery in smooth going order. Our Br. David T. Williams, as engineer, is unremitting in his attention and care, leaving no room for anxiety in that direction May God bless our dear Brethren and Sisters who are working among the intricacies of the machinery. Then there is Br. George St. John, who with that forethought which his able predecessor Br. Arthur Bruce always exercised has already taken time by the forelock in the direction of spring garden operations. He is attending the usual early seed potatoes as they are sprouting for special forward garden planting. Albert Evans. � Shakers, N. Y.. Second Family. March, 1893. It is an old saying, one extreme follows another; so it is as regards the weather. In our last we were lamenting no snow, and now we have too much. We also have had but little water; probably the next will contain accounts of floods; so it goes the year around. There is always something a little out of joint and not just as I would have had it, thus wails poor humanity. As we have been snowed in the past month we have not much that is new or interesting to write about. Our Beloved Ministry are here at their Valley home. The health of Society is as good as could be expected considering the cold and changeable weather. If blizzards and windy wTeather have anything to do with longevity, we have had enough the past month to make us think of Methuselah' s age. But we have come to the conclusion that there is enough for us to worry about that we can help, and to worry as little as possible about what we cannot help. It is well that we have not the charge of the weather for I do not think we cotild improve it, or make people more satisfied, therefore, let us remember that a contented mind is a continual feast. Isaac Anstatt. THE MANIFESTO. 97 North Family. Mar. 1893. What a bond of union the little Manifesto is, on its monthly visits, bringing the best thoughts from dear Brethren and Sisters. It must be the tree that 'yieldeth its fruit every month,' and is for the healing of the nations. By the time these notes appear the preliminary work on the farm and garden will have begun. What can be a more valuable adjunct to and as a means of healthy living than a well kept garden where not only the necessaries but some of the luxuries can be produced that will thrive in this climate. And while the subject of horticulture is under discussion we would say to all lovers of melons, that they can be had from two to three weeks earlier than common by the use of a cold frame, glass, without bottom heat cut sod about six inches square and four inches thick from rich pasture land, invert and plant under glass early enough so that by the time out-door planting is ready they will have made growth to their fourth or sixth leaf and be ready to set in the open ground. A tastefully arranged and neatly kept flower bed in the lawn or dooryard is a source of innocent pleasure and profit to young and old. We know of no one flower that will give such a magnificent display and is as hardy as Drummond Phlox. Every lover of flowers must make his own selection. The kinds that can be selected from, are legion. The wish from our beloved Brother, Daniel Orcutt that the Manifesto could make weekly instead of monthly visits touches a responsive chord in the souls of many of its readers. We are not given to indulge in flattery but would say with honest feelings, may the Editorial shadow never grow less, and all of the workers on our little missionary feel their hearts encouraged and their hands strengthened. We remember the words of Lawrence, 'Don't give up the ship,' and though at times out of sight of land we know that we have a pilot who is safe and we shall yet enter our port of destiny.
