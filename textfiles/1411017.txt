DWELLING IS GOD. MARION JOHNSON. ' God is love: and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.' I. John, iv.: 16. Tins sublime yet simple sentence, so replete with meaning', so emphatically declaring and summing up all Christian life and progress, comes home to the heart with the clear incisive force of inspiration ; clearing away the mists of doubt and error from the mind, dispelling the fog of old tradition and superstition and letting the clear sunlight of the gospel shine into the soul. Love is the fulfilling of the law ; the embodiment of the golden rule ;ï¿½ the grand underlying principle upon which the whole superstructure of the Christian character should be built ; if reared upon this basis it will withstand and endure whatever trials may be brought to bear upon it. Love to God and love to our neighbor should be the ruling motive in our lives, then shall we be found dwelling in God and abiding securely beneath the shadow of his wings, far above the corroding cares, the petty anxieties, the doubts and fears which so often annoy and perplex us. To gain this heavenly and blissful dwelling-place, this angelic abode, this haven of rest from all strife, turmoil and unrest, which is the heritage of the heart unsubdued and uuregenerated by the gospel, we must bear a daily cross against every passion and propensity of a natural and carnal heart, and from this life of self-denial and self-crucifixion emanate the rich blessings and comforts of gospel peace and love. But when the refining is completed, when the dross is all consumed, and we are purified from every stain and mar of sin, then shall we know the deep abiding peace, rest, and satisfaction of dwelling in God and He in us. Beautiful rest! compared with thee, how puerile, how insignificant, how utterly worthless appear the fleeting and transitory honors and pleasures which the world offers to its votaries ! How should it rouse us to action, stimulate us to higher endeavors, quicken us to renewed exertions, to know that this wealth of the spirit can become ours, to know that we can blend with the angelic host in their songs of praise and triumph through a never-ending eternity.
