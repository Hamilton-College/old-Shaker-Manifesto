A SUPERIOR REMEDY FOR FRESH WOUNDS, SPRAINS AND BRUISES. Procure a mild, coal fire. Sprinkle it with drops of any kind of animal oil, or grease, or tallow. Hold the effected part over the smoke, say thirty minutes, as hot as can be borne. A good way is to use a large tin tunnel inverted, as it gathers the smoke into a small compass. Hold the wound directly over the tunnel. Whoever will apply this to wounds, sprains, or bruises, two, three, or more times, say once in twelve hours, will find it invaluable to allay pain, to prevent soreness and taking cold, and the recovery will be rapid. This remedy has been practiced in the United Society of Shakers for more than thirty years, with most astonishing success.
