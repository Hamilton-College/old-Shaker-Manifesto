Watervliet, N. Y. Second Family. Wintek has set in, we have little snow but quite good sleighing. We are busy just now threshing grain. The North Family and we have joined help thereby mak- ing it a little lighter for both. Oats turn out good, but rye rather poor, but as crops on the whole have been quite fair, complaining will do no good. Have cut some tire wood also. As we must soon bid good by to '93 we shall have to prepare for the year '94. May we be careful to make fewer resolves but determined to keep all good ones and add unto them more. Each year is telling either for good or otherwise. There is need of extra exertion and may we begin the New Year with a determination to be consecrated, and not feel, I am only one, it will not matter much. Let us remember that as we are a part of community we should individually feel that there is a duty we owe to ourselves and also to society, which is to do all the good we can and as little harm as possible. Each deed counts either for good or evil. We wish all the household of faith east and west a happy New Year with gospel increase. Therefore, let all in particular study more closely the principles of our faith, that we may not only be better able to give a reason why we are Believers, to candid inquirers, but it will help us to work more understanding^ for salvation and redemption from a sinful life.
