Was Moses Mistaken? Was Moses Mistaken? This is the title'of a nicely illustrated pamphlet from II. L. Hastings of Boston, Mass. Someone has taken the liberty, either carelessly or willfully to make the statement, Moses was Mistaken, and things were not as he stated them to be in the Biblical'History. Br. Hastings becomes an advocate for Moses and in this little pamphlet proves to his own satisfaction that Moses was right and that Sacred and Profane History are able and truthful witnesses of the correctness of all that he said and did. Bead what Br. Hastings says on the subject and then if you are not fully persuaded to walk with Moses, you can make farther investigations. H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.

Word and Works Pub. Co. St. Louis, Mo. Figs or Pigs? Figs or Pigs? This is a pamphlet on Vegetarian Philosophy, by James M. Allen. The Author in his preface says,�'The food of human beings, except infants, should be derived directly and wholly from the Plant Kingdom. No food should be used which necessitates slaughter.' He then proceeds to tell the reason why and the why must be ascertained by reading his book which is very interesting as it includes testimonies from many deep thinking minds. The tenacity of habit, rather than careful reason, holds many to the system of eating slaughtered animals. It becomes a matter of education from early childhood and is not easily laid aside. Publisht at 233 Commercial St. Springfield, Mo. The Ladies' Home Journal Few people know that John Wesley was ever in America.
