Enfield, N. H. Oct., 1892. Beloved Elder Henry:Not forgetting your consecrated efforts in issuing the monthly Manifesto, fraught with so much that is worthy our acceptance, our thanks are due to you and the kind friends who suggested the more social correspondence, which gives us a better opportunity to hear from our kindred Societies both East and West. We find that it yields great pleasure to its many readers, and opens the avenues which serve to broaden our acquaintance and strengthen a kindly interest that might never otherwise be realized: so we bless the good wherever found. Some days since we entertained a gentleman and lady from Braintree Mass., by the name of Watson, who called upon us to spend the Sabbath; they belonged as they said to a growing party, termed Nationalists. These people seemed to have the conviction that mankind were growing to endorse to some extent the practicability of Edward Bellamy's dream as pictured in 'Looking Backward.' They gave us an outline of what they were doing. They were in earnest in their work, and we bid them God-speed, for well we know the world needs a mighty revolution. We are now in the midst of Harvest; with a view of preparing for winter. Potatoes are all dug; not a medium crop, and poor quality. Have just finished gathering our apples and think it safe to say that we have never known so few, in our remembrance. Of tomatoes, grapes and plums we have a good supply. On the 5th. inst. a cold wave struck us, and the snow fell sufficient to mantle the high mountain just east of our Village. We have had some hard frosts but have been fortunate in securing our vegetables so that nothing has been injured. We find enough work each day for willing hands and hearts, in striving to keep our home as near the standard of the Shaker Church as is possible, asking in faith and trust that a blessing crown our every effort for good. J. R. 3STortli Family. Esteemed Editor:Acting upon the suggestion of friends, we have contributed the 'Home Notes,' hoping they will not take the place of more valuable items. We sincerely appreciate the varied thought given each month for the pages of our Manifesto, and hope its precious sheets laden with soul elevating truth, will ever appear before the public. Antagonistic, as the Christ virtues are to the carnally inclined, we do not marvel that mortals should seek to retard the reforming powers, that would shatter all idols not bearing the stamp of holiness. Elaborate, may be the comparisons portraying the richness, glory and joy of a Christian life, and the unsatisfactory demoralizing effects of an ungodly life; still the unregenerate heart will crave the food of self-indulgence, and ignore and scoff at virtue. In our religious and social meetings is manifest a zeal to keep step with the class of earnest workers for the truth, and to develop those soul traits approved of God. Each day finds us busy in securing the fruits of the season. With the majority of New England farmers we have to report a small crop of apples, pears and potatoes as compared with former years, while of other fruits including berries, plums, etc., we have an average crop. The Sisters have acted well their part in preserving fruits and making jellies to enrich our table during the long and dreary months of winter. During the summer months, from a herd of thirteen cows, we have realized a yield of 1,125 lbs. of cheese, and averaged 25 lbs. of butter per week, besides being liberally supplied with cream for home consumption. Our family has raised and prepared for Boston market, 1,300 lbs. of Lavage, and at this date are engaged digging and preparing Dock root for J. C. Ayer, of Lowell, Mass. Amount not yet ascertained. Last but not least among our blessings, we are able to report a healthy condition physically, and spiritually, hence are realizing the happiness attendent upon this state of things. Kindest wishes for all the readers of our Manifesto. G. H. B.
