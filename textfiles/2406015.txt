Shaker Station, Conn. May, 1894. 'Let the peace of God rule in your hearts and be ye thankful.' The peace of God, which true crossbearing brings, gives joy, even in tribulation and the deepest affliction. 'Peace like a river.' We should be thankful for virtuous companions; for the comforts of a gospel home and social life, and for religious privileges and spiritual blessings that can not be measured. Offering thanks is acceptable to God. It is befitting that we join unitedly in special thanksgiving for the blessings of peace and salvation. Wisdom's path is peaceful and safe. Let us walk therein, and we shall be free from the reigning blight of sin. 'If we do ill, the joy fades, not the '1 HE MANIFES TO. 143 pains; if well, the pain doth fade, the joy remains.' No crown without the cross. ******* The limit of the capacity of the earth is 5,203,000,000 souls, says a Scientist, and this number will be reached in less than one hundred and eighty-seven years.' 'Glass in oven doors is a new contrivance, it enables cooks to watch the food without opening the doors.' 'Various attempts have been made to measure the rate at wliich electricity travels, and observers with delicate instruments have affirmed that it was not less than 114,000 miles per second.' The Brahma is a favorite breed of fowls with some poultry men, but not so profitable when thorough-bred as it is when crossed, that is, when the raising of chickens is an object in view. A profitable cross has been found between the Brahma and Leghorn. Daniel Orcutt.
