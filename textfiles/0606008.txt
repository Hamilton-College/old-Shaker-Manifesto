ADD WORKS TO FAITH This from the Golden Rule is a good warning based on true doctrine, and there is need of both the warning and the doctrine. ' Every Christian should beware of his faith, lest he grow to depend upon it overmuch and to deem it sufficient of itself to save him. For there is a faith which is of a deadly sort, and not of a lively, and it worketh death, and not life, to the soul that is drugged by it. This is the faith of those who do nothing, but have faith, and who trust to credulous exercises of their minds, and suppose that salvation will be theirs by reason of their assurance. But the Scriptures warn against this spurious faith, and make clear to all who study the sacred pages, that reliance on it is fatal to one's hope.'
