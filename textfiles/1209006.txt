ETERNAL LIFE. NANCY G. DANFORTH What is it? Jt is a life which we may live through all eternity without a desire of change in the order of it. We may still be progressing, traveling from one degree of perfection to another ; drawing nearer ever nearer to God, the Source of all life. The Savior says, 'My sheep hear my voice ard they follow me, and I give unto them o'eruul life and they shall never perish.' Thus we find that this life which we seek is obtained by becoming a follower of Christ. Being thus sheltered from the tumultuous storms of strife and ambition, which so fiercely rage among the children of this world, while contending for wealth, or unmerited fame, we turn the warfare within to overcome all that would render life unholy ; those conditions which would make eternity unpleasant to contemplate. The strife of the true disciple is to live in peace ; to speak kindly to all ; to forgive the erring, and let the love of God reign supremely in the soul, governing every act of the life. Where these principles are lived they will create a state so happy that we shall not wish a change ; but would have it grow into more and more of heaven, even upon earth. In this way we are sowing seed, the fruits of which we shall be willing to reap, and thus lay hold on Eternal Life. CanterburyN. H.
