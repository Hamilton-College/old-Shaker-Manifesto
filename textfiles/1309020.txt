Dear little Jessie; thank you for your wee letters... Shaker Village, N. H. July, 1883. Dear Little Jessie ;¦—-Thank you for your wee letter. S ort visits, make long friends; and what will short letters do? Can Jessie tell? Well, they are better than none at all. You must enjoy your nice swing ever so much. I wor.der if there ever was a little girl who did not like to swing. I suppose you and Gracie take turns, don't you? and Jessie's turn is the longest, because she does not have so many dialogues to learn for examination. You did not tell me what you were intending to do on that eventful day; presume you intend that, for your next letter, so I will wait. The roses are in bloom; that is very nice, too. Little girls like roses almost as well as they do swings ; but they do not last quite as long. We have a great many roses. The pond in some places is white with lillies. Our little girls are attending school. When not thus employed, they assist a little in the kitchen, work in the flower garden, or some other pleasant recreation. I hope you are trying to be a real, good girl; obedient to your parents, kind and gentle to all your companions. It is such children that we like to have come and live with us. When you say your little prayers, • you must remember your Shaker friends, and ask God to bless them; for we believe that the prayer of even a little child may do much good. I shall want to hear from you again. Sisters II—L—and E—wish to be kindly remembered to you all. Kindly Yours, A. E. N.
