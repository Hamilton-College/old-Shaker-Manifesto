TRUST. By Annie R. Stephens. It seems but yesterdaywhen winter's gloom Its somber robes of desolation spread, When leafless trees swayed lonely bare and dead. And now, what glorious resurrection from the tomb! The frozen bough is white and pink with bloom, The woodland violets faintest perfume shed, O'er velvet slopes on cloth of gold we tread That sunlight weaves, dark places to relume. And so we trust the hand that guides the year, Who, to the arid wastes new life can bring; Serene we wait without a doubt or fear For Hope to bloom, for Joy to soar and sing ; For out of life's dark reaches sad and drear, A touch divine shall bring immortal Spring.
