The True Gentleman The following sketch is called the portrait of a true gentleman, found in an old manor- house in Gloucestershire, England, written, framed, and hung over the mantel-piece of a tapestried sitting-room:— 'The true ggitleman is God's servant, the world's master, and his own man; virtue is his business, study his recreation, contentment his rest and happiness his reward; God MANIFESTO. THE 331 is his father, the Church is his mother, the saints his brethren, all that need him his friends; devotion is his chaplain, chastity is his chamberlain ; sobriety his butler, temperance his cook, hospitality his housekeeper. Providence his steward, charity his treasurer, piety the mistress of his house, and discretion his porter, to let in or out as most fit. This is his whole family, made up of virtues, and he is the true master of the house. He is necessitated to take the world on his way to heaven; but he walks through it a fast as he can, and all his business by the way, is to make himself and others happy. Take him in two words—a Man and a Christian.'
