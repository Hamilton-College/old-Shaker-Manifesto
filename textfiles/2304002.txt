A BLESSING. I hold in my hand a blessing,� A blessing for every one; Oh, come partake of the fullness! Each daughter and each son. Purity�whitest of raiment To clothe the spirit form, To bring the joy of the angels, The whole life to adorn. Love�with the flowing mantle To cover the erring soul; And Peace like an angel walking Where the angry billows roll. O, come! while the spirit moveth; And be forever blest With hope, and joy, and courage, In the way of righteousness. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
