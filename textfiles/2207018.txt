Canaan, N. Y. June, 1892. We are enjoying this pleasant season, having had an abundance of rain and cold weather. Nature has, indeed, put on her most beautiful array. Orchards, gardens, meadows, yea, all things seem to vie with each other in splendor and rapid growth. Surely 'the lines have fallen unto us in a pleasant place.' Plowing, planting and sowing have been done with zeal and energy. Sisters have done their part by getting various kinds of plants well started in hot beds; besides many plants and flowers with which to beautify our home. All, even to the children, have taken a lively interest in helping on the good work of building up and supporting the cause, gladly performing manual labor and home duties of every kind with the prospect of enjoying in common, the fruits of unselfish, united labor. More than this, we are blest with good spiritual meetings, blessed opportunities for developing the better part of our beings, for awakening pure thoughts and holy aspirations and drawing down those heavenly ministrations which strengthen both body and mind. What hour is so blest as that spent in spiritual devotion when all hearts in unison are striving for the pearl of great price, the true spirit of holiness. A good Shaker meeting, in which every heart is free from sin by an honest confession and is therefore free in the spirit to impart and make manifest their best gifts, is really and truly a feast of good things. It is the true impetus, the great motor which gives life and growth to a religious organization. Then let us raise higher the gospel banner and through the efficacy of living testimony and inspirational song, gather that abiding power that wrill be a substance and treasure for other souls, that they also may come and glorify the eternal spirit of goodness by helping to carry on the grand work of human redemption. Our five Sisters who have been visiting the friends at Watervliet, have returned laden with gospel love and renewed energy to persevere in well-doing, feeling quite refreshed by the kind hospitality so nobly extended toward them.
