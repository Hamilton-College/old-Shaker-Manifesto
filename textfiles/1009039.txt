Book of ensilage J. M. Bailey The Book of Ensilage, Billerica, Mass. In this work we have a treatise upon the newest and grandest sensation in the agricultural world. The idea of being able, by regarding the instructions of this handsome volume, to preserve in the green state for winter and spring uses clover, corn fodder, peas, beans, etc., is simply wonderful to thiak of, and by which we are enabled to produce milk for one cent per quart, butter for ten cents per pound, beef for four cents per pound, and mutton for nothing, when wool is thirty cents a pound ! We mean to try this Ensilage system by the construction of a small silo, and would recommend to all farmers the reading of the book.
