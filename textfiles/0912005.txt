SINGING SCHOOL OLA L. WHITCOMB Not the spectacled Master of Music, With a ' do,' and a ' re,' and a ' mi,' With a tuning fork, pointer and blackboard, And a rule like the tough 'Rule of Three;' But a sweet little brook in the meadow—¦ Where the willows can dip in their leaves, That babbles, and ripples and murmurs, Full of music ; the brook never grieves. A dear little bird on the walk there, Sipping temperance wine at his will, And singing as though life depended On the force of his not keeping still; A cricket, somewhere in a crevice, With chir-r, chirp, chimp and cheer, Whoever heard tell of a cricket That had in its song an ' Oh dear ! ' A fly, spinning round in the sunlight ; A bee, humming tunes to the flowers ; And the soft, sweet pattering music Of raindrops in afternoon showers ; The teakettle, hung in the fire-place, What a marvel, of music it owns ! No Mendelssohn, Mozart nor Blind Tom, Can equal its sharp and flat tones. I remember the times of my childhood, Its music was charming to me ; Perhaps that charm was—was—because — Wrell—we used to have dough-nuts for tea! The children out there on the hill-side 'Mongthe violets, sweet is their song ; Young children, bright flowers and music, Such beauties together belong. The brook, bird, bee, rain and fly, And children, are songs without end ; Nature's grand concert of harmony Is the singing school 1 would attend. Canaan, N. Y.
