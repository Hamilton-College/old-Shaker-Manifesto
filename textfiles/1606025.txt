Pitching towards Sodom. The Christian man who sacrifices principle to interest, and who makes the law of the Lord a variable thing, is pitching his tent towards Sodom. A gentleman, an officer of the church, some years since opened a hotel in a country village. He did it to support his family, and it was right; but then, to secure custom, he departed from Christian principles, and kept an open bar. In a few years he died, leaving a widow and several sons. The hotel was kept up, and his sons attended at the bar. The sons of that man all became drunkards, they squandered his property, and his widow is now sustained by the benevolence of the church. He was a good man, but he pitched his tent towards Sodom. Christian Advance.
