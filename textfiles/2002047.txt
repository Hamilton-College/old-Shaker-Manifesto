OUR COUNTRY'S NEED. Dr. Carl. Can we not see the hand-writing on the wall? Shall we not take warning? Is there no danger in the alarming truth that we as a people, as a nation, are last becoming slaves to a giant evil, the monopolies and trust combinations with (heir iron heel ready to crush to earth all they cannot control in their gambling board of trade down to the elevating principles of the true Gospel which they think they do not need and are trampling under their feet. Is it uot time that every known evil should be removed without time for argument? It is evident that much of this giant evil is to-day with all its worldlv elements in the fashionable churches, crowding out the Christ Gospel Spirit, putting the poor man under its feet; no gospel for him, no Savior. Only a slave greater than ever the black man was would it proclaim, forgetting what Jesus said,�What is a mau advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself? Again,�'If any man will come after mo, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.' Truly in vain have thousands and tens of thousands of laborers, men and women, been looking for the emancipating light to come through the legislative hall, and by the influence of their faith in a church which is equal iu its grasp ; and of all laborers woman has been the most patient and made the greatest sufferer to maintain the needs of this life and her virtue. No set of men would endure what woman has without a riot. There can be no rest as long as ancient darkness of the past centuries remain hovered over the present age. We who live in this blessed nineteenth century should not be willing to go back to be guided by the theories of the past only in the true Gospel light which was given to all mankind. Again, the educational systems are much in fault; the rostrum, the pro fessioual teacher and the common school all desire to cram the mind as if it was an elastic balloon never to collapse, but continue to stuff the mind until it is stupefied, mind and body enfeebled ; and fail to develop the moral power which is the great element of success and true happiness for the good of the people, and not turning away from what is practical and simple. It is the grand mistake of the times to foster an idea that we need not the Gospel truths now as ever. Because dark and dangerous clouds are hanging over its false teachers who desire to be the shrine and will not give God the glory nor look for the true Christ-life as is to-day manifested at all times in that people who live in the second appearing of Christ and to-day are the chosen few faithful ones. Where the door stands wide open for all who may come where there is no trust or monopolies only iu the spirit of love and to carry out the teaching of Christ in all its effects for the good of each other.
