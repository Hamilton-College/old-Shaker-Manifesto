South Union, Kys Feb. 1891. What glorious weather we do have! The sun shines very nearly every day, and truly the Lord has blessed us, not only with fine weather, but a proportionate amount of everything that is necessary in this life. One of our members, C. Holman, ha,s invented a rotary engine, and another member, Sanford Russell, has a steam propellor under way and nearly ready for vise. A mania has seemed to take hold of some of the Brothers for inventing and being skillful mechanics, and they are very successful. Although mechanism seems to play an important part, here, we need a general out-pouring of the Spirit of God, as every one seems to be in need of this awakening gift. It is rumored that one of our members is now studying out a plan for a flying machine. If such is the case you may expect a visit from him. C. R.
