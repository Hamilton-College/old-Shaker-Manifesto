EDITORIAL NOTES THE PRESENT NUMBER Contains much that is very valuable for the students of religious literature. Without specifying any one article, we ask close inspection of all, and all will be found profitable unto increasing virtue and truth. The article by Elder G-. B. Avery will be critically canvassed by many thinkers. Our music this month is very harmonious and agreeable. There is no denomination but can use it with pleasure and profit. We are sorry to record some departures from our midst of those whose years could not reasonably demand a passport to spirit spheres, and that to ' B. Good' we yet must die.
