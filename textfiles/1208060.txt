Sheep are becoming popular... Sheep are becoming popular with the masses of Western Farmers, who seek to increase their profits by stock raising and at the same time improve their soil, raise more grass, have less labor, and make more money. A pound of mutton can be raised as cheap as a pound of beef or pork, and is worth equally as much in market, and the wool is extra profit. Use thoroughbred males of any of the popular breeds, and in a few years your sheep will be a source of pride as well as of profit. Farming World.
