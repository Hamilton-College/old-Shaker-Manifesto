As it is more blessed to give... 'God loveth a cheerful giver'.' 2. Cor.ix., 7. As it is more blessed to give than to receive we should strive to give to others what we receive, cheerfully, not grudgingly, nor of necessity because all that we are able to give, in comparison to what we daily receive, is so meagre, that we should not only improve every opportunity which comes in our way but seek to benefit some one either by word or action. There are, as we all know, gifts of more value than the tangible things of this life with which we may bless each other. The treasures of a well stored mind, and a kind, courteous deportment toward all, are of far greater worth than all that may be bought or sold. Yet, how often, we defer the kind look, or the gentle word, and instead of making those around us happy, and having our own pathway fraught with blessing, we cause our friends and teachers much anxiety through our carelessness, and neglect of duty. Sometimes a kind word may cause an erring child to take a new step in the right, or perhaps develop new ideas of a religious life, while the careless words too often spoken, may cause years of sorrow. While we thiuk of all these things, let us resolve within ourselves to guard our lips more closely, that the sins of a careless life may not be ours to bring sorrow in the coming years. Mary M.
