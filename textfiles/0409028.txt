THE LEBANON SHAKERS The Troy Press, in writing up a Shaker history, says, in 1779, the people in the vicinity of New Lebanon became greatly interested in the conversation of a Shaker who chanced in that direction. Many were ready to believe his doctrines. Calvin Harlow was appointed by the New Lebanon folks to see the people at Niskayuna, and to bring an account of them. When he returned he confessed himself unqualified to give a proper report, and Joseph Meacham and Amasa Hammond (both Baptist ministers) and Aaron Kibbemade another excursion with him to the Shaker settlement. The four believed that what they saw and heard was the truth of God. A settlement was formed at New Lebanon, and in a short time the converts there were more numerous than the original Believers at Niskayuna.
