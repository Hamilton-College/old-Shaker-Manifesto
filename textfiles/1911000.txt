HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. NO. 5. The 'Instruments' were on some occasions, thrown into singular contortions of the body, as though in great distress, or would be seen bowing the whole body, for a long time, or turning with great velocity, or lying motionless on the floor. Those in a trance state would deliver their messages, or relate what they had seen in the spirit land and then return to their normal condition. Some who had cherished a lukewarm or infidel spirit, were arrested in astonishment and began to reconsider the position they had occupied. This was a manifestation that they had not anticipated, and were quite unprepared to solve the problem. To those who were spiritually minded it was a comfort and a staff. It increased their joy as they moved on their heavenly journey, and enhanced their anticipations of a future, spiritual kingdom, 'a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.' Every manifestation seemed designed to inspire a deeper love for sacred and divine things, and to establish a greater confidence in the beautiful gifts. The wonderful exercises of the Instruments, gave evidence to the many witnesses, of a supernatural power, which was passing among them. Sometimes several persons would be in the entranced state, and without a word of introduction, engage in a new and intricate exercise with the most exact precision. They passed and repassed each other with the greatest care as only those could who were under a more exalted influence. During all this time, their eyes were closed, and yet, they were never known to stumble over any object that intercepted th^ir passage, or to move in a wrong direction. The singing of new songs, and of spiritually improvised Anthems, some of which were attended with beautiful and intricate motions and all brought forward with remarkable composure and exactness, was additional evidence of the work of the spirit. A large part of the service was now occupied in these wonderful manifestations of the unseen power, which became very interesting to those who remained as witnesses. These gifts were also manifested more or less during the day, and yet did not trespass on the time of the daily avocations. The visionists were, sometimes, led by their guides to visit those who had entered the spirit world, and were engaged in worship, and then would be taken into their dwellings, and gardens, and at such times, they would speak audibly of what they had seen and heard, but were wholly lost to the things of this earth. The descriptions which they gave, of their interviews, were expressed in the choicest language as they referred to the spiritual blessings of those who were faithful to bear the cross of Christ. At other times the visionists were conducted to the dwelling places of unhappy spirits. Some of the conditions in this place filled them with fear and horror, while many of the spirits uttered solemn warnings to those who were unfaithful to the voice of God. It was not our province to judge this work, as we could know of the spirits, only as we learned from the visiouists. The Second and South families at Watervliet, N. Y., were the first places where these singular manifestations were witnessed, and for months they were of daily occurrence. As no one could determine the reason for this sudden outpouring of visionary gifts, and especially as it came, first, through thi children, it was permitted to work its own development, and be, as it really was, a blessing to the Society. In January, 1838, not less than eight, individuals were under the visionary in fluence and eighteen visits were made to the spirit land. Many of the Believers from other Societies visited Watervliet to witness the strange phenomena. They did not go because they were entire strangers to spirit manifestations, but this was new in that it corresponded so well with the prophecy of Joel, 'And it shall come to pass, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your .sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.' Joel ii., 28. During the period from August, 1837, to April, 1838, the manifestations at New Lebanon, were very limited, but many were praying for their revival and great increase. Jt was a time of anxious anticipation, particularly, with those who were residents of the first family. After waiting, patiently, fur several weeks, a word was received from the East family at New Lebanon, one of the least in the Community, that they were the recipients of many beautiful gifts, in songs and visions. The Church or first family at New Lebanon, was actively interested in the reports that were received from Watervliet, N. Y., and from other places. The songs were learned aud used, the visions were read and re-read and a general desire to share more and more fr' these precious gifts. A deeper devotiou was manifested in the work of consecration, and through this an ont-pouring of the spirit of God. All the gifts, that had up to this date, been received, seemed well calculated to enliven and encourage all who shared in the blessing, and to convince many of the reality of a future state, as well as to stimulate an interest in sacred things. This was, however, a preparation for the mind to be able to receive a deeper iuward work. Messages. 1838. After waiting, in suspense for a few months, a wave of inspiration broke over the Society, and its manifestation in the first family was quite different from what had been anticipated. Its introduction was by the speaking of solemn messages, during the hour of worship. It was the visitation of guardian angels, and the word was spoken in the name of our Heavenly Father, of our Heavenly Mother, and of the saints and angels of God. It was a season of deep tribulation, which caused great anxiety for those who were absorbed in the work of the spirit. '1 he purport of the messages was that our Zion would be searched as with the caudle of the Lord, and it would be shown how she had departed from that perfect order in which she was established. The time had come when .an advanced work must be done. This must be a deep, heart-searching labor of soul, and the putting away of all that was sinful. God's house must be a house of order, and his people must walk in the light, by honest confession and repentance. Messages were also delivered to individuals, for blessing, for encouragement and for a better understanding of spiritual interests. Many signs were manifested and a greater freedom obtained in the deliverance of exhortations, in time of worship. Singular demonstrations were sometimes made, and by those from whom we might the least anticipate. But it had already been written that, ï¿½'Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.' It was not uncommon to see some led into a gift of violent shaking, of turning or bowing, and for these to continue a long time. Some were thrown into a trance state and would lay as one in death. Those who spoke by inspiration would generally be seized by that mysterious power or influence, and tremble or shake before they gave utterance to the words of the spirit. This was followed by a more passive condition, during which, the 'Instruments' would speak with great clearness and composure. We were often favored with reports which informed us of a corresponding work among the Believers in other Communities. Of course it was pleasant and interesting to learn that such was the case. In June 1838, these gifts and messages were less frequent, having as we supposed fulfilled their mission to the people. During the month of August, we experienced a revival of the manifold gifts, as before, both in exercises and in doctrine. Many evidences were given that Mother Ann was still solicitous for the spiritual prosperity of her gospel children. Special blessings were conferred upon those who were agod, and a prayerful hope expressed for the young. One of the remarkable features of this work, was the deprivation of speech which, on some occasions, continued several days. Not a word of the English language escaped their lips. During this time, at extended intervals, they would for a few minutes use a form of speech, but it gave no intelligence to the general compaay. Some who were not able to converse with their companions, would sing beautiful songs. Some became speechless and helpless, under which influence they would remain for several hours. (To BE CONTINUED.)
