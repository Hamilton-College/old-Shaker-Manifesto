Shaker Station, Conn. Dec. 1892. Jesus said, 'I have meat to eat that ye know not of.' If the meat that perish- eth is good and desirable, the meat that endureth unto everlasting life is much more needful. There is no hunger like the hunger of the soul for spiritual food. Many persons desire peace and rest in a worldly life but find continual unrest. True rest is found only in a godly life a sinless condition. ^'Godliness is profitable unto all things ' It is as blessed as it is profitable. Choice literature is sometimes chosen for New Year's gifts, often very appropriately. It is natural to make use of what interests us, as an expression of our interest in others. A gift of the Manifesto for one year to our friends, who are not now blest with its monthly messages of purity and truth, might be productive of much good. Let us try it. Special grain for fowls at this season of the year, such as buckwheat, ilax-seed, wheat and oats, make excellent changes used in small quantities in connection with the regular diet. A good supply of coarse food is very essential to the health of the flock. Loose or poor heads of cabbage stored by themselves are the best and most easily obtained green food for poultry during winter. Two or three heads hung so that the fowls can easily reach them, and renewed when necessary will well repay the trouble. Onions are very good to mix with the salt food. Poultry keepers must exercise judgment in the selection and changes of food in cold weather. A change of rations two or three times every week will give strength, tone and appetite to chickens. D.
