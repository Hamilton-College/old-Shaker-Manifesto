ELECTION, TEMPERANCE, LAND Eternal, abiding and unchanging law: Truth is the only fore-ordination that ever was or ever will be. We are nominated and drawn by the Father, but our election depends on the Mother, in the tangible form of works; deeds of holiness and righteousness qualified by temperance. Under the law the heirs of temperance are promoted to honor and trust, to office and to the teaching, with grace and truth, gifts of the spirit, healing, speaking in unknown tongues, etc. So far the ' Shakers ' have done well in fulfilling the law of Moses and the teaching of Christ, relative to marriage, duty to God, duty to our fellow creatures, abstinence from strong drink, swine's flesh, etc. In the primitive, or Father's adopted Church, a wife was permitted. The permission lasted unto the setting up of the Mother Church. The ax hath been used for all advances in progression. It has lopped off, in that Church, husband and wife, strong drink, swine's flesh. The ax will be wielded further. All permissions must run out. Offenses must cease in proportion to Church progress.
