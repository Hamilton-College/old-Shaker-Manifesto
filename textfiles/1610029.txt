FOREVER. Canterbury, N. H. No other God will I adore, For I have felt Jehovah's pow'r; It called me in a needy hour To praise his name forever. Forev, forever, forever and forever. I'll give the best, a measure full, A cheerful heart, a living soul; And through his love I'll be made whole, forever and forever.
