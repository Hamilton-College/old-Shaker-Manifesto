WHAT IS PRAYER? Hamilton De Graw. (The thoughts are suggested by the Poem in 'Lucifer' of May 3rd. 1889.) The question is asked and will be answered from the stand-point of a Believer in the spiritual Philosophy. The Materialist will fail to comprehend our definition. What is Prayer ? It is the divine unfolding of the innermost soul, bringing it into rapport with those subtle elements of the spiritual world which are the fountain and source of life to the soul. Can appeals change the infinite plan and cause it to turn from those immutable laws that govern the spiritual world as well as the material? Nay. to whom then do we pray ? JSot to a personification of great sovereign power that resides somewhere in the universe of miud, dispensing rewards to the meritorious and punishments to the guilty, but to the Divine Father and Mother of life, personified in angels and spiritual beings that are daily ministering to our necessities. Ask the blind or those whose olfactory nerves are dead, if the rose is beautiful and if it smells fragrant. The reply will be that those terms are dead sentences to them. But never-the-less the rose is beautiful and fragrant to those whose senses are alive to its subtle impressions. As well tell a hungry man who is seated before a table loaded with luscious and nourishing food that it does not taste good and will not revive him, as, to tell the soul who is spiritually hungry that by entering into rapport with the fountain of life he will not be refreshed. Then why is prayer not always answered? Because we pray amiss ; if we ask for the impossibilities then we are disappointed. If I pray for the lightning to strike my neighbor's house because I have a grudge against him ; that does not imply an answer to my prayer. His house was simply on the line of the least resistance to the electric fluid and therefore it was struck. The writer says 'Pray not, the darkness will not brighten.' Pity to the individual that is so wrapped in the winding-sheet of doubt and buried in the grave of materialism, that never felt the 'darkness brighten' while in the sweet and silent communion of prayer. 'Within yourselves deliverance must be wrought.' True that each individual must work out his own salvation, but the fact remains that each individual is helped by every other individual that is in spiritual sympathy with their hopes and desires, and retarded in the same ratio that they come ui:der the magnetic influence of opposing forces. It is a fact well known to Believers in the spiritual Philosophy, that there are malignant forces operating against mankind, as there are benign forces working for his elevation, and it is absolutely necessary to understand and discriminate between these two elements if the race is to make any real advancement and not be carried back to barbarism. Viewing it from our stand-point,ï¿½Prayer is not that mysterious unknowable force by which concessions are granted to man by the Infinite mind, but a harmonious blending of the human with the Divine spirit by which the human is polarized and made more positive in its power for good the more it comes in contact with the divine mind.
