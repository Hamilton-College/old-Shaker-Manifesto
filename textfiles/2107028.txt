PEACE ON EARTH. [Contributed by Marion Patrick.] All the world seems to be in a whirlpool, instead of the straight way. Confusion, discord and disobedience is everywhere prevalent. Peace on earth. Where is it? Good-will to man. Where is it? Love one another. Who does that? 'Yea, the truth shall make you free.' But who is free? Money, time and influence are spent on peace societies, trying to convince the people to live in peace, and no longer be at war with each other. Thousands of dollars, tracts, books and papers are sent abroad to convert the people from war to peace; and the temperance people are doing the same to convert people from drunkenness to sobriety; and the professed Christians are trying equally hard to convert the sinner to righteousness. Although each in their sphere may accomplish some good, none will ever make a. permanent success, while the world stands, until they lay the ax at the root of the corrupt tree. Begin first at home. Cle'anse the sanctuary, the temple. If people read lustful literature, it causes them to become lustful. If they read exciting stories, fiction, frightful catastrophes, etc., they will not only dream of hob-goblins, but grow like unto them. Like begets like. When man is continually committing murder, killing, shedding blood, taking life and eating dead flesh, using tobacco, drinking tea and coffee with the '?flesh-pots of Egypt,' is it any wonder that people get bloodthirsty and go to war? Sinners will not be truly converted, drunkenness will not cease, nor war come to an end so long as men kill animals and eat flesh. Vegetarians are universally for peace, hence they are not warriors and are opposed to all war. The Peacemaker.
