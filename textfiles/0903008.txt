BEDS F. W. EVANS Is it not a significant fact that one of the lowest in the animal kingdom has this one good trait. When rising in the morning its first act is to stir up and ventilate, as best it knows how, the bed upon which it reposed ? Is it gratitude for the night's lodging, scientifically expressed, to thus commence the new-born day by observing one of nature's laws, promotive of life and health ? THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 59 Go to the Ant thou sluggard, to learn activity; go to the Stork to learn lilial affections; to the Bee, and be industrious; observe the Swine, and leave not in the morning thy couchuntil, as some of our societies now practice, you have hung up all the bed-clothes and some of the bedding. So shall ye leave the imperfect behind and press on to sanitary perfection. So long as necessity compels to combine the sitting-room and bed-room in one, let the rights of each be regarded. In the forenoon, be it a ventilating bed-room ; in the afternoon, let it be a retiring room. Is a whitewashed sepulcher any more objectionable than a nice-looking sitting-room, made out of an unventilated bed-room ? In every good word and work, the righteousness of Christians should exceed that of the outside world. The preacher's lips should reveal the knowledge that forestalls sickness and premature death, as the result of physical unrighteousness.
