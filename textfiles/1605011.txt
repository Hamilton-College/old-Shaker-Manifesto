'THE HOUSE OF GOD.' P. E. FARTNSWORTH. Is that the ' House oi God ' where human art Displays itself in pictures on the walls� Whose lofty dome and altar� every part For human praise and admiration calls ? Dwells God in temples such as that below, And is it there He doth his glory show ? That fane was reared by human toil and skill, Its decorations speak of human pride, Which seeks with outward show the mind to till And thus its own deformity to1 hide. Ou that gilt altar, beautiful, but cold, Appears no other sacrifice than gold. Is that God's minister to mortals sent, Who comes to them with studied words to tell That they are doomed to endless punishment, The tortures and the agonies of hell? Was that the gospel Jesus came to bring, That man is born to endless suffering? How little of the simple, peerless grace In which the works of Nature all abound, Appears within that consecrated place, Or in the labored manuscript is found. The burdened soul that seeks relief in prayer, Repeats in vain the forms of worship there;. But listen to the notes of sacred (?) song, That from behind a crimson curtain rise ! Now peals the solemn organ loud and long, And now the voice in plaintive cadence dies. The measured tones that through that temple ring Proclaim the praise of�those that play and sing! Behold upon that turret, lifted high, The cross of Jesus, glittering in the sun, To tell the world that once there came to die For man a poor, despised and lowly one! Contrast his life of poverty and woe With all the pomp that fills the house below! 'Tis not by building fanes that reach to heaven, That man is saved and God is glorified, Nor can the sins of any be forgiven Till they have overcome their selfish pride; For what but pride would rear the cross in air Which on their shoulders men disdain to bear? ' God dwelleth not in temples made with hands, ' Nor takes delight in studied forms of prayer, But where the human soul with love expands, His spirit finds a ready temple there; And men should praise and worship God above By lives on earth of harmony and love.
