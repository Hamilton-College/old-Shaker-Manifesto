Enfield, N. H. May, 1896. The theologies of all ages have had a powerful influence in shaping the lives of humanity and advancing civilization. Today we know that all things that tend toward the bettering of self-hood, or the advancement of society, are of God; and numberless are the influences that work for our general good. Good literature, exhortations and prayers, are three great forces effectual in the degree that they inspire to moral activity and good works. Shingle sawing and gardening, combined with the usual invasion of housecleaning are now in full operation, demanding consecrated hand service from willing laborers. As willing hands make light work, so genuine heart goodr/ess is productive of results that bespeak a living christliness, by which human life is brought into rapport with the attributes of God. God, the beauty, wisdom and power, That governs this world of ours; Evolves the crude ore into the flue; Makes life sparkle of the divine. God, centered in spirits not of earth; Known in service of moral worth That tells for justice, wisdom and love Blending mankind with Christ above. George H. Baxter.
