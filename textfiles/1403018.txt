WITH MIGHT AND MAIN. Strike, when you strike, with might and main. Pure force a crisis carries, Whilst wavering strokes, when parley's vain, The feeblest bulwark parries, In every scheme some moments rise That brook not of invasion. No man nor boy e'er clutched his prize Who trifled with occasion. How oft we see a worthy mind, With noble perseverance, Plan, plot and toil, to scoffs resigned, A hero in appearance. And yet, when all the irons glow, A call for resolution. Taint, trembling, at the final blow, And fail in execution. To build an arch, the founder lays O'er strong supports and braces, With cautious touch through anxious days, The granites in their places ; So nice that when the tops begin To meet, a breath would blunder, But when at last the keystone's in, He knocks the props from under. The General, o'er map and chart, To plan a conflict, ranges With anxious brooding mind and heart, And thought that often changes. But when the cannon's thunders lead The battle's crimson story, He must rush in with fearless speed To win his meed of glory. Use care and pains, weigh, shift and pinch In getting matters ready, But solid strength put in to clinch And keep the rivet steady. Tken strike, when strike you must, my boy, With might and main forever; The crashing final blows destroy The blocks t planned endeavor. Selected.
