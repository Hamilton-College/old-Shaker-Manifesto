KIND WORDS. Beloved Elder Henry:--The Manifesto comes to us freighted... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Mar. 1889. Beloved Elder Henrt :ï¿½The Manifesto comes to us freighted with much that is calculated to stimulate thought and give us food for mental growth in the Divine Life. We wish you God speed in sowing the seed of truth. The harvest lags for want of laborers and we pray the Lord to send more earnest workers into the field. Your Brother, Timothy Rayson.
