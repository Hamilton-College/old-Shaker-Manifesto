YOUTHFUL DAYS. By Virgie Breedlove. A NOTHER year is to be numbered with the past. Its pleasures, joys -ZTjL and sorrows are being written; some soon to be forgotten while others will ever remain on the tablet of memory. Each day we are borne further from youth's shore. We should all remember that youth is the time to lay a solid foundation for true and real happiness in after life, by the cultivation of the noble powers of mind given us by a wise and beneficent Creator. If we spend the strength and ardor of our youthful days in idly seeking for pleasure, the distant future to which we now look so joyously, will be filled with vain regrets for wasted opportunities and time unimproved. Some of the brightest examples of history show us the wisdom of devoting our early life to the attainment of that knowledge and the cultivation of those graces of heart and mind that may fit us not only for true enjoyments, but make us a blessing to all humanity.
