The Mistakes of Moses The Mistakes of Moses ! by H. L. Hastings, Boston, Mass. This little Book is an answer to that class who have written against the wonderful work that was accomplished by Moses in liberating the children of Israel. It is now a revised and enlarged edition and has reached no less than 'three hundred thousand.' Such an extended circulation is positive evidence that the book has been appreciated by interested readers and certainly it can not fail to afford a fund of information, and at the same time interest every one who appreciates the study of biblical history. Published by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass. Edward Bok says that of 5000 poems which come into his editorial office during a year, not fifty, if printed, would be read with any degree of patience by the public.Ladies' Home Journal.
