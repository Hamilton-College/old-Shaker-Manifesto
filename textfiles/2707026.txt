THE DAILY CROSS [Contributed by M. Witham.] He who would follow Jesus, A daily cross must bear With never ceasing patience, With watchfulness and prayer; And morning after morning, Must tread the upward way That leads through pain and conflict, To Life's, eternal day. He who would follow Jesus, The Master's life must heed; Must spend his life for others, And oft the hungry feed; There's a daily cross for all, And then the crown and palm, Here loss and many a trial, There Heaven's unending psalm.
