lu Remembrance of Eldress Julia Johnson. JULIA L. SWEET. Unto this sacred place we come With saddened hearts, and sore To render the last solemn rites To one whose short life's o'er. Whose Golden Sun in sky is set All Silver-starred and fair, While radiant gloamings ling'rin- - yet. Bespeak a beauty rare. The beauty of a life well spent In service unto God, Of Heavenly peace and sweet content Though smitten by the rod, Affliction's rod, which robbed her life Of earthly bliss and health, And made existence but a strife Despoiled of this great wealth. Still did she ne'er repine nor grieve, But strove with noble aim The bitter chast'ning to receive And meekly bear the same. Though sorely tortured day and night. No murm'rings ever came, And her chaste soul enrobed in white, Has won the victor's fame. Hancock., Mass.
