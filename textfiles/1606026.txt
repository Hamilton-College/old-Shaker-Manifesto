From the Youth's Bible Class. THE PRODIGAL SON. Luke xv. Among the many parables which Jesus spoke to the multitudes who thronged to hear his beautiful sermons, is the following :�A certain man had two sons, the younger of whom one day asked his father to divide his property and give to him his share, as he wished to travel. The father complied with his request, though with many misgivings, and the son departed with brilliant prospects in view. While his money lasted, he was surrounded with friends, but being of an extravagant nature, his property was soon gone and with it these new acquaintances. Just at this time, a terrible famine arose in the land, and being left entirely friendless, he had no means of support. Hungry, weary, forsaken, the poor outcast reviewed his imprudent course, and though he knew his present condition was the consequence of a false step, he was still too proud to return and ask forgiveness. He determined to find a situation, and work for a living; but he was thwarted in this plan, for like many others equally destitute, he failed to find an opening into business. What should he do? At last, he applied to one of the citizens there, but was coolly told he had servants sufficient. On after thought, however, he said, 'You may go into my fields and care for the swine I am raising. ' The young man thought it all over. Brought up in luxury, every want supplied by the kindness of a fond father, must he now come to this? In the strength and pride of young manhood, must he stoop to this menial service ? It was either accept or perish, and almost desperate, he agreed to serve the man. Slowly and sadly he went into the fields, almost stricken with remorse and disgrace. He thought longingly of the home of his childhood, of the blessings which he had shared within its sacred precincts, and then he wondered if his father would recognize him, should he see him in this miserable con �dition. How he had blighted the hopes o Ms kind parent, and what a poor return he had made for the tenderness which hac guarded his childhood and the paternal love which had blessed his youth ! What a terri ble mistake he had made ! But could he not now atone for the sin ? Thoroughly rep?nf ant and humble, he wept bitterly, for it was not without a struggle, that the wanderer decided to return to his father, confess his transgression and pray to be torgiven. With lightened steps he took his homeward journey, and it was with a grateful heart that he came in sight of the home he had deserted but a few short weeks before, yet how much had transpired in that time ! His father's love had not diminished during the absence of his son, but he had worried and prayed and suffered over his wayward boy. He had been longing for his return for many days, and the watchful eye of the good old man saw the prodigal when he was still far from the house. Hastily catching up his hat, he hurried out, and in a few moments, father and son were again united. How sweet to the paternal ear was the humble confession of his child. His soul warmed with compassion, and upon reaching home, he clothed him with the best his house afforded. His joy knew no bounds. His son had returned, and he intended to make him feel that he was still in his father's blessing. The servants were commanded to spread a sumptuous feast. 'Spare no pains to make the best, ' the father said, and in a few hours the guests were seated to a meal which would have suited even an epicure; then imagine how luscious to the eyes of the famished boy ! Music, dancing and every other possible enjoyment were included, and arrangements were made for a very pleasant entertainment. The elder son, who had been away during the day, heard the music before he reached the house, and he called one of the servants and asked what was going on. On being told of the return of his brother, he was angry and refused to join the merrymakers. The father then came out and entreated him to unite in the feast; but he said, 'I have served you all these years unmurmuringly ; I have never willfully displeased you, and yet, with all my faithfulness, you never provided an entertainment for my friends, and never rewarded me with a tangible proof of your affection. But when my brother returns, he who has spent so much of your property and disgraced your name, you have displayed the best to welcome him. I consider it very unjust that you should treat him so much better than me. ' How Christ-like the gentle reproof of the father! ' My boy has wandered and returned, was dead and is alive again, lost and is now found ! Is not this sufficient cause for great rejoicing? Ah, my son, learn to subdue the jealousy of the heart, and remember ' There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.'' Jessie Evans. Canterbury, N. H. Pitching towards Sodom. The Christian man who sacrifices principle to interest, and who makes the law of the Lord a variable thing, is pitching his tent towards Sodom. A gentleman, an officer of the church, some years since opened a hotel in a country village. He did it to support his family, and it was right; but then, to secure custom, he departed from Christian principles, and kept an open bar. In a few years he died, leaving a widow and several sons. The hotel was kept up, and his sons attended at the bar. The sons of that man all became drunkards, they squandered his property, and his widow is now sustained by the benevolence of the church. He was a good man, but he pitched his tent towards Sodom. Christian Advance. TRANSIENT AND ABIDING. The brilliant flowers will pass away, And singing birds not always stay To cheer us on our lonely way, If such we have ; But truth of virtue in the life, Whate'er the change or outward strife, Is inward joy, with pleasures rife, Earth's failures cannot move.
