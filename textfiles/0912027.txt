LEARN A LITTLE EVERY DAY Little rills make wider streamlets, Streamlets swell the river's flow ; Rivers join the ocean billows, Onward, onward as they go! Life is made of smallest fragments, Shade and sunshine, work and play, So may we, with greatest profit, Learn a little every day. Tiny seeds make boundless harvests, Drops of rain compose the showers, Seconds make the flying minutes, Minutes make the joyous hours ! Let us hasten then, and catch them, As they pass us on our way; And with honest true endeavor Learn a little every day. Let us read some striking passage, Cull a verse from every page, Here a line, and there a sentence, 'Gainst the lonely time of age ! At our work, or by the wayside, While the sun shines, making hay ; Thus we may, by help of Heaven, Learn a little every day.
