Women's temperance Christian union of Boston... The Women's Temperance Christian Union of Boston has been instrumental in procuring laws in fourteen States for compulsory education in the effects of liquor on drinkers. The society now seems to feel the responsibility of indicating what the lesson ought to be. It lias been decided that, in Massachusetts at least, children shall be instructed that alcohol is never desirable as an article of food, that any considerable indulgence in it is sure to be correspondingly injurious to the body, and that mental and moral ruin is bound to result from excess.
