George Francis Train writes to his favorite paper: 'Having eaten no meat, eggs, fish, oysters poultry, or animal food of any kind for many months, all the ancient argument, antagonism, ferocity of my nature has died out, and yet I am in savage health and terrible mental vigor. I never imagined a Bengal tiger could be transformed into a Mongolian sheep by Turkish baths and a vegetable diet. I suppose the new religion of evolution has helped to make the change. I am either incubating some gigantic power to develop love and truth in mankind, or I have culminated in the most magnificent fizzle produced for centuries.'
