INVITATION. Zella H. Terry. We are invited to 'walk in the spirit' to 'worship in the spirit' to 'think in the spirit.' Friends, can you, who are highly developed, spiritually, understand that to a person who has lived only for the senses for the greater part of his life, the idea of being 'spiritually minded' is to him as Greek is to the unlettered savage. The writer speaks from sad experience. It is no little thing to understand or to actually learn how to be 'spiritually minded,' or to 'think in the spirit.' It is true the average intellect can be taught to readily understand that at all times we energize, grow stronger in one or the other of about three grades of thought; either the sensuous, or the intellectual, or the angelic part of our life is being strengthened. But to get command of the mind sufficiently to control our thoughts, with nothing to guide us but our unenlightened minds, must give the seeker for spiritual light a little place in the sympathies of those advanced souls who have progressed and ascended, step by step, up the ladder ahead of us. We are instructed to pray and to meditate. It is true we can say the Lord's Prayer, and have a little set form of prayer; but to pray with composure and to have any conception as to what we pray to, and bow our heads when we have never cultivated reverence, is certainly not praying 'In the spirit.' And how is a novice to meditate unless he is taught how to meditate aright? To form the habit of correct thinking, is to revolutionize our entire being. 'Unregulated thought wars with spiritual growth;' and surely spiritual knowledge and growth should be sought for in a calm, determined, dignified manner: and can no system be suggested? Will some kind Brother or Sister who is now on a higher spiritual plane, please suggest some method to sincere beginners, by which they can possibly gain potency day by day ? and not for years stumble along with no method by w7hich to control the undisciplined mind, taking a step forward to-day, and one backward tomorrow ; working themselves into a state of enthusiasm and then suffering from the reaction which is sure to follow. It is in this reaction where the great danger lies for beginners in spiritual growth; and if there are those above us, who by persistent effort have reached a point of development where they steadily look up higher, kindly suggest how they learned to preserve a medium, as we suppose it is only in that way 'safety lies.' The writer has paid some attention to this subject of reaction which perpetually seems to go on in our dual nature, something akin to the ebb and flow of the ocean. We seem to rise up like billows to meet our God and enthusiastically hold ourselves, so to speak, poised in almost a sublime atmosphere for a short time ; and then the inevitable reaction sets in, and with a soul-sickening feeling we recede ; and doubts come surging in; and the old, bitter, unbelieving spirit cries out, 'Victim of imagination;' 'Self-deluded fool;' 'You cheat your THE MANIFESTO. 1G1 reason into slumber.' Who has not found himself floundering in these waters, and cried out, 'Lord, save, or I perish ? ' These reactions come and go in greater or less degrees, and possibly vary with the individual, as to the quality or state of his three natures. We have tried to ascertain if by any possible means, the probable length of time between these reactions can be determined, and believe that although we may have an impulse to recede now and then, we may, by carefully obeying the behests of our higher nature, triumphantly walk on the waves for about three months, at the end of which time, a reaction will come. Again the question presents itself,ï¿½ Can a system be suggested in this all important subject of soul growth? Could a systematic division of time be arranged which would be conducive to forming the habit of correct thinking? Could a proper diet, or even fasting, assist our higher nature in gaining and retaining the ascendency ? Could we learn to anticipate these reactions, and the weaker ones be taught how to battle with them successfully, and learn to lengthen the time between them until they disappear? We, certainly, take great pains in the training of the physical part of our being. If there is any place on earth where conducive environments and harmonious conditions can be found for spiritual development, it is in a Shaker Community. 'The sphere of spiritual health is serene cheerfulness,' and this serenity is only possible within the climate of love, surrounded by those who are like minded. Union Village, Ohio.
