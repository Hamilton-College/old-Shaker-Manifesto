FRUIT-EATERS NEED NO DOCTORS We were struck recently by the remarks of a doctor friend of ours, who said no one thing will do so much to make people inde- pendent of the medical profession as the daily free use of fruit. He had noticed that those farmers in whose families fruit was regularly and largely consumed, seldom needed his services. 'We thought what a pity that every farmer in the land could not be convinced of these truths. It is a deplorable fact that fanners' families do not enjoy thav; robust health'that country air and out-door life, with plenty of exercise, should give. It is also a fact that, living on farms whose rich acres are aching to produce abundant crops of the varied fruits, but very few have plenty, and many never have any fruit, ex cept it may be an occasional apple. The standard food in a majority of farmers' houses consists largely of bread, butter and meat, mostly pork fried in grease, and, where pastry or cake is used, it has lard in large proportion in its composition; and this food is eaten at least twice, and in many families, three times a day, year in and year out. Is it any wonder that they are not more healthy, and that their prevailing diseases are such as indicate an over-consumption of greasy food? If fruits were expensive or difficult to raise, there would be some excuse; but there is no part of the country without plenty of varieties adapted to its soil and climate, and just such as are fitted by nature to both nourish and cleanse the body, and no more skill is required to grow them than to grow corn and wheat.
