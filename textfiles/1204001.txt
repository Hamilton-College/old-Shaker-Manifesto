LINES FOR BROTHER EZRA SHERMAN R. S. MCGUIRE Our kind loving father Has gone to his rest, Wisely finished his labors below; Having wrought in that righteousness Angels can bltss And Heaven approval bestow. Thus passed our good brother, True, faithful and just, Like a sheaf of ripe grain, gathered home Where treasures lay garnered, Untarnished by rust, The fruit of life's duties well done. How happy the song Of the justified soul, When called earthly cares to lay down : 'I have fought the good fight, Over sin found control, Which gives me my kingdom and crown.' And tho' the thin veil Which now drops between, May hide our dear friend for a time, In spirit we mingle, And^dimly discern His home in that beautiful clime. White Water, Ohio.
