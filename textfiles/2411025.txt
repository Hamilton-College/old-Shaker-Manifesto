Watervliet, Ohio. Oct. 1894. We have been blessed with several good showers since we last wrote for Home Notes. The order of the day is cutting up corn and gathering fall crops. We are also improving our time repairing, putting on a new shingle roof on our corn crib etc. We number thirty in our Society at present writing. We had the privilege of enjoying a few pleasant days with Elder Oliver Hampton at our Society recently. The writer had the pleasure of meeting the Ministry and Elders of Union Village at Dayton on their way to the Eastern Societies. May they enjoy a pleasant visit while in the east. We are having very good meetings here. Thursday evening we have a singing meeting, Sabbath morning a bible meeting, Sabbath afternoon meeting for exercise and in the evening prayer meeting, so we try to improve our time in doing good to ourselves and others. We enjoy the good readfngs in The Manifesto very much, and always make it welcome to our Society. We herewith extend our love and blessings to all who are striving to build up Zion. Henry W. Fredrick.
