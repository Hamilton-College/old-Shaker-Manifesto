SPIRITUALITY CECELIA DEVYR 'Tie not in loving God afar, In overstraining human powers, In spirit flights from star to star, In quest of bright eternal bowers. 'Tis not in weighing scriptural words, Nor studying cabalistic signs, *'Tis not in watching flights of birds, Nor poring over sulphur shrines. 'Tis not in wild, ecstatic thought, The zeal that madness close allies, Nor in conversions, lightly caught, From passing meteors in the skies. 'Tis not in formal rite or prayer; 'Tis not in all perfected creeds ; 'Tis not in saintly robe nor air, In chalice font,, nor sacred beads. The heavenly kingdom is within The common things that mortals slight And love alone can entrance win, Into its holy pure delight. The heart must love, and loving, know By intuition's subtile powersâ€” The' undercurrent tides that flow, Throughout this wondrous life of ours. The rapturous soul, that soars above The vale that true affection yields, Will find a realm too cold for love, In planet-seeded, ether fields. Yea, he who does not prize the laws Of life, in tiny flower and blade, Will darkly, vainly seek the cause, That vast creation's structure made. No warbler builds her nest in air ; No blossom climbs the solar ray ; No life develops full and fair, But in its God-appointed way. And God's appointed-way is law ; Its revelations are from Him ; The promises the prophets saw, Beside its workings, are but dim. *Old Roman customs. For, as the pulses of the spring Throb through all nature's vast domain, So, true religion's breath will bring The soul its blossom-time again. Yea, true religion will redeem From every blight, and cumbering thorn; And cause the heart, and earth to teem With fruits of the Millennial Morn. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
