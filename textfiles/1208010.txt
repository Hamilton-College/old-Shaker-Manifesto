JUDGE NOT ARTHUR THEOBALD Judge not; the heart thou canst not see; And 'neath a stern outside may flow A crystal fount of purity; Or there may lie, unknown to thee, A gem, with purest love aglow. The heart, perchance to thee unknown, May have a fertile teeming soil, Wherein the seed of love, there sown, 179 180 SHAKER MANIFESTO. May live, and flourish, and when grown, Repay the sower's care and toil. Judge not; the mind—the inner man, Cannot by fr^il mortality Be seen. One Eye alone can scan That temple, and unfold that plan Which lasts through all eternity. The thoughts which thrill that mystic chain Thou canstnot read. They may be r,uYe As are the skies—as free from stain, Or aught that would this sacred fame Defile, as are the heavens secure. Judge not; this life is but a span ; But let that blessing from above O'ertiow the banks of creed and clan, And love, whilst thou hast time, and can, Humanity; 'for God is love.' Enfield, N. H.
