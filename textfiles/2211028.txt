The changing hues of the beautiful trees remind us that winter is approaching, and with it that auspicious day when, at least, all professed Christians, are supposed to turn over a new leaf in their life history, and endeavor to make a radical change for the better. With this class must be numbered the printers, who in spite of all the mistakes which they unluckily have made, and which, alas for them, the reading public must know, still keep up good courage, undaunted by the fact that they must needs turn over many a new leaf before they reach perfection, even in the printers' art. With the autumn, comes the preparation for the winter months. We have been blessed in our 'basket and in our store.' Gathered in Sept. about fifty bu. of peaches, which were rapidly converted into sauces and preserves. During the present month forty bu. of grapes have been gathered. The potato crop has been a partial failure, very much to our sorrow. Of apples we may have a medium supply. The gardeners report one hundred and fifteen bu. of tomatoes, and a peep into a corner of the garden barn revealed a goodly store of squashes. Industry through the summer is amply rewarded and we pleasantly realize the truth of the maxim, 'Labor is Worship.' *
