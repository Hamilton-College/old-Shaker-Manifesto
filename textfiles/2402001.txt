PEACE OFFERINGS AT THE WORLD'S EXPOSITION. By Cecelia DeVere. Earth brings her tributes to her gods, And piles her splendid altars high, Exultant queries, where the odds That from the earth to heaven lie ? Amid the splendor here achieved What thinks she of the other side? The wrongs that never were retrieved, The war made wrongs half deified? She heaps her gains, and great they are, Flung up like waves that oceans toss, A bulwark that doth vision bar, And screens her penury and loss. For war and famine,�fiends of death,� Sent forth by the oppressor's hand, Have breathed destructive sulphurous breath, And fever-blight on every land. If from their wreckage grim and drear, Such wondrous beauty, skill hath wrought, How would earth's opulence appear Had Peace and Freedom aided thought. Had they with gentle mother-heart, Instructed in the life sublime, What wealth of Genius, Toil and Art Would teem to-day in every clime. Long ages ere the midnight choir That sweet momentous message bore, Isaiah said with tongue of fire, That nations should learn war no more; Their weapons beaten out and changed To implements for bough and sod; Then man no longer strife estranged Might walk within the light of God. Yet after crimson lapse of years, Fringed by the so-called Christian reign; With smoke, flame, flood and quenchless tears All unfulfilled the words remain. 30 THE MANIFESTO. To-day there is no nation ripe ; Yet, there are workers tried and true Who strive with zeal of es-ery type, The vast millennial work to do. Yea, they who in the name of Peace Bring pruning- hooks, and plough and bell, Would see the Bethlehem light increase O'ev fields of snow-white asphodel. For needy sufferers that abide, Would bid rich ambient harvests wave; And thus remember side by side The home of life and soldier's grave. Oh, who of all the motley line That thither crowd, shall know or feel, The import of the Day Dawn Shrine Whose incense would the nations heal? Or who will prize the wedge of worth, The ploughshare fashioned from the swords, That shall upturn the glad new earth, When Christians own, it is the Lord's? The pruning-hooks must thought prepare, Strong as the cedars of the hill, Till growth of wisdom all can share, In fruitage of parental will. Yea, they must cut the deadly bane, The branches of the strange wild vine, Till earth can bear on every plane Fair clusters, dropping heavenly wine. When Christians turn from compromise To their own law with peace agleam, This war-carsed earth will realize, The angels' song, and prophet's dream. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
