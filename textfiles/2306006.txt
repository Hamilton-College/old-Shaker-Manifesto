HALT AND CONSIDER! Isaac Anstatt. Beloved Gospel Fbiends:ï¿½Is it not time that we call a halt, and carefully consider where we are, and whither we are drifting? Do we realize our condition? Are we aware of the danger that lies before us if we continue our present course? Are we not on the brink of a dangerous precipice, caused by doubt, infidelity, disbelief, lukewarmness, ease and personal comfort? Are we not satisfied to let present conditions remain, so long as we are not disturbed, and left alone in our ease, and even go so far as to say, What is it to me? If the Lord has begun a work that He can not carry out, are we to blame? Be careful, be not deceived, God will not always be mocked by men. Brethren and Sisters, the time has come for us to look our condition square in the face. Our ranks are depleting; the aged are few that are left, and these will soon be called to the spirit land, and who will fill the vacuum? Who will stand in the gap? Confession is good for the soul. We may as well confess our Community faults. If it is good for one soul it is good for all, and our first step toward restoration. When did Zion flourish? When she obeyed the laws and orders that were given for her protection and safety, both temporally and spiritually. When did Zion begin to wane? WThen she began to disobey these laws and orders, and by degrees to enter the vortex of Babylonish ideas and beliefs as well as unbeliefs of our day and time, and this babel of ideas and doctrines has THE MANIFESTO. 135 caused the question, What are our principles, what is our faith and belief? It may seem well to the carnal mind, to roam in the flowery realms of doubt and disbelief, and frame a model Zion after Satan's likeness and image, where the flesh and spirit can join hands and throw aside the statutes given by Christ and Mother, as unnecessary in this day of progression and progressive ideas, and thereby go to heaven on flowery beds of ease. Be not deceived, this is the same spirit that said to Adam and Eve, 'Thou shalt not surely die:' that tempted Christ, when he offered him all the kingdoms, that drove Mother Ann out of England and persecuted her while here. Beloved Brethren and Sisters, the time has come to clear the deck and prepare for action. We have come to the time and place, when the still small voice has become so feeble that it can not be heard. Unbelief, doubt, lukewarmness, indifference and brazen defiance to the laws and orders given for our protection, like Goliath of old, defy not. only the laws and statutes, but the very anointed. Where is the David that has the courage to come forth and slay this monster of self-conceit that defies the laws and orders given for Zion's protection, safety and travel? Come forth ye watchmen on the walls of Mount Zion, and in thunder tones proclaim, the day of thy restoration has come O Zion, and thy deliverance is near at hand. Confess and repent, should be our motto. Come to the rescue every valiant volunteer in Zion, and join the army of the Lord and help slay this defiant Goliath, he has become strong with his lies and deceit and would even deceive the very elect. Stand not mute nor dumb, ye indwellers of Zion. 'Cry aloud, spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet, say unto Zion, thy God reigneth.' Let none cry peace while this destructive spirit remains. 'Let the dead bury their dead,' was the voice of him who is our standard-bearer. Let us kindle anew the fires of our forefathers, that the doubters who dare not go, but hate to stay, who have become sin hardened by not obeying their faith and conviction, or those who are only looking for the loaves and the fishes, or the vultures, who are hovering around expecting Zion's overthrow, may be burned and destroyed in the unquenchable fire of the gospel, with those infidelic doctrines that have been a curse to Zion. Awake! we have had enough of this lukewarm milk and water testimony, that lets us remain in our sins, in ease and indifference, which does not bring conviction for wrong nor salvation from sin. It is time for us to draw a line of demarkation between the flesh and the spirit, between him that serveth God, and him that serveth sin. Delay is dangerous as as well as destructive. We must come back, confess and repent of our sins, if we expect Zion to flourish and her people to travel and have restored the gifts and power of God. We have gone astray, we have desired the flesh pots of our day, and like ancient Israel, we are dying with the quails of infidelity, disunion, disbelief and all the other disorders that follow the train, between our teeth. Be not deceived, God is not mocked, whatsoever we sow, that shall we reap. Let us rebuild the broken walls as did the ancients rebuild the temple, with a trowel in one hand and a sword in the other. Let us bear in mind the words of one of our songs: 'Then why, O why thus doubting stand Indwellers of thy courts? Gird on the armor of the Lord, And in his strength go forth And meet with glittering sword in hand The foes that 'gainst thee move, And in the name of Zion's God, Victorious thou shalt prove.' Let Zion's banner float to the breeze, let the inscription upon it be 'ISTo Surrender,' but follow our standard-bearers, Christ and Mother. Let our battle cry be the deliverance of Zion from the curses of Babylon and a restoration of her power and glory. SluiJcers, AT. V.
