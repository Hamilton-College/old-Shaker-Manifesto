THE HAPPY CLIME JOURNEY Augustus Blase Shakers, N. Y. 1 I'm now on my journey to that happy clime, Where grief and sorrow are no more, 2. With courage and zeal I will hasten away , From all that is a hind'rance to me, Where love and sweet union the faithful entwine, O how I long for that beautiful shore To dwell with the saints in a bright, endless day, Completely redeemed, yea happy and (free. That beautiful shore, that beautiful shore, Where joy and So happy and free, so happy and free, The followers of rejoicing will be ever more, I long to be there, a true Jesus for ever will be, That I will be one, all evil rightful heir, Of heaven's rich blessings and glories to share, I'll shun, And onward I'll move'till the victory is won.
