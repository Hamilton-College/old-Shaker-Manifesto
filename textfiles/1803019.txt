TESTIMONY OF DANIEL MOSELEY. Being a well-wisher to the peace and happiness of allthehumau family, whom I consider as my Brethren and Sisters according to the order of nature in the old creation ; and believing that the time is coming, and is now begun, in which every individual soul of all the human race, will be waked up by the resurrection power of God, and come forth to receive their reward, according to their works, either in mercy or judgment, as they obey or disobey the will of God ; I therefore feel it my duty to bear testimony to that blessed way of God which is dearer to me than life, and which I have proved by long experience to be the way of salvation from sin, having been thereby saved from the pollutions that are in the world, and in which mankind are sunk and lost from God, through the lusts of the flesh. Some time in July, 1780, I went to Watervliet, to visit the little family of people who had then begun to be greatly ' wondered at' by the world around them, on account of their strange religion. I went well guarded, as I supposed against deception, having already seen enough of that among professors, to put me on the watch. I had likewise experienced much of what is commonly called religion ; having had great convictions of sin, and passed through many scenes of religious exercise of mind. In the fifteenth year of my age, I had joined a society of very zealous New-Light Baptists, and for six years had supported the name and character of a Christian without reproach or rebuke from the society, or from any other quarter except my own conscience. During this period, I had been sufficiently acquainted with people who made a great profession of religion, and who, I knew, lived in wickedness more than people in general who made no profession : and therefore I thought it necessary to be on my guard. But when I came there, I found my fears were groundless. I found as much difference between the professors I had formerly been acquainted with and these people, as to the nature of their religion, as there is between dead carcasses and living souls ; and the power of their testimony differed as much from that of the former, as flames of fire differ from the stagnant waters of a muddy pond. The fire soon began to burn my carual nature, of which I was as full as a pine knot is of pitch, and I cried out like the prophet Malachi, 'Who can abide the day of his coming?' I found that it was indeed, ' like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap.' I was searched like ��Jerusalem, with candles,' and all my dark works, which had before been hid from my own sight, were brought out of their secret hiding places, and exposed before the Lord and before the eyes of his people. Lord what is man ! A lump of pride, lust and vanity ; for such I found myself in the light of divine truth, and exposed to view. The serpent was no longer able to hide; my pride was stained ; my lust was mortified, my vanity was blown away like the smoke of a dunghill; and my good Christian name, which I had cherished so dearly, alas ! it was like chafif before the wind, or a dry brush-heap before a flaming fire ; it was consumed by the truth, and all my religious notions and imaginations were blown away at once. Then, for the first time, I began to understand the words of the prophet Isaiah : ' The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down ; aad the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.' And also of the prophet Malachi; ' Behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven ; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, (whether professor or profane,) shall be as stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that il shall leave them neither root nor branch.' Such was the spirit and power of that gospel which Mother Ann preached. It exalted the work of Christ alone, and swept away the corrupted religion of Antichrist, and the religious inventions of fallen man. The way being thus prepared, my soul began to be baptized into the spirit of the g&amp;spel, and to receive the pure and heavenly gifts of God. Then I was able to say in truth, and testify with confidence and bolduess before all men, that I knew it to be the way of God ; because it purged me from my sins. I knew it to be the power of the resurrection ; because it raised my soul from the death of sin to a life of righteousness. 1 can say in the sincerity of my soul, I feel thankful to God that I have lived to see the day in which I have the privilege to testify these things for the benefit of my successors iu the gospel, and of all honest enquirers after truth. Some people who visited Mother Ann and the Elders, and heard their testimony against all sin, and especially against the lust of the flesh, went and spread a report that these people forbid to marry, and applied to them all the hard names and heavy charges contained in the first epistle to Timothy against apostates, Chap, iv., 1, 2, 3. Mother therefore told me not to go and repert that they forbid to marry ; 'for,' said she, 'we do not. But all that cannot or will not take up their crosses for the Kingdom of Christ's sake, and that only, I would advise them to marry and live after the flesh, in a lawful manner, and be servants to their families : for that is natural, and less sinful in the sight of God than any other way of gratifying that nature.' As to temperance, regularity and good order in the management of their affairs, these people exceeded all that I had ever seen. I was brought up in New England, among good farmers; but such neatness and good economy as was here displayed in the wilderness I never saw before. After spending two days with them, I returned home to Pittstowu, where my parents lived, and I saw Mother no more till after hsr return from Poughkeepsie jail. I then visited her, and found the same godliness and purity, with an increasing testimony against all sin. 1 saw nothing but what was every way perfectly consistent with modesty and chastity ; indeed quite too much so to suit the feelings of a carnal nature. This was the great stumbling stone and rock of offence, and the mighty cause of contention between ''Michael and his angels, and the Dragon and his angels.' 1 always found in her the same powerful testimony against all unrighteousness and every evil work, and a corresponding example of godliness and purity. I also visited her in Harvard. Her appearance there seemed to me more heavenly than I had ever seen it before. Her soul was filled with love and joy, peace and purity ; and the gifts and power of God, through her, to all that believed and took up their crosses, were ministered in great abundance. I was then but a babe in Christ; yet I had my little measure full, which raised me above the carnal delights of the flesh and the mind. I could never feel the least sensation of impurity from her; but all she said and did, seemed to come from a spirit of perfect purity. Her enrollment was with the Lamb on Mount Zion, where souls are redeemed ' from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit.' TO BE CONTINUED.
