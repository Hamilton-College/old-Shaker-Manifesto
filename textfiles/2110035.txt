The Phrenological Journal.�A fine portrait of Professor Harris, United States Commissioner of Education, embellishes the first page of the September number of The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health. In 'The Agent in Ethics' some excellent points are presented by the writer to show the necessity of understanding moral conduct scientifically. No reader can say after considering the second paper on 'The Physiognomy of the Mouth' that we have not reached certain positive principles for our study of the face. 'Thought Transference,' by Mrs. Poole, is a very reasonable paper. Two eminent New England physicians and a western one are sketched in the installment in this series on Phrenological biography by Mrs. Wells, and Prize Essay No. 3. follows. The installment of 'Hits' is large thistime and entertaining. The Rev. Dr. Smith, so well known as the author of America, is well sketched, and a/ac simile copy of his handwriting given that would look well in a gilt frame. 'The Social Problem,' 'The Treatment of Boys' and 'The Wonderful Slot'�the last especially will please. 'Internal Baths in the Treatment of Fevers' the leading title of the Health section, and there are several other things which will be found serviceable to the attentive invalid. This department is always well furnished and important. The editor's talk and the other short items and paragraphs help to complete a capital specimen of this venerable monthly, now in its 92nd. volume. Published at $1.50 a year, or 15 cents a number. A special 'On Trial1' offer is made of six months for fifty cents. Address Fowler &amp; Wells Co., Publishers, 775 Broadway, New York.
