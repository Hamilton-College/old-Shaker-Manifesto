Union Village, Ohio. Aug. 1890. Beloved Eldress Dorothy :ï¿½We took the cars at Albany, N. Y., at 1-4:5 P. M. and reached Union Village, at 11 A. M., the next day. There are many who mourn the loss of Beloved Elder Matthew, and yet they bear their burdens quite manfully. Elder Napoleon B., Elder James R. and Eldress Jane C. have been on a visit to this place, but will return to their homes in Ky. on the 11th inst. It is very hot and dry. No rain has fallen since June. Wheat and oats are a medium crop. Corn and potatoes will be light on account of the drought. The apple crop will also be light. Although my time is well filled with the many calls of the hour, yet I always look to your dear home with great pleasure and send kindest regards to all the friends at Canterbury. May God bless you now and forever. Accept kindest love from the Elders, and also from the writer. Your Sister in the gospel. Elizabeth Cantrell.
