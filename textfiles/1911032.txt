BEAUTIFUL SHORE. Andante. ' And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.'ï¿½Rev. vii., 17. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Time's dark billows and tempests may roar,Yet will I sing of that beautiful shore, 2. Gladsome the spring of that fair happy land,Blossom and fruitage in glory expand, 3. Pilgrims who tarry, your time yet abide, Slowly receding is life's ebbing tide: Where the chill winter of life shall be o'er, Ne'er to return to the soul. While the soft breeze from its emeraid strand, Scentladen float to us here. Over its surges your spirits shall glide Safe to that beautiful shore. Blest summer land,free from,sorrow and gloom, In fadeless beauty our spirits shall bloom, Love builds its mansion all pearly and bright, Rising in grandeur in rosetinted light: Happy the tho't if our hearts are made pure, We an inheritance there shall secure. While the earth casket inherits the tomb, Seasons supernal will roll. 'Tis for the blessed, whose robes are made white, Heavenly homes have been rear'd. Hops still confides in the promises sure, When here our journey is o'er.
