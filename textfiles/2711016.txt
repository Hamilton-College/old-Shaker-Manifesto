THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACE. The expression of the face is continually changing. No artist, no camera can catch this changing, fleeting, evanescent expression. When you look in the glass, the very desire to find out how you look is depicted on your face. The more you strive, the more the intent is intensified, and such an expression is not natural to your face. How often do we look at a photograph and find only disappointment in it? Why is this? The camera depicts the sitter just as he is at the moment the picture is taken, but very seldom can the instrument catch and record that subtle thing called 'natural expression,' because few persons are natural when seated before the camera. Well, what of all this? simply this. If you are noble, loving and true, such virtues will light up your face: if you are sordid, mean and selfish, your face proclaims it to the world. Anything in your life that is active for good or evil will impress itself upon your personal appearance. Pride, scorn, hate and lust write themselves indelibly in the physiognomy, when such ignoble qualities rule the life and have become habitual to the countenance, and the features themselves become permanently changed to accord with the expressions.
