PLEADINGS BETWEEN NATURE AND FAITH. Margaret C. Pattison. Lay down your watch and sheathe your sword, The willy tempter cries, You've battled long and hard enough, You'll win the proffered prize. You need not fear, you've struggled for And laid up quite a store, And loJ you see the prowling wolf Is nowhere near your door. You now can rest and take your ease And lay your armor down, You surely cannot miss the goal Or lose your hard-earned crown. You've borne the cross for many years, And labored with great care; Now, be content to muse awhile On something else save prayer. You know you do n^t want to live In nature's fallen state, You would rather share the meanest fare Than this should be your fate. Your conscience greatly troubles you, You're careful every day, Lest from the self-denying path You recklessly might stray. Your reputation now is good, You'd pass for quite a saint, And all the good that you might lose Is of no worth. Why? faint? I only want to let you know, You feeble, doubting oneï¿½ I'm 'fraid you'll wear your body out Before your work is done. These orders that you keep so strict. I own are good and pure; But, are the little ones for you? You, who are so secure? I think, and also think I'm right, They were laid down for those Who had not yet much victory gained, Or conquered many foes. Confession too does very well, That is for actual sin, But then, such very little things Are scarcely worth a pin. You cannot for a moment doubt The truth of what I've said, And if you'll only go with me And by my word be led, Sweet liquid music you shall hear. See lovely blooming flowers, And roam in pleasant verdant groves, Repose in shady bowers. Art, science, dress and literature, And poetry sublime. Yea, everything to please the taste Is found within my clime. Religious service too I have Where you may sing and pray, And yet enjoy the luxuries And pleasures of the day. Come now and take a walk with me Along this broad highway, Where time will pass so pleasantly; I've something more to say, * * * * Already you have said enough, Be gone! be gone I say! I know your artifice and wiles, The scepter that you sway. A liar from the very first I alwaj s knew you were, You sinned, and lost your place in heaven, A demon, now you are! O base impostor! cruel foe! Deceiver of our race! Oh, how I hate your sophistry! Come boldly to my face. But nay, in dark mysterious ways You lurk me to beguile, And on an open battle field You shrink from rank and file. A carnal nature, filthy, vile, Which God hath doomed to die, To keep alive this earthly sense Your poisoned arrows fly. To undermine the gospel plan How oft you've tried, in vain; God's power omnipotent and wise The truth will e'er sustain. He sends his angels, cherubs bright, To guard his chosen flock, And though hell's forces 'gainst them rage They're firm upon the rock. Your power, subtle though it be, Cannot withstand the flow Of mighty truth and faith divine; God's work shall spread and grow. And souls from every clime and tongue Shall yet the chorus swell, 0 God, we praise Thee evermore, Thou doest all things well! Thy arm hath full salvation brought Through Thy Anointed Ones ; We gladly give our all to be Thy daughters and Thy sons. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
