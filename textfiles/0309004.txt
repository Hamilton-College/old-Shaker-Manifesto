TWO GOVERNMENTS A Civil Government, that shall be male and female, to begin with, will have taken an ad- vance step in the direction of the Millennium. Other radical changes and improvements would speedily follow, as naturally 'as day the night.' An influx from the Divine Order would com- mence which would never cease, until the land should be as common to the people as is the air and water. Poverty would be no more ; for the Lord would greatly bless such a people. ' War would cease to the ends of the earth ;' the social evil would not be so much as named; and sickness an evil unknown. For great would be the peace, and perfect the righteousness, of the nation whom a dual God should direct through its Civil Government. While the Spiritual Church, 'not of this world,' and as perfectly aloof from the Civil Government as is the sun aloof from the moon would be ' the tabernacle of God with men ;' 'the kingdom of heaven upon earth,' with no generative elements or practices ; and with all the property of life, and its labor products enjoyed ' in common,' by the subjects of the Resurrection. Thither would the nations of the earth go up to inquire of the Lord, as the tribes of Israe' went up to the temporal Jerusalem — to it; Temple, its Altar, and its Priesthood. The ' ark ' — organization ; the ' pot of manna' — spiritual instruction; the ' Covenant ' — the abstract laws of Divine Love and Wisdom in government, leading into all truth, which would perfect human happiness in the Natural and Spiritual Orders, with their dual ivil Governments, and the dual Church of hrist, would be the Millennial Epoch.
