Think before you speak what you shall speak... Think before you speak what you shall speak, why you should speak, about whom you are to speak, what will come from what you may speak, what may be the benefit from what you may speak, and lastly, who may be listening to what you may speak. Turn your speech seven ways, and there will never come any harm from what you have spoken. ' Maria Witham, Enfield, Conn.
