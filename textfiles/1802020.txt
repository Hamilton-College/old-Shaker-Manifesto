How I Cured My Cold Feet Cold feet are, with a large number of persons, all the year round, and more particularly during the winter months, a source of constant discomfort and depression. Many women and children never know the satisfaction of being warm. All this is contrary to what was in. tended by nature. A good circulation of the blood t^nds to produce individual happiness and comfort. No one need suffer from cold feet, which are symptomatic of mal-distribution of the blood. It is part of the duty of the healthy nervous system to regulate the balance of the circulation and, under the vicissitudes of err' ery-day life, to ensure to every part a sufficient suppiy of blood. Whenever there is liability to derangement of the circulation, producing local congestion or depletion, it is evident the nervous tone is lowered. Such a state opens the way for a variety of diseases. Sedentary occupation, eating indigestible food, congested liver, disordered digestion, tight lacing or tight boots are all apt to cause cold feet, unless the constitutional powers are very strong. The nervous tone will be raised, and so equalize the circulation, by bracing treatment, as the morning tepid or cold bath, and short sitz each day at a corresponding temperature. The weak digestion will be improved by foments, and congestion will also be removed by their use and an occasional hot-air bath. Treatment directed specifically to the feet, will be mainly cold mustard foot-bath for five minutes; if the feet are cold to begin with, warm mustard foot-bath 102 degrees for the same time, followed at once by cold foot-bath, each finished by vigorous friction. Should the feet be persistently cold at bedtime, a pair of cotton stockings well wrung out of water, covered with a pair of warm woolen ones, may bu relied upon to restore warmth and comfort.ï¿½ One Who Has Tried It.
