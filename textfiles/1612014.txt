FULFILLING PROPHECY. NANCY G. DANFORTH. uFor they are the spirits of demons, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.' Rev. xvi., 14. At the present time there are great commotions in the earth, and it is well to inquire where we are as regards prophecy. In the physical, material world are terrific storms, floods, cyclones and tornadoes, with pestilence and famine, to destroy human life aud prospects. In the civil, political world are oppression, mobs, murders, riots and strikes ; society divided into numerous factions and parties, each striving for the ascendency. In the spiritual or religious world is a breaking up of old creeds _andj dogmas ; former traditions and systems of faith and belief are dissolving before increasing degrees of light. Strife and discontent pervade every department in life. It is a time of universal unrest aud upheaval�War in the household, war in the church, war in the nation. What people are exempt? Have not '�the kings of the earth, and of the whole world,' been called by an invisible power, to this great battle? Is not this the great day of God, foretold by many of the prophets? A day of ''darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as a destruction from the Almighty should it come. ' kt Many mighty men shall cry bitterly.' Very 'many hearts failing fcr fear,' and no seer arises to elucidate the dark page and read what is t.o come. This conflict between Michael and the Dragon may be long and severe ; still we know that right will finally prevail, while all wioug and oppression will be overthrown. ' The Lord may have his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, ' yet He will surely vindicate the righteous cause, and truth will eventually triumph over all error, and peace and righteousness shall dwell in the land. This is not written as an exhaustive article, but merely to make a few suggestions, hoping to s-ee the subject treated upon by abler miuds. N. G. D. Canterbury, N. H.
