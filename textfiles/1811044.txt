Simon Tuttle Atherton At Harvard, Simon Tuttle Atherton died Oct. 1st. of heart failure; aged eighty-five years, four months and twelve days. He has lived in the Society eighty years. In 1833 he was appointed one of the trustees. In 1847 he became Senior trustee, in which office he spent the remainder of his life. Even at his advanced age the Society sustains an irreparable loss. His diligence in business cannot be excelled and has few equals. His integrity bears not the taint of suspicion. Punctuality was prominent among his many virtues. It was no fault of his if all accounts were not cancelled in due time. Some one has said, 'In the open hand of death we have only what we gave, what we keep we lose.' Then his wealth must be great who gave all he hadï¿½a whole long and arduous life for the common good. In storms and adversities he was oak and rock never faltering in duty. Duty was the dial on which he measured time. Now that the duties of life have all heen well done, and the sun touches the western horizon, and lengthening shadows slant towards the east, then surrounded by friends the harvester comes with a strain of music. So much departed worth is felt by a large circle of acquaintances whose memory they cherish with respect.
