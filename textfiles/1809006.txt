WHICH? Louis Basting. In a letter recently received from a valued young friend occurs the following : '1 make discoveries in the Bible now ; a flood of light and life, refreshing and enlightening, rushes down upon me from the pages of this book of books. Strange it is that we are so seldom urged to study its contents; stranger still that so many Ingersolls and associates should persist in their Sysiphusï¿½labor of assailing this bulwark of the ages.' Since there is a cause for everythiug so is there a reason for the phenomenal popularity of Colonel Tngersoll. Crude infidelity, with its cold negations, is never attractive, but when allied with wit, satire aud eloquence it assumes a character that demands attention. It was biting sarcasm and merciless epigrams that made Voltaire famous. Iugersoll is listened to today because he is a man whose character is above reproach, a descendant of a line of pious ancestors who were virtuous and Godfearing because the Bible taught them so to be. As a soldier of the Union he gallantly led a cavalry regiment in the war ; as a lawyer he amassed a large fortune ; as an orator he commands one thousand dollars for every lecture. His eloquence, his wit aud pathos, his humor, his keen perceptions of the frailties of human nature, his magnetic presence, the play of his clean-shaven expressive features, the ease with which he moves his audience from tenderness to laughter and boisterous applause, all combine to make him an uncommon man. Standing on Memorial Day before a vast and distinguished audience in New York, pearls of beauty dropped from his lips. Said he: ''The dome cannot save the temple whose foundation is injustice.' 'A brazen falsehood and a timid truth are the parents of a compromise.' 'History is only the trace of a few mountain peaks, crimes, calamities, mistakes and wars. The valleys, where the real victories are won, are left in eternal shadow.' He saw 'a world where thrones have crumbled and the aristocracy of idleness has perished from the earth,' a world 'without the beggar's outstretched palm, the miser's heartless, stony stare, the piteous wail of want, the livid lips of lies, the cruel eyes of scorn.' He saw a race 'without disease of flesh or brain, shapely and fair, the married harmony of form and function, life lengthened, joy deepened, love canopied the earth, and over all in the great dome, shone the eternal star of human hope.' Pretty and poetical, no doubt, but what can an infidel mean by all that? St. John had a vision very like the Colonel's, glorious with blessing and wisdom, thanksgiving and honor. 'These are they which came out of great tribulations and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in his temple, ajid He that sitteth upon the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light upon them nor any heat. For the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.' Says a writer in the Tribune, commenting on the above: 'Liberty is a great blessing, and it removes all barriers from human progress and makes the field of opportunity wide as the world. But it does not make men of itself virtuous or wise, and when the vision that Colonel Ingersoll and St. John both saw is realized, it will have been brought about by a force that only the latter detected.' There is a further reason why Col. Ingersoll is heard respectfully. Much of what he says is but too true. When he launches forth the arrows of invective against the hypocrisies, the frauds and shams and hollow pretensions that exist in the church, thoughtful men say he is right, and applaud. But when lie attempts to deny the facts of eternal life and of human responsibility to a Divine Being, the music of his cadences becomes like childish twaddle and the nights of genius and eloquence but as the aberrations of a wandering mind. And the vulgar crowd, frivolous men and women, love to hear him attack things sacred and sublime ; they feel as if authority were given them to break the restraints of faith and conscience and to work their own sweet wills as they list and be a law unto themselves as far as safety and convenience will permit. Let it not be forgotten that Ingersoll is an advocate of and for the world ; who insists upon the right of all to exercise and enjoy and use all the faculties and powers '.nd sensations they are in possession of; to whom the idea of self-denial is an absurdity, and the practice of religious celibacy a crime and offence against the designs of nature. There is no surer sign of the growth and existence of true religion than that he can go about and give utterance to his opinions without molestation or hindrance ; were it otherwise one might indeed suppose that the Colonel's assumption were true.
