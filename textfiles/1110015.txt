DEEP THOUGHTS All principles will be judged by their results. All forms of society will be judged by their results. ' A large mould of men is what we want, and to get this, we must stop treating men like a miscellaneous lot of hatchets and axes that are only waiting to be ground.' ' We are enfeebled, we don't want new outlets for power when power itself is what we lack.' ' Religion is perennial; religious instincts demand constant satisfaction, though the form of the satisfaction varies from age to age:' ' The nature of scientific doctrines is such as to demand more rather than less development of the religious sentiments.' ' Living the great truths of the spiritual world constitutes vital religion.'
