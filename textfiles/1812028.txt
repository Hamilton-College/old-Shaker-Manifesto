THE VALUE OF KIND WORDS. They never blister the tongue or lips, and we have never heard of any mental trouble arising from this quarter. Though they do not cost much, yet they will accomplish much. They help one's own good nature and good-will. Soft words soften our own soul. Angry words are put to the flame of wrath and make it blaze more fiercely. Kind words make other people good-natured. Cold words freeze people, hot words scorch them, bitter words make them bitter, and wrathful words make them wrathful. There is such a rush of all other kinds of words in our day, that h seems desirable to give kind words a chance among them. There are vain words, and idle words, and silly words, and empty words, and hasty words, and spiteful words, and profane words, and boisterous words, and warlike words. Kind words, also produce their own image on men's souls. They soothe and comfort the hearer. They shame him out of his sour, morose, unkind feelings. We have not begun to use kind words in such abundance as they ought to be used. There are peevish and fretful words, cross words and complaining words, and there are soothing and peaceful words, grateful and reviving words, encouraging words. Pascal.
