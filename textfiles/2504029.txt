The very act of confiding... 'T.He very act of confiding in another takes the poison out of many an offense, enables a man to see his act as others see it, and to take those steps which, if another were concerned, he would at once discern to be the only wise, right, and hopeful method of escape from his offense or his difficulty. He who confides in a faithful friend divides his troubles and doubles his power of resistance and his chances of deliverance.'
