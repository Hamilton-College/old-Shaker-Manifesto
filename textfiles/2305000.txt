UNBORN POETRY. There is a river that makes glad the city of our God. Passing over the river is not to die With outstretched limbs in state to lie, For as a man thinketh, so is he, In time or in eternity. To die is a change that none forego, The peasant, the king, the friend and foe, Go hastening on in weal and woe, To the land of ghosts which none may know. Know as we know the things of earth, In manhood, youth, and back to birth. Mystery of mysteries from the beginning! Why do we live? love? Why keep on sinning? Where did we come from? Whither go we, Men, women, and children, bond and free? To die is not to pass over the river, For still we live, live on forever, 110 THE MANIFESTO. But there is a river that's never dry That none may pass over until they die, Die to the life that reproduces The race of man without abuses. The end has come, the summer has ended, The harvester death, with life is blended, Life�eternal life, from the throne of God, The Lamb was the first, the first who trod The banks of that river�the river of God.
