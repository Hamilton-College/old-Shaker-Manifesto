THANKSGIVING HYMN. [Contributed by Amelia Tait.] Now, Father, the harvest is ended, Ere twilight has curtained the sun, With hearts overflowing with gladness, We thank Thee for what Thou hast done We thank Thee not only, great Giver, For harvests of wheat and of corn; We thank Thee for Thy daily mercies And works Thou renewest each morn. 'Thou crownest the year with goodness;' Thou blesseth our lives with Thy care, The earth is too small for Thy kindness, Thy mercies are strewed everywhere. Thou filleth the earth with Thy sunshine, Thou sendeth the dews and the rains, Thou giveth us all that is needful To ripen the fruits and the grains. Oh, Shepherd! our lives Thou protecteth, Each day thou hast guided our feet, Thy wonders as thickly are scattered As sprays in the sheaves of the wheat. We never can measure Thy greatness, So vast is Thy power and might, Then teach us, our Father, all blessings, To use for Thy praise and the right! Selected.
