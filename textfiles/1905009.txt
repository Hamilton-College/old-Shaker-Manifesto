THE COMING OF CHRIST. Alonzo G. Hollister. 'if shall come- to pass afterward, that I will pour out from my spirit upon all flesh' formed in my likeness. Joel. The wise shall understand. Daniel. An inspired Apostle wrote concerning a future coming of Christ, ' The Lord himself shall descend from heaven TGr.'] in a command, in a voice of an archangel, and in a trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we the living that remain, shall at the same time with them, be caught away in clouds [multitudes] to meet the Lord in the air, and so be always with him.' 1 Thes. iv., 16. This text has been quoted by some who give a literal interpretation to figures of speech, to prove a personal coming of Christ Jesus, and also a resurrection of physical bodies. But the figurative style of the language makes it evident that the coming referred to is spiritual, and was to be manifest as an inspiration from heaven. Air is a diffusive, all pervading element, which inspired as breath, sustains the vital operations of the body. It was regarded by the ancients as a type of spirit, and the Greek has one word which represents breath, air, wind, or spirit, according to the connection in which it stands. Hence, as Christ is spirit, if he comes in the air, it is evidently as an unseen, and to many, as an unsought inspiration. How often it is remarked of certain ideas, such as spiritualism for instance, or of communism, ' It is in the air.' Because so many considerate people are talking, writing, or meditating upon it, and all seem to feel it, or to be in some way affected thereby. A person inspires certain thoughts in the atmosphere and reasons to conclusions which nobody has taught him. When he meets a stranger who is possessed of like views, after comparing thoughts, he judges that said thoughts must be true because having silently conceived them in his own interior conciousness, he has found a witness to the same in the conciousness of another. The two are no longer strangers, for a feeling of kiaship has sprung up between them, arising from similarity of inspirational ideas, the cause of said ideas being in the air, or life sustaining elements. Multitudes of minds thus operated upon at the same time, may be prepared to assume the higher kindred relationships, and so be led to cooperate in putting those idea.s into practice. Only such as are organizationally and aff'ectionally qualified to receive said ideas, will have their lives changed thereby. Therefore it is written of that period, 'Two shall be in the field, one shall be taken and the other left. Two shall be grinding at the mill,' 'Two shall be in one feed, and one shall be taken and the other left.' Those left will be resurrected later. Those taken will form groups or societies, homogenous in spirit, as particles of moisture in a cloud, (drawu by the heat of the sun,) and are caught away together in spirit, by the power of the 'Sun of Righteousness,' to a meeting with- the Lord io the air. whose presence will henceforth be an abiding source of strength, direction and consolation. Thus the change is realized without suspending the law of gravitation, or chauging the relation of physical bodies to the material universe. If is a lifting up in spirit, thought, interest, purpose, and execution, to an atmosphere of perpetual inspiration from the Lord's own presence, while our mortal bodies remain on the earth, subject to the spirit, being instruments thereof, and to the laws of gravitation, growth and decay governing all physical bodies, until the debt to nature is paid. The foregoing explanation of the presence, and of being with the Lord in the air, in spirit, is supported by the following language of the same Apostle, written in Philippi, to Coriathians. ' For I indeed being absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as if prose:.t, him who has done this thing.' 1 Cor. v., ?&gt;. Also the following written in Rome to Colossians. ' For though (lit.) to the flesh I am absent, to the spirit I am with you, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the stability of your faith in Christ.' Col. ii., 5. These passages show that the Apostles recognized the intelligent action of one's spirit in places remote from the presence and limitations of the physical body, which tethers it for awhile to earthly conditions. We here call to mind that the last of the four general dispensations of God's grace to man, symbolized by the four cherubim within and around the throne, is represented by the flying Eagle, inhabitant and king of other teuauts of the upper air, which corresponds to spirit. We are hereby enabled to understand why the Angel (a noun of multitude,) having the everlasting gospel to preach to those (lit.) sitting upon the earth, (both spirits and mortals,) was seen flying in mid heaven. Rev. xiv., 6, 7. Mid heaven corresponds to the resurrection state, being medial between the earthy, unregenerate condition, and the discarnated, pure Redeemed, who stand with the Lamb on Mount Zion, out from whose midst, the messengers of the gospel go forth to harvest and judge the world. For 'The Reapers are the messengers.' 'The Son of man shall send forth his messengers to gather his Elect.' Jesus. That is, those who elect to comply with the terms of the gospel, and are called to the marriage feast Rev. xix., 9. and iii., 20. 'Know ye not that the saints shall judge the world?' asks the Apostle. Christ is in his saints, judging the world and ending it, in all who will come to him. 'And judgment was given to the saints of the Most High. * * And the dominion and greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven was given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.' Daniel, vii., 27. How do these explanations chime with the promise that ' Every eye shall see him?' It is not said that all shall see him at once. For however sudden may be the destruction coming on the disobedient who refuse to hearken, and to understand, being joined to their idols of creed, dogma, pleasure, worldly honor or profit, the harvest itself and the work of the judgment, which is a separating, purifying process, will extend through many generations, occupying the entire period of the millennium. Moreover as Christ is spirit, seeing him cannot be predicated of any but spiritual eyes. The carnal or animal mind sees only the outward form. Christis not recognized by outward form, neither in his first or second appearing. To perceive his spirit, one must be in a degree conformed to itï¿½ must be resurrected. 'Every eye shall see him,' is promised to those only who live and are looking for him. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
