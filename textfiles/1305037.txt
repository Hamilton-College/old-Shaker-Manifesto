Cleaning Brass. The Government recipe for cleaning brass, used in the arsenals, is said to be as follows : Make a mixture of one part common nitric acid, and one-half part sulphuric acid in a stone jar ; then place ready a pail of fresh water and a box of sawdust. Dip the articles to be cleaned in the acid, then remove them into the water, after which rub them with sawdust. This immediately changes them to a brilliant color. If the brass is greasy it must be first dipped in a strong solution of potash and soda in warm water; this cuts the grease so that the acid has the power to act. The Manufacturer says that rusted steel can be cleaned by washing with a solution of half an ounce of cyanide potassium in two ounces of water, and then brushing with a paste composed of half an ounce of cyanide potassium, half an ounce of castile soap, an ounce of whiting and sufficient water to make the paste.
