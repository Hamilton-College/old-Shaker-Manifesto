Word and Works Word and Works for Macrh opens with an interesting chapter on the 'Moon and the Planets.' With the accompanying pictorial illustration we are pleasantly introduced to the heavens, and can see how nicely we are all 'swinging around the circle.' Just now it will make but little difference 'whether we live on the outside or inside of the earth, so long as we sie assured of a safe passage around the sun. The 'forecasts for March' are as we have been taught to expect. The snow-storms and high winds will probably be with us to the end of our days, but when Word and Works urges us to make special preparation for tornadoes and blizzards, it is time for us to be on the thoughtful side. A large amount of good reading on varied subjects will alto be found in this numberwhile the 'queiy corner' will give pleasure to many, especially the careful answers about a perpetual motion, and about Br. Cain and his lady. Wtokd and Works Pub. Co. 2201 Locust St. St. Louis, Mo.
