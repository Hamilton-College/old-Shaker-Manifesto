TRIBUTE OF THANKS AND LOVE As it is a cardinal principle, and standing order, in Shaker organizations, to pay all just debts, I feel it incumbent on me to present my thanks and love to the editors, contribu- tors, and all, who bless and sustain our Gospel messenger. I have been edified and instructed in reading valuable articles, on various interesting subjects, all designed to help the mind develop and grow into the angelic life — to form a Heaven now, on this terrestrial sphere. I offer my union and blessing, as a link in the chain of universal love — now being created in our Zion home — to draw the wandering and erring under the benign influence of peace. In purity is peace. An eye single to the glory of God, and the testimony of Christ, now in the Female Order, is good religion. It yields the peaceable fruits of righteousness. I pray for a living increase of resurrection life and power, to carry us away from all that is held in high esteem, in the narrow selfish, generative order. We want a higher, purer and holier relation. Here are the germs of Life Divine unfolded to us, as we, by virtue of the Cross of Christ, live a true, consecrated life of self denial. I love my Shaker home. For the blessings found therein, I freely sacrifice all that is dear to the carnal mind. In bonds of Love, John M. Brown, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
