Cement for Petroleum Lamps. â€”A cement particularly adapted for attaching the brass works to petroleum lamps is made by boiling three parts resin with one part of caustic soda and five of water. The composition is then mixed with half its weight of plaster of Paris. It sets firmly in half to three quarters of an hour. It is said to be of great adhesive power, not permeable to petroleum, a low conductor of heat, and but superficially attacked by hot water. Zinc white, white lead, or precipitated chalk may be substituted for plaster, but hardens more slowly.
