ELECTRIC BELTS AND PADS. Of all the humbug devices by which quacks gull the public, none is more barefaced than the electric belt swindle. It is not very long ago that almost a quarter of the people in some sections of the country were wearing curious little disks about the size of a silver half dollar, composed of alternate smaller disks of zinc and copper. This combination was said to be a battery. It was attached to a string about the neck and was worn next the skin over the pit of the stomach, and it was supposed to cure dyspepsia, rheumatism, nervousness, and about every thing else.
