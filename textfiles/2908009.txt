-Alfred., Me. July, 1899. It has been some time since Alfred has been represented in Home Notes, but we are still a little band of earnest workers in the Master's vineyard. July has brought the much-needed rain, but we hope to have more before long. It is the driest season known in this town by the oldest inhabitants. In consequence of the drought we shall have very little fruit. The Brethren are busy haying. There will not be more than two thirds as large a crop as last year. The family garden is looking well, notwithstanding the lack of rain, thanks to Brother Frank Butler who has tended it faithfully. The Sisters' workshop has been receiving a new coat of paint on the inside, and this improves its appearance very much. 124 THE MANIFESTO. A few weeks since we enjoyed a pleasant visit with Elder George Clark and the Sisters from Conn. We wish these visits were of more frequent occurrence. On the 4th inst. the young people of our village enjoyed a picnic in the woods, and although a heavy thunder storm in the afternoon sent all within doors after a thorough drenching, yet the sun came out once more and we spread tables out of doors and prepared supper which was a pleasant ending of the day. We extend love and well wishes to all our Brethren and Sisters, far and near. Our prayer is that peace and prosperity may bless every Zion home. Era M. Ubbey.
