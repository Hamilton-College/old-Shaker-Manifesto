THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER. Albenia Grimes. Ox the shores of the sea of Galilee near Capernaum was the interesting lesson given of 'The Parable of the Sower.' This subject fills my mind with many serious thoughts and I ask myself, how can I receive the help and benefit that it is intended to give unless I carefully read and reflect. It causes mo. to pic ture ia my mind two paths in life, one pursued by the wise who are obedieat, and the other by the unwise who are disobedient, and the joy and sorrow they bring upon friends by the choice they make. If by obedience we strive to mould our lives to their counsel and instructions we insure a ten-fold reward, which is the inward consciousness of doing right, and the blessing of God and our kind teachers, who devote so much of their time for our benefit, striving to impress upon our minds these beautiful lessons taught by our Savior. By disobedience we become like the Avayside hearers whose hearts are hardened by neglect and sin,1 so that truth makes no impression, and the wicked one represented by the fowls, plucks away the good seed. 'Our scripture examples are Pharaoh and Festus, so is the one who interrupted Jesus while he was preaching to ask him to interfere and compel his brother to divide the iuheritauce with him. If we become hardened as were the wayside hearers, the good seed will find no soil in which to grow, the voice of conscience will be hut-hed and thus step by step the downward course is taken. These reflections prompt me to make a resolve that these beautiful lessons will not be lost on me while having this privilege to learn how to devote my life to God in the days of my youth. Mt.
