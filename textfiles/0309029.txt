PRAYER AND PRAISE (Sentiment taken from Fifth Psalm.) 1. Tin to my words, O Lord, give ear, My meditation heed, While lowly bow'd in sacred fear, Thy strength my soul doth need; 2. My voice, O God, in morning light, I will direct in pray'r, Guide thou my wand'ring thoughts aright, And shield me by thy care; O, hearken when to Thee I cry, Thou art my hope and stay, I feel Thy Though tempting snares my path be set Steadfast my faith shall be, Thy promise spirit drawing nigh, When unto Thee I pray. I will not forget, But look for help from Thee. In wickedness and vanity No pleasure dost Thou show, No evil thing shall dwell with Thee, All wrong Thou wilt o'erthrow; The false shall not stand in Thy sight, The nattering tongue thou't bind, For truth with clear and glowing light Will search the heart and mind. 4. Those who rebel against Thy law, And in defiance sin, Upon their souls true judgment draw, And feel its pang within ; But as for me I'll seek a place Within God's house of prayer, Where dwelleth mercy, truth and grace, My soul shall worship there. Within Thy temple songs of praise Shall evermore resound, In anthems sweet my voice I'll raise For blessings that abound ; Let them rejoice that in Thee trust, And shout in songs of joy, Thou ever wilt defend the just Who evil works destroy. Those who Thy name adore and love, Shall sound a joyful strain, As they advance to realms above, Away from earth's low plane; Thy favor to the righteous show, O Lord be thou their shield, Till they Thy perfect life shall know, In endless light reveal'd.
