WASTE NO TIME Time lost can never be regained. After allowing yourself proper time for rest, don't live a single hour of your life without doing exactly what is to be done in it, and going straight through it from beginning to end. Work, play, study, whatever it is, take hold at once and finish it up squarely and clearly; then to the next thing, without letting any moments drop out between. It is wonderful to see how many hours these prompt people contrive to make of a day; it is as if they picked up the moments that the dawdlers lost. And if ever you find yourself where you have so many things pressed upon you that you hardly knew where to begin, let us tell you a secret. Take hold of the very first one that comes to hand, and you will find the rest all fall into file, and follow after, like a company of well-drilled soldiers; and though work may be hard to meet when it charges in a squad, it is easily vanquished if you can bring it into line. Dr. Cheever says : ' If you imagine that you have nothing to do after this prayer, you are greatly mistaken. You must have an incessant watchfulness. When you make this prayer — 'Breathe in me a pure heart' — you have entered upon a lifelong struggle. It is an unceasing, never-ending fight between the higher and the baser nature, which are both working to obtain the mastery. Therefore your work must last with your life.'
