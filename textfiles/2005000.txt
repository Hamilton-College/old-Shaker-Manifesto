HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 11. TANNING. In the first year of the Community a small building was used for grinding bark, and for the finishing of leather. Several vats were made near the building, and the business of making leather made good progress. The grinding of the bark was done by horse power, and the machine was a circular stone. For twenty years these rude accommodations were used with but very little improvement. After the introduction of a cast iron bark mill, which was driven by water power, the business was greatly facilitated. In 1807 more additions were made to the buildings, and machines added for rolling the leather. In 1813 a machine was.added for splitting leather. The business had so much increased by the year 1834 that still larger buildings were needed and more ample provisions made to meet the growing demand. By tins change the vats were placed in the basement of the building and numbered not less than thirty-two. Every thing on the premises was made to correspond with the amount of business, as well as with the quality of the work 'demanded. The hides at this date were softened in a common fulling mill, but in 1840 a wheel or cylinder jwas used and considered a great im�provement. As the sales increased, [the old process of tanning leather in ,cold vats was by far too slow to suit �the sellers and buyers of this fast age, and a steam boiler was introduced in ;1850 for heating the vats and leaches, in order to force the hides more expeditiously through the process of making leather. This branch of business has been continued almost uninterruptedly, since the forming of the Community and has been quite remunerative. THE MAKING- OF HATS. Experienced hatters were among those who accepted the faith of the Believers, and the manufacture of fur and wool hats began with the beginning of the Community. Th'es*e were jnade not only for New Lebanon, but for the Believers in other States and for persons not of the Society. After a few years the business was all given in the charge of the Society at Hancock, and for twenty years no hats were made iii New Lebanon. This branch of industry has never been attended with that success which one might wish, and diminished gradually from year to year till it entirely closed. THE MAKING OF PAILS AND TUBS. By the introduction of a small amount of machinery, the Believers engaged in the manufacture of pails and tubs for their own use and a limited number for the market. But little improvement was made in the machinery for several years, but much good and substantial work was done, which found a ready sale. From the scarcity of lumber, and other branches of business occupying the attention, the making of pails and tubs, has been allowed to pass from the Community. THE MANUFACTURE OF CLOTH. The making of cloth in 1787 was almost wholly the work of hand cards, hand looms and the cloth was sheared with hand shears. In 1809 a machine was invented for shearing the cloth and this was accepted as a great step in advance of what had been. Hand looms continued to be used for many years. SADDLE AND HARNESS MAKING. This occupation was followed for some years, and was to the Society quite a profitable business. But at the commencement of the present century the .use of saddles became so greatly diminished, that in a few years the business was wholly laid aside. One horse wagons were quite universally introduced, so that the making and repairing of harnesses, became quite an active branch. BRASS AND TIN WORK. The principal articles manufactured of brass were sleeve buttons. These were made in two parts, and attached by a chain. These were largely used at the wristbands of the shirts. Some were made of polished brass and others were covered with cloth. Shoe buckles were used to fasten the shoes instead of strings. Knee buckles' were used to secure the legs of the breeches at the knee, but on the introduction of pantaloons, the buckles passed out of date. Stock buckles were also made and used to fasten the stock at the rear of the neck. Various kinds of harness buckles were also made of brass, and the sale of all these articles was for some years a satisfactory source of income. The Society made and repaired most of their own tin ware, although some articles manufactured of brass or tin they purchased as they did many other goods. CARPENTERING. This should be considered as one of the domestic branches and from the origin of the Society has been of great value. In the construction of buildings and in the multiplicity of jobs from necessity and for convenience, it has been one of the greatest blessings of the order. In the early years when the work on a building began, individuals from one or more Societies would assist till the job was completed. This obviated the necessity of employing any hired help. As this volunteer work was reciprocal, all the Societies were equally benefited as occasion offered. At this date the workmen had but few tools and these were mostly of an inferior quality. In 1813 a great improvement was accepted by the introduction of a buzz or circular saw. A large amount of work was now done in the mill with a saw running by water power, which was a great relief to the workman who had till now used his hand saw for this same purpose. Planing machines, for the smoothing of boards and timber were introduced in the year 18� and have proved to be of great value to the workman. At the time of the organization of the Society, few buildings were on the place, and those were not as well adapted as they should have been for required purposes. Many were subjected to much inconvenience on account of the limited accommodations that could be afforded them. So soon, however, as they accumulated sufficient funds, they began to accommodate themselves with better buildings, both for dwellings and for workshops. In all this wo^k they studied a rigid economy, in sifce and manner of finish, trusting that a future day would allow them to do much better. Sometimes from lack of experience the.y increased the expense and amount of labor on a building by making a&gt;curb or hip roof instead of a gable* roof. This, however, was the custom of this part of the country and on this account generally adopted. The halls of these buildings were quite narrow and the stairs very steep, in order to economize the room as much as possible. Very few of these first buildings were ever painted, as that was considered superfluous, and for many years after the custom had been introduced, only the best dwellings were allowed to have a coat of paint. All the buildings made previous to 1805 were very plain. The halls and rooms and all stairways were very contracted, and on the outside no jets to the eaves, nor any trimmings about the doors were permitted. Since the above date there has been a gradual change and in 1850 not a building was left that had not undergone some change in its construction. In this change a great many improvements were made, both for convenience and in the general appearance. The roofs, of all these first buildings were covered with shingles, while many since 1810 have been covered with tin or with slate. The Brethren's shop three stories in height, was built of brick in the year 1826. The Trustee's Office was built of brick, in 1827. The meeting house that was built when the Society was organized, was removed from its place and a much larger building occupies the ground. The present structure is 80x65 ft. and' has a round roof covered with tin. The roof was formed by arches of long planks, bent to a circle of about forty feet radius. The inside is one entire room, having a height of twenty-three feet. Attached to the south end is a building of 35x27 ft. and three stories high. The first loft was for the accommodation of the Society when they came to Church, and the second and third lofts were furnished for the Ministry and used as their dwelling. The family dwelling was 80x60 ft. and three stories high, above the base- ment. It contained twenty dwellingrooms, and in addition a large number of halls, closets and permanent cases for drawers and cupboards. This building was destroyed by fire in the year 18�. The foundations of many of the buildings were made of natural faced stone, while others were made of sawed stone. Wagon making and wheel and reel making have been carried on to some extent from the first, for home use, and more or less for sale. Our first wagons and trucks were all furnished with wooden axles, but these finally gave place to those made of iron. (to be continued.)
