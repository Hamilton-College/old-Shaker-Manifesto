Books and Papers 'Battle of the Books.' 'Battle of the Books.' The 'Literary Revolution' wiiich caused such a sensation a few years ago, and which was supposed to have been thoroughly overthrown and done for, seems to be 'ablaze' again, more fierce and flourishing than ever. Its '100-page catalogue, free' and 'books sent to any one to be paid for after receipt and examination, evidence of good faith being given,' are now being advertised in thousands of papers, and it opens one's eyes to see the books offeredâ€”this time thoroughly beautiful typography and the best of paper, presswork and binding, instead of small type and cheap work, as formerly. And one must acknowledge that they are indeed 'the lowest prices ever known.' We quote a few samples, the books being always unabridged, and in large type : Tennyson's Enoch Arden, 2 cents. The Cotter's Saturday Night, 2 cents. Csesar's Commentaries. Cicero's Orations, and numerous other 'Ancient Classics for English Readers,' reduced from $1. to as low as 15 cents each. Bacon's Essays, 15 cents to 40 cents. Dore's famous Bible Gallery, $2. Irving's Sketch Book, 25 cents to 60 cents. Irving's 'Works, in 6 large and most beautiful volumes, $4. Ancient Egypt under the Pharoalis, reduced from $15. to $1.25. Scotts's Waverley Novels, reduced from $30 to $7.50. George Eliot's Works, reduced from $12. to $3.75. And a whole host of the great poets of the world, ranging from 40 and 50 cents upwards; also plenty of other books equally interesting and astonishing to the old-time book bu}-ers. The books are sold only to buyers direct, and not through booksellers. Those who would be inclined to believe such claims fabulous, are confronted with the 'privilege of examination before payment,' and the witness of one's own neighbors on every hand who have already received their books. It is certainly worth a postal card to get the 'catalogue free.' 'For that, address John B. Alden, Publisher, 18 Vesey St., New York.
