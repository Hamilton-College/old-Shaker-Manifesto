CHRIST'S KINGDOM. Its Bed Rock Foundations. DANIEL FRASER. Ever since the manifestation of Christ in the female a work of shaking �whatever could be shaken has been going on in the world, and, with extraordinary results, and, from time to time has been felt among the Shakers. Under the idea of progress, some individuals have urged their ideas and conceptions, upon notice, tending, in some �cases to the subversion of the normal and radical form of Government of the Christ Order. A true line of faith, as taught by the Christ spirit, instructs that the work of Christ's Kingdom is the work of God, and, that all true progress will proceed from Him, through the work itself, in those who are subject to its order, and ��not in the line of mere human theories, and worldly philosophies,�conceptions of progress in the intellect only; such conceptions, and a quiet perseverance in self-denial to wrong and hurtful habits are quite distinct. It is truly written 'The invisible things of God,' (to the carnal vision only) 'are clearly seen and known' (to the Christ enlightened vision) ' by the things that are made, even His Kternal Power and Godhead. ' And, with safety we can add, that the visible things of creation aleo clearly show that all normal growth, proceeds from central life ; and, that when any living body sets up local action, not controllable by, central life, an abnormal growth, as a wen, boil, or carbuncle is the result, which certainly tends to disorganization,�disease, which, persisted in, results in death. If we look through the four grand divisions of animate life,�the Radiate, the Molusca, the Articulate, and all the various forms of the vertebrate, up to man, we find central life predominating', and beneficently presiding and harmonizing with the members of the body, and the members, with the central controlling power ; and. when there is a delegation of central energy, as in the ganglionic system in man, said system is strictly under central control. Central controlling life is a leading, prominent, ever present manifestation of animate life ; and, what is truly remarkable, the growth of each individual, from the lowest Radiate, up to Man, is independent of the animal, in its inception, independent of its will, or volition ; Jesus Christ saw this, hence he. says, ' Which of you by taking thought, can add one cubit to his stature?' Those who speak lightly of the theocratic form of government of Christ's kingdom, would act wisely to be still, and learn that God is in His Holy Temple, a redeeming and creative power; redeeming us from the bondage of our degraded animal nature, its habits and propensities, and creating us anew in the likeness of His own attributes. Even as our bodies have their growth irrespective of our choice, so, also, will the work of God be irrespective of our planuings, and devices. The best that souls can do, is to be faithful to obey the appointed centre of life,�the Order and Authority in the Kingdom of Christ. To this our Lord and Savior,�Christ, set us the example when he uttered, ' Not my will, but thine, 0 God, be done. ' Let each one and all be true ' to finish ' (put an end to) u transgression ' (of God's laws :) ' an end to sin ; make reconciliation for iniquity, and bring in everlasting righteousness. ' Do so. and, in due time, every good and true desire in regard to government, will befulfilled ; growth of stature iu Divine goodness, beauty of form, and development of function will be completed. Again. Peace ! Be still. ' The theories and; philosophies of the natural man, are, at best, but disintegratingagents, when introduced into the ideal of God's plan, and, in the nature of things, unstable, let them alone; they are adapted for the worldly man, not for the members of Christ's body. 'Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord,' * * * 'For my thoughts are not (as) your thoughts; neither are your ways (as) my ways saith the Lord. ' Isa.' lv., 7, 8. There is such a thing as a seeming support and subjection to central authority, which., in fact, is unreal! Let our support be from an undivided heart ;� warm, and affectionate ; ever overflowing with thankfulness that we have a part and lot in a work that confounds the wisdom of the natural man, and humbles in the dust all self-exaltedness 1 Let us not forget, that, in the exercise of our free agency, we may gain, by a wise use, our claim to an inheritance with the faithful; or, by an unwise use thereof lose that inheritance ! If, in faith, we look for God in His Order, we shall find Him, as lie has promised, He will meet us there ; and this, notwithstanding what may be. or seem to be, the imperfectness of individual personage-, representiug the Order'. 'Why callest thou me good?' said Jesus,. ' There is none good, ' (absolutely free from all imperfection) 'but God.' If this Order of God is slighted, and counsel is taken of human nature's crooked wills, where Christ is. such souls cannot come. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 20
