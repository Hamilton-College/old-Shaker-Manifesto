OBITUARY. Sophia Copley. On Friday, Aug. 4th, Br. Richard went his usual rounds of duty. On returning to the house he said, 'I feel just as I do not want to feel. I am much exhausted but perhaps a little rest will bring me out all right.' He walked out again in the p. m. The physician who was called entertained hopes of his recovery. The Doctor came again at evening, but his symptoms were worse. On Sunday morning at 4 o'clock, the physician was again summoned and then said that he was beyond all mortal aid. It was pronounced to be heart disease, combined with peritonitis. The Church were in the morning service, but soon after meeting received word that life was fast passing away. At 1 p. m. all was over, and the sad word was sudden and unexpected to many in the Society. Sister Margarett had left us just twelve hours previous, but we had been expecting her departure and were better prepared. The funeral of our two gospel friends was held on Monday at 3 o'clock p. m. at the Church family. Several friends, not of our Order, attended the services, and sympathized with us in our bereavement.
