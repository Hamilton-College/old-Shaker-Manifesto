THE CURSE OF THE AGE The words which should be written in every home and impressed upon every mind are that the education that is to avail in this life is not to be learned from books, piano-stools, drawing-schools, and French tutors alone. This idea has cursed the people of this country long enough. Men and women are to-day wandering about with nothing to do, who have spent time enough poring over Greek and Latin, or drumming on a piano, and mental and muscular force enough, too, to have acquired knowledge of and skill in a business or trade that would have placed them beyond the possibility of want. The field for intelligent and skillful labor in this country is large and poorly supplied ; that for accomplished imbeciles is small and terribly overstocked.
