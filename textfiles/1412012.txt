TRUE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. Conscious of the immense power of the religious sentiments in the human mind, and of the impossibility of separating them without violence from their vital union with the moralities, I have all along felt that the plan of excluding religion from education was inherently a defective one, which could not continue to hold its place against the assaults of reason and truth. In the past position of the question, it was best which could be followed, and was defensible as the smallest of several evils among which society was compelled to choose. As such I still advocate and defend it; but I think it important that it should be defended and advocated on its true grounds, and not as in itself proper and desirable. Instead, therefore, of recommending the separation ot secular from religious instruction, as in themselves distinct, I would adopt the true grounds, and in answer to the wish of some to make all education religious, say: Yes, I agree with you entirely that all education must be based on religion and that the authority of God should be recognized by us all as the only infallible standard in everything ; but that we may know what we are talking about, let us understand distinctly what each of us means by religion. Standing on such a basis, we cannot be shaken by either Jew or Gentile, Calvinist or LutheranThen comes the discussion, What is religion? A, says it is a code embracing, suppose, ten principles in all. On examination B, C, and D find that, say, eight of these refer to practical matters directly influencing conduct and character, and that they approve of them as true ; but each affirms that the remaining two are church dogmas, untrue, dangerous to salvation and deserving of all reprobation. For these B proposes to substitute other two, but is, in his turn, voted wrong by A, C, and I). The latter two follow with their substitutes, and are each condemned; all, meanwhile, admitting the eight practical principles to be sound and necessary to happiness. Here it is plain that if the children of all are to attend the same school a compromise must take place ; and while all agree to leave out the two articles, they may cordially unite in teaching the remaining eight, and in endeavoring to insure their recognition by the pupils as their best guides and as indispensable links in that religious chain which binds them to their Creator and imposes upon them the primary duty of seeking to know and do His will in all things. This done, let the parents and priests teach what they deem truth on the two disputed points, in addition to the religious principles thus daily and hourly inculcated and brought into practice among both teachers and pupils. It may be said that this is what is done already. But there is a difference. At present the line of separation between religious and secular education is drawn sharply, and in the school the pupil is not taught that the natural arrangements he studies or sees in play around him have been devised by Divine Wisdom for his guidance and happiness, nor are his feelings interested in securing obedience and gratitude to God as a moral and religious duty in return. The arrangements of nature are taught simply as 'knowledge' coming from nobody, and leading only to worldly advantage, not personal happiness. Religion again is taught not as the complement of that knowledge, leading the mind back to God and bearing at every moment on our welfare, but as a something apart, which does not dovetail with our conduct or duties. In short, the prominent idea in the minds of both teachers and taught, under the present national system, is, that secular knowledge and religion are distinct, and have no natural connection; and hence neither exercise its legitimate influence. But the result will be different if it be recognized universally that, taught as it ought to be, all the knowledge conveyed is inherently religious, and calculated, necessarily to bring the creature and the Creator into more immediate contact, and to develop feelings of love, admiration, reverence, and submission to the Divine will. Let it be proclaimed and understood that the inevitable tendency of knowledge is to lead the mind to the Creator, and that wherever it is taught without this result there is and must be a defect of method, or a fault in the teacher, which ought instantly to be remedied. Let it be proclaimed to the four corners of the earth, that education, rightly conducted, is religious in the highest degree, although embracing none of the tenets peculiar to sects or parties, and that a ;' god' Hess education' is a contradiction and a moral impossibility. It would be as logical to speak of a solar light without a sun. Every truth, moral, physical, or religious, springs from, and leads directly to, God; and no truth can be taught, the legitimate tendency of which is to turn us away from God Instead, therefore, of giving in to the op~ ponents of national education, and admitting a real separation between secular and religious knowledge, I would proclaim it as the highest recommendation of secular knowledge that it is inherently religious, and tha* the opponents are inflicting an enormous evii on society by preventing philosophers and teachers from studying and expounding its religious bearings. If this were done it would lay the odium at the right door, and show that the sticklers for exclusive churcheducation are the real authors of 'a gigantic scheme of godless education, ' in attaching such importance to their own peculiar tenets on certain abstract points ; that rather than yield the right of conscience to others, they are willing to consign society at large to an absolute ignorance of the ways of God as exhibited in the world in which He has placed them, and to all the misery, temporal or eternal, certain to result from that ignorance. It must be admitted that, as at present taught, much of our knowledge is not religious : but this is an unnatural and avoidable, not a necessary evil, and it has arisen, in a great measure, from the denunciations of the party opposed to the diffusion of education. By stigmatizing as infidel and godless whatever knowledge was not conjoined with their own peculiar creed, they deterred men from touching upon or following out the religious aspects of knowledge ; and if they be allowed to maintain longer the wall of separation they have erected, the result will continue to be the same as in times past. The only way to meet them is to turn the tables and denounce them as the obstructors and enemies of religious education, because they refuse to allow any exposition of the Divine wisdom and arrangements and will which does not also assume the equal infallibility and importance of their interpretation of His written wisdom and ways. This is a tyranny to which human reason can not continue to submit, and the sooner they are put on the defensive the better. Science is, in its very essence, so inherently religious, and leads back so directly to God at every step, and to Mis will as the rule of our happiness, that nothing would be easier or more delightful or more practically improving to human character and conduct than to exhibit even its minutest details as the emanations of the Divine wisdom, and their indications as those of the Divine will for our guidance. In a well-conducted school-room or college-hall, the religious sentiments might be nourished with the choicest food para pass'u with every advance in intellectual knowledge. The constant practice of exhibiting the Deity in every arrangement would cultivate habitually that devotional reverence and obedience to His will which are now inculcated only at stated times, and apart from everything naturally calcxilated to excite them. So far from education or knowledge proving hostile to the growth of religion in the minds of the young, they would in truth constitute its most solid foundntion, and best prepare the soil for the �eed to be afterward sown by the parent and priest, who would then receive from school a really religious child fashioned to their hands, instead of being, as now, presented only with the stony soil and the rebellious heart. The practical inference from all this is, that while we continue to advocate the exclusion of sectarianism of every hue from our educational institutions, we are so far from wishing to exclude religion itself, that our chief desire is to see all education rendered much more religious than it has ever been or ever can be under the present system. To make religion bear its proper fruit, it must become apart and parcel of every-day life. It must, in fact, be mixed up with all we think, feel, and do; and if science were taught as it ought to be, it would be felt to lead to this, not only without effort but necessarily. God is the creator and arranger of all things ; and wherever we point out a use and pre-arranged design we necessarily point to Him. If we can then show that the design has a benevolent purpose, and that its neglect leads to suffering, we thereby necessarily exhibit the loving-kindness of God and recognize it even in our suffering. If we next point out harmony between apparently unconnected relations, and show how all bear on one common end, we necessarily give evidence of a wisdom, omniscience, and power, calculated to gratify, in the highest degree, our sentiments of wonder, reverence, and admiration. If we familiarize the mind with the order and laws of God's providenc? and their beneficent ends as rules for our conduct, the very reverence thereby excited will prompt to submission�systematic submission because cheerful and confiding�to His will as our surest trust. Here, then, is the legitimate field for the daily, hourly, and unremitting exercise of the religious feelings in the ordinary life of man, and fur the exercise of that true, vivifying, practical religion which sees God in all things, lives in His presence and delights in fulfilling His will.�From the '�'�Life and correspondence of Andrew Combe.
