A TURNIP STORY. A farmer was once told that his turnip field had been robbed, and that the robbery had been committed by a poor, inoffensive man, of the name of Palmer, who many of the people in the village said had taken away a wagon-load of turnips. Farmer Brown, much exasperated by the loss of his turnips, determined to prosecute poor Palmer with all the severity of the law. With this intention he went to Mollie Sanders, the washerwoman, who had been busy in spreading the report, to know the whole truth; but Mollie denied ever having said anything about a wagon-load of turnips. It was but a cart-load that Palmer had taken, and Dame Hodson, the huckster, had told her so over and over again. The farmer, hearing this, went to Dame Hodson, who said that Mollie Sanders was always making things out worse than they really were, that Palmer had taken only a wheelbarrow load of turnips, and that she had her account from Jenkins, the tailor. Away went the farmer to Jenkins, the tailor, who stoutly denied the account altogether ; he had only told Dame Hodson that Palmer had pulled up several turnips, but how many he could not tell, for that he did not see himself, but was told it by Tom Slack, the plowman. Wondering where this would end, Farmer Brown next questioned Tom Slack, who, in his turn, declared he had never said a word about seeing Palmer pull up several turnips ; he only said that he pulled up a turnip. This is a fit illustration of how reports often grow and are circulated to the injury of a neighbor. Let every one be careful how they give credit to or aid in circulating evil reports, lest they be found lifting a hand to slay the innocent. Star and Crown.
