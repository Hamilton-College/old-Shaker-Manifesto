'OH, THAT I HAD A BIGGER BOAT!' That was a grand and heroic speech of the Becton boatman, who was the first to launch forth on the darkening waters of the Thames, at the cry of hundreds of drowning victims of the Princess Alice steamboat. This good man found a copious harvest of human lives, easily gathered in a moment to the full of the small capacity of the boat. And seeing how soon he had gathered all he could accommodate, and hundreds still struggling—and the vast majority of them struggling in vain—with the waters, he exclaimed : ' Oh, that I had a bigger boat! I could save so many more !' In a higher and nobler sense, this is the cry of all who are earnestly laboring to save souls from the overwhelming waters of sin and unbelief. Oh, for more and larger opportunities for doing good ! Oh, for a bigger boat to ' rescue the perishing,' to rescue more drunkards, more blasphemers, more sinners, from the depths of woe in which they are ingulfed; for just as in proportion to the number of boats, and ropes, and safetybelts, and life buoys, and other helps sent forth, the more were saved from a watery grave. So, in the mission work: the more energies employed, the more souls are rescued for Christ.—Hand and Heart.
