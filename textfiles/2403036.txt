Books and Papers. The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for February contains extra pages and exceptionally varied and interesting matter. Dr. H. S. Drayton in the illustrated opening article learnedly discusses the 'Brain of Woman Relatively,' and throws a clear lifiht upon that much mooted question. Dr. Edgar C. Beall's phrenograph of William Dean Howells, the famous novelist, from a personal examination, is an artistic pen picture and also closely analytical. Prof. Nelson Sizer continues his series, 'How to Study Strangers,' and contributes also a phrenological description of the well-known humorist, Marshall P. Wilder, from an examination. This will prove interesting as an echo from the consultation room of the veteran character reader. Horace Mann, one of the most eminent educators of America, is the subject of a sketch by Mrs. Charlotte Fowler Wells, in which the phrenological views and wonderful labors of the great philanthropist are appreciatively set forth. Child culture and hygiene receive attention as usual. The editorial columns contain an important testimonial from Dr. Lyman Abbott in favor of phrenology. Character sketches of Dr. Parkhurst, Supt. Byrnes, District Attorney Fellows, andDelancy Nicoll of New York, also Master Workman Sovereign, besides the field notes, etc., are new and attractive features. Price, 15cts; $1.50 a year.
