REST. MARION JOHNSON. 'Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. ' Matt, xi., 28. Living as we do in an age whose prevailing characteristics seem to be a spirit ot unrest, hurry and bustle in all departments of life ; each one striving to outrun his neighbor in the race for wealth, position and the fleeting, transitory bubble called pleasure ; how refreshing and consolatory to the weary mind, come home these soothing words of our divine Master, assuring us of a permanent and abiding rest in Him. Not indeed a rest dependent upon earthly surroundings and concomitants, or a relaxation from physical toil and labor; or an immunity from the cares and burdens, which our daily life imposes ; but the calm interior repose of a soul who, living in an element above the low ambition of earth, is not disturbed by its sordid and groveling cares and pursuits ; but trusting in God, and relying wholly on his promises, pursues the even tenor of its way, whatever may come. We are informed in the context how this rest is to be obtained, by taking the easy yoke of Christ upon us, and learning of Him who was meek and lowly in heart; by a self renunciation, by confessing and forsaking sin, and becoming crucified to that nature of evil, which is the inheritance of every son and daughter of Adam, and which is the true source of restlessness and disquiet. And as we die to this restless and unsatisfied nature, we enjoy that rest and repose of soul, which will find its full fruition only beyond the shores of time. May we by earnest patient endeavor, by watchfulness and prayer, by an unreserved consecration of ourselves to God, attain unto a fullness of this divine and heavenly rest. Canterbury, N. H.
