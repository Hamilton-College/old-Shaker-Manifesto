There is a calm the poor in spirit know... There is a calm the poor in spirit know, That softens sorrow and that sweetens woe. There is a peace that dwells, within the heart, When all without is stormy, cold and dark. There is a light that gilds the darkest hour When dangers thicken and when tempests lower, That calm to faith, to hope and love is given, That Peace remains when all beside is riven, That Light shines on us e'er direct from heaven. M. Witham.
