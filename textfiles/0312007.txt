VISION On or about the middle of November, 1870, upon retiring to rest at night, and closing my eyes (being still awake) the following scene, or vision, appeared before me : In the first place, I saw the Throne of God, and from thence a descending plane, reaching as far as my eye could extend, down to the region of darkness. Upon this plane there appeared a vast multitude of platforms, ascending one above the other, from the lowest progressively upward toward the Throne, which appeared like a dazzling cloud of Light and Glory, extending in length across the end of the plane, thus : and was cov~~-------------------------eredwithsucb Throne, indescr i b a b 1 e Platforms. brightness, and so enshrouding the ____________________ Almighty, that He___________________ could not be seen. At--------------------------the lower end of the plane, adjoining the dark_______________ regions, there appeared______________ upon the first platform ,-----------------souls who had just entered thereon, upon whom there was ~ a small measure of light shining_________ which enabled them to see some-----------of their gross and sensual abomina---------tions. Upon the next platform above them appeared more light shining ___ upon its occupants; and so it continued to increase upon each ascending plat-— form toward the Throne of God. And, as souls upon one platform faithfully improved the talents committed to them, it formed their credentials for advancing to higher ones ; but, if they had not improved their talents, the^r light became darkness, and they were rejected. The upper platforms toward the Throne appeared radiant with light and glory, which shone upon the occupants as if the work of regeneration with them was nearly or quite accomplished. I had no distinct view of Christ in his full manhood as a person, but was impressed with a feeling that he sat at the right hand of the Throne, and facing the Resurrection plane, and was there ruling and reigning over redemption's work, and putting all things under his feet, which, when done, his Mediatorial Office will cease, and he will give up the kingdom to the Father, and God will become all in all* Among the multitude of souls I saw, I recognized none that I knew in the form except Elder Ebenezer Bishop. He was in the front rank, and at the right hand of one of the platforms, and I was not far from him, upon a space not occupied by disembodied spirits ; and while I stood there, those upon that platform went forth in the worship of God, with their faces toward the Throne; and, as this mighty host moved forward in the dance, the manifest strength, life, and energy of their spirits were grand and sublime ; and the peace, love, and harmonious feeling which pervaded their ranks, and which they wafted over upon me, was beyond description ; it filled my soul with heavenly joy and delight; and I said to myself, ' This is heaven complete; I can ask for nothing more !' At this time I thought the greatest pleasures, honors and riches, that the world could bestow, presented themselves to my view, and they appeared so insignificant and worthless, that, even if they were not transient in their nature and duration, I wondered that any intelligent soul could for a moment desire them. * As the process of creation will never cease, and natural men and women will forever be coming into existence, so the end of the world, and of the works of salvation, redemption, resurrection, and the all in all in God, can apply only to individuals, to nations, to races, and to globes, The human personality, in this vision, arose from an educational and theological bias, which, in all of us, is as flavor (given from casks) to the wine of inspiration. Christ, as a plane of Deiflc, spiritual, and heavenly Intelligences, is infinitely superior to Jesus or Ann, as mere personalities. And Mother Ann said, ' Do not build your faith upon me, but upon the Gift of God : — That can never fail.''— Ed. Richard Bushnell, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
