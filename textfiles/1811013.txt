BIBLE TEACHING ON DRESS. 1. A thing- should not be worn merely as an ornament. Read carefully the following. 'Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold and putting on of apparel.' 1. Pet.iii,3. 'And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all the earrings which were in their ears and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.' Gen. xxxv., 4. 'And no man did put on him his ornaments.' 'And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments.' Ex. xxxiii , 4,6 Also, Isa. iii., 16, 26. Putting on apparel for adorning is as plainly forbidden as gold or broidered hair. Ornaments are those parts of apparel known as trimmings, such as lace, fringes, embroidery, buttons, ribbons, braid, stripes of velvet, feathers, ruffles, flounces, bustles, etc. Christian parents are forbidden to put any of these things on their own clothing and that of their children, as mere ornaments, and would sin in doing so. God requires you to bring up your children in the 'nurture and admonition of the Lord,' and you are responsible for their proper teaching. 2. 'Gold, and costly apparel.' Wearing gold ornaments, chains, rings, pins, buttons, studs, etc., as ornaments is understood by spiritually minded persons to be meant, and apparel that is worn for its costliness, instead of its economy, its comfort, and its durability, is condemned. No appeal to Old Testament practices can justify the use of what is wrong in and of itself. Because David, that 'man after God's own heart,' committed murder, should not be taken as evidence that murder is right. 1 Cor. x., 11. A writer on the subject has well said : 'The unholy women, as they do now, adopted a fashionable, worldly attire. They were known by their appearance. 'For they had golden earrings because they werelshmaelites.' Judges viii.,24. If they had been true Israelites they would not have had upon them these useless ornaments. In Isa. 3rd chapter, the various modes that fashionable women adopted to render themselves attractive, are specifically mentioned and unsparingly condemned.' Chas. G. Finney said: 'What does that gaudy ribbon, and thpse ornaments upon your dress say to every one that meets you? It makes the impression that you wish to be thought pretty. Take care ! You might just as well write on your clothes : 'No truth in religion.' It says 'Give me dress, give me fashion, give me flattery and I am happy.' The world understands this testimony as you walk the streets. You are living epistles, known and read of all men. Only let Christians act consistently and heaven will rejoice, and hell groan at their influence. But, O, let them fill their ears with ornaments and their fingers with rings�let them put feathers in their hats, clasps upon their arms, and heaven puts on the robes of mourning, and hell may hold a jubilee ' Bishop Weaver said � If there were two heavens, one where Jesus is all and in all, and the other with a Paris in it, I presume the road to the Paris heaven would be crowded with fashionable Christains.' Dr. Judson says : 'During the years you have been wearing these useless ornaments many...... have gone down to hell, with a lie in their right hand, having never heard of the true and only Savior ! The Holy Bible and valuable tracts might have been more extensively circulated in heathen lands had you not been afraid of being thought unfashionable and not 'like other folks,' had you not preferred adorning your persons, and cherishing the sweet, seductive feeling of vanity and pride.' What should Christians do? Rev. Albert Sims says : 1. 'Aim directly at pleasing God�dress so as to have God bless you in the dress. 2. Aim at promoting the health of the body; it is God's Temple. Dress on sanitary principles. 3. Let the dress be made so as to promote neatness, tidiness, simplicity, and good taste not slouchily and repulsively. 4. Dress so that a sound reason can be given for the wearing of every article. 5. Let your dress be a rebuke to fashion and extravagance, and a Model worthy of imitation. 6. Do not be afraid to profess religion by your dress. Do not shrink from the singularity of being right in this particular.' War Cry.
