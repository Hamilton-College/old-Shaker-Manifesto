A king desired to have it abridged, and certain scholars reduced it so that it could be carried by a hundred camels. Other kings came, who demanded that it should be diminished still more ; until at length the volume was reduced to four maxims. The first of these maxims bade kings to be just; the second prescribed obedience to the people; the third recommended mankind not to eat except when they were hungry; the fourth advised women to be modest.
