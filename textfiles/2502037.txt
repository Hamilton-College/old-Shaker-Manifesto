The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for January appears in a new, elegant, 'up-to-date' dress, and the contents are equally fresh and attractive. The Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, L. L. D, is the subject of the frontispiece and a closely ana. lytical phrenograph from a personal examination by the editor, Dr. Edgar C. Beall. This will prove exceptionally interesting to the many admirers of the brilliant orator, and to all students of character reading as a science and an art.
