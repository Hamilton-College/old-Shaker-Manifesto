South. Union, Ky. North Family. Jan. 1893. We extend to all the compliments of the season, and wish them very many happy returns. 'Home Notes' with us have been rather a scarce commodity lately, and after so lengthened a period of silence and seeming neglect or indifference, we have no alternative but to confess to a remissness of our duty in this respect, and promise to be more prompt in future. Now that Time's bells have chimed a requium over the past year, whatever may have been the errors of past days, we have fully resolved that the present year shall be more fruitful of good works; giving ourselves unreservedly to the work demanded, assured, that according to our faith and works, it will be unto us, and unto them to whom we minister. We had a most agreeable time Christmas. At 9 o'clock a. m. we had a singing meeting. In the evening we had a very loving and lovable sociable, for which Eldress Nancy Clark and Sister Lucy Clark had prepared a bountiful repast in the shape of those particular edibles that 52 THF MANIFESTO. go to make up what is commonly called a Merry Christmas. It was surely a feast in itself to the older Brethren and Sisters to see the expressions of delight depicted on the countenances of the younger ones. Throughout the sociable there was a happy mingling of sentiment, song recitation and reading. The recitations by two very young Sisters were excellently well execucuted. The reading by another young Sister was rendered with very pretty effect. The readings and recitations were all the more highly appreciated from the fact that they were given voluntarily�a most noble spirit,�and one which the children of a larger growth would do well to emulate, A company of Sisters and a Brother from the East Family graced our sociable with their presence and contributed much to the enjoyment of the gathering. We had, withal, a most delectable time, and all departed to their respective places of abode, greatly blessed, feeling that in life there was really more of sunshine than shadow. Health of family, good. Weather bitterly cold for this section. A kind adieu and best wishes for the future welfare, both spiritually and temporally, of all. William Miller.
