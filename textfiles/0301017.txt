BEAUTIFUL SHORE Andante. 1. Time's dark billows and tempests may roar, Yet will I sing of that beautiful shore, Where the chill winter of life shall be o'er, Ne'er to return to the soul. 2. Gladsome the spring of that fair happy land, Blossom and fruitage in glory expand, While the soft breeze from its emerald strand, Scent-laden float to us here. 3. Pilgrims who tarry, your time yet abide, Slowly receding is life's ebbing tide: Over its surges your spirits shall glide Safe to that beautiful shore. Blest summer land, free from sorrow and gloom, In fadeless beauty our spirits shall bloom, While the earth casket In-her its the tomb, Seasons supernal will roll. Love builds its mansion all pearly and bright, Rising in grandeur in rose-tinted light: 'Tis for the blessed, whose robes are made white, Heavenly homes have been rear'd. Happy the tho't I If our hearts are made pure, We an inheritance there shall secure. Hope still confides in the promises sure, When here our journey is o'er. rit. [if. F.Mt. Lebanon.]
