LIVE FOR TIME PRESENT AND TO COME. Mary Whitcher. We see the ages of our friends departing, Some over-reach our own, and some fall shori, We find ourselves just liable, while living, To tarry yet awhile or soon depart. But nothing shakes our nerves while thus [beholding The possible and probable of this oui day ; We only know 'tis wise to be preparing For our departure and for further stay. Canterbury N. H.
