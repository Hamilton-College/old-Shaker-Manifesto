HEAVENLY PATHWAY. 'I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.'Rom. viii, 18. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Canterbury, N. H. 1.

Oh! then let us press onward, the goal we may be, When our souls from all struggles with nature are sight, As the stars softly melt in the morning's clear win, And our souls may be cleansed from the nature of free ? When the unbounded regions of glory are light; And our spirits made pure by the Gospel's bright sin; By the cross that our Heavenly Parents did ours, And our pathway lies always 'mid heavenly flowers, fire, Will rise through eternity, higher and higher, bear, By watching and meekness, by love and by prayer.
