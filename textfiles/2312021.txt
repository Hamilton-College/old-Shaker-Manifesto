Shaker Station, Conn. Nov. 1893. 'He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much.' These are the words of our Savior, and how true do we find them. To deviate from faithfulness even in a small degree, will harden the heart and lead to greater departures from right. Faithful in small things. We should live by the principle that 'whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.' Only those who have done well, can expect the 'well done.' Without faithfulness there is no promise of reward. Let us resolve that what was well done, shall be better done. Let us tell others how they may shun the pitfalls of sin and we shall show them the sincerity of our friendship and love for pure principles. Superior choice may we display by shunning that which is sinful. We can not look into the future; let us improve the present. Now is our time, do not let us miss it. ***** It is not profitable to keep too many fowls in contracted quarters, without any opportunity for exercise. A teaspoonful of sulphur once a week, given in their soft food, will be beneficial as a stomach regulator. Ginger in poultry food is recommended as a tonic. Oatmeal is the best food for chicks for the first month, regardless of cost. Opinions vary as to what food is best for poultry. It is rare for two poultry keepers to agree exactly as to what articles are the best for egg production. Some people use various kinds of soft foods; others use grain almost entirely. The best feed undoubtedly, is that which runs to neither extreme. Soft food entirely is apt to produce bad results, while all hard food is inclined to diminish egg production. Variety in poultry food 'is the spice of life.' Brown Leghorns lead all others as layers. Daniel Orcutt.
