DR. THOMAS' CASE As we feared, the Methodist church has done the very foolish thing of condemning Dr. Thomas for daring to express a better religion than John Wesley knew of one hundred and more years ago ; and for being true to 256 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. his conscientious convictions of God's goodness and mercy, though differing from the steel-clad errors of a creed bound ''church. We agree with The Christian Union, that the only effect of his expulsion ' will be to add one more to the increasing number of useful and influential independent ministers, and to give notice to young men who have aspirations toward the ministerial profession that they enter it at the risk of purchasing peace by the abnegation of their manhood, or liberty at the hazard of a perpetual and bitter battle with their own brethren in Christ. Every such exclusion of one earnest but independent thinker from the order of the ministry shuts out a score of others whom the pulpit of to-day can ill afford to lose.'
