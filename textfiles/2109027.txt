Enfield, N. H. August 14, 1891. Deae Editor:ï¿½It was not for the want of a pencil, that Notes from our home were not forthcoming last month. The event did not occur that was worthy of note, nor has it now, unless it be that scores of boarders from the towns about us have inspected our premises from dewy morn till shades of eve, with Elder Abraham for their guide and counselor. If he meets them all again in the land of souls, he will, no doubt, be obliged to preach to the spirits in prison, as did our Savior, in order to get en rapport with some of them, although in the main they are wellbehaved, self-respectful people. If I could only record some recognition of the genuine cross our Savior bore against the selfishness of the human heart, some outpouring of the spirit, such even as our predecessors were privileged to witness, although the day and time demands a more perfect development, how it would gladden the hearts of all my dear brothers and sisters, who have the interest of our cause at heart! Tet we know the spirit of God is working in the hearts of his children all through the broad universe, and will not 'pass by' the earnest worker who wearies not in well-doing. The August Editorial was excellent; it was read in our morning service from advance copy and was highly appreciated by many. Our summer term of school closed July 30th. with honors, so far as commendations of 'The Board' were concerned at least. The one representative present pronounced the proceedings to be a good illustration of what unity would do, seeming to recognize the fact that proper discipline between school hours, also the support of community members had a deal to do toward insuring success. Some shingling has been accomplished this season, wish we might say painting as well. The hay harvest is now in progress. We cannot tell about the delicious beans and corn that are 'marching along' nor do we expect the procession to be a very lengthy one when it appears, judging from former experiences. Our fine vegetable garden which people admire so much, and really is a picture in itself, is devoted to the producing of seeds mostly, and vegetables for other consumers; and although we know if holy, we shall be thankful for daily blessings, greatly in advance of the majority of humanity, just as worthy, yet (we) believe that when all things work together for good to those who love the Lord, we shall have less hired labor to provide for, and more thought given to doing what we can for our home. Health of our Society generally good, no extreme cases of sickness, no cyclones, nor water spouts have as yet spread devastation, for which we are truly grateful. E. B.
