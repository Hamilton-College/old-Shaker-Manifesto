OBSCENE LITERATURE Is it not a novel idea to commence the suppression of obscene literature, by incarcera- ting in the Tombs those persons who, of all others, except the Shakers, are the most fear- less and unselfish exposers and denouncers of the 'social evils,' from which the obscene literature proceeds ? This is akin to the St. Louis legislation where men enact the most abominable obscenity, enforced by the most outrageous violation of individual rights, that it is in the power of men to inflict upon women, who, in all respects, except physical might, are their equals. In both cases the ' social evil ' is increased, and its abettors, Avho occupy high places, shield themselves by persecuting their prosecutors. The Mormons Are one step in advance of popular Christia.nity, in solving the sexual problem. They have gone back to Judaism, out of which Christianity arose. Marriage, combined with the ' social evil' practices of the popular Christians, is further from Christianity — Shakerism — than is the polygamy of the Mormons, combined with the absence of the ' social evil ' habits of Washington, New York, or Boston. Prostitution of adults, and masturbation of juveniles, being unknown in Utah, except so far as they are introduced by the influx of monogamic Christians. Wherein is the moral superiority of the St. Louis Christians, who legalize prostitution and raise revenue from it, over the Mormons, who legalize polygamy and suppress all other forms of the 'social evil?' The servant of G-od should be of ' quick understanding in the fear of the Lord; and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears; but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.' Is. xi. 3 &amp; 4.
