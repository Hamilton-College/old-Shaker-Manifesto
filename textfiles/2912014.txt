This being so, seriatim, I must say: our itinerant Ministry at present are located at Hancock, Mass., reviewing the progress of the Community there, in things spiritual and temporal. So far as my information extends, their relationship is a bond of peace, love and union, a three fold cord not easily broken. At Mt Lebanon, Church family, the burden of the Brethren is the harvesting of the fall crops, preparatory to meet the inclemency of a cold, frost-bound, snowmantled winter. We are quite well prepared for the unwelcome visitor. According to the Indian maxim; 'Before winter sets in, the swamps must be filled with water,' which at present is not the case, and our springs are very low. The Sisters are busy as bees in the season of flowers; besides their ordinary round of duties, they are favored with orders in the line of making cloaks for citizens not of our Community. This employs a number of the Sisters from morning dawn till dewy eve. So both Brethren and Sisters have enough to do, leaving no time to be sick or to be unkind. This is a blessing, that should be appreciated, even if some of us do at times snap the hygienic law and get ourselves into a trap of troubles. Calvin G. Reed
