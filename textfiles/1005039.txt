Things I have Noticed J. C. N. .—I have noticed that there are farmers who are afraid to trust their farms, and their farms show it. I have noticed that there are farmers who feed their mowings spring and fall, and usually a considerable portion of their barn room can be rented. I have noticed that some farmers plant no corn, saying they can buy it cheaper than they can raise it, and have seen the cattletlook as though they had waited a long time for their owners to raise money to buy the corn. I have noticed that some farmers' horses have a habit of stopping at every liquor saloon they have come to. I have noticed also that the horse and driver resemble each other in this respect; each wears a staring coat. I have noticed that the man who can manage his own and his neighbor's business successfully1 is the coming man. At any rate he has not arrived yet. I have noticed that some farmers swear with their tongues, and some with their milking stools. The cows prefer the former style, but the devil don't care which. I have noticed that poor fences make unruly stock and bad neighbors. I have noticed that if a team gets ' set,' it is better economy to take a part of the load from the wagon than to take a part of the flesh from the horses. I have noticed that it is a good plan to take notice of the good and the bad, so that we may follow what is good and shun that which is bad.— in llecord and Farmer,
