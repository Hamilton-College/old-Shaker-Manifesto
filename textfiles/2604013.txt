Narcoossa, Florida March, 1896. We have been much strengthened by the presence of Elder Joseph and Elder Isaac for three weeks past. During their sojourn Elder Joseph broke up the first four acres at our central station on the lakes, and worked with us three or four days clearing the high and dry hammock on the lake which includes about twelve acres. We tore up trees, and roots, and 70 TK E MAN I FES TO. piled for the fire, over a surface of about three acres. Elder Isaac returned to help us and drove our mules the last day we were blest with their able help. Our garden filled with all northern productions is in thriving condition, collards, raddishes and lettuce for the table, and sometime before this meets your eye we shall have new potatoes and sti'ing-beans. We have a beautiful green pasture of rye for our cows. Our 130 peach trees planted Dec. 24, have made six inches growth and look healthy. The 1C65 pine-apples as a whole look wholesome, but are partly quiescent in cool weather. Our tomatoes have been, and are yet to be; the winter crop is past. Corn and melons planted since the Brethren's sojourn with us are putting forth briskly since we were blest with about an inch of rain, Friday the 2*7th ult. Meadow-larks take the whole if they can get it. We are in better hope and experience from this winter's work. I think it is as good a country and land, as lies upon the globe, when we learn to adapt ourselves to it. Every tiling raised in the north can be raised here in the winter, and melons, peaches and oranges will produce without fail. The cross, the cross is just as hard to bear to those who do not want it here as in a more northern climate, but the yoke of Christ is easy and his burden light everywhere. Henry Hollister.
