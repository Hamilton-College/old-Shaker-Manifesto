THERE IS NO DEATH. Oliver C. Hampton. There is ao death we only rise To higher altitudes of life; When in the dust this casket lies, And we surcease from mortal strife. There is no death, the patient soul, Wears out its earthly cerements, Puts on the Golden Aureole, And soars serene in glory hence. There is no death hut each true life Is safely 'hid with Christ in God;' With vital force forever rife, Tho' Earth takes back her lifeless clod There is no death, for shade of man And woman, never were alive And 'twas not in the Master's plan That soul and shadow long should strive. There is no death, but soon we pass Into the restful summer land, To sail in peace the 'sea of Glass,' Or wander o'er the Golden Strand. There is no death tho' sure and soon, The silent boatman calls for us, With funeral dirge and mournful croon, The lamp of fate to darken thus. There is no death, O wand'rer pale Amid the glimmering sheen of Earth, 'Tis but the dim and shimmering veil, Dividing from a higher birth. There is no death, dismiss all fear For Christ hath lit Earth's gloomy crypts With consolation love and cheer 'Mid even 'the Earthquake and Eclipse.' There is no death, but in its stead, Blest Apotheosis of life, A resurrection from the dead, Debris of this sad world of strife. There is no death, which does not give Existence vastly more enhanced, Far sweeter in its realms to live Than this to loftiest height advanced. There is no death, then O prepare, For joy in Holier Realms than this, Our Father's love and peace to share, Our Mother's smile to crown our bliss. There is no death, exulting sing, Flee gloom and sorrow all away; : O Death where is thy vaunted sting, 0 Grave where is thy victory.' Union Village, Ohio.
