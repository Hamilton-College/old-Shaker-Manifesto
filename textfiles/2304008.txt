LETTER FROM MOUNT LEBANON, Addressed to an absent member of the Society. My Dear Sister:�It is a lovely day, I am sitting by the west window viewing the scenery that surrounds our beautiful mountain home; my thoughts take wings and fly to you, and 'as thoughts are things,' did you not feel a familiar presence, my lonely absent Sister? I remember the time when I was brought to Mt. Lebanon; I was young and fond of worldly pleasure, and was greatly opposed to staying, where I supposed everything self-pleasing and attractive would be denied me. You met me with a gentle, loving spirit; and spoke many kind, encouraging words; showing me that our greatest happiness was attained through selfsacrifice and devoting our lives to do good and be good. Be assured dear Sister the impressions I received from those who spoke from actual experience, and in whom I could see Christ's life and teachings exemplified, created in my heart new desires and aspirations ; I was ministered to by a spiritual power that changed my purpose in life. Oh how thankful I am that I have chosen the better part. I feel recompensed for every sacrifice made and find true pleasure and peace of mind in following my inward convictions of right and duty. I feel the necessity of looking to God for strength and assistance, if we trust in his Divine power made manifest through his sacred order, we shall 'possess our souls in patience' and be inspired with hope and cheerfulness, these will alleviate all niixict'.* s of mind. THE MANIFESTO. 'Mirth is like a flash of lightning that breaks through the dark clouds and glitters for a moment, but cheerfulness keeps up continual daylight in the mind, and fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity.' It is conspicuous in the characters of philosophers and holy men among all nations, and they who are possessed of this excellent frame of mind, control circumstances and conditions, and live as it were under the benign influence of God�of good. We above all people should be the happiest, surrounded as we are by so much that tends to the elevation of character, to purity of life and the recognition and practice of every Christian virtue; looking not to a far off God who sits enthroned beyond the skies, but seeking his presence in the hearts of those who are created in his and her own likeness and image. What a beautiful thought this is, the acknowledgment, not of the Trinity but of the Duality of Deity. Father, mother, one in spirit, but dual in expression, as we see clearly manifest in all created things. And is it not better to follow our Master and exemplar Jesus, than to place him in the Godhead, and lose the force of those intensely practical human teachings, that made his life not only at one with the Father, but with his brother man, ' 'He came to seek and to save' and 'was the first born among many brethren.' I often realize what a good work of reformation and regeneration Mother Ann Lee, the founder of our order inaugurated. Truly, her mission was a heaven inspired mission, proclaiming as she did that mankind were under the power and dominion of sin, that the lust of the flesh was the root of all evil, and produced all the misery and unhappiness there was in the world; it also darkened the spiritual understanding so that mankind were unable to perceive the truth. When those who obeyed her testimony formed the communal homes of the Societies of 'Believers,' they were based on the equality of the sexes. Woman, no more the slave of man's desires, stands as his equal in the pure celibate order; and, since the establishment and practical demonstration of righteousness, and purity in the domain of sex, how woman's cause has grown; surely motherhood is broadening in the sphere of its duties and relations to mankind, and when all sects and people shall acknowledge the Maternal Spirit in Deity, then will extend the glorifying, ennobling influence that shall redeem and uplift the race from all forms of gross evil and injustice to which mankind are now subject. There is so much to interest and absorb our attention, indeed it seems as though all the great reforms of the day were but the stepping-stones to the grand heights to which we all are climbing, and we are anxious to see prosperity attend every effort that shall bring nearer the Millennium. Loved Sister, your letters to dear ones at home, are to our feelings 'as deep calling unto deep.' Oh, how much we long to have you in our midst again. You are missed from the 'SelfImprovement Society,' we hold our meetings regularly once a week, and often place a chair in the circle for you. There has been much of inter88 THE MANIFESTO. 89 est to employ our time, we are encouraged with the progress we are making. There have been some interesting articles read, one or more of those concerning societies, organizations, reform movements, etc. One member has written beautifully of the 'King's Daughters,' and of the society for the 'Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,' including the Bands of Mercy for children. Another member has written an article concerning the 'Temperance Movement,' from earliest existence; she interspersed much valuable information with well expressed, original thought of her own. Another member wrote nicely upon the 'Peace Cause' and the progress of 'Arbitration' in the nations, its many bloodless victories. One of 'the younger members informed us concerning the 'Brotherhood of the Spirit' and 'School of the Christ,' an organization in existence at present. The young Sisters have a special singing meeting Friday evenings, for the cultivation and training of their voices. While we are striving for intellectual culture we do not neglect the assembling of ourselves together for worship. We have had some beautiful spiritual meetings. The Christmas tide was very enjoyable. With new songs and interchange of many gifts, morning service, afternoon entertainment which was made up of original conti'ibutions and music, the day was profitably spent. We do not make merry and feast as the worli feast, and while we had a bountiful repast, we were thankful that no harmless creature yielded up its life for our gustatory pleasure. Injustice and heartlessness are even at our doors; there have been two evictions in the town of New Lebanon this winter for non-payment of rent and a foreclosure of mortgage. Not only pride and folly, but selfishness and greed are in the hearts of the children of men, and they fail to deal justly and love mercy. I feel increasingly the necessity of dependence upon those higher spiritual powers that alone sustain and uplift from self and sin. We know from experience that we grow in nobleness of character and breadth of soul just in proportion as we merge our individual life and happiness in the life and happiness of others. The beautiful adornments of the spirit are meekness and purity. We shall be glad to have you return to our home and hope that you will be blessed with renewed health and strength. We remember you in our prayers and hold you in our heart's affections. Give our kind regards and thanks to the good doctor who has been so faithful in attending to your case ; may she be blessed in all her efforts to benefit humanity, and teach and preach the gospel of health. We will extend to you our continued love and remembrance. Ever your loving Sister,- - - - -
