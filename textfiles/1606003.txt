SCIENCE and RELIGION. OLIVER C. HAMPTON. There never was, is not now ; and never will be any antagonism or conflict between Science and Religion. Nothing but sheer ignorance in any man could suggest such a possibility. To completely disprove such a statement, and annihilate at once all the silly arguments based upon it, it is only necessary to say, that all truth is of, and from God and God cannot antagonize Himself. If this is not so, there is no truth, no reason, no sense, no anything. The faculty of Reason (which is merely a comparison and mental manipulation of ideas already possessed, and derived mostly if not wholly from external experiences) is a verity and a useful one. But the sublime faculty of Intuition with its inspirations and sequences is just as much and as really a verity of consciousness as the other, and infinitely more reliable. Pure reason cannot conflict with pure Intuition, because both are of God and agree with the Supreme Intelligence and any two things, which agree with a third, must agree with each other. False reasoning and false Inspirational Intuitions growing out of undeveloped mental and spiritual conditions need not be nimed in this essay. They are not verities but phantasms. Through the sublime faculty called Intuition, the most sublime and stupendous truths have been suggested to man in all past ages, of his history and still continue to be and will forever. They photograph themselves upon the dial plate of his consciousness instantaneously, before slowly plodding reason has time to manipulate the'm or even look at them through her mechanical lens called Logic. But give Reason and Science time enough, and they will be found uniformly on the side of the sublimer faculty of Spiritual Intuition, and never in conflict therewith. All truth as comprehended by finite man, must necessarily be more or less tainted with the feculence of error and the beautiful process of Evolution will be necessary to gradually fan away this feculence throughout all time and through The the interminable cycles of Eternity The canons of logic may answer the purpose of dove-tailing arguments to gether in order to reach a certain given and often foregone conclusion. Bu without the help and kindly co-operatior of Inspirational Intuitions did the cok cast steel canons of logic ever satisfy any mind? And if they did what kinc of a mind was it? It was a cold-blooded angular temperament, all intellect and not one bit of emotional sentiment or kindly and charitable warmth of spirit. Such are metaphysical monstrosities. We need not wish to belong to that category of intellects. The best mode of development we can adopt is to become if possible equally perfect, physically, scientifically, spiritually. An excess of life�intellect�or emotion is sure to be disastrous sooner or later. But if philosophically developed as above suggested, there is no danger not even a possibility of any antagonism or conflict resulting between our Eeligion and our scientific attainments. In fact this is the way to 'seek first' (and last) the kingdom of Heaven and its Righteousness, and the only way. Any development different from this whereby any one or more of these three dapartments of our being is sacrificed to the others, must result in arrested development of the neglected departments and hideous monstrosity. Happiness and bliss arise from the practice of temperance in all directions and excess in none. Let us learn and practice every physiological law and keep our health at a standard which will enable us to labor for the good of others. Let us learn all possible science which will in any way directly or indirectly do good to our Brethren and Sisters temporally or in-tellectually. Let us learn and practice all manner of religious truth which can be brought practically to bear upon the progress of our Brethren and Sisters in holiness and happiness ;- -all that will comfort them in affliction, cheer them in forsaken hours ; all that will enable us to weep with the sorrowful�rejoice with the jojful�all that will make us forgive and love our enemies as readily as our friends. And let us once and forever shut down on this nonsense about a conflict between science and religion and rather look upon them as counterparts in the Divine Scheme of Providence to help us on to higher and higher attitudes of happiness and glory ; as two sides of the same shining road leading to the sublime presence of 'Him who inbabiteth Eternity ;' whose dual name and nature is Wisdom and Love ; and from whom originates all Religion and all Science.
