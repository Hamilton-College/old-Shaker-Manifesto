Within some persons, some families... Within some persons, some families, some congregations, some communities, the leaven of truth has been deposited for a long time, and yet they are not moved, they are not changed. The. leaven remains as it came a stranger ; all around, notwithstanding its presence, is still, is dead. It is when the Spirit is poured out as floods that the leaven of the kingdom spreads with quickening, assimilating power. 'I will pour out my Spirit upon you, saith the Lord ; ' the promise is sent to generate the prayer, as a sound calls forth an echo. Behold, I come quickly, says Christ; even so, come, Lord Jesus, respond Christians.
