DAY LILIES. By Cora Vinneo. Born for a day! and yet so sweet and fair That day seems brighter just to see thee Isloom, And night seems holy just to be thy tomb. God said 'exist,' and from the virgin air He spun for thee a robe, with matchless care, And in the under darkness and the gloom He struck the wells supplied with rich perfume, And filled thy incense cup with nectar rare. Born for a day! and yet the thoughts that come Stay with us when thy snowy forms are gone, And find a voice when day's harsh voice is dumb. But when the golden sun announces dawn, We look to see thy lovely sisters greet The new-born day with forms and perfume sweet. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
