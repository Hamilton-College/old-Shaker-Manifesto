THE BETTER THOUGHT. Sophia Wayne. How often in temptation's hour, An unseen force seems brought, As if to check an evil power And prompt the better thought. And they who learn by spirit light And in that faith abide, Well know we have contending might Forever at our side. That One, in a persuasive tone, And powers that can entice: And Conscience is the other one, That speaks with gentle voice. If we a victory would win, And vanquish Satan's sway, This present time we must begin, And not postpone, a day. For Conscience is a holy power, On whom we can rely To guard us in temptation's hour, And Satan's power defy. If we its gentle voice will hear, And to our Father, pray, The enemy will disappear, And Conscience win the day. Ballston, N. Y.
