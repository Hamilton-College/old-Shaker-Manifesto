TIME By Daniel Orcutt ' Time and tide wait for no man.' We are constantly reminded of this truth, as we leave days, weeks, months and years behind. And, are we becoming better, as golden opportunities come and go? We are certainly growing better or worse. Writer, how stands the verdict regarding yourself? You must know, if you are true to your own conscience. Having lately crossed the line which separates 1872 from 1873, what is your ultimate aim for the present year? Your aims may be good. But good desires, without corresponding efforts, will not benefit you. If you make earthly pleasure your ultimate aim, you will certainly fail of finding real happiness. ' For what is earthly pleasure ? 'Tis like the snowflake on the river. One moment there, then gone for ever.' The desire to be like the meek and lowly Saviour, unless that desire calls forth daily practical obedience, will not make you like him. If you would live with Jesus in heaven, you must live to Christ on earth. The time allotted you for heavenly discipline, and for holy living, like the current of a mighty river, is swiftly passing. Therefore, give earnest heed to the injunction, ''Work while it is day.' For 'to-day is gold, tomorrow is dust.' Resolve to be so pure in heart that you can 'see God' in yourself; and act fully up to that purpose; 'then the work of redemption will have commenced. Will you make that resolve? The prudent mariner, when sailing in windy latitudes, sweeps the horizon with his glass, to ascertain if there are signs of a storm. As night approaches, he shortens sail, sets his watch, and keeps a good look-out. If prudence be necessary when applied to things of time, how much more so when applied to our religious life here, and to the life which is to come? For the soul is of more importance than the body; and time is of less importance than eternity. 'A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.' â€” Enfield, Conn.
