Mt. Lebanon, Nov. 25, 1890 Beloved Elder Hesky;â€”The fire that occured on the evening of Nov. 21st was a building used as a drying kiln. In a considerable degree, a store house for dried apples, sweet corn, medicinal roots with other things was entirely destroyed by fire with most of its contents consisting of nearly 100 barrels of dried chickory, 23)-o barrels of sweet corn, 4 barrels dried apples, 2 barrels boiled cider, a steam engine, 2 corn machines, a new fannin.7 mill, 1 large and one small Fairbanks' scales, numerous barrels for putting up dried roots and for beef etc., etc. Loss estimated at about $4,000. The Church family was running the kiln for drying eLiokory. The wind was strong in northwest until about the time the fire started, and had it thus continued it would have been impossible to have saved a single building belonging to the South family. But some kind Providence suddenly turned the wind very strong in the southeast, so that, by the use of an ample fountain of water un- der 80 or 100 ft. pressure and two large three inch hose attached to a good hydrant all other buildings except one small ony adjoining the kiln, were saved. Soon the fire was tolerably and mostly extinguished the wind again siiiited into the northwest, but by the aid of fire extinguishing apparatus, the debris was kept from burning so as to endanger other buildings. Thus, notwithstanding the loss, the South family have tlieir home left to them to be thankful for, and thus have courage to continue the wrestles of life and bless God for the gospel of a full and clean salvation from sin.
