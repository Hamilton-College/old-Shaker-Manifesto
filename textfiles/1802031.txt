THE BIBLE A generation is growing up--indeed, in many cases is already grown�to whom the Bible, if not an unknown, is a grievously neglected book; that there are many young men and women, and not a few older men and women, among the so-called 'educated classes,' who have never read the Bible, and whose knowledge of it is obtained mainly, if not altogether, from hearsay. They may, if the children of religious parents, have learned something about it in Sunday school and from sermons, but that is all; they have not read enough of it to have any clear idea of its contents, much less to appreciate them at their true value, or even to fully understand allusions to them. If this rather startling statement is doubted let the doubter test it by asking two or three biblical questions in the next miscellaneous company he meets be the members old or young�and see the answers he gets. Unless more fortunate than some others who have tried the same experi_ ment, he will be�to put it mildly�astonished. That the Bible is read more than any other book may be freely admitted; but the point we urge is�and facts will sustain us�that it is not read as generally as it ought to be, not nearly as much as is commonly supposed; and that there are hundreds, if not thousands, in every large community, of what are considered intelligent persons, to whom� for all the personal acquaintance they have with them by reading�the Old and New Testaments might just as well have remained in their original Hebrew and Greek. Let us suppose that instead of being known to the world for thousands of years, it had been� though as old as it is believed to be�recently discovered; found, as Tischendorf found the manuscript of the famous Sinaitic Codex in the convent of St. Catherine, on Mt. Sinai, in 1844 and 1859. Let us suppose that during the process of translation and publication extracts from the more important portions had been given to the public through the daily press or in pamphlet. With what eagerness would all Europe and America wait the appearance of the completed book; and when it appeared, what man or woman, young or old, with mind above the clods, would not read it, or have it read to them. If the Bible had nothing to recommend it but reputation�leaving its Divine authorship out of the question altogether�even then not to read it would be nothing less than a crime against the intellectual and moral nature. Here is what has been said by one [Eev. Theodore Parker,] who did not believe in its inspiration, or only in that kind of inspiration which is given, in various degree, to all great and good men who strive to lead their fellow-men through darkness up to the light that is in God : This collection of books has taken such a hold upon the world as no other. The literature of Greece, which goes up like incense from that land of temples and heroic deeds, has not half the influence of this book from a nation alike despised in ancient and modern times. It is read of a Sunday in all the thirty thousand pulpits in our land. In all the temples of Christendom is its voice lifted up week by week. The sun never sets upon its gleaming page. It goes equally to the cottage of the plain man and the palace of the king. It is woven into the literature of the scholar, and colors the talk of the street. The bark of the merchant cannot sail the sea -without it; no ship of war goes to the conflict without the Bible is there. It enters men's closets; mingles in all the grief and cheerfulness of life. The Bible attends them in their sickness; when the fever of the world is on them the aching head finds a softer pillow if such leaves lie underneath. The mariner, escaping from shipwreck, clutches this first of his treasures, and keeps it sacred to God. It goes with the peddler in his crowded pack; cheers him at eventide, when he sits down dusty and fatigued; brightens the freshness of his morning face. It blesses us when we are born; gives names to half Christendom; rejoices with us; has sympathy for our mourning; tempers our grief to finer issues. It is the better part of our sermons. It lifts man above himself; our best of uttered prayers are in its storied speech, wherewith our fathers and the patriarchs prayed. Men rest on this their dearest hopes. It tells them of God and of his blessed Son; of earthly duties and of heavenly rest. Foolish men, find it the source of Plato's wisdom, and the science of Newton, and the art of Raphael; wicked men have used it to rivet the fetters on the slave. Men who believe nothing else that is spiritual, believe the Bible all through; without this they would not confess, say they, even that there was a God. Not to have read the Bible is not to have read the book of all the books in the world best worth reading. To read it as it deserves to be read�even conceding its human origin�is a liberal education. No one can be unlearned who has learned what this book has to teach. Read the Bible, then; if you cannot read it as 'the Word of God.' read it for what it surely is�the highest and noblest word of man. In it human nature rises nearest Divine nature; in it mortality comes nearest the Divine nature ; in it mortality comes nearest the putting on of immortality. Or if you care only for meaner merits, where will you find such poetry as Isaiah or Job, which Froude, a skeptic, says, ' will one day, perhaps, be S'ien towering up alone, far away above the poetry of the world.'' Where will you find such prose as in some r.f the Epistles of Paul, such soulstirring philosophy as in the sermon on the mount, the parables of the good Samaritan and the prodigal son; such theology as the conversation with the woman of Samaria; such sublimity of pathos as in the passion, trial, and crucifixion of Jesus? 'Strike, but hear me.' Call the Bible what you will, but read it. St. Louis (Mo.) Republican
