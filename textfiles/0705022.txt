The Cloud of Witnesses BY THEODORE TILTON 'Are they not all ministering spirits ?' I leaned upon a burial urn, And thought how life is but a day; And how the nations, each in turn, Have lived and passed away. The earth is peopled with the dead, Who live again in deathless hosts; Who come and go with noiseless tread, A universe of ghosts. They follow after flying ships, They flicker through the city's marts, They hear the cry of human lips, The beat of human hearts. They linger not around their tombs, But far from churchyards keep aloof; To dwell in old familiar rooms, Beneath the household roof. They waken men at morning light, They cheer them in their daily care; They bring a weary world at night To bend the knee in prayer. Their errand is of God assigned, To comfort sorrow till it cease; And in the dark and troubled mind To light the lamp of peace. There is a language whispered low, Whereby to mortal ears they speak; To which we answer by a glow That kindles in the cheek. Dear shadows, fairer than the day; With heavenly lights they wrap us round Wherein we walk a gilded way, And over holy ground. Oh, what a wondrous life is theirs, To fling away the mortal frame; Yet keep the human loves and cares And yearnings still the same. Oh, what a wondrous life is ours, To dwell within this earthly range; Yet parley with the heavenly powers,â€”Two worlds in interchange! Oh, balm of grief, to understand That whom our eyes behold no more till clasps us with as true a hand As in the flesh before. ^o longer in a gloom profound Let memory, like a mourner craped, Sit weeping by an empty mound, Whose captive hath escaped. So, turning from the burial urn, I thought how life has double worth, f men be only wise to learn That heaven is on the earth.
