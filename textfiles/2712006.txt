A large volume of water upon one corner of a field... A large volume of water flows upon one corner of a field, but flows immediately off again; the grain that was planted in the field can do no good, because no moisture was received which it needed to cause it to grow. A man at one moment receives a great deal of love, a great desire to live the Christian life, but unless he allows it to spread evenly over the whole of his life, he will never reap the harvest of a pure and a happy life. W. C. Mc Ginnis.
