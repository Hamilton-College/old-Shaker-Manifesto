Watervliet, N. Y. Watervliet, (Shakers P. O.) N. Y.. Here live nearly two hundred professional Shakers ; and for a long time past, even as at present, not one is sick, nor otherwise incapable of some active physical service! This will strike the reader more peculiarly, when we say that two are more than ninety years of age—Eleanor Vedder, and Phebe Lane, (colored)—from among those who united about the year 1800. Two are above eighty years old—Jeremiah Lowe ;—J. C. Buckingham and Eliza Wells—both connections of large families coming early in this century. All of the above are very active—far from being on the retired list. Then follow twenty-five, who are more than seventy years of age, some of whom act as if in their prime; while fully as many more are within five years of three-score and ten, yet none say: '/ am sick;' none that say : 'I am old I' Elder F. W. Evans may praise Mt. Lebanon, but as a place of health and perpetual youth, which one will rise up to compare with youthful Watervliet?
