Enfield, N. H. July, 1895. We can but echo the sentiments expressed in Sister Catherine Allen's ottering to the June No. of The Manifesto. Surely, all the years we have given to a life of self-denial must have had a tendency to enrich our minds with a goodly development of solidity and intelligence of a Christ-like type, and it is our duty to utilize these powers for the best good of humanity. It would seem to be a senseless assertion to declare that certain cherished ideas were absolute and unchangeable, for nothing is so except truth, substantiated by personal experience and the evolutions oi' nature. Turning the reflector of memory backward, we see that by the removal of old conventionalities and useless ceremonies, there has been wrought out larger human qualities that enrich and brighten Christian life. In every progressive movement are experiences both bitter and sweet, teaching lessons of truth which blossom into deeds of righteousness inasmuch as the aim is to benefit mankind. We are pleased to add to the record of our Society history, the pleasant visit we have enjoyed with Sisters Maria Blow, Jane Cutler, Cecelia DeVere, and Lydia Staples, also Brother Ezra Stewart, representatives from the North family of Mt. Lebanon. Such events give a flood of thought that bring friends near, and convince us that the company of the pure in heart constitute the joys of Heaven. We would that there were more of such pages of remembrance. 188 THE MANIFESTO. Harvesting of hay in full operation, and proves to be of excellent quality. Elder William Wilson who is interested in bee culture, has been successful in enlarging his colony from three to nine hives. We hope they may increase an hundred fold as we regard honey profitable as food and merchandise. With renewed love for all, we hope an impetus will stir Zion to new movements to spread her God-revealed truths, while those who have taken hold of the plough of progression, press nobly on not looking back to view the stones of impediment unearthed in their onward march for justice and truth.
