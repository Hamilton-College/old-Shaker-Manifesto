Dear Editor:�The Manifesto continues its monthly visits and is a welcome guest. We always find items of interest in Home Notes of the different Societies and families. In most of the articles of the last . kindly notice is taken of the demise of our honored and much beloved Elder Giles, whose place will be filled by Elder Joseph Holden to the best of his ability. While it is a great cross for us to part with him from the Center family, we are glad that our little circle had one in its midst so worthy and acceptable to the people as he is and we of the Center bid him good, or God-speed in his new vocation. We know he will do honor to the place and to the family in whose kindly care he grew to manhood. Br. Alonzo is a worthy successor to Elder Joseph, who meiits the love and good feelings of Believers far and near, and I doubt not will have the prayers of his numerous friends both among Believers and those not connected with the household of faith. Winter is far progressed and the weather taken together has been quite moderate. All the families in our Society have secured a winter's crop of ice. One family secured theirs this week, in nice condition. Although the season has been quite icy, yet there has been no report of broken bones thus far, which is cause for gratitude. We pray the Lord of the harvest to send forth more reapers, as we have room in our houses and in our hearts for many, many faithful souls, who may wish to come and dedicate themselves to a life of self-abengation. Oar love to the whole household of faith. T. D. R. Watervliet, N. Y. Feb. 1891. Dear Editor:�You, no doubt, would like to hear how we are prospering in Watervliet. We are busy drawing and sawing logs at our mill, for our Society, and our neighbors. We are making full time just now, and are also getting up, and cutting our year's supply of wood. Our ice crop was gathered last month. It was very nice and from twelve to fourteen inches thick. Our stock is wintering well this season. Some of the families are hauling and spreading manure on their meadow land. The weather is cold here and a warm stove is looked upon with a good degree of pleasure. 1 hear the hum of the sewing machines every day, except Sunday, and I conclude our Sisters are anxious to make shirts for the heathen, (or somebody else.) So we are busy helping each other along. We have had enough of winter to last us twelve months and are now looking anxiously for spring. The hens have been on a strike this winter, and refuse to lay. We are in hopes with warm weather, to have the strike declared off. We have not much to complain of, and a great deal for which to be thankful. J. B. Oue ice was harvested some time ago, a goodly store, both in quality and quantity. There has been good sleighing most of the time, and snow in the woods has been a little too deep to please the wood-choppers. The weather is good, bad and indifferent ; and we have had f otir stormy Sundays in succession. In answer to enquiries about our silo�would say that since we have commenced feeding ensilage to our cows, we think the quantity and quality of milk much improved. Br. Daniel in Home Notes of Feb. ISTo. says, there is something lacking or wanting at Watervliet and throughout our Zion homes. What is needed? What is wanting? Talmage, in a recent sermon, says, what the Churches need to-day is, 'Power from on high.' Is it not this power from on high that we need and what Zion lacks? Will it come to us without exertion? and shall we be willing to accept it? Words are not lacking�but the Holy Spirit which is a consuming fire. Hancock, Mass. Feb. 1891. Dbah, welcome, Gospel Messenger, Inspiring are thy truth-; As like a Godly counselor, They chasten, teach and soothe. Thy pages teem with richest thought, By able talent given; And wisely is each soul there taught, How best to live for Heaven. Not much news from the home circle at the present time. The winter which is nearly past, has on the whole, been very good. Snow and ice are plentiful and there has been a sufficiency of cold weather to make the climate healthful. Sickness, we are happy to say, has been almost a stranger. A few only, have suffered from heavy colds. The Company who are working the iron-ore mine have sunk their new shaft to the depth of a hundred and thirty feet, finding ore in abundance and of good quality. The foreman of the Company has erected for himself and family a new dwelling, and has at present in his employ some seventy or eighty workmen. J. L. S. Enfield, Conn. 'Life is mostly what we make it;' then why not make the most of life? Crosses and trials will come. Let us not dwell on them, but bear them with Christian patience, and look ever for 'the silver lining.' We know that, if borne in the right spirit, even our trials are good for us, and we can 'bear each other's burdens and fulfill the law of Christ.' There is no trouble so grievous that it cannot be brightened if we would try to see its bright side. Too many are prone to nurse their trials, thus aiding them to abnormal growth. Let us strive to cultivate that patient, sunny spirit which, finding the good in others, blesses the possessors. The present is ours. Let us not fill it with sighs for the past and dreams of the future. We should fill our hearts with sunshine; sorrow's cloud will not behalf so dark. Our Manifesto is like an angel in the household, ever bringing help, encoiu-agement and good cheer. Let us, within its pages, offer our best to each other, from the practical hints that make life's burdens lighter, up to the helpful hints for the soul. 2772 spaces of cream were sold in January. A change of food will sometimes stimulate hens to lay when nothing else will serve the purpose, simply because they become tired of the sameness of diet and readily accept something else. Coal ashes and tobacco dust in the poultry house are good disinfectants. No egg eating when china eggs are kept on the floor. Cold air on the hens in the night means 'roup' every time. Nothing better for hens than boiled oats with wheat bran. If a fowl is wanted that combines many good qualities, the Plymouth Eock should not be overlooked. D. Orcutt. South. Family. Feb. 1891. The wheels of time are constantly in motion, and already we are commencing the second month of the New Year, and the duties of every-day increase with its length. Vacancies that are made must be filled by those who are left to bear the burdens of the present. The dairy is yielding us good returns for the labor expended. Some repairs are being made at Brethren's shop and other places. Wood is now being sawed and put into the sheds. The great quantity of snow and rain has interfered with out door labor to some extent. Not as much damage from the ice on the trees in our Community as in other sections of the Connecticut valley. We have secured some excellent ice for creamery use, thirteen inches thick. Sleighing nearly gone here. The blessing of health prevails. M. W. Harvard, Mass. Feb. 1891. Dear Editor:�On the 31st ult. we were called to pay a worthy tribute of respect to one of our old comrades, a true soldier of Christ, beloved Elder, Isaac Bailey of Shirley. So we see that the veterans are leaving us, one at a time, to report in another home, and it is left for us to hold aloft the banner of Virgin purity and to keep it for others, as they have kept it for us. Thus far the present winter has been very favorable for business, indeed the best for twenty-five years. The snow came in November and the white mantle has covered the earth to the present day. Our Brethren are engaged in the herb and broom business. Should any of our friends need some of these necessaries of life, we could furnish them very readily. Of herbs we have a large amount, and are continually sending them to Boston, through hope that they may help correct some of the miseries of that enlightened city. On page 35 of Feb. Manifesto, we read a little gem, contributed by some dear soul, 'Let no knowledge satisfy but that which lifts above the world,' etc. What a lesson to learn! This shall be my aim. The knowledge of deep truths, treasured in the store-house of heaven is what my soul thirsts for each day, and the only way to gain this treasure, is to live to our highest understanding of right. Our blessed Mother Ann, gave us many good examples in this new order of life. 'Hands at work and heart to God.' 'Do not fail to meet together for worship, even though your houses should be torn down, over your heads.' The necessity of keeping a spiritual gift and regularly attending our religious service ought to be with us of the first importance, as in this way, our Mother, found a great salvation and travail of soul. 'Seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and all things will he added.' Let us all give this a little more attention. A. B. Canterbury, N. H. Weather Eecord, East Canterbury.

Our Community in Canterbury is elevated some nine hundred feet above the city of Boston, and full one hundred feet above the streams and ponds in our vicinity, so that it is quite impracticable, at present, to use water as a motive power for machinery unless we go some distance from home. At the first family we use a twenty-five horse power engine for laundry purposes and the running of several knitting machines. For the sawing of cord-wood we use an engine of six horse-power; one in the printing office of three horse-power and one in the dairy of one horse-power. This last mentioned is a 'Davey Safety Engine,' and it is beyond dispute, a safety engine, in the charge of the inexperienced or even of a child. At the North family they have a six horse-power engine for their laundry, their dairy and for the sawing of wood. Our ice harvest in January was of the best quality, and not less than one hundred and fifty tons were secured for the use of our family. The ice, when cut, was sixteen inches in thickness. From our herdsman we have this item:� that a Jersey cow gave ninety-nine quarts of milk in seven days, and from this was obtained six pounds of butter. This we call doing pretty well on the hill-sides of New Hampshire. * Feb. 1891. Beloved Editoi::�The absence of 'Home Notes' from Canterbury, in the Manifestos of 1891 is no sign that we are away from home, or that its interests are not still guarded by as valiant soldiers as held the fort throughout the good old year, 1890. It is so natural to depend upon ready pens and willing hands that have served us in the past, that only the absence of a good thing brings us to a realization of the truth, that we should give as willingly as we have received. We are sternly aware that we have entered the second month of our spiritual New Year, which we pledged to make bright and glorious by renewed efforts of willing consecration. Some one says it would be well for us to pause between each month, long enough to settle our debit and credit accounts, spiritually, repent of all sin committed by seeking an honest confession and newness of life; thus enjoy twelve New Year's days where we have formerly had but one. A timely suggestion, the conscientious regard of which will insure us a place in that kingdom, forever increasing. At date of writing, our predicted storm has not commenced, and we meet for our Society service wherein we are blest to hold communion with the worlds above. The wires of spirit telegraphy of which our beloved Elder Giles spoke when at Canterbury last, are neither laid low by winter's fiercest blasts nor the wily attacks of any enemy. Our faith and trust in God's work is unshaken as are the granite rocks of New Hampshire to-day. Yea, we mean to be granite rock Christians. Thus, humbly remembering God's goodness, we fearlessly enter upon blustering March, as we sing� 'I'll brave the storm and breast the wave, The way of God to keep; For in the harvest of my life,� Its power, I would reap.' Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1891. As I attempt to write something that shall in part represent our branch of the vineyard, I am puzzled to know just what to place upon paper, as so many subjects crowd before the vision. If the power of expression came as freely, what beautiful thoughts one might place before his readers. How true it is, that the 'songs unsung' and the 'words unspoken' are the sweetest. No lack of material for thought but language often fails to fulfill its intended mission, even when expressed in good faith. Suffice it to say, in our home, every moment of every day has assigned to it, some duty, all of which we may make 'labors of love' if so disposed, and glad are we of this, for duty faithfully and cheerfully performed, gives joy and present satisfaction. We do not envy those who sigh for the weary, tedious day to pass, that night may come bringing its round of gaieties, that make the young, old before their time. We have reason to believe that this style of living is passing into ill repute, even among our sisters abroad, and a more 'sensible view of life's responsibilities as beings destined for Eternity, are taking its place. Last year, one thousand corn-planters were manufactured here under contract; this season only five hundred are wanted, which looks as if all had not heard of this new device for corn-planting or had concluded to let the crows help themselves while they I plant in the 'good, old-fashioned way.' ! The new invention covers securely as soon as the corn is dropped. Our ice was harvested in January, and parties who came from far and near last season to obtain this necessity have evidently procured it nearer home. Some quite warm, pleasant days have j been ours to enjoy, in spite of the severe I cold. At times the thermometer has reg- j istered eighteen and twenty degrees be-! low Zero. Cold enough, and yet, thus : far, no epidemic worthy of note, (as was j the impostor of last winter,) has assailed us. E. B. Sabbathday Lake, Me. Feb. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�The time for writing has rolled around once more and it hardly seems a month since I last sent notes for the Manifesto. We are very glad to tell you that our good Brother Thomas has been spared to us and is now rapidly recovering. Br. Henry Green, from Alfred, is with us assisting Elder William Dumont in preparing the poplar wood for basket. work. Eldress Lizzie and a company of Sisters are also engaged in the same business. The Brethren have invented an improvement on the machinery which holds the blocks of poplar to the plane, whereas it formerly had to be done by main strength. We are glad that Br. Henry came to help us, not for the sake of his work alone, for it is a blessing to have the influence of such a good, gospel Brother among us. Two hundred and seventeen bushels of potatoes have recently been freighted to Mass, from this place for which we receive eighty cents per bushel. Our school closes the 20th. inst., and thus ends a long term of sixteen weeks which has kept right along without interruption excepting one half day. A. S. C.
