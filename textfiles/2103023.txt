Sabbathday Lake, Me. Feb. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½The time for writing has rolled around once more and it hardly seems a month since I last sent notes for the Manifesto. We are very glad to tell you that our good Brother Thomas has been spared to us and is now rapidly recovering. Br. Henry Green, from Alfred, is with us assisting Elder William Dumont in preparing the poplar wood for basket. work. Eldress Lizzie and a company of Sisters are also engaged in the same business. The Brethren have invented an improvement on the machinery which holds the blocks of poplar to the plane, whereas it formerly had to be done by main strength. We are glad that Br. Henry came to help us, not for the sake of his work alone, for it is a blessing to have the influence of such a good, gospel Brother among us. Two hundred and seventeen bushels of potatoes have recently been freighted to Mass, from this place for which we receive eighty cents per bushel. Our school closes the 20th. inst., and thus ends a long term of sixteen weeks which has kept right along without interruption excepting one half day. A. S. C.
