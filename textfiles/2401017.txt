South Family Dec. 1893. The season of Thanksgiving was duly observed and thanks returned for the blessings received. The comforts which are experienced in our quiet homes are the reward of industry and care, as time has swiftly carried us through the harvesting season and filled our granaries and storehouses with a bountiful supply from the Giver of every good and perfect gift. A new elevator is in process of construction which will also add to the many improvements of the year eighteen hundred ninety-three, and all have proved so far beneficial. We have been favored lately with a short but pleasant interview with our highly esteemed Brother Arthur Bruce and also with Elder Calvin Reed and a Brother companion. These seasons of gospel interchange strengthen the bond of union, although the time was too limited to be satisfactory. The Year 1894 is about to dawn. The past, freighted with golden opportunities has gone forever. Its hours we can never recall, but its influence is ours, its spirit abides, though unseen. Even so with those who have left us, they live and are laboring now; their achievements are for us, their inspiration is our portion, our legacy, our New Year's gilt. As a people may we awaken to a vivid sense of our responsibilities, for all we do lives after us. May the Spirit of Truth, Wisdom and Love, be our guide and counsellor through the untried year.
