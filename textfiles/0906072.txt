Sweet Corn as Stock-feed Jonathan Talcott the well-known farmer of Rome, N. Y., reports to the American Cultivator this very satisfactory experience with sweet corn as stock-feed : ' During the past two seasons I have had an acre or more to cut up when suitable for roasting'ears, besides what I have fed in its green state direct to the cows, and I think it is the best feed that I have ever used for feeding dairy-cows or fattening animals. In either case it seems a food nearly perfect. The ears furnish material for fattening or milk, as the farmer wishes, and the stalks, if cut when green and well cured, will be eaten very clean, and serve all the purposes of hay, especially for working oxen; and while they are so supplied they feel the effects of good feeding as readily as on any feed 1 have ever given to working oxen. I find, while so fed, oxen will lay on flesh veiy fast if not required for daily labor on the farm. Let every farmer try a piece of sweet corn for 1879, and note the success, being careful to secure the fodder, with the ears on, in fine condition, and keep it bright and sweet till fed out.'
