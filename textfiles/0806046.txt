Sudden changes in the weather... Sudden changes in the weather are very trying to poultry, and no poultry-keeper is up to his business who does not keep a few remedies at hand to promptly meet any indisposition. Simple remedies are generally sufficient, if used at the first appearance of trouble. Sulphur, charcoal, and cayenne given in soft food, will generally restore them, but in the case a distinct disease appears, remove the affected bird for special treatment.
