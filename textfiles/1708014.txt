THE TREE OF LIFE. ERNEST PICK. I. There stood an apple-tree in a beautiful orchard. Its roots were firmly buried in a fertile soil and wide spreading limbs and branches made it a beautifully shaped tree under the shade of which it was sweet to rest. It promised abundant fruits delicious to the taste. The owner of the orchard was a very good-hearted man and Mr. Too Easy was his name. He did not take great care of the apple-tree and allowed the sprouts to grow and go as they liked and in a couple of years the tree looked like a small wilderness. For the sprouts had taken all the place, excluding the sun-light, many limbs were crooked, many dead altogether. At spring-time caterpillars built their nests and the worms crawled all over the tree destroying the leaves. Harvest-time came and though the apple-tree still offered plenty of shade there were no fruits. II. In course of time Mr. Too Easy was obliged to sell his property and Mr. More Energy purchased it. And then you ought to have seen the heavytrimming our tree experienced. The sprouts were cut off, the crooked limbs and the dead wood cut off, the limbs hindering the rays of the sun were cut off and every by-way limb, small though it be, was clipped off mercilessly. Soon the old good tree stood there in its former comely shape, the lights of the heaven poured into the centre quickening the sap to a vivid circulation. When at spring-time worms tried to build their homes there clipper and pole were after them and the nasty worms were clipped off, burned and trampled down. Harvest time came and our apple-tree needed not be ashamed of its own existence, it offered abundance of fruit ; an adornment to itself, a joy and blessing to man, an embodiment of the Creative Power of Goodness.
