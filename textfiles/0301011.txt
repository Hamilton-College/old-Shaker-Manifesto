I WANT TO BE A SAVIOR By Anna Dodgson How often we are cheered by the sweet sound of the little chant, 'I want to be an angel, and with the angels stand,' as it comes from the lips of bright-eyed, juvenile innocence. And who is so hardened that her soul, upon reflection, does not affirmatively respond to the desired want? But I am thinking that for mature years, where furrowed brow, dimmed eyes, and whitened locks bespeak experience in this world of ours, we might with propriety sing of wanting to be, or becoming, saviors. O, how our world needs practical salvation ! And is there not already a call for saviors to arise and stand on Mount Zion ? I want to be a savior and on Mount Zion stand, With self-denial for my shield, and sword of truth in hand; To live a life that's sinless, in innocence and love, With wisdom of a seraph, and meekness of a dove. I want to be a savior: then saved I first must be From selfishness and envy; from worldly pride be free; From base, low, groveling passion, I must have wings to rise, Not seeking worldly glory, but reaching for the prize. Like Jesus Christ our Pattern, the lowly Nazarene, Performing acts of mercy, each savior must be seen, And boldly chiding error, with stripes, if needs should be, Completes a savior's mission, as by the word we see. We have two holy Patterns â€” Christ Jesus and Christ Ann, Who've taught us to be saviors, and form'd and laid ' a plan,' By which each human creature who ceases from all sins Becomes a Christ or Savior, whose mission here begins. Then come, O come, ye saviors, and stand on Zion's hill; There boldly rear your standard, your mission to fulfill, To save from sin and sorrow all who will hear the call, Be resurrected, born again, and freely give up all. A practical salvation, in thought, in word and deed, Brought forth by self-denial, is what our world does need; And many a blessed savior now on Mount Zion stands, With crowns upon their heads, and harps within their hands.
