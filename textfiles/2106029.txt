Enfield, Conn. 'Gather up the fragments that nothing be lost.' There is a beautiful economy in all God's works. There is no real waste anywhere. If God saves every atom of material in carrying out His works, surely it becomes us to be thoughtful of the use we make of that which is entrusted to us. A good steward is ready to give an itemized statement of all that is entrusted to him, and no less will be expected of us. 'A true account must yet be given.' If we could but realize more fully that the blessings we enjoy are only ours in trust, we should be more prudent of them. There are comforts and blessings multiplied continually, if only we will be thankful and rightly improve them. It is often the very lavishness with which our blessings are showered down which renders the human heart insensible to its many comforts. There is frequently more thoughtlessness involved in the lack of appreciation. Whatever fragments can be made useful are worth saving, and we are wise indeed when we gather them up and make the most oi them. 3744 spaces of cream were sold in April. A space is nineteen sixtieths of an inch. Strawberry plants are quite promising. A fair crop of peaches may be expected for home use. Our Hubbard squashes will probably last till June! Growing chicks need animal food to build up a strong frame of muscle and bone, and the more exercise they get Use more of this food they will find. They should be allowed to range the fields where insects and worms abound. Whole wheat for chicks is better than all soft food. Hens should have plenty of bulky food. Grain alone is too concentrated.
