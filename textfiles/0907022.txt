Courtesy We are deeply moved at the very courteous treatment received at the hands of our Spiritualistic Contemporaries, The R. P. Journal, Banner of Light and Texas Spiritualist. These journals seem not to tire in quoting from our columns with credit; and have so many good words to say about us, that we feel under many obligations to them, which we do not know how to cancel. The secular press deserves a large share of gratitude from us, for only kindly mention and encouragement. And while we receive the silent courtesy of the various Church organs, with now and then a shy observation, we are ever grateful for the courteous treatment. The Am. Socialist has many, and only good words for us.
