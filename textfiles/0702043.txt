How to Feed Poultry The Massachusetts Ploughman says : ' Don't feed poultry corn; for laying hns it is worse than valueless ; there is so much fattening material in its composition and so little of the albuminous, that eggs cannot be manufactured from it. For their breakfast a dry dough of shorts is sufficient; if you have some skim-milk to mix with it, all the better. A good supply of oats and barley should be kept in the feeding-box through the day, and at night a feed of whole wheat should be given them. Corn should be fed only in the cold weather, and then sparingly and for the last meal of the day.'
