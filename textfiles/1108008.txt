A PERFECT WHOLE CECELIA DE VEYR What can we spare from the Gospel, The gift of eternal life ? Can we spare the lovely gem of peace, And take the thorns of strife ? Can we spare the equal rim of gold, On which the eems are set, Then seek to claim, to grasp, and hold Whatever we can get, And from the love of God to all That shields us round about ? What order, either great or small. Can safely be left out ? The Gospel is a perfect whole, However it may come, And blest and happy is the soul That takes its teachings home. The father and the mother love, And mighty burning flame, Are inspirations from above, The source and end the same ; They come to teach our souls to make A sacrifice of sin ; They come our spirits to awake â€” The precious pearl to wiu. The pearl of virgin purity, The fadeless, priceless gem, The anchor of security, The star and diadem ! We cannot gain it, till we stake The life to nature clear; And hearts, the sacrifice that make, How glorious they appear! The shining angels 'blessings bring That fall like gentle dew, For every good and holy thing Is given to the true. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y'.
