Arbitration vs. War The cost of the armies and navies of all the nations which call themselves civilized, amounts to a thousand million dollars each year, in times of peace. In order that these nations may assume a defensive attitude and be ready to protect their rights, or assault the rights of some other nation on slight provocation, five million able-bodied men are taken from the active producing portion of the people, and a burden of twelve dollars per year is laid upon those who remain at work, for the support of standing armies and navies. When wars occur the expense is, of course, greatly increased, and burdens of debt contracted which require years to wipe out.
