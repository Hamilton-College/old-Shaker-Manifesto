Harvard, Mass. July, 1895. Again we renew our bonds of union with all in Christian love. Those who are striving to live the Christ life are one in him wherever located. While the nation celebrated its birth 214 THE MA NIFES TO. with noisy demonstrations we enjoyed the day in quietness. Sister Nellie, Brother Kneeland Codman and G. S. Cheney wTith lady, were with us. After feasting on a good substantial dinner, the room was cleared and at 3 o'clock we were recalled to be entertained by the young people. Very appropriate selections were spoken and sung, represented with good taste and becoming costume, followed by impromptu speaking. Mrs. Codman rendered 'Anastatia', and Mr. Codman gave us 'Spirit Breathings' impromptu. We were then served with ice-cream, cake, watermelon, lemonade, candy and nuts. Our centenarian Br. Ezra Newton was in our midst, and enjoyed all with as much zest as our young people. How beautiful is age, when sits upon the brow the crown of Wisdom. Hay harvest is nearly over. The farmers have had a wet season. By judicious management they have been successful in securing nearly one hundred tons of good hay and none injured by rain, which is a great blessing to us.
