To Loosen Glass Stoppers â€”Put on one or two drops of sweet oil round the stopper, close to the mouth of the bottle; then put it a little distance from the fire. When the decanter gets warm, have a wooden instrument with a cloth wrapped tightly round it; then strike the stopper, first on one side, then on the other; by persevering a little while you will most likely get it out. Or you may lay the bottle in warm water, so that the neck of the bottle may be under water. Let it soak for a time, then knock it with a wooden instrument as before.
