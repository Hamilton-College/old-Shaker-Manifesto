THE GAIN OF VIRTUE P. H. BRADY, OhiO Any one having practically learned the true character of virtue, reflects the same on the minds of his associates. As the brilliant rays of the sun are reflected by the glistening particles of snow, so does the influence of virtue shine on the hearts of truthseekers, and unveils the mist that hovers over the brink of death. The most prominent characteristics of virtue, are godly knowledge and purity. Mankind, commonly ignorant of the sustaining power of chastity, are, unknowingly, sinking deeper in the abyss of degradation. It is true, that virtue is an essential element in the progress of divine truth ; however unable men may be to explain the wide difference between its theory and practice. But the perfected religionist requires both the knowledge and power of virtue, to rise above the level of common humanity, help others up, and hold complete government over the passions. We look upon the inimitable foliage, cast in the crucible of virtuous nature. If we cultivate in opposition to nature, that soon becomes imperfect. So, by failure to use the power of virtue, men become akin to the satanic. Virtue is a characteristic of truth ; and meekness and patience under trials are evidently the fruits that proceed from truth. Crossbearing is necessary for the maintenance of purity. Under the power proceeding from the testimony of Shakerism, which is in opposition to every unchaste practice, we find an ability to learn and practice an exceeding virtue. And souls are rising up in demonstration of this fact, and are living evidences, that the knowledge and power of virtue, once lost, can be gained, and more than gained.
