WHY DOUBT! MARIA WITHAM. An, whence this doubling, faithless heart! Why sadly linger on thy pilgrim way? Let 'Faith and Hope secure for thee a part, Press for the prize that can be thine to-day. The love which sought thee, now can bear thee up, Will still uphold and guard on every hand; While faint and weary, full may seem thy cup, Doubt not; God's love forevermore will stand. Unclasp those fetters which can set thee free ! And speed thy progress till the eventide; Renew thy strength; for short thy race may be, And in God's love thou canst and will abide. Enfield, Conn.
