MADE PERFECT BY SUFFERINGS WATSON ANDREWS Pity me not, when travel-worn Along the weary way, You mark my languid step and eye, As wanes the toilsome day; Congratulate me, rather, dear, For know these travel-stains, Are indications of success, Are marks of real gains. For travel is the thing we seek, Still in the ' narrow road ;' And travel causes weariness, Tho' leading home to God. Not weariness alone, but death— The natural must die— In order that the soul may 'live And reign with Him on high.' ¦ New creatures we are to become And leave the old behind ; And this transition painful is, But we should be resigned. Then pity not, my sister, dear, But know, these marks of pain, Are caused by what pain only cures, And hence are marks of gain. North Union, 0.
