HISTORY OF THE SHAKERS. By Henry C. Blinn. WITH the advent of the testimony of 'peace on earth and good-will to men,' that was heard in the streets of Galilee, in the halls of Capernaum, and in the city of Jerusalem, came the gathering together of kindred souls who accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ and separated themselves from sin and sinners, that they might become the sons and daughters of God, and be able 'to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world.' That the work was for the direct growth of the moral and spiritual faculties, no one can dispute. It was the prayer of Jesus;�'Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as in heaven.' It was the establishing of a kingdom among men that should embody the divine element of repentance and forgiveness. In this progressive work the spiritual faculty of man was stimulated to move into a higher and purer element, and this change has been beautifully and forcibly held up to our view through the practical righteousness which Jesus has taught. 'Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God,' and 'the pure in heart for they shall see God.' Men were to become brethren and learn to do unto others as they would that others should do unto them. This was the higher law of life, the great and good law for humanity. The testimony of Jesus condemns even the manifestation of anger, and FEBRUARY, no less that of slander. The very thoughts were to be under the discipline of advanced law, and through this remoulding of the individual, the Christ life was to be manifested. The disciples and apostles accepted these truths and presented them fully and plainly to the children of this world, and it is these same great truths that have ever been struggling to be recognized as messengers for the d liveranee of man. Witnesses for freedom of thought as well as for religious liberty have arisen from time to time and delivered their testimony as they were able, in favor of righteousness and against the �ins of the world. During those long, dark ages when the consciences of men were bound by ecclesiastical bigotry, many faithful witnesses for the word of God, testified against the dominant rule of an antichristian order and look! forward to a new day of spiritual light. It matters not that they have been denominate;! schismatics and heretics, their lives of self-sacrifice for the promulgation of the principles of truth and for the good of humanity are known and are on recoixl in their favor. In France the Albigenses were ridiculed as the pure and the Beghards as those who cry for mercy. In the caves of the earth, in the depths of the wlderness and in the privacy of the chamber, these despised outlaws cried day and night for the blessings of the son of God to be with them. As long ami as fearful as the night may have been, the anticipated morning of their deliverance was hailed at last. The Friends or Quakers were the last witnesses that suffered persecution unto death in consequence of their testimony before the world. A spirit of protection and toleration had so grown in the minds of men that religious persecution through sectarianism, creedal power, churchal authority and religious bigotry, had in part, lost its power. Through these humble and faithful Christians, the light from God has made its manifestation upon the earth and been the guiding star to many weary pilgrims, into the light of a pure, Christian element. As the love for religious freedom began to claim the attention of reasonable and progressive minds, revivals of the Pentecostal season were witnessed in many parts of the country of France and Germany and more or less throughout all Europe. Among those who had accepted this revelation of divine light was a large class of zealously, devoted minds, soldiers of the cross of Christ, and souls gifted in the spirit of prophecy. Like the Baptist at the river Jordan, they warned the people of an approaching day of God's power. 'Amend your lives, repent ye, the end of all things draws nigh.' Their cries were for mercy, for their own order, and then for the world. This was the voice of God to the children of men. It past from country to country, and from city to city and entered England about the year 1706. Here it was the means of a great awakening and many were baptized into the spirit of a new life. During the year 1747 a small body of these people who had been recipients of the divine Spirit, were led to form themselves into a society under the ministry of James and Jane Wardley, of Manchester, England. These leaders were sincerely devoted to the cause of truth, and were most signally blest with manifestations of spiritual light. 'They possest great meekness and were very plain in their apparel, and unassuming in their manners.' Their testimony was like that of the primitive Christians, as they, through visions and revelation, testified that Christ, the anointed Savior, was at hand and that the Church was rising in its full glory and would increase till every divine promise was fulfilled. It was the outpouring of the holy Spirit upon honest, prayerful souls. The public devotion of the Society was in diverse operations of the power of God according as they were imprest at the time. Silent meditation for an hour was not uncommon. At other times they exercised in violent shakings, then changed to singing, dancing, shouting or walking the floor. Sometimes they would pass and repass each other like clouds driven by a strong wind, and from these exercises the people received the name of Shakers. To this little band of worshipers it wras the manifestation which God had promist by the prophets;�'Yet it is a little while and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.'�Hag. ii., 6, and hence the name Shakers was very appropriate although given in derision. The Society, however, at a subsequent date, arranged a name by which they wisht to be known and which was illustrative of their religious calling, 'The United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing.' In 1758, Ann Lee accepted the testimony of these people and was baptized with them into the same inspiration that gave life to their gospel mission. The religious light of the order had led them to an honest confession of every sin, and to the bearing of a full cross against that which they knew to be wrong. This work continued to increase in divine power until the year 1770, when the present testimony of eternal life was preacht by the special revelation of God, through Ann Lee, who was at this time acknowledged by the Society as their spiritual Mother in Christ, and has ever been called by the Believers since that date, 'Mother Ann.' * Ann Lee was born on the 29th of February, 1736, in Manchester, England. 'The powers of her mind were remarkable, and under the operation of the holy Spirit, she appeared divinely beautiful. At an early age, she was peculiarly favored with religious impressions, and often a witness of heavenly visions.' Mother Ann and her people, like all other true witnesses of God were rejected by an unbelieving world. They were clast among the false proph*For a more extended notice, see 'Life of Mother Ann Lee.'

Their houses afforded them but slight protection, as the lawless mob assaulted them with clubs and stones, breaking the doors and windows and shamefully abusing the Brethren and Sisters. The last imprisonment of the Believers in England, was under the pretense of a profanation of the Sabbath. This appeared to be a concerted plan of the enemies of Christ to prevent Mother Ann and her little family from worshiping God on that day. A number of spies had been placed in the streets under the pretense of preventing the people from profaning the Lord's day. The Believers assembled that morning at the house of John Lee and began their worship as usual. The spies gave the alarm and a mob was soon raised, directed by the principal warden. They surrounded the building, burst open the doors and past to an upper story where the Believers had assembled. The whole company were arrested and inhumanly dragged from the house and thrown into prison. All, however, were set free the next morning except Mother Ann, who was held under arrest for several weeks. In 1774, Mother Ann received a special revelation of God to repair to America, at the same time, receiving1 the divine promise that the spiritual work would be blest with a great increase. This revelation was placed before the Society and permission was given to all who were able, to accompany her. Those who became the companions of Mother Ann on this voyage, were William Lee, James Whittaker, John Hocknell, Richard Hocknell, Abram Stanley, James Shepard, Mary Partington and Nancy Lee. This little company of Believers left Liverpool, England on the 19th of May, 1774 and after enduring the storms and dangers of the great ocean, in an unseaworthy ship, they reached New York on the 6th of August following. In America,, Mother Ann and her band of followers suffered many privations. For two years, they were obliged to find employment in different places, as they were not able to move to their anticipated home in the wilderness of Niskeyuna, till the month of Sept. 1776, when they took up their residence in the town of Watervliet, about seven miles N. W. from the city of Albany. In this place they toiled industriously for a temporal support and' through agonizing prayers, offered up their devotions to God for the opening of the testimony of the cross of Christ. At this time, the whole country was involved in the war of the Revolution, and all persons coming from England, were lookt upon with suspicion and the charge of treason was publicly preferred against them, which resulted in the imprisonment of Mother Ann and several others of the family in the old fort in Albany. An attempt was subsequently made to banish Mother Ann to the British army. Failing to ac- complish their object in this, she was imprisoned in the jail at Poughkeepsie, but subsequently released by order of Gov. Clinton of N. Y. While engaged in divine service, the Believers proclaimed a strong testimony against all sin, and through the gifts of the spirit, manifested the most convincing proofs of a pure and living work of God. In the spring of 1780, large numbers of people visited Mother Ann and the Elders, to hear of the new and living word, and to witness the operations of divine power among them. Mother Ann Lee and Father William Lee, died in the year 1784, and Father James Whittaker in 1787. During this progressive, religious work that had been conducted by the Believers since their arrival in America, a preparation had been going forward, the consummation of which, would be the formation of societies, based on the principles of united inheritance and separation from the world, and like the Apostolic church, all their interests would be in common, and consecrated to religious purposes. The first society was formed at New Lebanon, N. Y. in the year 1787, and has from that date, been denominated the parent Society of the Order. Persons from almost every religious denomination, embraced the faith and accepted the cross of Christ. They were also afflicted with mockers and scoffers whose object was to seize every occasion to scandalize the work. Through good and evil report, the Elders workt faithfully to establish righteousness among the people. Communities may now be found in New Lebanon and Watervliet, N. Y., Hancock, Harvard and Shirley, Mass., Enfield, Conn., Canterbury and Enfield, N. H., Alfred and Gloucester, Maine, Union Village, White Water and Watervliet, Ohio, and Pleasant Hill and South Union, Ky. East Canterbury, N. H.
