THE SHAKER TO ITS READERS-GREETING With hopeful and happy greetings to universal humanity, The Shaker enters upon its sixth annual volume. Though returning to its original title, it would he understood to amplify rather than detract dual principles, in all things which the name Shaker and Sliakeress could imply. Advocating truths which have their foundation in the belief of God's duality and the duality of Christ, The Shaker will illustrate the fruits of such belief by the presentation to the world of a brotherhood and sisterhood in Christ, where impartiality of rights is fully prevailing — in a perfected Shaker organization. The present management take this early opportunity of bestowing unqualified approval and. commendation upon their earnest and faithful predecessors, who have been so long and favorably known within and without ' the household of faith,' as unflinching foes of error, and advocates of all that is pure and good ; who have so unselfishly labored for our little Monthly, that they have neglected duties demanded of them by the model organizations at whose heads they preside. Thanking them in behalf of humanity, we believe 'all the people will say, amen!' Elder F. W. Evans assumed control of The Shaker at 'a time which tried our souls' as by fire, and now that he feels the autumn of his life more real than ever, it seems happily opportune that we relieve him — than whom none could bo more loving, fatherly, nor more practically Christian. We crave his mantle. In the immediate future The Shaker will be conducted in behalf of the United Societies by G-. A. Lomas, as Editor, and N. A. Briggs as Publisher.
