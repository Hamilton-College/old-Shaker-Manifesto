CHURCH AND STATE I vert largely attribute the decline of religious interest in some directions to the interest which has been taken in the questions which naturally arise out of the adulterous connection at present existing between religion and the state in this land. We should never be satisfied until we stand upon an equal footing, all of us in matters of religion. An Established Church is an established tyranny. We wear upon our wrists each one of us, as dissenters, fetters that gall us worse than if they were made of steel. We have to support a church whose business it is to oppose the truth we try to preach ; we have to maintain an institution which tries to pull down that which we would be willing to die to maintain. Popery is this day paid for in this land; that which our fathers died and rotted in prison to put down, we have to contribute to support, and we cannot help feeling indignant — we should be less than men, certainly less than the sons of the Puritans who made the Cavaliers feel the strength of their right arms, if we do not feel in our souls that we cannot long submit to the tyranny which galls us every day. Down with it! Down with it 1 We will be free, as God lives. This question must be answered and settled once for all, and the sooner it is done with, the better; and we mean that it shall be done with, by God's help, ere long. — Mr. Spurgeon on the Disestablishment of the English Church
