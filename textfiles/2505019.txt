White Water, O. North Family. April, 1895. As the cold weather has abated and the warm sun is spreading its rays over our beautiful White Water valley, I thought a few home items might be of interest to our Gospel friends, both east and west. We are at the present time, planting our potatoes. Expect to plant about five acres. The cold weather has not injured our fruit crops as badly as we expected. I presume if we have no more heavy frosts, we may be blest with some fruit, which has been a failure for the past three years. Our good Sisters are very busy at our home cleaning house. The Bible teach- THE MANIFESTO. llo es, 'Cleanliness is next to Godliness,' and we believe it. What a blessing it is to the Brethren that they have kind and willing Sisters ever ready to beautify our gospel home and we know from past experience, that they are glad that there are good and faithful Brethren to help as this season of renovating and repairing comes round. Brother Charles Dixon, our herdsman is very active with the whitewash brush, and I presume when he gets through, we will hardly know our old place. May God bless every soul who is willing to help beautify and build up our gospel homes, both temporally and spiritually. On the 23rd of March we opened a pit of potatoes and found enough new ones there for a dinner for fifteen gi'own persons. I do not know whether our Florida Brethren can excel this or not. We of White Water extend our prayers and love to our gospel friends in Florida. Recently, I had the privilege of visiting at Union Village and enjoyed it very much. La Fayette Parker.
