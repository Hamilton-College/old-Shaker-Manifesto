We hope, that in every issue of The Shaker... We hope, that in every issue of The Shaker, there will appear evidences of what is true Shaker belief; so that none, getting hold of a stray copy, but may therein find something that will teach 'What any must do to be a Shaker.' A virgin celibacy : It is the life for Christians—the life of the heavens. Communion of interests : None rich ; none poor ; the whole comfortable. Bless, and curse not.' ' Resist not evil.' Separation from the world : From its loves, lusts ; from its bad and its good. Follow Jesus, the Christ, in our daily life. Natural inclinations prompt us otherwise ; make us believe it impossible, unnecessary. But the ' follow me' of Jesus means a life like his, —very unlike the ones our natural inclinations select—very unlike the life of the world.
