Physical hunger can only be satisfied by material food... Mary B. Sprague. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness. Matt, v., 6. Physical hunger can only be satisfied by material food. With the masses, this can be secured only by arduous labor. Such as have never suffered to obtain subsistence cannot feel the gratiude and appreciation experienced by those who pay the price with brain or muscle. Those who share an abundance in earthly possessions too often know nothing of the true soul satisfaction ; for the soul immortal even though cramped aud dwarfed by earthly conditions, asserts its need of spiritual sustenance. But they alone who hunger and thirst after righteousness, that is, after God, the knowledge of the truth pertaining to right living, 'ï¿½shall be filled.' Desires for worldly honor and riches should be subordinate to this prime object of seeking for righteousness. The promise of God to all who desi-e far something beyond self are very encouraging ; none need hesitate. 'Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find.' What we sincerely desire we usually seek with uninterrupted zeal until the coveted object is within our reach. Living in good society and having the knowledge of much truth will fail to perfect our lives in the beauty of holiness if we are self-satisfied and contented with our limited knowledge of God. We read that it is one of tin; most difficult tasks to keep the soul of man open to the iufinite and the smaller the' soul the more difficult the task. Blessed, indeed, are those who seek for spiritual life, for they are in a receptive condition and will surely be filled with goodness from Eternal sources. Canterbury, N. H.
