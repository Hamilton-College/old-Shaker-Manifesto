Shaker Village, N. H. Dec. 1881 S. Shaker Village, N. H. Dec. 1881 My Dear little L. I have just been reading the pretty letter you wrote me last Sunday in which you say you would like an answer. This is not strange, for your little sheet looked very nice, and for the care you took I love to give you a reply. Did you ever see any flowers like .the ones I send you with this letter? I think I hear you say.—'0, indeed, I have. A great many grow under the peach trees north of our house.' Don't you like to look into their little faces and see them laugh so sweetly? Ah, my little L.— laughing flowers are pretty but I think good and kind little children are much prettier, Don't you? I am glad you have such a good home. Give my kindest love to your dear teachers as well as to your companions, and remember, my child, that for you to be good and happy is the wish of all your friends. Good bye,
