Y. New England Magazine THE OLDEST HOUSE IN WASHINGTON. Down at the foot of Seventeenth Street, away from the usual route of the guidebook sightseer, stands the oldest house in Washington. The moss had grown thick upon its humble roof long before quarreling Congresses wrangled and disputed over the location of the future 'Federal City,' and when at last the dispute was ended, and a definite site selected, it was found that the unpretentious home and paternal acres of a sturdy old Scotchman, David Burns by name, occupied a large portion of the proposed situation. The homestead itself was located almost upon the immediate bank of the Potomac, here a mile or more in width, and only a little distance away from the beautiful hill upon which the Observatory now stands� the hill upon which, it is related, Braddock's forces camped on their first night out from Alexandria, in that ill-starred march into the wilderness.�From 'The Oldest House in Washington,' by Milton T. Adkins, in New England Magazine for May.
