CROWN ETERNAL Words Selected. O. W. Pillsbury 1. On the brow of mighty monarchs May sparkle many a gem, 2. Proud were the mighty conquerers Crowned in Olympic games; 3. With a harp of angel melody And a palm branch in his hand, And gold and pearls and jewels May deck the diadem. They deemed that deathless honors Were entwined around their names, The saint 'mid circling spirits Round the golden throne shall stand. But it shines with earthly lustre, It will tarnish and decay, But sere was soon the parsley wreath; The olive, and the bay, And his song shall be enduring As heaven's eternal day; But the Christian's crown of amaranth But the Christian's crown of amaranth While his victor crown of amaranth Will never fade a way. Will never fade a way. Shall never fade a way.
