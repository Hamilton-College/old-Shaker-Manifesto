SPRING. By Lucy S. Bowers. Behold the passing of the sparkling snows! The silent dimming of its crystal bright; The pleasant coming of the vernal light; The gentle lulling of the -wind that blows, And hear the murmur of the stream that flows. List to the matinee from tree top's height,� ' Sweet, happy echoes of a true delight� All kind adieus to winter as lie goes. Behold the matchless slemior of the skies, And rivaling beauties of the earth beneath; The thousand tender leaves and buds that rise To twine for lovely Spring u flower wreath. The sombre months are friends but in disguise Which in their generous wills glad joys bequeath. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
