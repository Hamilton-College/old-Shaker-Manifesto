Stephen Cleverly received a fine education... Stephen Cleverly received a fine education, through the kindness of his uncle, of Boston, Mass. He became a merchant and was very successful in his business. Stephen often called at our house, as we had long been intimate friends, aud while speaking of a law suit, soon to be brought forward, he remarked, 'You need not fear, you will get the case. The wicked cannot prosper. They will try to afflict and do all they can to overthrow the work of the gospel, but they cannot do it. No weapon formed against you can prosper.' I said to him, Stephen you have faith in the mission of Christ, why do you not obey it? 'I have faith,' said he, 'and I should have obeyed it. I have seen and conversed with your Mother Ann.' 1 then asked him to relate his interview with Mother Ann and thï¿½ Elders, which he did as follows : '' Some of my companions came to me aud wanted I should go with them to see Mother Aun and confound her. On account of my advantages for a good education they thought I could do it. Mother, aud the Elders received us very kindly, and we were soon engaged in conversation. Mother Ann spoke of the evils that were abroad in the world. Some philosophers, said I, think that what people call evil, is real goodness. Mother Ann then referred to some of the sins that abounded in the world, and said, 'Are not these, evils?' I soon found that I could not obtain the least advantage and was glad, to excuse myself and leave the place. At the time of this interview I obtained faith in the life of Christ, but as I was a young merchant I did not wish to forsake the worldly prospect before me, nor to turn away from my young companions.'
