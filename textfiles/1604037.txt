From the Little Children. LOYE. The Bible says 'God is love' so if I would seek this power of love I must first know who God is. We often say we will love our little mates, now the most effectual way in which we can show our love, I think, is through obedience and kindness to each other. The Bible says, ' Love your enemies' you may ask, how shall we love our enemies? I answer simply, be kind and obliging to them and do your best at all times. N. E.
