SELF-LOVE Oh, I could go through all life's troubles singing, Turning earth's night to day, If self were not so fast around me, clinging To all I do or say. My very thoughts are selfish, always building Mean castles in the air ; I use my love for others for a gilding To make myself look fair. I fancy all the world engrossed with judging My merit or my blame ; Its warmest praise seems an ungracious grudging Of praise which I mightf claim. In youth, or age, by city, wood, or mountain, Self is forgotten never ; Wlier'er we tread, it gushes like a fountain, Its waters now forever. 0 miserable omnipresence, stretching Over all time and space, How have I run from thee, yet found thee reaching The goal in every race. Inevitable self ! vile imitation Of universal light,â€” Within our hearts a dreadful usurpation Of God's exclusive right!
