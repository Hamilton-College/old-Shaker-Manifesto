CREDIT TO 'WHOM CREDIT IS DUE When we think there is no,t one minister of tiie Jonathan Edwards' school, that preaches theology just as severely as he did ; no Presbyterian who is a complete copyist of Calvin; that Luther could find no perfect imitator to-day, and that the entire religious world is much more liberal now than ever before ; so much so, that there is scarcely one who preaches to-day, but would have forfeited his life 150 years ago ; then can we well afford to render to Thomas Paine some credit, for it is surely due. His crimes were a disbelief in the Bible as a revelation from Godâ€”plenarily inspired; and he denied the divinity of Jesus. Yet he said : 'The world is my home ; to do good is my religion ;' 'No man should make a living by preach- ing;' 'One good school-master is worth more than a hundred priests!' He abjured shedding blood ; and hated any god that commanded it. His opinion of Jesus was 'that he was a sincere man ; that the morality which he practiced, was of the most lofty and pure character, and that he had never been exceeded by any mortal man!' Again: 'Any system of religion that has anything in it, that shocks the mind of a child, is not a true system.'
