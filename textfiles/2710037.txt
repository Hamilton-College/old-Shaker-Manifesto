Humanity No. 2 Humanity No. 2, for August and September has made its long anticipated visit and A. J. Utley has an extended article on 'Seignorage.' The coinage and the value of gold and silver, before and after its coinage seems to be the burden of his article. F. S. W. is evidently of a religious turn of mind and has actually ten commandments after the order of his own mind. One writer has a poetic article on Hï¿½1 and another on the story of the creation but the story of Jonah being illustrated according to life is very interesting. Other valuable articles may be found in the same number. Publisht at Kansas City, Mo.
