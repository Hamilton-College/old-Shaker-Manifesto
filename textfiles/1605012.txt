Among some old manuscripts... Among some old manuscripts, we find the following from the pen of David Parker, addressed to his companions, in age, at a time, when considerable attention was being given to the study of Letter writing; at the close of a school taught by Bro. Seth Wells, of Mt, Lebanon, N. Y. We publish the article for its own merits, and for the pleasure it may confer upon many of Bro. David's friends. Shaker Village, N. H. Mar. 1833. Beloved Companions ;- -Having been called to associate with you in your literary productions for a few weeks past, and as the time has nearly closed which has been allotted us for the present, to improve in penmanship and in the writing of letters, you will naturally expect something from me on the eve of our departure. Such a variety of sentiments and subjects, press upon my mind, that I hardly know upon which theme to touch ; yet I cannot consistently refrain from saying a few words ou two very serious and important matters ; although I do not aspire to an elaborate discussion or rhetorical explanation of either ; but simply to express my own views. At the close of Br. Seth's school here, he spared no pains to impress upon our minds and inculcate in our hearts, the necessity of obedience to gospel principles. His remarks were such as should excite our warmest admiration. To me they have afforded much consolation. If we receive them, as we ought, and award them the attention they deserve, much good we shall derive therefrom. There is another heavenly virtue, embodied in our sacred structure, to which I would call your particular attention ; viz. Union. By this is our compact linked together ; and the whole Church of Christ is based upon this foundation. Many, within my knowledge, have undertaken to get along in their own way, to be out of union, considering the principle of minor importance. I have always noticed the failure of such individ-. uals to become true members of the Church of Christ. While those who have entered by the straight gate, carefully yielding obedience and maintaining a*gospel union, have always found blessing and prosperity. We ought, as a people to be united, to be peacemakers, to cultivate union with each other in all things. Never let any hard feelings, or disunion arise among ourselves, but be kind one to another; and above all should we yield obedience to those placed as Elders and leaders in the Church of Christ. As young Brethren and Sisters let us show them that courtesy, attention and respect, becoming our age, and their situation. We are amenable to them ; and they are responsible agents in our behalf, and are amenable to a power that is above us all. Union and harmony must prevail among all the members of this consecrated compact, else it cannot exist. Are we aspiring for places of care and responsibility ? Let us remember that we are first to become as clay in the hands of the potter ; willing to be molded and fitted to any shape or pattern, which will render the most acceptable service in the House of God. We must walk in the Way of God as our souls have been blest to understand it. Let our enlightened consciences be our guide. Let us consider how short and transient are the things of time compared to Eternity ; and what shall we be advantaged though we may gain the whole world and lose our own souls ? None of us regret the little progress which we have made heavenward ; but feel thankful for the measure of justification which we realize. Let us press onward for the prize. We all know where we can do the most good, and be the most serviceable and an honor to ourselves in the gospel. 1 have been so situated in life as to be placed in contact with all classes of people, and have had perhaps, severer trials of my faith than any of you. I have been offered all the alluring pleasures and indulgencies that this world can give, if I would retract my purpose and abandon my faith. Every temptation has been presented that could impede my progress and overshadow my soul; but I have always been determined to be honest and upright; and feel thankful that I have not been swayed nor enticed. All the flattering prospects the world can present, are but temporary, and compared to the nobler purpose of the selfdenying Christian, are but a phantom. Our gospel home affords us every blessing ; not among the least of these is that of an approving conscience. We have had a peculiar privilege, the past winter to gain information We have felt the union and approval of the Ministry, Elders, and our older Brethren and Sisters. We have received at their hands ihe most valuable instructions and wisest counsels. They have spared no pains to instill into our minds and to implant in our souls the principles of the gospel. They now look to us, as heirs apparent, to their inheritance ; and hope to feel a dependence on us that the gospel transmitted to us may be handed down to our posterity, in its original purity. They feel greatly interested in our prosperity and welfare. We see them dropping away, one by one, like shocks of corn fully ripe. Ere long they will all be gone leaving us and our successors, as stewards in the household of faith. On our faithfulness and obedience depend our justification. Are we prepared to take upon ourselves the important trusts which ere long must be committed to the rising generation? Is our faith planted in the right soil? Are we confident that the world can never overcome us? Shall it be said of us that yet another class must come in and take our birthrights? Shall we not all unite and be upright and faithful? Or shall one or two of us be left to bear the burdens alone? I cannot believe this for within reach of my voice, are quite a number of young companions endowed with faculties, which, if rightly improved will do honor to the gospel. My dear companions, this is probably the last time, we shall convene together, at present, for instruction. I therefore embrace the privilege to ask for your prayers in my behalf that I may yet be saved. As we separate take with you my most fervent prayer for your welfare for I sincerely desire your happiness and prosperity ; and trust that when the Summer is past and the harvest ended, we may receive the reward of our labors,ï¿½A crown of everlasting life. Your brother in Christ, David Parker.
