West Pittsfield, Mass. Dec. 1885 Our esteemed Manifesto :—We have often wished, for months past, to greet you with encouraging expressions ; but for reasons (we do not like to tell you just yet,) we have failed to respond to our promptings. There is an adage, something like this, that 'Manas he grows older, grows wiser and better. ' This is true in some cases with both men and women. But we are about to adapt this saying to you THE MANIFESTO. 11 dear Manifesto, thinking it can well be applied. You come to us every month promptly, and every time laden with something worthy our thought, consideration and attention. We find you maintaining the beautiful spirit of humility and peace. This spirit, we realize, every religious reader is pleased with and will recommend. We would like here to notice, and make mention of the many good and spiritually inspiring articles you have given us within the year from dear Brethren and Sisters, as well as worthy selec- tions from other auth . Here is an opportunity for sacrifice, and we must try and be brief, knowing your love and necessity for this element,—brevity. We cannot do much but render praise, and our hearty thanks to your contributors both aged and youth—all who have worked in the least for yovir and our interest, and in behalf of those who do not understand the 'Way. ' Your testimony has been calculated to point to religion 'pure and undefiled,' full ol heavenly virtue. In Feb. No. (1885) Sister N. G. Danforth describes the ' Way, the Truth and the Life ;'' and then says, ' in this way we crucify self. ' When this is accomplished we have no inclination to follow any other course. Then shall we be filled with all the fullness of love, and inherit the reward of sweet peace when we have come to our heavenly Parentage not by believing merely, but by actually living, the 'Way, the Truth and the Life. ' The intelligent mind can see how that by cultivating the higher and more spiritual part of the garden of the soul, the noxious and foul weeds must wither and die out. These latter, Jesus said, 'The Father hath not planted. ' All may be sure then that He will never recoguize or tolerate them. We must just mention those wise sayings occasionally inserted by our well tried sister H. H. ' Such as abide in the light, no power can harm them. ' And then those verses and short poems by dear sister M. W. so often filling up your spaces give evidence and manifest the interest and soul activity of such as have lived ' unspotted before the world.' It is good for us to contemplate how these have made themselves white by coming up through tribulation and risen above the 'earth earthy,' by living the 'pure virgin life.' Others we would like to notice who have added to your wealth and ornament for the special benefit and better understanding of your readers, of the Way and the Life of principles which hold the saving power. Now dear Manifesto we dare not, must not, will not fail of accepting the ' Good Word' you have brought from time to time ; for in this we have a surety of being partakers of the 'Powers of the world to come.' We will not engage your attention but a few moments more. We have perused all your 'Notes' with pleasure and pronounced them good and for the interest of the people of all lands. Time has passed away so swiftly that we cannot recall your age, but we know you are somewhat advanced in years, possibly you will tell us sometime how old you are, at least how old you 'think you are.' The passing year and your labors and kindly visits during its continuance are nearing the end ; we again say, thanks for all your toil. And we wish that the New Year so close at hand may open 12 THE MANIFESTO. upon you and all Christian co-workers with manifold blessings. May they have clear vision and behold the prospect of the glorious reward promised to such as endure and prove faithful to the end. Kindly adieu, Betsey Johnson
