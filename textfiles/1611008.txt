In Memory of Elder Benjamin Dunlavy, of Pleasant Hill, Kentucky. BY F. M. SCARBROUGH. Died on the field of battle In conflict with the foe. The field o'er which the angels, Are flying to and fro. Xo foeman's hand hath smote thee A soldier true and grand. Whose battle-cry has been, For God's Home and Native Land. But the brave heart was weary. God saw he needed rest, And sent a bright winged angel To call him to his breast. The loved disciple long ago Leaned there and knew his peace. And the brave toil worn soldier Has gained a sweet release. A wail of bitter mourning, From myriads doth rise. But it cannot drown the peans Of welcome from the skies. To him that overcometh, This is the strain they sing. He shall have power forever In the city of our King. And the many he has rescued Shall join the loud acclaim, And bless him for the work he wrought Tn the Redeemer's name. Groveland, N. Y.
