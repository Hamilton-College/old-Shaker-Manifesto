WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO. EXPERIENCE. We learn our lessons as we go along. Each rising day a new experience opes. As we go forth with mingled fears and hopes, To plod our weary ways amid the throng, Unmindful of the burdens of the day. But often r.id the struggle and the heat Of life's great battle, Failure and Defeat, The giant enemies of Purpose strong, Are sure to rise defiant in the way, And then, unless by Right we quell the [Wrong, And triumph,-ah! we make the sad mistake. So we will march right onward; let our song Be Faith and Courage ; and this counsel take, To learn our lessons as we go along.
