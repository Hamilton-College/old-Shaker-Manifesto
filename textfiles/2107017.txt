Hancock, Mass. June 12, 1891. Dear Editorï¿½There seems to be nothing note-worthy in our locality at the present time. Most of our family are in usual health. We are endeavoring to brighten up the interior of our buildings a little, by the use of paint. Have also a good opportunity to contemplate the beauties of nature with which we are surrounded. The maple trees which line the street also are robed in beauty. The blackberry bushes, planted by our venerable Elder, are in full bloom and present a charming appearance. We are pleased to learn that a company of our Gospel friends from Enfield, 'N. H. contemplate journeying hither. A cordial welcome is extended them in advance. The Teachers of our County held their annual convention on the 29th. ult., which had a large attendance and was very interesting. Oats and other crops are looking tolerably fair, but are somewhat affected by the drought. Fruit is doing well. J. L. S.
