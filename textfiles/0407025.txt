GROWTH OF THE SOUL The soul's capacity for growth, and its longings for something higher and more enduring than earth can give, is a subject that has engrossed the attention of mankind, and should continue to claim deep and earnest thought. The soul is often spoken of as a vessel that may be filled with wisdom and virtue, and vice versa. Some have thought that view conveyed the idea of limitation to the soul's advancement, in contradistinction to the sublime truth of eternal progression in knowledge and goodness, and that it would have a tendency to check the aspirations for growth and improvement. But shall we not conclude, that if the vessel is the soul, then the vessel expands from time to time and makes room for more, and still more. The mind of a little child may be fully occupied to-day, but its unfolding life capacitates it for increased receptivity tomorrow. If spirit existence and progression are to be represented by material things, I would select the fairest type of seed that can be found in the vegetable kingdom, which contains within itself the germs of future life and unfoldment. In each seed, within its tender rind, Where golden threads in endless circles wind, Maze within maze, the shining web is rolled. And as they burst, the living germs unfold. In the material world, the germ exhausts itself in growth; but the spirit is ever increasing its capacity and gaining more strength and vigor, being watered by the dews of a perpetual spring, and the soul is continually putting forth new branches and forms of beauty. There is an innate desire in every intelligent soul to grow and to rise into higher conditions. As a child aspires to manhood, so does man seek a broader, wider range of thought, and to enlarge his sphere of action. Florence Martin, Union Village, O.
