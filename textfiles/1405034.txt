HOW COLDS ARE TAKEN. A person in good health, with fair play, says the Lancet, easily resists cold. But when the health nags a little, and liberties are taken with the stomach or nervous system, a chill is easily taken, and according to the weak spot of the individual, assumes the form of a cold, or pneumonia, or, it may be, jaundice. Of all causes of ' cold, ' probably fatigue is one of the most efficient. A jaded man coming home at night from a longday's work, a growing youth losing two hours' sleep over evening parties two or three times a week, or a young lady heavily ' doing the season, ' young children over-fed and with a short allowance of sleep, are common instanees of the victims of ' cold. ' Luxury is favorable to chill-taking; very hot rooms, soft ehairs, feather-beds, create a sensitiveness that leads to catarrhs. It is not after all, the ' cold ' that is so much to be feared as the antecedent conditions that give the attack a ehance of doing harm. Some of the worst ' colds ' happen to those who do not leave their house or even their bed ; and those who are most invulnerable are often those who are most exposed to changes of temperature, and who by good sleep, cold bathing, and regular habits preserve the tone of their nervous system and circulation. Probably many chills are contracted at night or at the fag-end of the day, when tired people get the equilibrium of their circulation disturbed by either over-heated sitting rooms or under-heated bed rooms and beds. This is specially the ease with elderly people. In such cases the mischief is not always done instantaneously, or in a single night. It often takes place insiduousty, extending over days or even weeks. It thus appears that ' taking cold ' is not by any means a simple result of a lower temperature, but depends largely on personal conditions and habits, affecting espeeially the nervous and muscular energy of the bodv.
