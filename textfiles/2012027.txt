Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Elder Henry :�-The eventful year of 1890, calls for our notes, both the cheerful and the solemn ones, for the last time. It is with thanksgiving and reconciliation for the manifold blessings, which its checkered pages have presented, that we hail you with as much pleasure as at the opening of this volume of time. Good Old Year of 1890! We may never see one just like you, but the good we have gained, the wisdom we have gleaned from your fields of experience are ours for possession and profit, and we say, rest with the honored manuscripts of past chronicles. Our score is settled; we have had our digressions and progressions, secessions and accessions ; we have seen the fair prove false, and the false acknowledge the blessings of truth. At this juncture we quote for your comfort and ours, 'Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world,'�self. Have we not proved that we already had faith to believe that the righteous are never forsaken nor the faithful left to beg his bread? that 'Underneath all the trials which bear us along, Are the 'Arms everlasting,' so tender and strong?' With the deep sense of our obligations and preparations for the New Year, we desire first and best, to give our attention to the sacred duties, as expressed in a piece of music recently sung to us :� 'The spirit is calling, earnestly calling, 'O Zion, unfold in deep prayer. O pray for the fathers, the sisters and brothers, O pray for the whole household; O pray for the mothers, remember all others, O pray for the whole, whole world 1''
