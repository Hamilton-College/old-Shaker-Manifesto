EARLY AGRICULTURE Hartlib, the friend of Milton, pensioned by Cromwell for his agricultural writings, says, that old men in his days remembered the first gardeners that came over to Surrey, and sold turnips, carrots, parsnips, early peas, and rape which were then great rarities, being imported from Holland. Cherries and hops were first planted, he says, in the reign of Henry VIII; artichokes and currants made their appearance in the time of Elizabeth ; but even at the end of this latter period we had cherries from Flanders ; onions, saffrons, and liquorice from Spain ; and hops from the Low Countries. Potatoes, which were first known in these islands at about the year 1536, continued for nearly a century to be cultivated in gardens as a curious exotic, and furnished a luxury only for tables of the richest persons in the kingdom.
