COMPENSATION. By Sarah F. Bodine. The seed implanted in the earth Unfolds and reaches toward the light, Soon stem and leaves of emerald green Reveal their beauty to our sight; Then blossoms of the richest hue Exhale sweet perfume day and night. But ah, too soon the fair sweet life Yields to the chilling touch of death, And petals that were fresh and bright Lie scattered by each passing breath. The loss of fragrant living bloom Portrays a law all grand and true, 'Tis from the ashes of the old Another life is brought to view ; And thus our hearts are always cheered With blossoms ever fresh and new.
