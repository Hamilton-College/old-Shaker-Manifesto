THE ASCENDING GRADE Humanity, before the Germ of Divinity, our birthright inheritance, germinates, is opake. When the germ sprouts—aspires to higher plane—that soul enters the nebulous period. When, guided by hand unseen, we reach the true altar of sacrifice and thoroughly do our first work, we become translucent. When, by indomitable self-control, our every thought is squared by our divinest ideal, we enter the transparent—the Sun of Righteousness shines through us clear as crystal— no adverse winds can tip us off our balance, whether in, or out of the earthly house, we are Seraphim and Cherubim of the more advanced heavens. Amen.
