Shakers, N.Y. North. Family. Feb. 1893. The last of January brought the much wished for snow, not so much as we would like, but enough so that we can haul our fire wood on runners which is easier for man and beast. It may not be possible for the lesser to bless the better but we can pray for them. And at the present time our prayer is, Heavenly Father, and Mother, may thy angels of power and comfort strengthen and bless those who are walking in tribulation to uphold the standard of the higher life and maintain in its integrity, our virgin Communal relation. My dear, young, gospel companions, let us hold up their hands and without fear nor doubting believe that the cause for which we have given our lives will not be suffered to fall to the ground. Jack Frost has been doing quite effective work, from the number of water-pipes upon which he has laid his icy grip. The ground is frozen over three feet. Those THE MANIFESTO. 71 who have resided here many years, tell us that they have not for some years seen the springs and streams so low as at present and so closely ice-bound; but it will be spring by and by and the birds and flowers will compensate for it all. We will patiently wait. Hamilton DeGraw.
