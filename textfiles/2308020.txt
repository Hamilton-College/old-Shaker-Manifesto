Pleasant Hill, Ky. July, 1893. Beloved Elder Henry:�I have been looking over various numbers of the Manifesto to-day. What a fount of heavenly virtues beams forth from the pens of our inspired ancient worthies! There I find our gifted Elders, F. W. Evans, H. L. Eads, G. B. Avery, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, and scores of others beautifully illustrating the sublime teachings and example of those self-sacrificing, devoted souls, who received and kept the gospel in its purity in days gone by. I always hail with joy the Manifesto 194 THE MANIFESTO. so fraught with precious truths. O, for a score of Brs. like Isaac Anstatt and truthful sayings so bravely proclaimed. We are a little band away out here in a region called the 'dark and bloody ground;' toiling and struggling with foes within and without; intermingling with the world, dependent on them for aid in our daily toil. ''Oh! what will .the harvest be?' Communities have sinned and strayed (in many things) from the true fundamental principles of the faith, therefore, few in numbers and works. Though like the Xinevites we sometimes cry out,�''Where are the hundreds and thousands that were to flock to Zion for the food of eternal life?' From early childhood we have watched and waited, and still the vision tarries. And, where rests the responsibility? A certain inquirer, visiting us once, said, 'If the testimony you put forth was strictly lived to, people would fall before you like grass before the scythe.' What a responsibility is resting upon the subjects of this faith! All praise and honor to your faithful heart and toiling hands, in keeping afloat the highly prized Manifesto. May your days be long and blissful. I was so impressed with the article of Br. Isaac Anstatt, that I felt like making a faint effort to add to your columns a few lines. We are having very warm and stormy weather. Our fruit about half a crop, meadows and grain fine. Kavcy L. Rupe.
