DUTY TO GOD [The following recitation was given before the Brethren and Sisters of the Church Family, by the several individuals whose names it bears. Ed.] DUTY TO GOD J. E. My dear companions ; As we have been interested reading the Scriptures for a further comprehension of our ' Duty to God,' let us enumerate some of the many texts we find relating to this subject. First, We are commanded to fear God. M. K. Obey Him. L. F. Wait upon the Lord. E. F. Trust in God. L. S. Hold communion with God. L. D. Hope in God. I. F. Rejoice in the Lord. J. E. Love God. M. K. Praise Him. L. S. Confess to Him. J. E. Pray to Him. J. E. The good book teaches that 'the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. ' M. K. 'The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him, and He will shew unto them his covenant. ' 'And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels, and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. ' L. F. ' We are to wait upon the Lord, therefore turn thou to thy God; keep mercy and judgment, and wait oil thy God continually. ' They that wait upon the Lord, they that wait upon the Lord, shall re - new their strength, shall re new their strength ; They shall mount up with wings us eagles, They shall, mount up with wings as eagles They shall run and not be They shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint. weary, They shall run and not be weary, They shall run and not be weary, They shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint. E. F. 'Be of good courage and L. F. Rejoice in the Lord 'Glory He shall strengthen your heart, all ye j ye in his holy name; let the hearth of that hope in the Lord.' 'Let Israel j them rejoice that seek the Lord.' hope in the Lord from henceforth and;' Serve the Lord with gladness, come forever. ' before his presence with singing.' MF Sing, O daughter of Zion; Shout, O Israel; Be glad and rejoice with all thy heart, O FF P daughter of Jerusalem, Glory ye in his holy name. Let the heart of them re -joice that Soprano. Alto. Soprano. seek the Lord, And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And, declare his Alto. Sop. Alto. FF works with rejoicing, Declare his works with rejoicing, rejoicing, rejoicing, rejoicing. J. E. The first and greatest commandment is this, ' Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. ' ' If a man love me, said Jesus, he will keep my Avords. ' In Prov. we read, ' I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me. ' I. F. Jesus said; 'He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. ' J. E. It is written, ' Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.' O Love the Lord, all ye saints, For the Lord preserveth the faithful; I will love thee, O Lord my strength. I. F. 'He that covereth his sins shall not prosper ; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. ' ' He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. ' M. K. ' If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. ' L. S. 'Beloved, if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask we receive of Him, because we keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight. ' E. F. Prayer to God. 'Seekyethe Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near. Watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation.' I. F. ' For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him thatknocketh it shall be opened. ' J. E. After this manner therefore, pray ye ; 'Our Father, which art in Heaven, L. F. Hallowed be Thy name. L. S. Thy kingdom come. L.D. Give us this day our daily bread. E. F. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. J. E. And leave us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, All. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.' J. E. The Scriptural examples of prayer, have, most of them, an unutterable intensity. They are pictures of struggles in which more of suppressed desire i� hinted, than that which is expressed. Recall the Avrestling of Jacob, ' I will not let thee go, except thou bless me :' and the strong crying and tears of M. K. Thy will be done on earth as j our Lord�' If it be possible�if it be it is in Heaven. possible ! ' ntt. Let all the earth fear the Lord, let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him, For his mercy is on them that fear Him, from generation to generation. E. F. Let us hear the- conclusion of the whole matter. All. ' Fear God, and keep his corn mandments, for this is the whole duty of man.' Canterbury, N. H.
