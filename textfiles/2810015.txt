CHARITY. By Sinter Mary Whitcher. My soul hath a secret I'll keep it secure. That if coolly treated The same I'll endure. And never repeat it In one mortal ear, With God rather leave it Who only should hear. No malice I'll harbor In view of the same, No sadness shall cover My brow with its claim. But onward in duty My steps shall proceed, Beholding but beauty And working for need. East Canterbury, N. H.
