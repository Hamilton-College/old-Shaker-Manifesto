THE BY AND BY E. T. LEGGETT What glowing hopes await the by and by Whose mystic shadows fall across our way; That star of promise in the dreamland sky Toward which our hearts go upward night and day. How good we'll bยง, and happy, by and by; How easy to be good, when all below To 'Paradise Restored,' and all on high A fountain, from which living waters flow. When youth's hot blood thrills through our veins no more; And hearts beat but to music of the spheres; Grace shall the bloom of innocence restore, And faith and smiles supplant our doubts and tears. But when that bright to-morrow of our prayer, Shall, with its fortunes, to the past belong, How many treasured hopes, then buried there, Shall form the burden of our future song. The cloud-capped mountains that afar off glow, Like golden islands in some distant sphere, When magic lifts the veil, but fields of snow And jagged peaks, 'mid frozen wastes appear. Thus distance paints, with colors all its own, Each rugged wild of nature's solitude; And builds a heaven in each misty zone Where love ne'er tempted angel to intrude. The golden hours, the seasons as they roll, Are richly stored with happiness and love, To build an Eden in each living soul, And consecrate it to the courts above. But make the present bright, the future then No fancy ever pictured half so fair; Then hope shall fold her wearied wings again, And, back to earth, find her true heaven there.
