Cure for Deafness Some time ago an old lady recommended the use of heated hoi's oil dropping it into the ear internally one or more times daily, and above all to persevere in its use, and it would certainly help me. This simple remedy I have faithfully employed, and I now hear as well as I ever did in my life. This oil is very penetrating and in the case mentioned acted remedially by softening the indurated earwax, which is no doubt the cause of deafness in more instances than is generally supposed.
