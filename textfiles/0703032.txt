TO EXTIRPATE HOUSE INSECTS. —Take two pounds of alum and dissolve it in three or four quarts of boiling' water; let it stand on the fire till the alum disappears; then apply it with a brush while nearly boiling hot to every joint and crevice in your closets, bedsteads, pantry shelves and the like. Brush crevices in the floor of the skirting or mopboards, if you suspect they harbor vermin. — Phreti. Joicrnal.
