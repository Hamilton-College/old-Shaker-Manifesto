A GIFT FOR MOTHER'S DAY. Harvard, Feb . 1891. Dear Manifesto :ï¿½I wish to express my gratitude for what God has done for me. Praise to thee, blessed Mother Ann, for this good, great and glorious work which tkou hast done for all the children of this world ; to lead man back to his native purity, that he may, in deed and in truth, again become the noble representative of his God. That he may walk in uprightness and present to his Maker the offering of gratitude, praise and thanksgiving, with 'clean hands and a pure heart.' We praise thee for this soul-ennobling work in which thou hast marked out the path and led the way wherein the children of men may, by confession and repentance cleanse their spirits from all uncleanness, and become thy lovely sons and daughters. We praise thee for this glorious light and liberty, this sweet releasement of soul and body from worse than Egyptian darkn jss and from a slavery of the cruelest form, and blackest shade. Let woman present her warmest thanks and bring her choicest tribute of gratitude. Let long and loud shouts of praise ascend from the hearts of thy daughters, in commemoration of this important era in the world's history. May thy children constantly bear in mind, thy sufferings, mental and physical for the establishment and increase of the gospel, and may the time speedily arrive when those who are now groping in darkness may see the beauty of this pure and holy way. ' May many who are in nature's darkness be made acquainted .vith a spiritual mother and rejoice in her love and blessing. Martha Ann Carr.
