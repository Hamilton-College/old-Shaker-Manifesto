FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS While we would not presume to use our prerogative for the animadversion of any who so kindly love us, and sustain oar Manifesto as they would and do ; yet, we are constrained to offer, in explanation, the reasons for the absence of seven very nicely written, and most respectful mementoes, of as many lately and dearly departed. The publication of these would occupy more than eleven pages of our Manifesto. If agreeable to the majority of our readers, we could make up one whole number as a literal Mausoleum, just to see how it would appear. Having declined several long notices of very eminent individuals, it is only fair and impartial that we hold to this decision — one which we deem would be an agreeable one to those deceased, were they now living — to accept, for publication, no long mortuary notices. We hope for the union and sympathy of all our good folks in the same. Ed.
