REST MARIA WITHAM How precious to the weary one is rest, A solace to the heart by grief oppress'd, A place, a shelter from the burning sur, When all our weary, heavy tasks are done. Rest for the mind, and for the tired brain, Eest for the nerves from anxious toil and strain; The throbbing brow is on the pillow press'd, Sweetly and tranquilly, we sink to rest. 0 sweetest rest of all, is rest from sin, When cleans'd from all the crimson stains within, With calm ineffable repose of mind, In Heaven's peaceful home, we rest may find. Dear Mother hear, O hear, my spirit cry, List to my faint petitions when I die, And take my weary head upon thy breast, Near thee, 0 let me take my last long rest. Enfield, Conn.
