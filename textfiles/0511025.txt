All hail! to the spirit of beauty... All hail! to the spirit of beauty adorning The ever green mountains, the low-land and glade, All hail! to the light that breaks forth with the morning, The glorious sunshine and deep silent shade. Rich anthems of praise, from the glad earth and heaven, Are voiced through God's boundless creations of love ; Responsive our song full of joy shall be given, Our earth home foreshadows fair Eden above.
