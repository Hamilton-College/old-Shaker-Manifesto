OBSERVATIONS ON THE NATURE AND EFFECTS OF PRAYER. Giles B. Avery. Dr. Blair remarked, 'Prayer has its effect wholly, or principally on ourselves ; because God is unchangeable, and, therefore, unmoved by our importunities, and unaffected by our joys, sorrows, wants or woes ; for with Him is neither variableness, nor shadow of turning.' Jesus,�the Christian Preceptor and Guide, said, ' If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven know how to give good gifts to those who ask him.' Matt, vii., 11. The fact is, the only hinge upon which the justice of God hangs, is a continual adaptation of God's purposes to meet the doings and conditions of his creature, man. And to apply the principle of unchangeableness of God, which simply has reference to the immobility of his laws, to the idea that He is unaffected, and unmoved, by the doings of his creatures, consequently does not meet their acts according to his law of justice and mercy, and strengthen and fortify them in worthy, good pursuits, while he discards and frowns upon the opposite, is to make justice and mercy terms of no meaning, or, rather, to drive them into chaos and oblivion, and set up the Supreme God on a throne ot unchangeable dispensations, showering down upon earth from time to time alternate portions of blessings or cursings, let his creatures do as they may ; for, it cannot be denied that both of these are the dispensations of his hand ; although some sophists contend, that, since God is love, it is not consonant with his attributes to dispense sufferings. But, let the objector remember that God's attribute of love does not obliterate his attributes of justice, righteousness, mercy and truth, '^hall not the Judge of all the earth do right?' Gen. xviii., 25. God is not solely one of these attributes without the others! And, since there are opposing powers, it is not possible for God to love that which is good, without hating that which is evil; for, the very effort of loving and blessing certain deeds and principles that are good, is, of itself, hating and cursing that which is evil. What could be a stronger demonstration of opposition, aversion, or hatred to wicked deeds and baleful principles than this ? On the principle of unchangeable dispensations ; or, changeable alternately and uniformly, without regard to merits or demerits of humanity, it might so chance that a generation living under a dispensation of God's fixed blessings might thus be blest who were quite unworthy, while a worthy generation, living perchance in a period of his displeasure, would receive cursing and bitterness of soul! Where then would be manifest justice, righteousness, and goodness? Would it be just that a meritorious people should be ravaged by the scourge of God's displeasure, and driven out of hope? Could zeal for good works survive under an expectancy of such a scourge ? Could love and gratitude to God be tendersd by a soul while smarting under the lacerating strokes of unjustly dispensed sovereign will? Nay, Caviler! When Omnipotence frowns on virtue, she sinks to rise uo more! And when He smiles on vice, justice will wrest from Him the scepter, and rule the world himself! Aye, more, were it possible for God indifferently to sit, while virtue and vice contend, his silence would be a sanction to them both, and, thus divided against himself, He soon should no more be ! The subject is beyond reasonable prevarication that power, wisdom, goodness, justice, love, righteousness and mercy, are attributes of Deity. But, all these are unmeaning terms, if God is unmoved by the doings of his creatures, and unchangeable, in the sense of not conforming his dispensations of love, mercy, righteousness, &amp;c.�to meet the meritorious doings of his creatures ! The position that, ' With God there is neither variableness nor shadow of turning' is strictly true, but, it is applicable only to his identity of attributes ; not to the application of his powers in righteousness to meet the doings of his creatures ; for, as said Paul, 'The powers that be are ordained of God, and the invisible things of Him from the creation are manifest in the things that are, even his eternal power and Godhead.' Rom. xiii. This refers only to the 'higher powers.' Hence, how is it possible for the wonderous works of his hands to be affected by powers and principles in contact, and all nature�the work of his hand, animate and inanimate to be affected by the action of surrounding conditions and principles in operation, when in connection and none of this element to exist in their Maker ? Without influence, communication is bankrupt, heavf.n-void, and friends unknown ! Thus would Cowper sing in vain that, ' A true friend must echo sigh for sigh, aDd groan for groan, And wet his cheeks with sorrows not his own.' If this influence extant in all nature, is not from Deity, it surely must be from Satanity, for it exists, and if thus, 'Friendship's cordial were a boon of hell.' No longer say that God is the soul of heaven, and unmoved by the doings of his creatures ! Christ, the Son of God, when born of the spirit, as a primary lesson, taught to feel for others' woes ; and he declared that he was in the Father, and the Father in him. If God were unmoved by the doings of his creatures, upcn what principle is their sufferings consequent upon the violation of law dispensed to his creatures? Is it consistent for Him to pull down that which He has built up ; to erect a temple for the purpose of demolition, thus to teach man his Omnipotence? If this bespeaks Omnipotence, man shares his dignity ! Upon what principle are rewards and punishments admissible? Upon what principle was language confused at the building of Babel ? Upon what principle did Christ teach remission of sins? Upon what principle did Christ teach faith in prayer? And that prayer would be granted because of importunities ? Say, is it goodness,� And, did God make a pure desire, E'er to exist in quenchless fire? Say, should his justice never fill, A cup formed empty by his will? Has He set limits unto space, Beyond the circles of his grace, And yet designed the same to fill, When inconsistent with his will? Shall justice sheathe his judgment's sword, When creatures mock and scorn his word, Or did He bid mankind profane His Holy Reverential name? Shall He in justice's chariot ride, And, unaffected, see the tide Of man's ambition ebb and flow And bless alike for weal or woe? Is He unmoved when sordid Just Would sheathe his scepter in the dust, Ajid bigots fain would rear a throne More that they honor than his own? Did He create desire and hope To tantalize till they elope? Or has He granted to their will To measure future good or ill? He's interfered, indeed with man, And often contravened man's plan, For this God's goodness did foresee To be his justice's stern decree ! But, say, did not the piteous moan, When Abram sacrificed his son Call forth an angel to his aid Before his knife the child had slayed? Was God unmoved though Adam fell, Refused obedience,�Rebelled? If so, was yet his promise true Of Savior and Redeemer too? When wicked Cain his brother slew, Did God, supine the action view? If so, how did the curse on Cain, Derive its power to float amain? When wickedness the earth did fill, And rebels spurned God's holy will, Did God, unmoved, behold their rage, And blot the record from time's page? If thus, whence did the flood descend To deluge earth from end to end? And why was heaven so cruel too, As to destroy the rebel crew? Who taught old Noah an ark to build, Directed how it should be filled Commanded him repentance preach, And perfect veneration teach? If God, unmoved by man's vile plan, Still blessed and prospered him as man, In running counter to his (God's) will Man's lust to pamper and fulfill, Say, if God never frowns with horror, Who punished Sodom and Gomorrah? Or, being good, if God frown on us, Who gave a Covenant, with promise To good old Abraham�faithful sire, Who proved his faith to feed the fire? For Moses why the bush to burn If God moved not to man's concern? Or, how did he, by God's direction Inflict the plagues for man's correction? If God, unmoved could see old Pharaoh's rage And, grieved old Israel cared not to assuage, Pray, tell us how her murmur did Him shock, To pour forth water from the barren rock? Or, why, when gratitude for manna fails, God filled the mouths of Israel with quails? If God's ne'er moved by e'en a nation's plea. Say, who for Israel sundered the Red Sea? And if God moves not when man's soul is tried Why were the broken tables fresh supplied? When Moses, in distress for Israel's sin, Brake the two first, why give to him again? Why call him to the mount, and there renew The Covenant for the idolizing Jew? And, if with God, man's deeds have no avail, Who slew the fourteen thousand men when Korah fell? And why was Moses, and his brother Aaron, Withheld from entering the land of Canaan? Say, why, if God ne'er frowned at their distrust Why this debar from lovely Canaan, just? Why, for idolatry, and whoredom too Destroy two dozen thousand of the Jews? And thus debar them from the land of Canaan, Because seduced by the advice of Balaam? If God move not when troubles scathe the soul, Who caused the waters of the Jordan roll? And, when all Israel stood upon her banks, Divided Jordan for her dry shod ranks? And piled the waters, as a heap of rubble To let his Israel pass them free from trouble? If God's ne'er moved when man, in weakness calls, 'Who leveled Jericho's substantial walls? When priests, with trumpets rent the mellow air What was there in the trumpets but a prayer? And, if Jehovah was not moved with this What threw the giant walls into abyss? The sound of trumpet though it split the quill Could never move a wall without God's will! How could Elijah unto heaven ride In fiery chariot without God for guide? And would his angel guide a wicked man Whose life was mockery to his holy plan? Were not the prayers Elijah poured to heaven Together with obedience by him given, The motive powers that rolled the chariot wheels, Urged forward by the Lord, who prayer feels? If God's ne'er moved whene'er his children pray, But, tyrant like, from prayer doth turn away, Who slew the Baal prophets, all by fire To prove Jehovah true, and Baal liar? When good Elijah prayed, who rain distilled Upon the thirsty land, a bounty willed? If God ne'er moves, when man prays in his might Who bade his angel, punish in a night The eighty-five and hundred thousand men By death, for trespass upon Judah then An answer to the prayer by Hezekiah United with his brother, good Isaiah Did God move not, for mortals here below, In case of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego? Who, then protection in the furnace gave? Who rolled away the flaming fiery wave? Who saved them scatheless in a sea of fire In answer to their godly live's desire? Who, when the church of Christ's disciples prayed The cloven tongues of nations then displayed? Thus, when they keenly felt the Savior's loss, Bestowed on them the heavenly pentecost. When John and Peter, to the house of prayer In Christ's own name and spirit did appear, Who healed the lame man, sitting at the gate And raised to a walking man's estate? When the Apostles were in prison laid, Who led them forth�the soldier's trust betrayed? When Peter, bound with chains in prison lay, 'Tween soldiers, watching lest he steal away, Who, while the soldiers slept, the chains did loose 4.nd led him forth for heaven's special use? These gifts were answers to the saints, who prayed 'Twas God's right hand of power these works displayed And thousand thousands yet the song may sing To praying saints, God will an answer bring. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
