SWEET VALE OF PRAYER MARIA WHEELER O quiet vale of prayer, sweet prayer, The fragrance of God's peace is there : Its holy paths o'er-shining sod, Are watered by the hand of God. Lone weary hearts oppressed with grief, Can wander there and find relief, Or, for the toil of life prepare, Within that sacred vale of prayer. Â© quiet vale of prayer, I've found A treasure on thy hallowed ground; The precious seal of trusting love In God, who rules the spheres above. And though my falt'ring feet may stray, From truth, to error's troubled way, Forgiving love will meet me there, Within that quiet vale of prayer. Union Village, Ohio.
