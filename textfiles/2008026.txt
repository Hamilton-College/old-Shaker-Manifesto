NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North. Family. July 10; 1890. The July Manifesto came smiling along, bright and early, iind renewing our interest at home and abruad. Mother's counsel was very wise, to do everything in its season; to heed this we have no time to lose. The seasons roll round so close one after another that it requires constant diligence to keep up with them. We no sooner get through with seedtime, than we have to commence harvesting. To have every set of tools all in readiness for the season, is arming ourselves beforehand; and saves a great deal of fret and worry. The best way, we find, is, at the close of each season to put the machines and tools all in working order before they are stored away. We shall attend to this, or try to, in the future better than we have sometimes in the past. Old Time is everlastingly working away, taking the polish off, and using the influence of the elements to bring all man-made things down to one general level. A few years ago we painted and fixed up till we thought we were pretty nice; but now when we come to look round we find we are getting quite dingy. So with the help of angel Sisters we have started to polish up again. Are now engaged painting our buildings ; righting up chimneys, fences and things in general. This necessitates the hiring of extra help; which always brings additional burden. We are trying the plan of hiring by the day, and have them board themselves. It may cost a little more one way, but I think we gain it in another. It pays well to look after the interest of our sisterhood. They can then the better look after the interest of the brotherhood. Are now in hay harvest; which is excellent where the land is rich. Potato bugs, and weeds call, and have to be attended to. Br. Charles Greave's fertilizer machine is a grand affair for putting plaster with paris green, on potatoes. I wish we were situated as are our good friends at Alfred, down in Maine; that is be able to do our own work. And I also wish that every man had land of his own to work upon. Our forefathers in the gospel were very zealous in their day, and wanted to do all in their power to redeem the earth; thinking that all the land Believers owned was being redeemed by consecration, they tried to buy all that joined them, as far as possible, and consecrate it to the Lord. But alas, in many cases it has become a burden grievous to be borne. We have recently had the privilege of seeing the beloved Ministry from Maine and some of our gospel friends from Groveland. I wish we could see more of them from near and afar. Who can tell the great amount of good that is imparted and received by the visiting of gospel relation one with another? I can tell of much good I have received, and I know many who have been blest in this way. If we have really forsaken the natural, according to the example of Jesus and the founders of our order, we have a right to cultivate the spiritual; and is it not our duty so to do? It was said of Jesus 'for the joy set before him he endured the cross.' For the joy with his heavenly Father, and sweet communion with angels did he forsake his earthly kindreds and relationships; so with us ; if we have no joy set before us of our Heavenly Mother, and communion with the household of faith, will there not be some danger of our turning earthward. 'We'll waft a waft of love thro' Zion, To our kindred everywhere. We'll shout a shout of gospel blessing, That angels on their wings will bear. Over mountain over valley, Over plain and flowing rill, Wf'll extend the gift of union, Till our kindred it doth fill.' In kindest love, Daniel Offord. Center Family. Beloved Elder Henry :�Our cherry crop which is nearly all gathered proved better than we expected and prices were exceptionally good selling at fifteen cents per quart, as there are very few in the market beside what Shaker Village produced. Brethren expect to finish haying (weather being good) to-morrow, the crop is very heavy and of good quality. Our Society Meeting commenced the second Sabbath in June and was opened to the public for the first time this season last Sunday. We had a select audience who were very respectful and attentive an.l why should they not be? Health of family and Society quite good, the weather is warm and dry. Potatoes are suffering for want of rain and will be a light crop unless we get some pretty soon. Fraternally yours, T. Kayson. Soixtli ITa-mily. Dear Editor :�Time is money just now, but we must boil down a few lines for you, or the blessed Manifesto. Since writing before, our people have painted two hundred windows so will not have that bill to pay but have not finished yet. Last week good brother Henry Mantle and two of our Sisters returned from Watervliet with a great deal of love and were very much refreshed ; well tried Elder Alexander Work, and two Sisters from Groveland were there at the time which made it very pleasant all around. The Manifesto reminds me of a good dinner it takes longer to prepare it than to devour it but we get hungry and want more. We at Mt. Lebanon do not know how to be thankful enough for the large supply of water we have had, since hearing Elder Alexander tell of the scarcity at Groveland. They came here to take the Census last week, and they wanted more than we could give. We are picking cherries, but have a small crop. S. A. C. Hancock, Mass. July, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�The rain is falling, thunder rolling, and lightning flashing! I have often heard of its 'raining pitchforks'' and think it comes as near being true this afternoon as it ever will; at all events I am glad to be sheltered from the fury of the storm that is raging without. I sent to your address in June a letter and some Bible Class papers; also answers to Bible question No. 8, but they must have gone astray or been mislaid, as our Society was not mentioned in the answers. But I do not mean to be discouraged, you perceive, but 'try, try again.'' Bible question No. 9, requires much .thought and research, but several have p-epared answers which I enclose. We thank you for providing this nice plan, inciting to the study of the Scriptures. The young people all feel an interest in it, and look fur the column devoted to the Bible Class as soon as the Manifesto is received The Ministry from Alfred, Me., arrived here early in the afternoon of June 25th. and remained with us till near the close of the next day, when they crossed the mountain to beautiful Mt. Lebanon. Their stay, though so short, was greatly enjoyed by us. The next day we were pleased to welcome Sisters Ella Winship and Elizabeth Sidle with whom we spent two very pleasant days. I wish I could tell you something more interesting, but one day is much like another, as mine are spent in the school-room, which is�oh, so warm these summer days. Sometimes of an afternoon, when we can endure it no longer, we ta'ke our books and sit for an hour in the grove near by. The children learn quite as good lessons and enjoy it very much. Our first term of school will close in two weeks. Br. Ira is having an addition built on the East end of the Office barn, thirty-six ft. long and twenty- four ft. wide and three stories high. It is now nearly completed. It is the intention, I think, to lay a bridge over the brook opposite the barn which will prevent the necessity of passing before the office with loads of hay, etc. I will send three Bible Class papers in another envelope Please accept an abundance of love from all Hancock friends for yourself and as far as you wish to extend. E. B. Enfield, Conn. The season is fruitful materially, and we hope spiritually, in a substantial soul travel Godward. Contentment is our lot, and thankfulness to God for all his goodness. Warm weather has come in earnest, the nights have been cold until the past two weeks. Strawberries have been very abundant, we have secured nearly seven hundred quarts from a plot 3x7 rods. Early pease thirty-fivo bushels from a plot 4x15 rods. The Champions are just corning on now to pick. The early pea-vines are cleared off and cucumbers phmted. In June from twenty cows 'without grain' we made S720 spaces of cream, divided by 6 gives the lbs. of butter�who heads this? Haying inactive progress. Our new implements enable us to put in our hay at the rate of twenty tons per day; we feel confident that with a little more experience we can put in thirty tons a day. Potatoes give an unusual promise, if we con judge by the growth of the vines. Abundant blessings are showered upon us. Would that many more of earth's inhabitants might be awakened by the power of conviction, and the fire of divine truth so as to be the happy sharers in the bounties of our Heavenly Parents. M. Witham. We should try to make the best of everything, and not be cast down by frequent trials and burdens. A beautiful rule to govern our lives is to look only on the bright sidi.' of life. Many of life's sorrows are just as dark as we make them, and no darker. A good way is to do no more than we can do well. It is the best work that pays best in the end. Weeds rob us of the results of our work and the fertilizer we have used to help the crop that we want, and farming is a struggle against them. We must not weary in well doing, but keep courage to fight them to the end. Plant food costs too much to let it go to waste. Spare the weeds and spoil the crop. Our field of ten acres of cabbage looks well, and there will be some cabbage to sell. The Rubicon carrot is well worthy of cultivation. Our Eureka mower, with six feet cutter bar, does good work. Coal ashes sifted in the hen-house makes a good disinfectant, keeping down the odors and making the house easy to clean. Dust is fatal to lice. Rather than bear it they oftentimes move out. Fowls should have all the water they want to drink during the summer months. Is it necessary to say, put in the shade? D. Orcutt. Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Elder Henry :�What a great blessing is health, and still greater is the assurance that our editor, compositors and we trust all in the household, sire now among the Messed in this respect. We are admonished by the non-appearance of our notes about home written for July, to he on time, always ready by living to the maxim, 'Never put off till to-morrow what should be done to-day.' What a line of thought is awakened by these few words! Who realh lives up to the injunction? We do not understand the counsel to mean literally that one must do all he sees to be done each day, as this would be an impossibility, but to make the proper selection of duties each day which shall exclude indolence and procrastination will be satisfactory. We spoke in our last of too much of a good thing referring to rain. We would to-day be glad of a little more, as we are just now verging upon a dry season. We have full experience of 'making hay while the sun shines,' and the work is being prosecuted with vigor�a large crop of grass on the dear old Granite Hills. Between flood and drought, our gardens are doing well. We had new pease and potatoes July 1 and 3, and while our Plum and Cherry trees are being destroyed by the Black Knot, (Has any one found a remedy?) other blessings give us sufficient cause for thanksgiving. Kind love to our dear friends, from Central Ministry to the least child Let every heart be glad and upon the 6th of August let us all sing : God's love is at the helm, We shall out-ride the storin; Whose life is in the light, Can fear no earthly . harm. Our friends of the North Family are painting some very needy houses, or buildings which need paint sadly, and we at the South Family are pushing repairs which employ both carpenters and plumbers. O these perishable walls, how they lead our minds to lay up treasures in the 'house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens !' Here let us ask the Sisters who read the Manifesto if they have tried the nice way of saving rhubarb for the early season of 1891? Before the stalks have grown to form an objectionable skin, cut the flesh in small, say inch pieces, and place in perfect self-sealing cans, filling them to the brim with ice-cold water. Screw the tops down immediately and you will find at the close of a twelve month, if your experience is like ours, that you have a nice article which you may stew and sweeten for the table, as though fresh from the garden. Among the singing birds that visited Central N. EL, this season, we had one family of the Purple Grosbeak, Carpodacus purpureus. In some localities this is known as the Purple Linnet. Its sweet song and beautiful plumage, would make it a great favorite, among those who are interested in the study of birds. During the month of June the morning notes of all our Bird visitors could be heard in full chorus, at 3 o'clock A. M. while at the present date they do not begin till 3-30. Enfield, N. H. July, 13, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�We thought the July Editorial, unusually fraught with valuable instruction, making clear to any thoughtful mind, that the Communistic principle, consequently the celibate life, (as the 'my and mine' element could not exist there,) must be the foundation of the true Christ life. These vital points are discussed too little, and we suggest that the basic, essential principles upon which our faith is founded be concisely formulated, and make a standard article in tjie Manifesto every month, as it i&amp; constantly passing into new hands. We have admired the Universalists' plan in thus doing and why should not our Church do likewise? It is true, people who cannot execute their plans, should be slow in suggesting, yet, we are always pleased when any one attacks a principle, and elucidates for the benefit of our young people, as well as strangers to our Order. Our Society enjoyed a pleasant and profitable open air meeting on July 4th. Remembering that Jesus very aptly said on an appropriate occasion, 'Render unto Ceasar the things that are Ceasar's,' we tried to render unto the Fathers and Mothers of this great free country, the honor due them, and it proved very interesting. The children gave extracts from History relative to the struggle for freedom, with music and singing interspersed, and they, no doubt, received a lasting impression, that liberty of conscience was bought with a price, and that through this Declaration of Independence, and separation of Church and State, it was made possible for the founders of the Shaker church to obey their convictions of duty. Supper was served under the trees, afu-r which we sang America and adjourned, with the firm conviction, that notwithstanding it costs something to arrange for such a gathering, in discipline and change of thought it pays. E. B. Alfred, Me. June, 1890. Fruit, large and small, promises to be abundant. Even the peach trees, of which we have learned to expect so little, this year are doing their best. As it seems to be the fashion, (and a good one too) to speak of improvements introduced into Society, it may be proper to mention the introducing to our dairy, of a Roper Hot Air Engine, and a Delavall Separator, both of which are giving good satisfaction.
