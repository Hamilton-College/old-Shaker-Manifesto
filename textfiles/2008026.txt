Alfred, Me. June, 1890. Fruit, large and small, promises to be abundant. Even the peach trees, of which we have learned to expect so little, this year are doing their best. As it seems to be the fashion, (and a good one too) to speak of improvements introduced into Society, it may be proper to mention the introducing to our dairy, of a Roper Hot Air Engine, and a Delavall Separator, both of which are giving good satisfaction.
