Watervliet, N. Y. On the 18th. of Fell, we had a severe thunder shower, with sha'p lightning, and ever since the weather has been cold and warm; and between these intervals of winter and spring we have managed to secure enougu ice to fill our ice house. It was from four to nine inches thick. March came in cold and blustering. Not much of any news. We are engaged in the usual duties of the season ; cutting, drawing and sawing wood for the nerds of another season. Roads are very rough; hard on horses and wagons. No snow; have to draw fire-wood on wagons and it is now Mar. 3rd. Sleigh rides will have to be postponed for the future. W*1 have had a i'ew cases of the La Grippe. Considering the havoc it has made in some sections, we are thankful to say we have been lightly visited and all are recovering. We wish a spiritual La Grippe would prevail among the people and grip them so hard that they would feel the necessity of taking hold of the gospel work in earnest. But unless they were real sick, so sick that they themselves felt the need of the Great Physician's help, we fear their recovery would be very doubtful. Zion needs earnest, sincere workers, not drones nor doubters.
