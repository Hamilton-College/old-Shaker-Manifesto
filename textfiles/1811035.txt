A LESSON FROM A TREE. E. R. Shepherd. A dying tree with sapless trunk Stood on a vacant plain; I listened to the kindly taljj Of the descending rain. 'I've come to take that plant in charge : I'll try to make this tree In fruit as full in limb as large, As yonder one you see.' So, on this gracious mission bent That day and night it fell Until its forces all were spent, Alas ! and sad to tell! Fresher! no larger seemed the tree Than it had been before, Wasted this rainfall seemed to be And kindness more than all. 'Twas morn: A sunbeam on its way Came warm and strong and bright; It said : 'I'll take yon weakly thing And make a tree of might.' But when night came, greener, perhaps, Not larger seemed the tree. Wasted the sunshine with the hours elapse? All, so it seemed to be ! Then gently fell the drops of dew On every leaf and twig, With the same object still in view, It said : 'To-night it shall grow big.' The proper elements in air And in the soil combined, Each in its turn worked silently, The same results to find. A few more leaflets than before, A little stronger grown The merest hint�and nothing more Of influence it had known. Ten years ! Again I pass that way, I look; behold a tree, Whose branches, leaves, and fruit display Great beauty�majesty. Not rain, nor sun, nor dew, nor food Alone, the work could claim, But all combined and oft renewed In time, receive the fame. So, often, men will plan some great And noble work to do. They labor hard, impatient wait The quick result to view. But oft comes disappointment -'een When after all is done, They cannot see the progress made By seeds on wayside sown. And then another comes to try By other methods quite, A little added growth espy, Perhaps it shines more bright. A third and fourth then take the work Striving to finish fast; Put forth what hidden force may lurk, And still, the work all these out-lasts, And many years must intervene, And many workers throw Deep love, strong labor, in between, Ere sought results will show. One sows, one reaps ; no one can boast, 'I shall receive the praise.' He little does who does the most, And short the longest days; But none of these can be excused Because their part seems small. The widow's mite was not refused But counted more than all; What seemed but wasted almost lost Sometime will all be seen� Life-work on marble-shnft embossed, Which rough at first had been. 0, workers in this double world Of nature and of grace, O'er you the banner is unfurled Which reads upon its face : 'Neither is he that planteth anything, Neither he that watereth : But God that giveth the increase.' Then grant to him all glory, praise, For help along the way And cheerful work with all your mighi, Though long the harvest wait� It surely comes, full, rich and white, And the reward, how great!
