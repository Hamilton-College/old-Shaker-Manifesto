HALLELUJAH IDOLS The self-renunciation of the ladies of Florence, when, under the preaching of Savonarola, they cast their jewels and false hair into the bonfire in the Piazza delta Signoria, is paralleled by the recent converts of the ' Hallelujah Lasses' at Blyth, England. ' On Tuesday night,' says the local paper, ' an interesting and novel sale took, place at Blyth, Mr. Fynes, auctioneer, having offered at public auction (for the benefit of whom it may concern) a large collection of Hallelujah Idols, comprising poultry, canaries, parrots, bird cages, dress rings, meerschaum pipes, a variety of gentlemen's and ladies' dress ornaments, and a miscellaneous group of other articles, which had been given up by parties in this district on their conversion by the' Hallelujah Lasses.'' There was a numerous attendance at the sale. Christian Union
