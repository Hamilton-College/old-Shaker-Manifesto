HOPE. JOSEPH WOODS. The Apostle Peter has said, ' Be always ready to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you ; with meekness and fear. ' Hope is a desire of some future good, as the hope ot Eternal Life. ' p]very man that hath this hope purifieth himself, even as Christ is pure.' ' Hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. ' And, we are saved by hope, but hope that is seen is not hope ; what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for ? If we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face ; now I know in part, then shall I know even as I am known. The Apostle at one time, having a spiritual sight of himself, exclaimed, 'O wretched man that I am ! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?' Thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord, there is deliverance through a living faith which works by love, purifies the heart and overcomes the world. The first man Adam was of the earth earthly ; a. generative man after the law of a carnal commandment. The second Adam was Jesus Christ, the Lord from heaven, a quickening spirit, who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. A Regenerator,ï¿½a term significant in that it cuts off the works of generation. The Prophet Daniel said of Jesus, ' Who shall declare his generation?' Who shall declare the generation of his true followers who daily deny themselves of all that constitutes the world and follow Christ their Lord in the work of regeneration, until they, like him can say in truth we have overcome the world. The apostle Paul says that Jesus hath appeared, to put away sin, by the sacrifice of himself. He also says many things are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. St. John informs us what the ends of the world are. He says all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world. Be of good cheer, said Jesus for I have overcome the world. 'Him that overcometh the world, will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as 1 overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. ' 'I am the Resurrection and the Life, he that believeth in me though he were (previously) dead (in trespasses and sin,) yet shall he live ; and whosoever liveth (the Virgin Life) and believeth in me shall never die.' This is the Resurrection. 'They that are accounted worthy to attain that world and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marrage ; but are as the angels in heaven. ' The Lord hath promised to create new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness; and that the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind. The former shall pass away with a great noise, and St. John in his vision beheld the old Adamic heaven depart as a scroll when it was rolled together. Canterbury, N. H.
