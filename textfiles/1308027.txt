Care of Irons. When irons become rough or smoky, lay a little fine salt on a flat surface and rub them well; it will prevent them from sticking to anything starched, and make them smooth; or scour with bath-brick before heating, and when hot rub well with salt, and then with a small piece of bees-wax tied up in a rag, after which wipe clean on a dry cloth. A piece of fine sand paper is also a good thing to have near the stove, or a hard, smooth board covered with brick-dust, to rub each iron on when it is put back on the stove, so that no starch may remain to be burnt on. Put bees-wax between pieces of paper or cloth and keep on the table close by the flatiron stand. If the irons get coated with scorched starch, rub them over the paper that holds the starch and it will come off. Rubbing the iron over the waxed paper, even if no starch adheres, adds to the glossiness of the linen that is ironed. Religious Telescope
