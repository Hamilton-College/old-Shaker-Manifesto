A NEGLECTED DUTY. No man has any right to manage his affairs in such a way that his sudden death would bring burdens and losses on other people. There may be rare cases where a man really cannot help entanglements, or where, from inexperience, or lack of judgment, lie has brought his affairs into such a state that the interest of others depends upon his life ; but lie should make all possible haste to extricate himself from such a position. Honor and honesty demand that he should so conduct his business that his death should cause no one to be wronged. And as to dying, although all men everywhere believe that every other man will surely die, yet they unite in thinking that they themselves are exceptions to this rule; or, at least, they act as if they thought so : this is radically wrong. It is every man's duty, in every transaction in life, to be influenced by the fact that at any day or at any hour he may die. Selected.
