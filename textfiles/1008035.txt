Ages of Sheep The following is a pretty accurate direction to tell the age of sheep by their teeth : The first year a sheep's front teeth are eight in number, and are all of equal size. The second year the two middle ones shed out and are replaced by two much larger than the others. The third year two very small teeth appear, one on either side of the eight. At the end of the fourth year there are six large teeth. The fifth, year all the front teeth are large. The sixth year all begin to show signs of wear.
