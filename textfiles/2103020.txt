Harvard, Mass. Feb. 1891. Dear Editor:ï¿½On the 31st ult. we were called to pay a worthy tribute of respect to one of our old comrades, a true soldier of Christ, beloved Elder, Isaac Bailey of Shirley. So we see that the veterans are leaving us, one at a time, to report in another home, and it is left for us to hold aloft the banner of Virgin purity and to keep it for others, as they have kept it for us. Thus far the present winter has been very favorable for business, indeed the best for twenty-five years. The snow came in November and the white mantle has covered the earth to the present day. Our Brethren are engaged in the herb and broom business. Should any of our friends need some of these necessaries of life, we could furnish them very readily. Of herbs we have a large amount, and are continually sending them to Boston, through hope that they may help correct some of the miseries of that enlightened city. On page 35 of Feb. Manifesto, we read a little gem, contributed by some dear soul, 'Let no knowledge satisfy but that which lifts above the world,' etc. What a lesson to learn! This shall be my aim. The knowledge of deep truths, treasured in the store-house of heaven is what my soul thirsts for each day, and the only way to gain this treasure, is to live to our highest understanding of right. Our blessed Mother Ann, gave us many good examples in this new order of life. 'Hands at work and heart to God.' 'Do not fail to meet together for worship, even though your houses should be torn down, over your heads.' The necessity of keeping a spiritual gift and regularly attending our religious service ought to be with us of the first importance, as in this way, our Mother, found a great salvation and travail of soul. 'Seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and all things will he added.' Let us all give this a little more attention. A. B.
