How very singular it is for highly civilized and Christianized people... How very singular it is for highly civilized and Christianized people, in this wonderful day of grace, to become excited and begin to 'breathe out threatenings and slaughter' against a little company of religionists. Persecution seems to be in the air, and after calling the Koreshans of Chicago, a long list of bad names these self-styled Christianized lambs are foolishly making ready to do violence to those whom they call the wolves of Koresh. This is a queer exhibition of religion. It is, indeed, a change of base, and could only be brought out in this nineteenth century. Those who viftit the World's Fair will also want to see this wonder of the age.Christian lambs devouring the Koresh wolves. The little company in Chicago who are under the charge of Dr. Teed and who at this time are unreasonably annoyed with the indignities of an ignorant class, have our sympathetic regard and a wish for their peace and prosperity.
