How to Spoil Tea If the first experiment does not make an infusion strong enough, or if the pot is partly empty and more is needed, do not put any fresh tea into the tea-pot, for it will surely be wasted. Tea water will not dissolve the theine from the dry leaves of fresh tea; only pure, fresh water will do that. The addition of tea to the nearly empty teapot will increase the color, but it will not make the tea perceptibly stronger in its exhilarating quality. Any one may try the experiment. Put a table-spoonful of tea into a quart of water, and let it stand five minutes, or boil it if desired Then add two more spoonfuls of tea-leaves to the same decoction. The color will be increased, but the tea will be little stronger in the active principle so much desired When more liquid or a stronger infusion is desired, put the additional tea in a cup, and pour fresh water on it; after it has stood a few minutes, it may then be put in the pot to good advantage.
