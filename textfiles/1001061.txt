If any man will 'IF ANY MAN WILL. -Condemn no man for not thinking as you think. Let every one enjoy the full and free liberty of thinking for himself. Abhor every approach, in any kind or degree, to the spirit of persecution. If yon cannot reason or persuade a man into the truth, never attempt to force him into it.- John Wesley.
