REFORM On the first day of April, 1872, there were four brethren in the Canaan Upper Family who used tobacco. Now there are none. The reform came in this manner : One day, Elder Frederick called at our house and asked to see those four brethren. After we were seated, he began to talk about tobacco, and called it some hard names, which, though true enough, we did not all of us like to hear. But, as long as he generalized and confined his remarks to tobacco alone, we did not feel much disturbed. It was soon evident, however, he now meant something more. He had come bearing a proposition, sanctioned by the ministry, that all the brethren in our little group who used tobacco should now quit it. This was a 'hard saying, who could bear it ? ' ' I'll quit it,' said the eldest of the four; and he has kept his promise to this day. Another argued stoutly for his quid, as if it were a good thing ; but finally came up to the help of the Lord against the nauseous weed, and like a good Believer, determined to conquer or die. He, too, has kept his resolution, and a short time since handed me two large plugs of navy tobacco, saying 68 8HAKEE with a pleasant smile on his face, ' I have not put a bit of tobacco into my mouth from that day to this, nor shall I, as long as I live.' The other two also took sharp hold of the proposition and are steadfast. January 1, 1874, there were four brethren of our small group, of about thirty souls, who ate animal food. Now there is but one. We have used in the past year 1,500 pounds unbolted wheat meal; 1,400 pounds unbolted corn meal; 800 pounds of oatmeal. Charles Greaves, Canaan, N. Y.
