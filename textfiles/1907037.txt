The Coming Creed of the World The Coming Creed op the World by Frederic Gerhard is a work that has been in contemplation by the writer for more than forty years. The accumulation of facts bearing upon the subject of churchal Christianity, and illustrating its effects upon the mind, is truly wonderful. The book contains a large amount of information having reference to the Bible, dogmas, sects, miracles, fanaticism and evil spirits that could not be obtained by the ordinary reader from any other source. The work is written in a very kind spirit and cannot fail to awaken a greater desire for a more thorough knowledge of the truth. That the author has formulated a system that is more 'sublime and blissful' than the picture he has drawn of the unspiritual, persecuting Christianity of a past and of the present age, is at once admitted. The testimony of Jesus Christ is the coming of the kingdom of God upon the earth. The creation of a new heaven and a new earth wherein should dwell righteousness and peace. The work must interest every intelligent person, although it should meet him with the potent admonition of the prophet.�Thou art the man! The author of this remarkable message may with all propriety send out his work, as �liA Voice Crying in the Wilderness,' and ask of the reader a careful perusal. Published by W. H.
