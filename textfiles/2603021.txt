RAISINS FOR FOOD. 'It is absolutely certain that the world would be better for it, from the hygienic point of view if we were to eat more fruit and less meat.' In California the country of grapes, raisins are cheap. And the raisin, which is only the grape dried in the sun, is a natural food, if there be any such thing. Sugar which the dried grape contains has long been recognized as a genuine food, so much so that manufactured sugarthat is, sugar extracted from the sugar-cane, sugar-beets, sorghum, the maple-tree, or what notis no longer regarded as an article of luxury, but as a necessity. This being so, it would seem that dried grapes or raisins would furnish the sugar which the system needs in its purest form, for nature's laboratory surpasses all the skill of the chemists and outdoes all the triumph of analysis, quantitative and qualitative. It is sincerely to be hoped that the subject of raisins as food may be thoroughly investigated and exploited, for while they may not take the place of other foods, they may well stand up high in the second rank of food products.
