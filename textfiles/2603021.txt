Sanitary. LET IN SUNSHINE. Man is a product of naturelike the grass and the flowers. He has come like these, as the result of natural and Divine conditions. Find a lone island in the Pacific, with soil and rain, and behold you discover vegetation and animal life. It is not more difficult for nature to make a blade of grass than to form a coral reef, nor is it more difficult for nature to make a man than it is to form a blade of grass. In the course of time either came forth as the result of successive natural laws. What is essential for the existence of one thing is essential for the other. Light, heat, moisture, air, electric forces, all go to bring forth the great essential motion of the Universe, that is Life. Withdraw any of these and the world becomes either THE MANIFESTO. a desert of sand or a sea of ice. All vegetable and animal life adjusts itself to the whims and passions of nature. Man is no exception. A cloudy sky tends to make him feel gloomy. Fog has a depressing effect upon him. The sultry atmosphere of the South makes him indolentthe bracing wind of the North makes him active. There is nothing more helpful to the spirit than the sunshine, sunshine and a great deal of it. We are too apt to forget that we are natural as well as a divine product, and that like the grass and the flowers we need sunshine and all the natural energy to our well-being. ï¿½Selected. RAISINS FOR FOOD. 'It is absolutely certain that the world would be better for it, from the hygienic point of view if we were to eat more fruit and less meat.' In California the country of grapes, raisins are cheap. And the raisin, which is only the grape dried in the sun, is a natural food, if there be any such thing. Sugar which the dried grape contains has long been recognized as a genuine food, so much so that manufactured sugarthat is, sugar extracted from the sugar-cane, sugar-beets, sorghum, the maple-tree, or what notis no longer regarded as an article of luxury, but as a necessity. This being so, it would seem that dried grapes or raisins would furnish the sugar which the system needs in its purest form, for nature's laboratory surpasses all the skill of the chemists and outdoes all the triumph of analysis, quantitative and qualitative. It is sincerely to be hoped that the subject of raisins as food may be thoroughly investigated and exploited, for while they may not take the place of other foods, they may well stand up high in the second rank of food products.
