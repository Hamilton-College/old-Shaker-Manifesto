DUTY. Evelyn Strowbbidge. There are many subjects creative of deep conscientious thought and scientific research, but none perhaps more conducive to individual and society interest, more important or worthy, yet often overlooked or lightly considered than the duty of the present hour. And while in an abstract mood, selfpreservation or wilful indifference, the opportunity passes by and is gone for- ï¿½ ever. Who can tell the value of a wasted hour, or desires to be answerable for failures caused by neglect or omission ? Creatures of constant need ever consuming there is scarcely a feature pertaining to active existence, but what we are directly or indirectly influenced or benefited thereby; and each one should exercise his God-given forces in providing and sustaining, numerous and diversified as we are, multifarious in form and magnitude, follow in constant routine the duties of each succeeding hour. Labor is Life. Temporal claims are manifold, and contain within themselves virtues, active, provident and preservative. However arduous or trifling they may seem, they form a part and are indispensable to the fulfillment and completion of the sum total of our existence. It is seldom that great opportunities occur to test our loyalty, or confirm our stewardship. Our special work may be the ennobling of toil, the heroism of sacrifice or obscurity of sorrow. Most probably in the twofold demand of physical and spiritual development, we shall experience the fatigue of one, triumph of the other, and hallowed calm found only in the vale of Gethsemane. To wait upon the Lord, we each have obedience entire to render. An individual world to conquer and heavenly inheritance to gain. We may seek sanctity in faith, and strength in prayer to render each day's service more perfectly. Maintaining in every detail a purer motive, and truer discipline. 'To be instant in season, serving the Lord' we must be prudent, patient, faithful and strong. Enfield, Ct.
