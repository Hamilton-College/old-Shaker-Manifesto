Ayer, Mass. Fight your own battles. Hoe your own row These words were spoken to me when I was quite young, and struggling under difficulties that seemed almost impossible to be removed. No one can so well help you as you can help yourself, unless they are equally interested in you. If you have a job of work in hand, put yourself into action and do it, and you will find much better results than to wait for some one to come along and do it for you. The man or woman that is to succeed in tliis life must be filled with push and principle. Be it spiritual, intellectual or physical gains,ï¿½they are as sure to succeed as night is to follow day. In a more worldly point of view, it is not the man nor woman who has had a thousand or thousands at the start of life, that has benefited mankind the most; but it is those who have worked their way to the top of the mountain. Who have had push and principle enough to go ahead, regardless of slander or ciiticisai from those less resolute. Life at best is a battle from the cradle to the grave and it is by decision, by character and by courage that the price is won. We must have decision and courage in a spiritual growth. Let us show our courage and our strength of character. We have placed before us principles far more precious than gold or silver. Let us contend for the imperishable treasures with the same zeal as did our forefathers, that we may inherit the legacy that they have left for us, as disciples of the Christ. We gladly welcome the merry songsters of the spring, after a long and severe winter. Our houses for wood are filled and our door yard put into order. The chips and rubbish from the wood pile are all carried into the house. Andrew Barrett.
