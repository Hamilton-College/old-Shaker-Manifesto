SCRAPS FROM THE BORDER LAND In your beautiful faith I am with you heart and soul, and I love and respect your people much more than those by whom I am surrounded. You are more consistent in living up to your profession. I was much interested in a paragraph contained in our ''Manifesto' of August, entitled, 'A Heresy Case.' And I feel convinced in my own mind that some invisible power has allowed that man to remain in the pulpit. For although he was tried and condemned by his orthodox brethren, yet they suffered him to continue preaching, well knowing he will continue to expound his own ideas. Such a man will prove a great power. For one holding such progressive sentiments and fearlessly preaching them from an orthodox pulpit, will have an important weight in overthrowing false and erroneous doctrines endorsed by the Church. Indeed many of the renowned preachers of our day are leaning in the same direction ; the spirit world is helping them in their efforts, and as it aids them, it assists you. The Shaker faith will triumph over all at last, and the glorious time is not far distant. Allow me to send you a few verses which I think applies to Mother Ann Lee. Love to all my dear friends on the mountain. From Sophia the Ballston Shaker.
