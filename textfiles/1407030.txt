Sanitary KEEPING THE TEETH CLEAN. There are many individuals who habitually brush their teeth, and some even declare that they perform this duty twice, thrice, or four times daily, yet cannot keep their teeth from becoming stained or covered with 'tartar. ' Who has not witnessed cases where the teeth, after having received a most thorough cleansing by the dentist, have Avithin a few months after, been again covered with accumulations as repulsive to the eye as if they had never been cleansed? And yet when expressions cf surprise follow such discoveries, assurance is given that the tooth-brush is regularly used! ' Why can not I keep my teeth free from ' tartar'? ' is a question frequently asked by discouraged patients. ' It is not from lack of brushing, ' they say. To express a doubt as to thoroughness on their part is a delicate thing to do, yet proofs are sometimes painfully apparent to warrant such a doubt. Undoubtedly many individuals imagine they are particular in this respect when they are not. The fact is, very few persons know how to properly manipulate a brush; nor do they snow what sort of brush to select. Scarcey one in ten of the brushes manufactured are fit for use, and this statement is no exaggeration. Many are too large and unwieldy ;o be successfully managed, and would be more suitable for 'nail-brushing.' The majority of them are also too compact; some too rigid and not sufficiently pliable to be useful, while others are too soft and little better han rags. The brush for service should never be broader than the medium sizes usually sold, nor over two thirds their length. The bristles should be elastic and their ends rimmed in serrations, or 'notched'ï¿½this form being best adapted to the shape of the teeth. In use, the brush should be pressed firmly gainst the teeth, commencing with the back nes at their cervical borders, and with a emi rotary motion slowly brought forward nd toward their grinding edges in such a ing of man, that '' none doeth good no not one. ' Believing this to be true as the iiispir ed testimony from God1, it could not be expected that good works wrought ou by the cross, through a discipline of the mind, would ever be in very great de maud. The moral quality which makes man regard his brother man with more or less consideration comes through his civilization and education. As good as this may be it is not the spirituality that is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Moses in his wilderness journey permitted his people to demand an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. It was not a matter of retaliation, springing from a spirit of revenge, but rather a punishment inflicted to coi respond to the transgression. While Jesus commended this course for those who believed in Moses, he at the same time said, that if they would be his disciples they must pray for those who were their persecutors. They must seek for the Kingdom of God and its righteousness. In this they had the promise of abundant treasures in earthly wealth, and the additional assurance of Eternal Life_ With him the preaching and practice were in divine unison. To do right was the righteousness of God. In this work the disciples were carried above the pleasures of time and sense and under the inspiration of the divine spirit became the beautiful lights of Christianity and able to publish the good news and glad tidings. For this, Jesus was well pleased to compare them to a city, built so high upon the hill that it could not possibly be hid from view. They had become a light to the world, and this is what Christianity should be at the present time. manner as to force from between them accumulations that have found lodgment there; also allowing the bristles to come in contact with all enamel surfaces possible to reach. Rapid horizontal dashes should be avoided. A brush furiously driven across the teeth touches only points of enamel that least require rubbing, leaving the accumulations that load their interstices undisturbed and unmolested. It is not the frequency of brushing that best preserves the teeth, but the degree of thoroughness with which it is done. The time for performing this duty most effectively is just before retiring for the night. During the twelve hours interval from the evening meal to the morning repast, particles of food retained about the teeth, and subjected to the warm, humid condition of the oral cavity, cannot fail to become decomposed or fermented, thus breeding an insidious foe that, night after night, besieges the enamel walls which, unless of extraordinary compactness, will sooner or later give way to its destructive forces. There is no objection to cleansing the teeth when making the morning toilet, yet if thoroughly cared for the night before, they require comparatively little of such attention in the early part of the day. To brush them more frequently than this is a needless task. 1 Dr. C. E. Francis, in The Independent Practitioner.
