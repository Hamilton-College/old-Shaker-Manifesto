WATCHMAN WHAT OF THE NIGHT. The outgoing and incoming epoch. Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, the morning cometh, and also the night.ï¿½Isaiah zxi., 11-12. Question. Watchman, upon the bastion height Of Salem's bulwarks, what of the night? Can you see upon the horizon far What the signs and the indications are? Is there aught amid the gloom profound That attracts your attention, sight or sound? Answer. Traveler up the mountain height, Threading your way through the gloom of night, THE MANIFESTO. I know your intense anxiety, And will answer calmly and truthfully. I see on the dusky brow of night Fitful flashes of lurid light, Shedding a baleful glare on the sky As of a coming catastrophe. And faintly, but distinctly, I hear Sounds in the murky atmosphere. Sounds as of angry bees in a swarm; Or the war in the woods of a coming storm.. Question. Watcher, on Salem's bulwarks high, What do these symbols signify? Answer. The strife of peoples, and nations, and kings, In the struggle for earth's material things. Vengeance ! for long pent-up arrears Of human suffering, sighs and tears; Of social injustice, oppression and wrong; Of the weak deprived of right by the strong; Of people made desperate with want, And solemn hypocrisy, folly and cant. The bitter, fierce, destructive cry Of the gathering hosts of anarchy. The salaried minions of the law, Hired to hold the mobs in awe. The laborers restless discontent; And the coming of that final event When the people shall rise and in their wrath Shall sweep their oppressors from their path: And thrones and kingdoms shall pass away In that awful, social judgment day. Question. Guardian sentinel, what shall be The signs of this terrible prophecy? Ansiver. A general moral delinquency In the structure and state of society. Scepticism and unbelief Shall bring religious systems to grief. The agnostic and the iconoclast, Shall sweep away the faith of the past. Fanaticism of various kinds, Shall take possession of morbid minds. A general rottenness permeate The character of the church and state. 133 134 THE MANIFESTO. Question. Answer. The judge and the culprit at the bar, Shall stand on the same social par. The clergyman, smiling, smooth and bland, With iniquity shall go hand in hand. The legislation of the day, Shall be for partisan plunder and pay. Doubt, distrust and suspicion be The sentiment of society. Defalcation and robbery Shall be the order of the day. None shall dare his friend to trust, None believe the other just. All confidence in human kind Shall be abolished from the mind. The secret wickedness of the times, Shall come to the surface in horrible crimes; Adultery, murder and suicide. By every hearth-stone shall abide. The rich shall grow more moan and hard, The poor from comfort be debarred. The reckless classes, (a dreadful brood,) Be ready and rife for the reign of blood ; Revenge and hate shall fan the fire Of brutal passion and beastly desire. A feeling of insecurity Shall permeate society. An apprehension of coming change, Undefined, uncertain, strange; Presentiment of the final collapse Of the nation ; and something worse, perhaps, Shall fill the mind with general gloom, And hang over all like the pall of the tomb. These are some of the social signs That shall mark the age as it declines Toward its final end, and close In dissolution's dissolving throes. Watcher, whose vision sweeps the sky, Can you tell the time of this prophecy? That no being has power to tell, Save the One who is Infallible. With that you have nothing whatever to do. The mission and work that is given to you, THE MANIFESTO. 135 Is to find the people of God, and prepare A place of refuge and safety, where Their weary, wandering feet may go, In these terrible days of darkness and woe. That they may know in whom to trust; May know who are the righteous and just. May know where they may surely find Spirits of similar heart and mind. And there the Covenant bond renew, With sainted souls elect and true. And where within their blest retreat They in fraternal love may meet; Secure from prowling beasts of prey, Whose object is the sheep to slay. Ask no further questions of me, But do your duty faithfully. Behold the approach of dawning light! The morning cometh, and also the night! Celestus.
