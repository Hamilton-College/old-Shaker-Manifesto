Oatmeal as an article of diet... Oatmeal as an Article Of Diet.â€”It is surprising how enormously the consumption of oatmeal has increased in our cities within the past few years ; but we suspect that its merits as a cheap and highly nutritious food are not so generally appreciated in the country. Every one knows how generally it is eaten in Scotland, and in some parts of England it is equally popular as an article of diet. A correspondent of an English paper says : 'In West Cumberland, Westmoreland, and North Lancashire, especially in the rural parts, it forms the staple of our food, not only amongst the laboring classes, but also in the families of tradesmen and the well-to-do; the children of most of them have porridge at least once a day. For the past forty years I have made my breakfast of a pint of oatmeal porridge, with very rare exceptions, and nothing else, fasting for four hours afterwards. If, however, I take any other form of breakfast, I find myself very hungry before the next meal, which is never the case when I have had my porridge. I feel assured that if the laborers of the southern counties, with their children, w uld but take a basin of oatmeal and milk porridge night and morning, with such other food as they can procure in the interval, we should have a much stronger and healthier race of men and women than now exists. A few years ago I had a Devonshire girl living with me as a servant. The girl was willing enough to work, but had not the stamina to perform it. This I found, on questioning her, arose from the deficient and ill-advised diet on which she had been reared. She shortly began to take her porridge night and morning, and this, with a daily mid-day meal of meat, enabled her to perform her duties with ease,'
