Louisville, Ky., Feb. 15, 1877 Dear Bro. Eades: I have this day received another evidence of your kindness in the welcome visit of that highly-prized periodical, The Shaker. I recognize my indebtedness to you for its regular visits, which afford me so much instruction, refresh my spiritual man, point me to a purer, higher life, and elevate my aspirations above that sordid and sensual plane upon which humanity plods its weary way to the grave. I feel that I cannot sufficiently thank you for having placed that periodical in my hands. But for you its existence might have been unknown to me, and I would have been deprived of that valuable information which I receive from its columns, It is no ordinary periodical, intended to advocate mere selfish human interests. It isnot set for the defence of worldly organizations, founded for the acquisition of worldly honors,~\ emoluments, or personal aggrandizements ; but it is a harbinger of the reign of peace, purity, and true holiness; and I earnestly wish it may find its way into every professed Christian home ; that it will reach thousands of firesides, where at present it is unknown. You will excuse me for saying that with all due deference to the judgment of the publisher, I think the selection of the present quarto form instead of octavo was injudicious, and is regretted by many friends of the periodical. Its present form makes it very ephemeral, and from being frequently folded and unfolded in its perusal, it is soon and easily worn out, and few of its subscribers have an opportunity of reading the pages a second time, though much of its matter is worthy of being read many times, and preserved in a bound volume. In its present shape it would make, if bound, a large, cumbersome, and unhandy volume of 11 1-2 by 15 inches. By changing the form to an octavo it would be 7 1-2 by 11 inches. It might then be read and laid aside for subsequent perusals previous to being bound. * * * I make these suggestions only on account of my high appreciation of the work, and my firm belief that the matter contained in it is worthy of frequent perusal; and will make any man or woman better, who shall diligently study its teachings, and act upon the principles inculcated therein. Present my kind regards to Elder Jno. R. Cooper, and believe me to be fraternally thine, J. H. B. Elder H. L. Eades. [We would make all Kentucky stare if we should print the above initials in full nameâ€” and we do not care for the stare particularly; but hope that The Shaker may find its way into a good many more homes in Kentucky, and be as highly appreciated as by this highly-honored individual, equally well by state and nation!
