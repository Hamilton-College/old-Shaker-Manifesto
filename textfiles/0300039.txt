'ASK, AND YE SHALL RECEIVE.' Very good. But how shall we ask ? Earth, and Heaven, are literally deluged with words. Heaven, especially, is fearfully bored with words — words — words — everlastingly teasing the Lord for blessings — Blessings, he can never bestow, without violating Heaven's organic law. And he won't do that. Blessings, as well as cursings, are the result of conditions. ' Whatsoever a man soweth, that also shall lie reap.' And so of women. ' Blessed are the pure in heart.' Already blessed — Blessed all the time. And their blessing crops out in their lives. ' In blessing, ye shall be blessed.' No better way to ask a blessing than to bless humanity, in general — and every body in particular — by doing all the good you can. By being examples of righteousness, worthy of all imitation. O. P.
