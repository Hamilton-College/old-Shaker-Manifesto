Harvard, Mass. July 12. Dear Elder Henry :�The present month finds us busy in the hay field. We started this year in good earnest and in good time. If the weather continues as good the remainder of the week as thus far we will have secured a hundred tons of good hay which will tell the hay story for this year. Our crops are looking beautifully. Potatoes about the size of hen's eggs. Corn never looked better. The sister-hood are engaged in their annual duties.�Picking over the herbs preparatory to pressing and papering which takes all hands with the exception of kitchen sisters. Our Laundry which was the last memento of our good and worthy Elder Elijah is the model of neatness, which we b:y heavily to the charge of the sister-hood We have just hi 1 a parting farewell to a company of gospel friends from Mt. Lebanon frrm whom we received much good. We found them wide awa/ce in gospel truths and ever ready to minister them to the hungry, needy soul. May good angels attend them throughout their Eastern j mrney Your dear, good paper is ever welcome to our home. We hail the tidings from each Society as a union feast. A. Barrett.
