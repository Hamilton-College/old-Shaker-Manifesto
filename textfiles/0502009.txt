HINTS TO WRITERS ' Most writers not accustomed to the press imagine that a newspaper article, like an oration, should have an exordium, an argument, and conclusion. Not at all. The argument is all that is wanted. That is state your case, say your say, and stop. Do not take time and space to get into the subject, and more to get out of it; but come to it instantly, and stop when you are done. ' Be short. The time is short, the world is very fast now, and readers of newspapers do not want long articles. Pack your thoughts into short words, short sentences and short essays. If you never do a great thing never do a long thing. ' Come to the point. If you have no point, lay down the pen and do something else, rather than write. It is not every one who can write for edification' and you may not be one who can. '• Write the article two or three times over carefully, making it shorter each time. Write on one side only of the paper. Write legibly. Keep a copy of what you send to the press. Editors do not return manuscripts. We cannot undertake to, and we so state every week, but are every week asked to. It is impossible to make the reasons plain to writers ; but it is out of the question. ' Be very modest in your estimate of your own productions, and do not fret if others esteem them even less than you do.'— N. Y. Observer.
