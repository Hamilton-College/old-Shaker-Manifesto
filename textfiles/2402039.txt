A PROFOUND YOUNGSTER. There was a convention of Sunday school teachers in session at Crystal Lake, and all the teachers of the three counties represented were there. The amount of ^biblical and theological knowledge they had was something astounding. On the last day of the convention the high chief ranger of the affair announced to the four hundred delegates that he would be pleased to have the knowing ones think up some hard questions on subjects pertaining to their work, write them on slips of paper and submit them to him, and that evening, at the last session, which was to be a sort of entertainment, he would answer them. A lot of people wrote their questions and gave them to the great professor, and when evening came he had about fifty good old gnarly problems in his bunch of paper slips. The evening's exercise began with reading and answering the questions, and though some of them were from away back and very obtuse, the good man who had put himself up there as a mark, coped with them successfully and impressed the great gathering with his vast knowledge. Finally he ran against a question that made him knit his brows. He scowled at it a moment and then laid it aside. When he answered all the rest he picked up this side-tracked query and said: 'Here is a question which I confess I am unable to answer. I submit it to the audience, and if any one is able to give the answer I will be glad to hear what it is.' Then he read this query: 'Who was the boy and what was his name who held the basket containing the five loaves and two fishes which fed the multitude?' Nobody made any effoï¿½t to answer it, and the professor said: 'It seems that nobody knows any more about it than I do. I will have to call on *he person who submitted the question to come forward and answer it. Will you please do so?'' THE MANIFESTO. 51 To the great surprise of the four hundred people and of his mother as well, Frank Jones, a thirteen year old school boy, got up and modestly walked up the aisle. Everybody looked at him amazed. The professor said: 'Did you submit this question?' 'Yes, sir.' 'Can you answer it?' 'Yes, sir.' 'Well, I am sure everybody will be glad to hear it.' 'The boy,' said Frank quietly but steadily, 'was Ben Ezra, son of Miriam, who was a sister of Philip, one of the twelve disciples.' A murmur of astonishment ran over the audience. Here was something too deep for even the professed theologians in convention assembled. The professor turned to the boy: 'Did you find that in the Bible?' 'No, sir.' 'Where, then, did you get it?' 'In Greek history?' That was the cap sheaf. A lad of thirteen bowling down four hundred declared teachers in the Christian cause, and telling them in an unassuming way that he dug the information out of Greek history. I think it will be well to give this boy room to spread himself when he becomes a man. Chicago Mail.
