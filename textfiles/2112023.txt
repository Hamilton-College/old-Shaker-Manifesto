Shaker Station, Conn. Nov. 1891. 'Watch in all things.' It is impossible to progress heavenward without constant watchfulness. If we would see and know ourselves as we are seen and known of God, we must constantly watch our hearts, our passions and appetites. Prayer and watching will save us from many wrong steps and much misery. We need the enlightening influences of the Holy Spirit to enable lis to discern that which is excellent and 'hold fast that which is good.' Prayer and watchfulness is the armor for the battle of life. ' There was one hour in which it was the North Family. And privilege and duty of the disciples to watch and pray with their suffering Savior. But they slept, and so he said, 'Sleep on and take your rest,' as much as to say, your opportunity is past. Watch, said Jesusï¿½and well we may. Our greatest opportunities may come to us to-day. 4641 spaces of cream were sold in October. 918 bushels of apples have been dried. Our apple crop will exceed 4000 bushels. Warmth, proper food and cleanliness mean success in poultry raising. Cabbage is indispensable as a relish for hens, and a sufficient supply should be stored to feed during the winter. Gravel should be placed in barrels and scattered on the ground occasionally. Bran, with ground oats and meat scraps 'steamed in milk is an excellent mixture for hens. About one hundred hens for an acre is considered to be the right number. D. Orcutt. SoTitli Family. Nov. 1891. The November number of our Manifesto has arrived richly laden with good things, and is a reminder of the duty to produce something of interest in and about home. The blessings which ever attend the faithful are ours, and our hearts swell with gratitude and thankfulness to God for his precious gifts of peace, plenty, and health. Winter again gives signs of approach, a steady cold spell warns us to secure our crops. Corn is nearly all husked. 50 tons of beets and carrots are in the cellar, also 1000 bushels turnips. Winter apples in great abundance are secured, and cider apples so plenty it has made it unprofitable to gather and haul to the mills. Very little rain has fallen this Autumn making it a favorable opportunity for pushing along the fall work, but causing fears of a short supply of water during the winter. It is good for us to feel our dependence under Divine providence, on our own exertions for temporal and spiritual blessings. M. W.
