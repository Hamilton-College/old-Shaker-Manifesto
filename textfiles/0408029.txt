SELF-DENIAL If we make progress God-ward, it will be through self-denial, the opposite of self-indul- gence. The all-wise God has given laws to regulate and govern our actions. If we study and obey those laws we shall find protection, and be saved from the sorrows and troubles that all feel who violate them. We, as dependent beings, are but small particles in God's universe of intelligence, and can do nothing without the aid of his Spirit to quicken and animate our souls. We may be endowed with intellect and natural talent, but unless we cultivate the moral and spiritual part of our being, we do not answer the design for which we were created, and shall be accountable for the non-improvement of our highest faculties. If we realize our dependence, and in childlike simplicity ask assistance, believing that He who hears the cry of the raven, and clothes the lily of the vale, will also hear and reward us if we diligently seek, then we shall realize the truth of the promise,'Ask and ye shall receive.' By denying the cravings of the carnal mind we triumph over the lower passions which yield no abiding pleasure, and make room in our hearts for God's Spirit to dwell, which, by degrees, will educate and lead us into all truth and teach that we were created for a noble purpose â€” to find and occupy a sphere above the animal plane. Laying aside worldly wisdom and seeking through child-like innocence and trust, for the wisdom of God, the understanding becomes enlightened, and doubts and fears are dispelled from the mind. We find that it requires strong faith and as great self-denial in us (as it did in Abraham of old) to make a full sacrifice and^ivi the whole heart to God. But those who thus dedicate all will receive a great reward. Their souls will be as a watered garden, they will be neither barren nor unfruitful, but will eat and drink of living bread and waters and thirst no more. Mary Middleton, Union Village, Ohio
