GOLDEN SAYINGS 'SEE! I HAVE CULLED THE FLOWERS THAT PROMISED BEST.' One of the best ' confessions of faith ' ever devised, is a straightforward, useful, cheery, consistent Christian life, seven days in the week. __I would not give much for your religion unless it can be seen. Lamps do not talk, but they do shine. A light-house sounds no drum, it beats no gong, and yet, far over the waters, its friendly spark is seen by the mariner.

'None were born to command the Golden Rule; but all to obey it.' —S. A. Weal. ... The principles of godliness are as old as time, and new as the moment. — Ibid.
