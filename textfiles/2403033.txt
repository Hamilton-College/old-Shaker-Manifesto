At a certain prayer meeting... [Contributed by Lucy Miller.] At a certain prayer meeting a man noted for his failures to meet business obligations rose to speak. The subject was, 'What shall I do to be saved?' He commenced slowly to quote the words, 'What shall I do to be saved?' He paused, looked around, and said again, 'What shall I do to be saved?' Again, with more solemn tone he repeated the question of questions, when a voice from the assembly, in clear and distinct tones, replied, 'Go and pay John Williams for that yoke of oxen.' The incident stirs up solemn thought. A great many people before they can be saved, or guide others to the Savior, will have to 'go and pay John Williams' the money they honestly owe him. Shrewd tricksters in the marts of the world are not shrewd enough to be dishonest at heart and retain the favor of God, who 'loves purity in the inward parts.' Neither can a hope of the world to come be like a slieet anchor in the soul of any one who robs God by being dishonest to his fellow-man. Thousands read no other Bible than the lives of those who profess to be following Christ's precepts in their daily lives. The greatest need of the church is true, pure, upright livingï¿½'living epistles, known and read of all men.' The 'square' man is the best shape. The tree is known by its fruit. 'Go thcu and pay John Williams.' The Sunlight.
