Arabian Maxims The little which suffices is better than the much which disturbs us. The best possession is a sincere friend. The eulogium made on the absent, serves to incline our hearts to the present. The best of riches is contentment, the worst of poverty is low spirits. Labor for this life as if thou wert to live forever; and for the other, as if thou wert to die to-morrow. Desire not either the wise man or the fool for thine enemy, but guard thyself equally from the cunning of the wise man and the ignorance of the fool. The man who contents himself to-day with that which he has, will content himself to- morrow with that which he may have.
