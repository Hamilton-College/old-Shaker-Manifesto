THE GLAD SONG. ENFIELD, N. H. Beautiful and lovely are thy courts O Zion! Purity is written on thy walls, Purity and Love, Holiness, Holiness unto the Lord. Come Zion's inmates, swell ye the song, The glad song of triumph and praise, For now is come salvation, the kingdom of our God, Glorious fulness of days.
