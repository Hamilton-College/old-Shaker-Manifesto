East Canterbury N. H. Feb. 1899. Candlemas Day dawned 'fair and clear' so, according to the prophecies of the ancient weather-wise, we are still to expect winter. One storm came into line on the 7th, as if to verify the time-honored couplet; 'If Candlemas Day dawn fair and clear Beware, for winter has not been here.' At date, 14th, the elements are conspiring to furnish us with an old-fashioned blizzard, which opened its first act Sunday a. m. It brings one keen disappointment on its snowy wings, however, since it necessitates a postponement of the longanticipated visit of our beloved Central Ministry, who had agreed to be with us on the 15th. Still, 'the storm will not always last,' and our loving welcomes are safely deposited in the bank of Heart and Home, which issues all payments with compound interest. Despite the inclemency of the weather our worthy Brother, John Bradford, has found his way from Enfield, N. H., and ii now securely environed with us on the hill from which, happily, there is no escape for him at present. We are always much pleased when our good friends call this way, and when our influence is not strong enough to hold them we willingly accept foreign aid even when it takes the guise of huge snowdrifts.
