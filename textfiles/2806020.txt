In the days of Slavery... the days of Slavery, Canaan New Hampshire Academy was broken up for the unpardonable sin of admitting a few colored pupils on equal terms with the white, by vote of the people in legal town meeting assembled. The edifice was lifted from its foundations, and by three hundred men and a hundred yoke of oxen was hauled out of tow. Acts of Anti-Slavery Apostles.
