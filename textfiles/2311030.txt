South Union, Ky. Oct. 1893. These has been much sickness in our home this fall and of a malarial type, yet no deaths have occurred. The season in some respects has been an eventful one. The spring was a continuous downpour of rain and at one time it seemed as though we should never get anything planted. Then came a severe drought which injured the crops, and yet as a whole they are quite good. We are now preparing the ground for sowing wheat and shall put in about four hundred acres. Sweet potatoes will all be housed the coming week an 1 we shall have a medium crop. Irish potatoes poor. Apples an entire failure. James H. Richardson. Oct. 1893. Cleae, calm and beautiful. Did autumn ever produce a lovelier, fairer day. What is life without external beauty? and the calm of inner consciousness, that love is universal and sympathetic. Come ye and 'partake of the waters of life freely,' in this our august home. But I must leave the abstract for the concrete. It was said of a man in the long-ago that he went out to sow, and his seed fell on different kinds of ground. He sowed his seed broadcast. But we are putting in ours with the drill; and putting fertilizer with it, to make it bring forth an hundred fold. The sound of the hammer, too is heard in the land. The Office Sisters took up the spirit of improvement and put new partition fences in their chicken yard, and it is a thing of beauty as well as of use. The Trustee too caught the contagion of improvement and is putting a new roof on the smoke-house and family wood shed. The shrill, loud whistle of the engine and heavy thud and rumble of the drill rod tells the passer by that we are going to have a new well at the Office barn. Last year we had one drilled at the Office, and got good water. James Carr. Center House. Oct , 1893. Deab Eldek Henky;ï¿½While terrible storms have devastated the coast of our Southland, bringing great destruction of property, and loss of life, and while a dreaded epidemic has visited cities of the South, bringing fear into many hearts, THE MANIFESTO. 2G7 and destroying many lives, I am glad to tell you, that we have met with no serious disasters. While the tide of travel has turned towards the World's Fair, carrying thousands to behold the treasures of art, and the wonders of the world, we have stayed at home to provide for returning wants, to tend the sick, and to lay up stores for the coming winter. Here, at this season nature is lovely. Many brilliant colors enrich the landscape. The varied hues of leaves and flowers, tinted with beauty, delight the eyes. Truly this is a beautiful world in which we live! But soon the frosts will come. This might lead us to moralize upon the growth and decay of all sublunary things. All that is bright must fade. We live and grow, and pass away. The aged among us are passing away. But, to come to business matters. It is a blessing to know that we are clear of debt, which is so harrassing to the mind and chilling to the energies, and which causes many sleepless nights. Many acres of wheat land have been sowed; with fertilizer put in; some sweet potatoes dug. Owing to the many hot days of summer, the crop is good. We are cutting corn for stock. New roofs are being put on some buildings, and many necessary repairs taking place. We have the necessaries of life in abundance. Plenty of milk, honey and butter, and we should be thankful. Let us be cheerful and hopeful, and enjoy the good things of life in an innocent manner. The children were delighted with the usual autumn holiday, to revel in the forest. This outing is a recreation and pleasure to them. School is now in session. We have had two cases of typhoid fever recently in the North Family, and some other sickness. T. R. Mac Rae.
