Enfield, Conn. May 8, 1891. With abundant reason for thankfulness for the blessings which surround us on every hand we are progressing heavenward. The scenery is delightful at the present time, trees in full bloom on every side, and although two severe frosts have visited our section of the Connecticut valley the past week, we do not despair of having some cherries and pears, but peaches will probably be a failuie. The work of potato planting has been very much assisted by the new Planter, which works well, and is a success. Oats are in and stocked down some ten days ago. Grass is looking well, and with a little rain now will be of great value to vegetation. The apple trees are coming forward, and hopes are entertained of a good yield. Our new Lawn Mower is highly prized in keeping the grass in good order around the dwellings. To beautify home within and without, is the duty of all Christians, therefore we would improve each and every opportunity to cleanse the sanctuary, that we may make those around us cheerful and happy, and also have a greeting ready for any who may come to seek for truth. M. Witham.
