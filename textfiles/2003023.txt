Harvard, Mass. I gratefully acknowledge the mutual benefit derived from 'notes about home' through the medium of the Manifesto. The results of experience and experiments in every department of life interest all�are aids to help keep abreast of the improvements of the times. Success and failures are our educators. Lessons of warning should prevent running our heads against the same post�the post of 'ill luck' too often. So we may all profit by information, investigation and observation, often saving time and trouble. There has been some changes and improvements in Society recently. And had we the experience at the start, that we now have, we might have done better with less expense. We have painted nine buildings in the Church family, four at the South family. Have put up a wind-mill for pumping water at the Euial Home. Piped the house and barn, enlarged the ice house, repaired and painted the buildings. Put in a new stone dam, layed in cement at the saw mill. Built a silo, and repaired the barn generally. Have laid a new system of sewerage for the main dwelling, with six inch Akron pipe. Have utilized the hitherto useless room in the basement of the Herb House, by putting in a twenty horse boiler, and a six horse engine, for heating dwelling, shop and bathroom, and power for the herb business, and laundry. Have arranged two bath-rooms closets, &amp;c, &amp;c. The laundry drying room is a highly appreciated success. The room is 8x8 feet and 8 feet high has seven double clothes racks. The drying is done by exhaust steam, with an eighteen inch fan to produce circulation, and carry away the moisture. The clothes are all dry soon afier the washing ii done. I wish to express my gratitude to my many kind and solicitous friends, some of whom came to see me in my late illness. Elijah Myrick.
