CALL OF THE SPIRIT Otis Sawyer Aug. Blase, 1. Let me treasure joys eternal, 2. Never period more momentous, 3. Let the self-exalted spirit, 4. Fleeting, fading, evanescent, Let me drink of waters pure, Louder ne'er the spirit's call, Fall before the throne of God, Are the alluring scenes of time, 5! Feigned your love to God in heaven, If you fail the least to love, Let my love in God be boundless, Build upon foundations sure. Lo a voice is heard from heaven, Zion rise both great and small. Let the doubting, double minded, Cleanse their hands and with God's word Carnal joys in pangs resulting, Sink the soul in sin and crime Of your brothers or your sisters, With a pure angelic love More in earnest be devoted, Consecrated heart and soul, Shake yourselves from sloth and slumber, Shake from selfishness and pride, Cut asunder flesh and spirit, That the piercing light of truth O, for strength to lift the fallen, O, for balm to heal each wound, O, let earnest prayers be offered, That conviction like a wave, Every moment filled with breathing, That God's power may thro' me roll. Talents which the Lord has given, No more in a napkin hide. May reveal their false position, And in honesty come forth. O, for faith by which to waken, That they hear the gospel sound. May roll on and touch each conscience, Sure to quicken, strong to save.
