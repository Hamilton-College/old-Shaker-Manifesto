Necessity and Origin of Government in our Community. OLIVER C. HAMPTON. Common version.�' Axr&gt; without all contradiction the less is blest of the better. ' Heb. vii., 7. Revised version.� 'But without any dispute the less is blest of the better. ' Syriac Testament. �'But it is beyond controveisy that the inferior is blest by his superior. ' Here are three statements of a law running, so far as we can see, through the entire Universe of sentient being. Indeed it may be said to dominate all conditions of finite existence. This law is sometimes expressed by the terms positive and negative, as of the Electricities, which are exactly the same in essence, and differ only in quantity and force, and so of all things else, capable of comparison. Their relation is one of less and greater. This law of relation is evidently and especially traceable in the vegetable and animal kingdoms. In the animal the relation of offspring to progenitor is one of helpless dependence. That of progenitor to offspring is one of fostering inierest and love. When these relations are properly seasoned by Wisdom andLove, they result in ties of affection which cannot be dissolved in time or eternity. By being so modified these relations admit of a wise and loving dictation on the part of the greater to the less, and an equally wise and loving obedience to, and compliance with, such dictation, on the part of the less to the greater. This law is so natural, so inevitably rich in blessings, that were it not for the rude coarse nature of undisciplined man, we should all be so sweetly attracted thereby as to move together in obedience and conformity thereto, in the same harmony and beauty and glory and gladness in which the planets move in their orbits around their sun, and sun, planets and all revolve around still greater systems and so on to infinity. But alas ! how imperious we are inclined to be in the use of our authority over our fellow beings and how very little are we inclined to submit ourselves to helpful and needful discipline and obedience to those who are able to lead aud direct us in paths of peace we could not otherwise find, even though such may not always be blessed with that amount of wisdom and love we might suppose they ought to possess at all times. Nevertheless these unfortunate facts and conditions in no way excuse us from a compliance with the great law under ^consideration, neither do they militate in the least against the philosophy of the positive necessity as well as blessing of such law. I have not the shadow of a doubt that were we all as we should be, and shall be some of these days, either in time or eternity, we should feel the force and heavenly attraction of this sublime law and should so sweetly and spontaneously respond to its serene dictates, as to feel the force of no power or authority external to ourselves�but merely the Divine attraction of the 'less to the better.' Any one wishing to learn music, painting, or anything worthy his attention and effort does not hate his preceptor as a tyrant, but loves him as a teacher who is wiser and more experienced than himself, and one whose direction and instruction it is his pleasure and benefit to follow. There is no slavish obedience on one side, nor haughty dictation on the other. It is only benevolent and sympathetic counsel and instruction aud guidance on the part of the teacher aud loving peaceful and pleasurable compliance on the part of the taught. Now this is really the whole foundation of what among Believers is generally denominated the visible Order of the Church consisting of Ministry, Elders, Deacons, Brethren and Sisters. There may be many graces and beauties to which we have not yet attained ; there may be also many defects of character among leaders and led, which go to mar the beauty and success of its consoling, saving and redeeming processes ; yet the inevitable outcome is surely the glorious and happy culmination hinted at above, a culmination to be reached by all who in patience and perseverance endure to the end. Things might be differently manipulated, provided we had all been endowed with a power of infinite independence of each other. But alas ! ' God never made an independent man 'Twould mar the beauty of the general plan. Some are wonderfully exercised over the idea of losing their individuality by being merged into the conditions of a Community, including the observance of those rules and by-laws necessary for its success and perpetuity, and also including the law by which 'the less is blessed of the better. ' My ideas on this point, which are result of 0&gt;2 years experience and observation in the practical and actual life of a Community, are exactly the reverse of the above anxiety about losing one's individuality. It is of all cases and places by far the best experience for developing one's individuality. We have an excellent opportunity to bring every shaky, unstable principle to the altar of self-sacrifice, so that when we are through with it all, we find that all that is in our Heaven and Earth 'that can be shaken, has been shaken and shaken to pieces, so that that which could not and cannot be shaken may remain.' At this sta;e of our experience we find ourselves in possession of a completely rounded out individuality, and perfectly free from every fitful fugitive vagary of both flesh and spirit. We find ourselves indeed soaring among the bright clouds of perfect independence of all rudimental proclivities and sailing on the wings of progress to higher and higher attitudes of glory and perfection forever.
