Ten rules for farmers __Ten rules for farmers. 1. Take good papers, and read them. 2. Keep an account of farm operations. 3. Do not leave implements scattered over the farm, exposed to snow, rain, and heat. 4. Repair tools and buildings at a proper time, and do not suffer subsequently threefold expenditure of time and money. 5. Use money judiciously, and do not attend auction sales to purchase all kinds of trumpery because it is cheap. 6. See that fences are well repaired, and cattle not grazing in the meadows or grain fields or orchards. 7. Do not refuse to make correct experiments, in a small way, of many new things. 8. Plant fruit-trees well, care for them, and of course get good crops. 9. Practice economy by giving stock shelter during the winter; also good food, taking out all that is unsound, half rotten, or mouldy. 10. Do not keep tribes of cats and snarling dogs around the premises, which eat more in a month than they are worth in a life-time. Journal of Chemistry.
