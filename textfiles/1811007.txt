A GOLDEN SHEAF GARNERED HOME. In Memory of Eldress HESTER ANN ADAMS. Ada Cummings. Lo! the Reaper came at night-fall With his sickle in his hand. See ! he thrusts it in and garners The choicest fruit of all the land. In his arms he bears our Mother, Gently as a sheaf of grain. She has heard the joyful summons Freeing her from earthly pain. O the joj she feels at greeting, Those we're sure were there to guide, O the happiness of meeting Loved ones on the other side. As she meets our own beloved, Will she look this way again, On her little stricken umber She has left in tears of pain? Fast the drops fall from the eye-lids, Anguish fills our every heart, And the throbbing grows more rapid, As with her we're called to part. She's at rest, why need we murmur? Our great loss to her is gain. Joy and peace has crowned her labors She in triumph now will reign. Gentle Mother, stay around us, Ret thy holy love divine, Rest upon thy needy people. Hold us still, securely thine. Thou hast been with us through pleasure, Drank with us the bitter too, Taught us by your pure example Precious soul! God blesses you! We shall miss thee, Angel Mother. Miss thy lovely smiling face. Miss thy words of consolation, Miss thy presence in this place As you near the shining portal, Keep thy little flock in view, In that land of light immortal, Find for us a place, with you. Joy to thee, sweet sainted Mother, Holy Angels sing with me, There, you see yon stately mansion, All prepared, awaiting thee. Enter thou in peace, forever, With thy jewels sparkling: bright Oh ! the splendor of their gleaming Far exceeds the stars of night. West Gloucester, Me.
