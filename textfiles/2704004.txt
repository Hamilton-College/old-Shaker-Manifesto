JESUS. By Frank O. Libbey. THOU shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'ï¿½Matt, i.,21. These are the words of the angel to Joseph the father of him whose birth nearly nineteen hundred years ago, is kept in remembrance by all Christian natious. Perhaps in some cases it is carried out in a spirit of selfishness, giving gifts to those of whom a return is expected or to those bound by natural ties only, instead of to the poor and needy. This day brings to our minds the manner of the birth and the lowly surroundings amid which our Savior was ushered into this world. Instead of a palace of wealth and luxury he had a manger for a birthplace, and his associations and work through life were among the lowly. The Jews had long lookt for a Ruler who was to come in great pomp and splendor, under whose leadership they were to become the most powerful nation of the world. When Jesus the son of the lowly carpenter declared that he was the long lookt for Messiah, they were filled with wrath, and would have killed him, had he not escaped from their midst. It also brings to our minds what the mission of Jesus was. He was sent to bring about a new older of things. The old Mosaic law was 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,' but Jesus said, 'love your enemies,' and do good to those who persecute or wrongfully use you ; to love, not only those who love you, but to love all. If some one injures or wrongs us, the natural man says, 'Resent it; injure him; pay him back.' The spirit of Christ says 'forgive him,' 'render good for evil.' It was this spirit he carried out in his daily life, so that he was able to pray for those who crucified him, 'Father forgive them, they know not what they do.' He was to save his people from their sins. To a large part of the profest Christians of the world this means being saved in their sins, or in other words, being saved from the awful punishment that would otherwise be meted out to them for their sins. That they were to be saved from sinning, by accepting Christ's life and ceasing from all sin was too much for the natural man to accept. By placing Jesus above his fellow men, and proving that he was born perfect, some even went so far as to call him God himself come to earth in human form and therefore, impossible for him to sin. Thus it was no use for poor fallen man to try to live as he lived, but that his death on the cross paid the whole debt. Altho sin they must; they will be saved from the consequences of their dpeds and get to heaven at last by simply, 'accepting Christ,' as they term it and believing on his blood that was shed on Calvary. Jesus said, 'Unless a man deny himself and take up his cross and follow me, he can not be my disciple.' These words were true then and they are true to-day. No one ever was or ever will be saved from his sins, except by ceasing to sin and accepting Christ's life and teachings and putting them into daily practice. Let us accept the spirit of the Christ with the resolve to bring our lives nearer to Christ. If we are inclined to speak hasty or unkind words, or to have hard or unkind feelings toward a brother or sister, think of him who could forgive even those who were cruelly taking his life. If some of us think that our lot is a hard one and we have more to contend with than others, let us think of what his trials were. We nerd more of the earnestness and zeal of those early saints who were ready even to the laying down of their natural lives for the cause of God, and the saving of their souls. When we think of the haidship and persecution they were willing to bear and of their thankfulness if they could but gain their soul's salvation, our greatest suffering seems small in comparison. I want all the world to know that I am striving to be a Christian and in this work I will go with you, dear gospel friends, through all the years to come, even to the end. Alfred, Me.
