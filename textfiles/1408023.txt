SUNRISE. MARION JOHNSON. Gilding the mountain tops With its roseate glow, Lighting up the valleys And the plain below; Sec! the sun-god riseth With his quickening power, Clothing earth in beauty; Opening bud and flower; Casting out the darkness Which the earth enshrouds, Flinging o'er the heavens Gold and silver clouds. Now the brilliant star-hosts One by one have gone� Fading in the splendor Of the glorious morn. O'er the rippling river In burnished rays of gold Now the sunlight glances,� Lovely to behold! How they dance and sparkle In its cheering beams ! How they gleam and glisten� BrooK, and rill, and streams ! Leafy groves and forests Murmer welcomes sweet As the sun-beams glimmer Through their calm retreat. AH the tuneful songsters Join the harmony, Warbling forth their praises In sweetest melody. Canterbury, N. H.
