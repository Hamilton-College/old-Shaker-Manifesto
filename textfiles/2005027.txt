Pleasant Hill, Ky. If our wheat crop was not killed it is supposed to be badly injured. The wheat fields look rich and yellow, and ready for the sickle. Peaches have met the same fate. N. D. B. IVtt. Letoanon, South Family. We have repaired the bridge going to Chair rooms. Are going to build a new shed on the wood house and take away the remains of old one. We have just been eating some shad, so you see all are not vegetarians as yet. We are all well.ï¿½S. A. C.
