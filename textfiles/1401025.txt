WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO. CHILDREN AND HOME CONVERSATION Children hunger perpetually for new ideas. They will learn with pleasure from the lips of parents what they deem drudgery to learn from books, and even if they have the misfortune to be deprived of many educational advantages, they will grow up intelli- gent if they enjoy in childhood the privilege of listening to the conversation of intelligent people. Let them have many opportunities of learning in this way. Be kind to them and do not think it beneath you to answer their little questions for they proceed from an implanted faculty which every true man and woman should take a great delight in cherishing.
