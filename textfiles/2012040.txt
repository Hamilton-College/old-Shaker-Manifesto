Deaths. Emily Sears Emily Sears, at Canaan, N. Y Oct. 25, 1890. Age 87 yrs. 'Mother' Emily as she was called, was a natural mother, but became one of the hundred fold spiritual nu tilers promised to the true disciple.ï¿½a promise only fulfilled to Believer's in Christ's Second Appearing. Forty-nine years age she heard the call ''Get thee out of thy country and from thy \kindn.d, forsake husband and children, houses and lands nml thine own life nls;&gt;.' Obedient to it, she came with her c unpanion a;i 1 eight children, and though living in the same Society, she never after recognized in them the old Adamic relationship. Her example as a genuine Believer could not well be excelled. In one of the 'many mansions' we find her to-d.-ty r; aping a further reward, and wearing a brighter crown than we as mortals can bestow.
