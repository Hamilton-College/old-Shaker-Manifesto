CHRISTMAS POEM. By Isabella Russell. What means this strong and mighty host, Of prophets, martyrs, bards and seers? Who've left their battlements on high To dwell amid Earth's darkened spheres; Whose clarion notes of peace and joy Resound thro'out Earth's vast domain; The blessed promise is fulfilled, Christ in his glory comes again! He comes, as in the olden time To meet our wants, our human needs, Comes, disregarding priestly rule, Ignoring useless man-made creeds, And in the spirit, and the power, Of consecrated Mother-love, Earth's erring children kindly leads To higher, purer joys above. The selfish plane of hoarded wealth, With all that follows in its train, True honor, virtue, manhood lost, Sure tell-tales of ill-gotten gain , The cry of poverty and woe, Has reached at last the Mother-heart , And Christ has come to rule and reign, Where woman wills, and acts her part, In consecrated deeds of love, In faithful service freely given, Foreshadowing Christ's kingdom here On Earth, as it is found in Heaven. No more a slave to any power, That bids her yield to man's control The gifts and talents God has given To bless and beautify the soul. In her own right she stands endowed With power and wisdom from on high, All ready at the Master's call To answer truly 'Here am I,' To dare, to do, for thee and thine, To minister to those in need, And in thy honored, sacred name, The naked clothe, the hungry feed. ,188 THE MANIFESTO. O waft ye winds to distant islesy The glad triumphant song of peace 'Which ushers in the newborn day, When love shall rule and discord cease. O spread the tidings far and near, Christ in his glory comes again ! Let every living thing rejoice, Let all the people say, Amen. Enfield, N. H.
