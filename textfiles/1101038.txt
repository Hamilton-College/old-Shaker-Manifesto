TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW Don't tell me of to-morrow ; Give me the boy who'll say That when a good deed's to be done, ' Let's do the deed to-day.' We may all command the present If we act and never wait; But repentance is the phantom Of a past that comes too late. Don't tell me of to-morrow; There is much to do to-day That can never be accomplished If we throw the hour away. Every moment has its duty; Who the future can foretell? Then why put off till to-morrow What to-day can do as well. Don't tell me of to-morrow ; If we look upon the past, How much we have left to do We cannot do at last. To-day ! — it is the only time .For all on this frail earth; It takes an age to form a life — A moment gives it birth.
