From the Little Children. MANNERS AT SCHOOL. We should not play in school when we are reading. We should not gaze. We should not disobey our teachers. We should sit erect. We should learn all our lessons before we play. We should not come to school before we have washed our hands and face. We should not bring play-things to school. When we come to school we should not run in school but walk. Johnnie Lorret. 8yrs. old.
