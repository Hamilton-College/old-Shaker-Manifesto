FIRE RECORD. On the night of the 18th of September at a little past 11 o'clock p. m., we were awakened by a wild cry of fire. It was at the old Brick Yard family which has been vacated for several years, but used as a store place for drying corn, roots etc. All the buildings of the Brick Yard family proper, were destroyed, except a small house. The Dwelling, Laundry, Dry kiln, Store-house, Seed-house, Sisters' dwelling, Brick shop and Office and the Office barn, with all their contents were entirely consumed. Brother Robert Valentine, Trustee, had all last year's crop of roots, his wagon, hay-racks and a large part of the farm tools and machinery, stored there. The value of the roots alone, was over fifteen hundred dollars. Most of the buildings belonged to the Church family. The Brick dwelling and Office, and the Office bnrn belonrred to the North family. The new barn put up by the North family some years ago was saved. The slate roof was its protection together with the earnest efforts of a few persons and a little water. All the buildings were insured, except the Brick dwelling and Office; which is one building. Total insurance paid, a little over five thousand dollars. It was undoubtedly set on fire. Daniel Offord.
