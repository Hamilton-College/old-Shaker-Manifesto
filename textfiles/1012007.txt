FATHER, FORGIVE THEM! L. L. B. BY 'Father, forgive them!' if these words were oftener breathed From the tried heart—from the weird mind with torture wreathed, From the deep soul, when pierced with selfish, vengeful wrong, Breathed those words divine in whispers, or in sweet song, They'd reach each sinning child, and turn to good ere long. 'Father, forgive them!' the power these words contain To reach the vilest heart—the darkest soul reclaim From imbred sin and crime—from deepest, poignant woe, To teach the erring truth—could saint and sinner know Their depth, their height, their worth, 'twould be the prayer below. 'Father, forgive them!' with His latest breath, he said ; With arms outstretched, and meekly, nobly bowing head : 'Oh, Father, forgive them, they know noc what they do!' While thorns were on His brow, His hands and feet pierced through,— In sorrow for Bis son, the Father God withdrew. 'Father, forgive them!' whether near or far away,— Those who have wronged us be it in our hearts to say, 'For they know not what they do,' whether good or ill, Only the Father knoweth whom He chasteneth still. 'Father, forgive them!'—'tis Thine it shall be our will.
