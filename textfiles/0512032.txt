Questions QUESTIONS. As a people, why do we shave — cut off our beards? Why do the Chinese shave their heads, as they do their faces? Why do Chinese females cripple their feet, and some females their waists? Why does not Nature give up the struggle of centuries, and let Anglo-Saxon and Chinese men be born minus surplus hair, and their females be born with wasplike waists, high heels, club-feet, and humps on their * * * * s, and on the back, of their heads? Does nature expect her children to become so sane that they can leave off a bad habit, without dropping a good one to balance it —progression without retrogression ?
