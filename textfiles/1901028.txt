A Convenient Calender and Stand A Convenient Calender and Stand. The most convenient, valuable, and novel business, table, or desk calendar for 1889, is the Columbia Bicycle Calendar and Stand issued by the Pope Mfg. Co., of Boston, Mass. The calendar proper is in the form of a pad of 365 leaves, one for each day. The leaves are 5%x2% inches, a portion of each is left blank for memoranda, and as the leaves are sewed at the ends, any entire leaf, as well as the memorandum blank, can be exposed whenever desired. The pad rests upon a portable stand, and when placed upon the desk or writing table the entire surface of the date leaf is brought directly before the eye, furnishing date and memoranda impossible to be overlooked. The upper portion of the stand is made of pressed pulp, with 'Columbia' in raised letters at the top, the whole handsomely gilded, and practically indestructible. Although this is the fourth year of the Columbia calendar, the quotations are fresh and new, and are interesting and instructive to the public as well as to the cycler. A departure is made this year, in that a portion of the quotations pertain to typewriting and stenography, with occasional reference to the new Becker typewriter made by the Pope Mfg. Co. The reading matter in no way interferes with the calendar, and the information contained on the leaves would, if placed in book type, make a fair sized volume.
