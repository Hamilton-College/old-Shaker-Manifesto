Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½The not too much of a good thing, which it has been our fortune to enjoy since we wrote you last, is the visit of Brothers Daniel Offord and Charles Greaves, with four sister companions from the North Family at Mt. Lebanon, who were at Canterbury from July 29 to August 5. It was only too good to last, as the children say, and so at the latter date they left us for a brief tarry at Shaker Station, as they journeyed homeward. It was not hard in their presence to believe that 'the pure in heart see God.' We blessed each other, as only the loyal who know the worth of loyalty can bless. How sweet the comfort of spiritual gifts and how blest the interchange. Bro. Daniel Offord spoke to us on the Sabbath, as a brother speaks to his friends where no cloaks are worn. One of our Brethren said in appreciation that he had heard many persons strike each side of the nail and in fact all around it, but never so squarely on the head as Bro. Daniel had done or did, upon the subject of 'Our United Inheritance.' Shall we send inquiry for Bro. Alonzo Hollister, who we hear is to journey this way? Rain fell nearly all day on Sat. July 26. On Thurs. July 31, took place the thunder shower and wind squall which did so much damage north of us. Two slight rainfalls only within the last two months. Hay is of extraordinary quality and stored in the barns in excellent condition. Corn is growing fast; sweet corn already ripe and White Rice pop corn eight feet tall. The pear and apple crops are light. Bro. George Clark speaks of 'a full crop of peaches' which we hope to realize. Blackberries plenteous and gatherers busy. We have little cause for complaint at any season, and are only desirous to forget earthly selfish interests and send out our sympathies in kindly solicitude for the relief of those who suffer and for the welfare of all mankind. We are thinking especially just now of the 'blessings in disguise' attending our dear western friends at Union Vill ge, Ohio In the death of one of their ablest leaders, we remember them in more than words, but whether we sorrow or rejoice, let us often sing 'To-day, though the vintage may fail, And answer to prayer seem to wait, Still let thy faith cheer thee to-day, God's blessings can never be late.' Two of our Sisters attended the Universalist camp meeting at the Weirs N. H., and responded to the kind invitation to take an active part.
