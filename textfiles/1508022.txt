NOTES NOTES. As was said of those who stood at the corners of the streets and in the synagogues, having a personal satisfaction in their protracted religious exercises, so it may be said, equally as well of the religious world of to-day, in their preaching, praying and singing. ''Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward. ' It is the reward that follows directly upon the consummation of the work. It is the self-consciousness of receiving that for which we have sought. If the work has been done in the interest of the children of this world, we can only look to them for a corresponding compensation. It seems to be an idle notion when one assumes to seek for that which they do not want, or to ask for that which they would not accept, History on its first pages records, most distinctly, the reward, or as we Avould say, the fruits of unrighteousness. The reward must come. Whether appreciated or not it must certainly come. There cannot be even the shadow of a mistake. Men in their wanderings have sometimes lost sight of the principles of righteousness, and have accepted darkness for light, and have even flattered themselves into the belief that they could violate the laws of God and yet remain unpunished. They entertained, only, a vague idea of the laws of retribution, and had written for themselves a formula which included a certain class of trespasses, and their consequent punishments. All these days of ignorance have been carefully mantled with charity, and the time has been when almost every form of transgression has received the commendation, either directly or indirectly, of the religious and irreligious world. In these times men ran rapidly on to destruction. A better day has dawned upon us. Ignorance no longer commands respect. Every man is expected to give a reason for the course that he pursues. To those who fear God, the sun of righteousness has arisen '' with healing in his wings.' Knowledge has accumulated and every department of the life of man is filled with light. He can if he so chooses walk the highway of peace and happiness, or take the road that leads to inevitable ruin. It was no idle word that Joshua spoke to the children of Israel, 'Choose ye this day whom ye will serve.' In this he gave them the privilege to exercise their own free will. To keep the laws of God in the discipline of their minds and bodies would protect them in all their rights and lead them successfully into the land of Canaan ;ï¿½a land flowing with milk and honey, while a .neglect of these laws would lead them into captivity and make them the slaves of their enemies. The history of man abounds with lessons of corresponding interest. At every step he finds himself face to face with God's law which plainly teaches the blessings that follow in the path of right doing, and no less the anxiety and sorrow that is sure to follow in the footsteps of the transgressor. Although there are instances where a penalty seems to pass over one generation that merits it and is inflicted on a future class who are not the active transgressors, yet this fact is being learned in its entirety and often to the deep sorrow of the afflicted. The good apostle was positive on this point, 'Whatsoever a man soweth that also shall he reap. ' 'If he sows to the spirit, he shall of the spirit reap life everlasting,' but if he sows to the world and the flesh he shall of the flesh reap corruption. Like begets like as the inevitable sequence of the law. Here again we have the most convincing evidence of the workings of the spirit of God. It cannot be thwarted. The simple minded man who had such a large appreciation of the beautiful, as to sow his field with thistle seed, gave to himself and to his posterity a great deal of hard work for which they received but a slight remuneration. Some men banter with their lives as a matter of the least importance. Carelessly and foolishly they move along from one degree of transgression to another, till they actually solicit the tempter to ensnare them. Others who glory in error, after finding that ' sentence is not executed speedily against an evil work ' allow themselves to entertain the falacious hope that no especial harm will ever arise from the course which they have chosen to pursue. Charmed into security by the voice of the syren, they easily fall into the broad way and pass on to destruction. 'Verily I say unto you, they have their reward. '
