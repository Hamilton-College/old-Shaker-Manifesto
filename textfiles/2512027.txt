Sanitary. TURKISH PORTERS. Captain Eea assures me that he never witnessed such feats of strength as exhibited by the porters of Smyrna. In unloading vessels with Havana sugar, each porter carries a box of sugar upon his back from the vessel to the storehouse; and this is done all day without complaint. The weight is over four hundred pounds. One porter was seen carrying a load of boards so large that the individuals present had the curiosity to detain him and to have it weighed. Capt. Eea saw it weighed and learned that it was nine hundred and five pounds. The drink of these porters was nothing but water, and bread the staple article of food. A prominent physician...

It will stop a cold if taken early in the stage. It will relieve a nervous headache and give instant relief to tired and inflamed eyes. It is most efficacious for sprains and bruises and will frequently stop the flow of blood from a wound. It is a sovereign remedy for sleeplessness, and iu conclusion, the doctor asserts, 'wrinkles flee from it, and blackheads vanish before its constant use.' Womankind.
