EVER NEAR. LEWIS HORTON. When the shadows darkly gather, O'er tht toiling rugged way, Lo ! bright angels from the Father, Turns the night to brightest day. When the storms of life are falling, And the path seems long or drear, Then a voice in spirit calling, Whispers softly, 'I am near. ' Sing my soul, O ! sing forever. Of the joys they bring to me, Earth with all its glory, never Can outshine their sympathy. Thus for all that comes I render Thanks, to him who knoweth best, Storms or shadows, clouds or splendor, All a loving God hath blest. Canterbury, N. H
