Book Table Lights and Shadows of Spiritualism D. D. Home Published by The BeligioPhilosophical Go., Chicago, 111. We have waited long and patiently for this work. D. D. Home is acknowledged as second to no one spiritualist (unless we may except Bros. A. J Davis and J. M. Peebles), in honesty of mediumship, and in anxiety that the truths of Spiritualism may be eliminated from, and exalted far above the villainous chaff of the mere sensational phenomena, which have assumed so extravagant a position under the garb of Spiritualism's name. Bro. Home has done true spiritualism a great favor by introducing to the world these ' Lights and Shadows.' He will receive the condemDation of the dishonest in the ranks of Spiritualism, even as Davis, Peebles, and their honest ilk deserve the censure of deceivers ; but such censure is extorted praise. Get the book; see what is true of Spiritualism ; see also, its '* Shadows,' and avoid them. Price $1.50, postage free.
