TOBACCO How a Clergyman Cured his Appetite for Tobacco. I had a deep well of very cold water, and whenever the evil appetite craved indulgence, I resorted immediately to fresh drawn water. Of this I drank what I desired, and then continued to hold water in my mouth, throwing out and taking in successive mouthfuls, until the craving ceased. By a faithful adherence to this practice for about a month / was cured! And from that time to this have been entirely free from any appetite for Tobacco.ï¿½ Medical and Surg. Reporter. Dr. II. V. Miller of Syracuse furnishes the following from reliable records. A French physician investigated the effects of tobacco smoking upon thirty-eight boys, between the ages of nine and fifteen, who had formed this habit. The result was: twenty-seven presented marked symptoms of Nichotine poisoning; twenty-three serious derangements of the intellectual faculties, and a strong appetite for alcoholic drinks ; three had heart disease ; eight decided deterioration of the blood; twelve had frequent nose bleed ; ten disturbed sleep ; four ulceration of the mouth in its mucous membrane.
