WHAT IS RELIGION? JAMES S. KAIME. As we understand the question, it means consecration and devotion to the service of God ; making it our chief study and interest to know and do his will. To be truly religious is to be truly good at heart, possessing the love of God in our souls, for the salvation of the human race. God has been merciful to us. in giving us sufficient light and understanding, if obeyed, to guide and direct our steps, from the lowest earthly, to the highest heavenly plane, where dwell the hundred four and forty thousand, having their Father's name written in their foreheads. To so live as to attain to that glorious state of existence is what I call religion. Canterbury, N. H.
