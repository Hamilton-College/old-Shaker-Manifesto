Question — What does the Shaker and Shakeress do ? Answer — It stops one of the gaps in the wall of the world's complaints—that we never go out to proclaim our principles and give to seekers of the truth, a reason for the faith that is in us. It bears witness, to the world, of the reality of physical — Spirit — manifestations — but not of the truthfulness of supermundane communications from the lower spheres. As a medium of present revelations, from the higher spheres, it is edifying to the saints. James S. Prescott, North Union, Ohio
