Beloved Elder Henry:--I want to return heart felt thanks... West Pittsfield, Mass Jan. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�I want to return heart felt thanks to both Editor and Author, for that life-giving article in the Jan. Manifesto, 'Seven Travails of the Shaker Church.' I am thankful that there are those still in our midst, who have been 'Baptized with Mother's testimony,' and have kept the baptism, and can to-day hold forth the testimony in its original spirit and purity. Heaven bless every such soul, is the desire of your gospel Sister, Lois Wentworth.
