COME, AND BE SAVED JANE EMILY SMITH 'Whosoever will, let them come.' O, ye who are halting on Babylon's plain, Come hither and seek the new birth — Be stripped of your idols, seek heaven to gain, By bearing the cross here on earth. Come, taste of the sweets which in Zion are found, By those who the full price will pay; O list to the trumpet, and greet the glad sound, 'From Babylon, come, come away! ' Come Fathers, come Mothers, come dear little ones, Who unto the kingdom are near; O come ye loved daughters, and ye noble sons, Your souls are most precious, and dear. Come, join the strong army of conquering souls, Who are turning the battle within, And freedom, her banner with beauty unfolds, In token of victories they win. Come ye who are sin-sick, and hunger for truth, Or thirst for the waters of life; O, come unto Zion, come aged or youth, And enter the glorious strife. The way of salvation is open for all — Who are sick of the world and its sins — ' Tis free for the patient, who run, yet not fall, And free for the hero who wins. The virgins invite you to join their pure band, And march, from the sorrows of earth, In ways that are leading to heaven's fair land — Thus seeking the heavenly birth. O come from the north, from the south, east and west, And sit down in the kingdom, with those Who from sin, death and darkness, enjoy a sweet rest, And their joy like a river o'erflows.
