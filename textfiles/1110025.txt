The Chinese government, for some reasons not stated, recently issued a decree commanding its subjects to abstain from shaving the head for a period of one hundred days. Detected in the act of disobeying this arbitrary regulation, between fifty and sixty persons in the city of Foochow alone were on the 11th of June sentenced to receive castigation with bamboo rods, and to pay each a fine of three thousand cash (about $6). It is stated by the local journals that before liberation the heads of the offenders were, as a wholesome warning to others, carefully painted and varnished.
