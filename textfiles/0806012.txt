War is the fruitful parent of crimes. It reverses all the rules of morality... Robert Hall War is the fruitful parent of crimes. It reverses all the rules of morality. It is nothing less than a temporary repeal of the prin- ciples of virtue. It is a system out of which almost all the virtues are excluded, and in which nearly all the vices are included. The morality of peaceful times is directly opposite to the maxims of war. The fundamental rule of the first is to do good; of the latter to inflict injuries.â€” War is the barbarous custom of duelling extended to nations.
