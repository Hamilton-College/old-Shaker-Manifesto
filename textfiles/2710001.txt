INTEMPERANCE. Will it be Abolisht by Legislation or Education? By Catherine Allen. AS every good is related to every other good, so is every evil, especially those of a public nature consequent to a wrong system that fosters many evils. While intemperance is in itself a cause of many ills, it is also an effect of still greater underlying causes, therefore so long as those causes exist, it seems that the wisest and most rigidly executed laws of State which should relate to temperance as a single reform, could at best prove only palliative and temporary in nature. While the government is so constituted as to express the will of the governed, improved legislation can only be enacted as a consequence of a broader, higher and wiser education;ï¿½with that awakening of the National conscience which will insist upon the conditions of radical democracy. An in- telligent study of public questions which will lead the p^oplo to adopt the simplest and most direct means of insuring this would, in our opln'oi, result more favorably to the cause of Temperance than all other measures c nnbined. 'When proportional Representation is adopted as a means of registering the real voice of the people, they will not be long probably in placing the currency under government control and in restoring the land to the people. This accomplisht, all other monopolies will hi thoroughly under.n ned; but there is little hope that these or other important reforms can be consummated until woman exercises the right of franchise. Then, we believe, there will be power to reach to the root of all the vice and misery by whicli the earth is afflicted, for the reason that so many noble women of clear vision are anxiously waiting that opportunity to use their influence in the purification of social life, when she will reserve to herself the right of choice in the dutie.4 of maternity. Of such measures, superior offspring will be an immediate result. The conservation of vital force is fundamental to the success of every true reform and will soon be manifest in a higher physical, intellectual and moral life in humanity. Through the development of the divine and spiritual nature in man, the well-springs of life will be opened within, then the soul will thirst no more, neither will abnormal physical appetites and inflamed passions demand that hell-creating 'fire-water' which ruins the body, blights and stultifies all that is noblest and highest of mind and soul. Intemperance having no longer a cause will then cease to exist. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
