THE GOOD SAMARITAN. A long time ago when Jesus was living, there came to him, so I have been told, a rich man who asked him who was his neighbor and Jesus told him this story. Once there was a poor man who started for Jericho. While on his way he met some ruffians who took his clothes and his nionay and left him almost dead. Soon after amin- ister came by on the same road and saw this man but didn't help him. The same day another man came by whom they called a Levite and he thought himself too good and rich to take care of this poor man, so left him and went on his way. Towards night a good Samaritan came by and pitying him bound up his wounds and gave him some milk from a bottle that he had in his pocket and put him on his horse and took him to a hotel and asked the Landlord to take care of him and when he came tho next day he would pay him for his trouble. When he finished, Jesus asked this rich man who was neighbor to the poor man and he said the good Samaritan. 8 yrs. old. Canterbury, N. H. Gertna Curtis.
