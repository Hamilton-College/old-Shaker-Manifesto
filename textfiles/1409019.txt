J would rather have ;i plain coffin without flowers, a funeral without an eulogy, then a life without the sweetness of love and tenderness and sympathy. Let us learn to anoint our friends beforehand for their burial. Postmortem kindness does not cheer the burdened spirit. Flowers on the coffin cast no fragrance backward over the weary way. Selected.
