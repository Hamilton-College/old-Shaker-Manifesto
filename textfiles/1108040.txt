A PREACHER'S ARTIFICE .----------?---------- Frater Roces, the celebrated but eccentric preacher of Naples, once scared his congregation in the most beneficial way. He preached a tremendous sermon on the inevitable consequences of a sinful life. His hearers were in a convulsion of excitement, with the blazing picture of a sulphurous retribution before their imaginations. All at once he stopped in the very midst of an eloquent appeal and cried out: 'Now, all of you who sincerely repent of your sins, hold up your hands.' Every hand in the assembly went up in an instant. The preacher looked upon the scene for one awful moment, and then, addressing the higher powers, exclaimed: 'Holy Archangel Michael, thou who with thine adamantine sword standest at the right of the judgment seat of God, hew me off every hand which has been raised hypocritically.' In an instant nearly every hand dropped to its owner's side.
