A GENTLE MAN BY W. H. VENABLE I knew a gentle man, Alas ! his soul has flown; Now, that his tender heart is still, Pale anguish haunts my own. His eyes in pity's tears Would often saintly swim, He did to others as he would That they should do to him. He suffered many things ; Eenounced, forgave, forbore ; And sorrow's crown of thorny stings, Like Christ, he meekly wore. At rural toils he strove, In beauty joy he sought; His solace was in children's words, And wise men's written thought. He was both meek and brave, Not haughty, and yet proud, He daily died, his soul to save, And ne'er to Mammon bowed. E'en as a little child He entered Heaven's gate, I caught his parting smile which said, ' Be reconciled, and wait. ' Humane Educator.
