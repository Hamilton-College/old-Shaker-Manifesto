WELCOME SUMMONS. 'Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life.'ï¿½ Rev. ii., 10. Canterbury, N. H. Fellow traveler,bound for Zion, Go rejoicing on your way; Falter not in time of trial, Nor make the least delay. Though the lighten, yoke grow easy, As in life daily worn. And a cross may be heavy, And life's burclans weigh you clown; It will crown in heaven awaits you, Glorious prize that you have won, Where the welcome summons greets you, ' Entar in, your work 's wall done.' Oh, the glory of the meeting, On the bright celestial shore! And the rapture of the greeting, By the saints who've gone before! WELCOME SUMMONS.
