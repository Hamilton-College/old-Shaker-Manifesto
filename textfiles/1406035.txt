GOOD AND BAD HABITS. Many people suppose they can drop a bad habit any time they choose. But this is a great mistake. The moment we begin a bad habit of any kind that moment we begin to lose our power to act right, and the longer we continue in any wrong course, the harder it is to turn to the right. Nothing becomes fixed and real till it is done. It is the doing that forms the habit. Doing before it becomes a habit, requires effort, and sometimes repeated painful efforts. But doing, when it becomes a habit, is easy. When we do right, because it is right, we act from good motives. When we do this till it becomes a habit, the doing of good first becomes easy, then pleasant, and finally a source of real enjoyment. Good habits, from good motives are heaven. Bad habits, from selfish motives, are hell. A mixture of the two is neither, and cannot last; for finally, the good will cast out the evil, or the evil will destroy the good. No man can serve two masters. The habit of speaking the truth, of doing right, or being humane, lies at the very foundation of a large part of the happiness in this world. And very few persons realize, how much of our safety and enjoyment in this world, is simply the fruit of habits of good. Whatever, therefore, helps us to cultivate good habits, becomes important. And whoever neglects to give his influence and example in its favor, endangers the moral healtlu of society, and his own safety as well. It is vain to expect, that morality can prevail generally, apart from religion, to give it authority and approval. And public religious worship becomes our indispensable necessity, for preserving the moral health of the world. And it is for this reason that we have the command, 'Neglect not the assembling of yourselves together, as the manner of some is. ' Selected.
