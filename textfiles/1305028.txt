THE USE OF LEMONS. The lemon tree is a native of Asia, although it is cultivated in Italy, Portugal and in the south of France. In Europe, however, it seldom exceeds the dimensions of the smallest tree, while in its native state it grows to over CO feet in height. Every part of this tree is valuable in medicine, though we rarely employ any but its fruit, that is, the lemon itself. And everyone knows how to employ this in lemonade—to squeeze the juice into cold water; this is the shortest way—or to cut in slices and then boil it. Either way is good. Lemonade is one of the best and safest drinks for any person, whether in health or not. It is suitable to all stomach diseases, is excellent in sickness—in cases of jaundice, gravel and liver complaints. The pippins crushed may also be mixed with water and sugar, and be used as a drink. Lemon juice is the best scorbutic remedy known. It not only cures this disease, but prevents it. Sailors make a daily use of it for that purpose. I advise every one to rub their gums daily with lemon juice to keep them in healthThe hands and nails are also kept clean, white, soft and supple by the daily use of lemon instead of soap. It also prevents chilblains. Lemon is used in intermittent fevers, mixed with strong, hot black coffee without sugar. Neuralgia may be cured by rubbing the part effected with a cut lemon. It is invaluable also to cure warts, and to destroy dandruff on the head by rubbing the roots of the hair with it. In fact, its uses are manifold, and the more we employ it, externally and internally, the better we shall find oiirselves. Natural remedies are the best and nature is our best doctor, if we would only listen to it. Decidedly rub your hands, head and gums with lemon, and drink lemonade in preference to all other liquids.
