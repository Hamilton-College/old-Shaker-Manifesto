[Children's Supplement.] 'FEED MY LAMBS.' AMELIA J. CALVER ' O, Simon, Simon, lovest thou ? ' Our Lord and Savior saitb, When rising from his sepulchre He triumphed over death. ' Thou knowest that I love Thee all,' Was Peter's fond reply. And sweeter than a seraph's tone, Was heard our Savior's cry : ' Feed my Lambs.' Thrice was this loving question asked, And thrice the injunction given ; And sealing thus his parting word, Returned again to heaven. But all along the vale of time, His silvery tones are heard, And every Savior of the race, Repeats His parting word, 'Feed my Lambs.' Yea, feed my lambs, my little lambs, Who're called to fields of grace ; For straight and narrow is the path And limited the space, Until they learn that paths of peace Are paths of pleasantness ; And good is added to the soul, With Heaven's righteousness. ' Feed my Lambs.' Feed them with precepts rich with truth, Examples wise and good ; And never let them seek in vain The spirit's daily food. For as you nurture, thus will grow The tender, youthful mind, While innocence and purity Will seek for food refined. â€¢'' Feed my Lam, bs.' And when they're strengthened in the Lord, By culture you have given, They will arise and call you blest, And sing your praise in heaven. And when you see them pure and white Amid the angel throng, You'll bless the day that duty called In accents sweet and strong, ' Feed my Lambs.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
