Mt. Lebanon, Feb. 14, 1877 Dear brother Albert : As soon as the February number of The Shaker was committed to our keeping, my eyes fell upon the beautiful piece, entitled, 'The Children's Grotto,' 'Talks to youth and children.' Perusing it, I could not refrain from thanking the author. Such considerations for the young, should not and cannot (by the thoughtful) pass unnoticed, among believers or by others. Being one of those fortunate, or unfortunate boys, possessed of much life, I am capable of making things rattle a little sometimes, and perhaps when I ought not to. But there is life in children as you remark, and it must come out one way or another. I have read your article several times, but will do more than read; I will impress it on my mind and mould my actions by the principles it contains. I really wonder a brother, having so many things to occupy your mind, and things that are above childhood too, could spend time to have such an interesting ;alk with us; and so we have reason to be :hankful for this also. I may not appreciate your remarks as deepy in my ignorant condition, as in riper years, but hope to show an increasing appreciation by my future deportment. I am not alone in appreciating your sentiments, but many others of my schoolmates lave resolved to discipline ourselves that we may make agreeable and useful men at some iuture date. In love and respect I subscribe myself, Henry Clough
