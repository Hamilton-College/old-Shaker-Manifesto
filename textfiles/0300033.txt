MY BEST DESIRES Annie Stephens, (11) What should be my best desires? Should they be for pleasure vain, Which would me lead from truth and good â€” Casting on my spirit stain ? Nay! my strongest, true desires, Shall be virtuous and pure, Ever tending Angel-ward, Gospel graces to secure. I desire to be increasing In the gift of holy love, And by effort without ceasing Reach the heavenly spheres above. I desire to be advancing In the way of truth and light, And, by casting error from me, Learn to think and act the riglit. O good spirits gather near me, Fill my mind with godly things, That daily I may feel the bliss Which true goodness always brings.
