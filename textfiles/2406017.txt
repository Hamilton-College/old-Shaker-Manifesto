Enfield, N. H. May, 1894. As nature makes everything bright and new, around us at this season, so man, (or more properly speaking, woman) finds a delight in making the inside of our homes more cleanly and beautiful. As every winter brings with it a budget of witty sayings about the plumber and his bills, so the spring-time hears the voice of irony, protest against spring housecleaning; yet how many of us there are, who, after having gone through a seige of soap and water, dust and white-wash, can not find a pleasure in neater and more tidy surroundings, that more than compensates for the trouble undergone. We are in the midst of our spring cleaning just now. Painting, papering, whitewashing and plastering makes work for all. Our garden crops are all in the ground and many of them ready for the first hoeing. We are glad to report that Sr. Julia Russell's broken wrist is rapidly improving. On the 10th ult. our young Sisters gave an Organ Recital, with recitations and songs interspersed. Many fine selections were played, and some were a revelation in execution and expression. We look forward with pleasure to Recital No 2. O. H. Kirkley. North Family. May, 1894. As the new season will give new fruit, we would we had new news with which to form our Home Note. We might line off sentiments scintillating with sparks of a theoretic or poetic type, and the same be devoid of the light that would inform the unregenerate soul as to a better mode of life and what would it profit the originator? yet we can delve into nature's inexhaustible mine of knowledge and exhume truths with which to illustrate the goodness of the Creator, as well as the glory of a true Christian character. Can we look upon maturing nature and fail to learn though the seasons come and go, its fruits grow and decay, that there are ever-existing, unchangeable life-giving elements that create the bud, leaf and fruit? and with this knowledge is it not reasonable to believe that the immortal part of man will be sustained by eternal powers? If so, than how important that our lives be devoted to works that sanctify and gladden souls, that in the 'march of life' we fail not to assist the needy and give as has been given to us, thereby responding to the call 'Love the Lord'� no less our associates�'with all thy mind, might and strength.' We are being favored as we hope all are with excellent weather for growing crops of grain and vegetables. Good health prevails, and anticipated blessings cause us to be thankful and give our best in every phase of our life, thus emulating the life examples of the founders of our Church, who so nobly acted their part in life, leaving the field of their labor for their successors whom we trust are ever able to sing, 'Away with all doubting and fear! Away with all doubting and fear! While morning around us is breaking And angels are hovering near. If others have stood thro' affliction, With firmness to-day we can stand; O gladly we'll banish all weakness, United a strong happy band.' George H. Baxter.
