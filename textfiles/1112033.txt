APPLIED THEOLOGY One Sunday morning, while a certain deacon was preparing for church, a wandering wayfarer, or, in modern parlance, a tramp, appeared at his door, pleaded his hunger, and begged for something to eat. The deacon looked solemn and frowningly, but reluctantly got a loaf of bread and began to cut it ; but while doing so, took occasion to admonish the beggar concerning the error of his ways. After reminding him that it was the holy Sabbath which he was desecrating, he asked him if he knew how to pray ? ' No,' was the reply. ' Then,' said the deacon, ' I'll learn you,' and he commenced to repeat the Lord's Prayer. But just as he uttered the first words, ' Our Father,' the beggar interrupted him with the question, ' What, is He your Father and mine too ?' ' Yes,' the deacon replied, 'Why,' exclaimed the beggar, ' we are brothers then, ain't we ? Can't you cut that slice a little thicker ?'
