Make Cows Pay .â€” We keep cows for their milk, mainly ; and while provender is so valuable, we should make the most of it. Let every farmer who is able buy a feed cutter, and soak the cut feed in hot water, unless he can do better, and steam it. Throw a little extra nourishment, like brewer's grain or buckwheat bran, upon the warmed cut feed, and thus we will find we will make cows and other stock pay.
