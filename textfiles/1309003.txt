THE LOOM OF LIFE All day, all night I can hear the jar Of the loom of life, and near and far It thrills with its deep and muffled sound, As the tireless wheels go always round. Busily, ceaselessly goes the. loom In the light of the day and the midnight's gloom' The wheels are turning early and late, And the woof is wound in the warp of fate. Click, clack! there's a thread of love wove in; Click, clack! another of wrong and sin; What a checkered thing will this life be When we see it unrolled in eternity! Time, with a face like mystery, And hands as busy as hands can be, Sits at the loom with its arms outspread, To catch in its meshes each glancing thread. When shall this wonderful web be done ? In a thousand years, perhaps, or one? Or to-morrow? Who knoweth? Not you nor I, But the wheels turn on and the shuttles fly. Are we spinners of wool for this life webâ€”say? Do we furnish the weaver a thread each day? It were better then, O my friend, to spin A beautiful thread than a thread of sin. Ah, sad-eyed weaver, the years are slow; But each one is nearer the end, I know; And some day the last thread shall be woven in, God grant it be love instead of sin. For the Christian Woman.
