Those who fail to increase their spiritual light... Those who fail to increase their spiritual light, are likened unto the five foolish virgins who provided no oil for their lamps. To such the path to happiness becomes darkened, and they fail to receive the bless, ings, which are attained by those who walk in the light. Ada Wayne.
