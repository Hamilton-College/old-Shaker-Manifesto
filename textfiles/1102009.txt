LEAVES FOR THE HEALING OF THE NATIONS GRATIA H. HARE [The following was sent us for publication. Out of respect for the parties so sending, we comply, hoping great good may come from the same.â€”Ed.] Shall I, a child born but to love, And through its sweets to find above The wisdom that from love evolves And it to its own law resolves; In whom affections, like the spring From which the cooling draught you bring, Gushes in constant pearly flow With gifts for all where it shall go ? Shall I be brought subjective to Rough passion's sway in all I do, And feel its waves, all steeped in earth, And, deeply dyed from fleshly birth, Rush madly o'er my world and me, All beauty through its coloring see ? Must all affection's waters be Lost in such tumultuous sea, Diluted from its purity ? ****** He, whom his manhood hath conserved, And hath his passion's force reserved, Walks the earth, to-day a Lord, His garments, e'en, with life are stored; The very hem of which would heal The saddest pain that hearts can feel. Oh, man ! my brother, through this trust That life evolves e'en from the dust, Though crucifixion be the cost, The gain is life, death only's lost. And if thy sister tempt thee, ' eat The fruit,' as to the taste most sweet, Tell her of life ; its forces will, Through broken branch, in waste distill ; And that the tree that beauteous waves Its branches clothed with glossy leaves All fragrant in life's nectared breath, Through waste would fill the air with death To her thou'lt be a Savior ; then A Jesus be 'midst other men. Glass eyes for horses are now made with such perfection that the animals themselves cannot see through the deception.
