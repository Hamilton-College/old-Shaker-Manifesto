KIND WORDS. THE SHAKERS. For several years we have been in regular receipt of The Manifesto, a little magazine published at Shaker Village, N. H. It is a pure little sheet without an evidence within or without, by editorial teaching, advertisement or suggestion which can injure the purest thinker by suggestion or innuendo. One feels after reading it as if he had been in company with the good and the pure and inspired with good thoughts and right suggestions. But we took up our pen to commend the humanity of the Shakers and Quakers as well to the animals under their care as to humanity, and not to compare their thoughts to the condemning of our own. They follow the old Asiatic practice of kindness to all creatures, human or dumb. In the broadest fullest sense they are humane and kindly. They go not about with a murderous gun, speaking death to God's praise singers. Their women wear no evidence of cumulative death in the aborning of their cloaks or dresses with birds, wings or skins. If they are proud it is in keeping under the desire to shine, and in the will to do for their fellows. They make no commerce in suffering life, and they advocate that Christian Utopia�a universal Christian brotherhood, where every living thing may justly and honestly receive its rights. What if the world should become as pure in thought, speech and act as the ideal of these peoples�would it know itself? Humane Journal.
