Religio-Philosophical Journal Every reader of Col. Bundy's valuable paper, the Religio-Philosophical Journal, will appreciate the improved changes that have been made in its form, as well as in the beautifully, neat appearance of the whole paper by the acceptance of a 'fine, new dress.' As an able and fearless advocate in the spiritualistic field, the Journal comes to us as a welcome friend. It is a knowledge of the truth of spiritualism that we appreciate and the man who gives that to his readers is a benefactor to the race.
