AN EXCELLENT LESSON. To rely upon witnesses, where truth and justice are at stake, is like investing your money in a lottery, where there are nine blanks to one prize. You must remember that there are 'two sides to a story,' and notwithstanding ycu may be able to prove by your witness what is true, still your opponent may, to your sad disappointment, find it an easy task to prove by his witness that which is false. A dozen lines in writing are worth more as evidence, even though there should not be a single grammatical sentence from beginning to end, than a whole regiment of forgetful and prejudiced witnesses.
