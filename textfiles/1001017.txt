BROTHER OPENHEART Thank God for Brother Openheart—we would not be personal—but The Shaker Manifesto would express, if possible, for such a brother, its inexpressible gratitude. Some of our religious exchanges are severely criticising the conduct of one, Brother Close- fist — he who loves the Church and the Church paper, only to the extent that he can make more money out of them than they cost him. Oh, how glad The Manifesto is that it has no Brother Closefist. We feel sorry for other papers. We would present to them the opinions and conduct of our Brother Openheart. Once he was a man of the world ; ambitious for wealth and worldly enjoyments. Once he loved what are too commonly considered the ' respectable vices ' of human life. Once upon a time of life he was first cousin, at least, to Brother Closefist. But he experienced a genuine conviction and conversion. He forsook the world, he changed the current of his ambitions ; lie discarded the vices — the nasty, unspiritual habits of the world's man He became a new creature—a Shaker—was intrusted, is intrusted with funds consecrated ' to charitable and religious purposes,' and is just as ambitious to help The Manifesto as Brother Closefist is to help himself. We rejoice in our relations to Brother Openheart, and hold him up as a model brother, for all who would love the Lord better than they do themselves. We have no closefist brethren—if any incline that way, they are just so far ' out of union ; ' ' off from gospel ground ;' worldlings, unworthy of trusts, and shames to their Christian, Shaker calling. May the good Lord 12 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. prevent such inclinations, and bless all Brothers Closefist with a gospel conversion to consecration — Brothers Openheart are sufficiently blest already. We are ready, now, Brothers Openheart for your subscriptions.
