SOME SIGNS Solomon said, many centuries ago: ' Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.' Some people seem to think that children have no character at all. On the contrary, an observing eye sees in these young creatures the signs of what they are likely to be for life. When I see a little boy slow to go to school and glad of every excuse to neglect his book, I think it a sign that he will be a dunce. When I see a boy in haste to spend every penny as soon as he gets it, I think it a sign that he will be a spendthrift. When I see a boy hoarding up his penniesl and unwilling to part with them for any good purpose, I think it a sign that he wil, be a miser. When I see a boy or girl looking out for themselves and dislike to share good things with others, I think it a sign that the child will grow up a very selfish person. When I see boys and girls often quarrelling, I think it a sign that they will be violent and hateful men and women. When I see a little boy willing to take strong drink, I think it a sign that he will be a drunkard. THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 279 When I see a boy smoking or chewing tobacco, I think it a sign that he will soon be guilty of other filthy habits. When I see a boy who never prays, I think it a sign that he will be a profane and profligate man. When I see a'chlld obedient to its parents, I think it a sign of great future blessings from Almighty God. When I see a boy fond of the Bible, and well acquainted with it, I think it a sign that he will be a pious and happy man. And though great changes sometimes take place in the character, yet, as a general rule, these signs do not fail.
