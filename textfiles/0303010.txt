CARD Lebanon Springs, November 10. In the Banner of October 26th I regret to see the revival of an error which went the rounds of the press some months ago, and which, at the time, I denied by published cards. Please do me the justice to state â€” 1. As I regard the Shaker order as a testimony against 'the pollutions that are in the world through lust,' I have never desired their renunciation of celibacy. 2. As I consider the greater part of their disci- pline as eminently protective of the celibate life, I have never desired the abrogation of any rule that prohibits shaking hands and kissing. 3. As I view their societies as nuclei for some of the purest and most refined of human souls, 1 deprecate their dissolution, unless that God shall build up for poor humanity some equally as good or better ' covert from the tempest.' Yours for truth, J. Robe
