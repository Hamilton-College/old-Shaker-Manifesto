Specimen Bricks from the Babel of Higher Critics Specimen Bricks from the Babel of Higher Critics, by H. L. Hastings. This is No. 41 of 'The Anti-Infidel Library,' and is an examination of some statements that have been made in reference to the Scriptures. The mistakes of the Old Testament Prophets, ï¿½which v ere brought forward in a lecture by Prof. II. G. Mitchell are carefully analyzed and it is concluded that 'the guides which the Prof, seems to have followed in his investigations exhibit great aptitude for confounding all hings sacred, profane, divine and devilish.' Br. Hastings has no mercy for the Biblical criticisms. 'A man who pronounces the Books of the Bible forgeries, its history fictitious, its miracles impossible, is none the less an Infidel because he writes 'Rev. Professor' before his name and 'Doctor of Divinity' after it. A lie is a lie a\ helher uttered in a church or a beer garden.' Pub. by II. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston Mass.
