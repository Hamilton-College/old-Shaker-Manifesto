RESURRECTED FLOWERS CECELIA DEVYR Seek not within the darkness of the earth, Thy friends nor flowers; For lo ! their spirits have a radiant birth Through death's dim hours. Ask for the mystery hidden in the light, For eyes are blind. Seek for the veil that screens all mortal sight And heaven thou'lt find. 'Tis but the olden root the sod conceals, The fiowers are new. A recreative power the spring reveals, Through heat and dew. The simplest blossom of the mountain pass, A marvel seems; When 'neath the magic of the wondrous glass, Its beauty beams. And yet within this revelation hides A marvel still; A life, a presence, calmly there abides, That makes us thrill. Only the eye clairvoyant can behold The spirit flower Gathering its robes of purple, pearl and gold, In dying hour. And yet, the eye clairvoyant, like the lens, A limit finds; The infinite creation so transcends Our girded minds. Thronging the air with fragrance, grace and bloom, Are unseen flowers; We feel their influence through the glow and gloom, Of life's strange hours. They put their impress on the flake of snow; The penciling frost Catches their outlines when the whirlwinds blow, And clouds are lost. The sun, that gives to us this fertile ball, Has jealous light, That shuts out with a golden roof and wall, The stars of night. And thus, the life external wraps the soul In fervid beams'; Conceals the glories that around it roll, Beyond its dreams. Death waves his hand, all outward things retreat; Then angels sing, Blest words wherein life's holy mornings meet; ' Wake it is spring.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
