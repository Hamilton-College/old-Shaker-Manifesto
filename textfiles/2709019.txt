TOO MUCH COFFEE. Do you want to be blind? Drink coffee. Drink lots of it. Drink it with breakfast, lunch and dinner, and drink it between meals. Drink it when you get up in the morning and drink it before you go to bed at night. Drink it long and strong, and keep it up, and by and by you' will be as sightless as the proverbial bat. That is what the celebrated French physician, St. Amaud, says, and there are New York doctors who indorse the declaration. It is well known that the Moors are inveterate coffee drinkers, especially the merchants, who sit in their bazaars and drink coffee continually during the day. It has been noticed that almost invariably when these coffee drinkers reach about the age of 40 their eyesight begins to fail, and by the time they get to be 50 years old they become blind. One is forcibly imprest by the number of blind men that are seen about the streets of the City of Fez, the capital of Morocco. It is invaribly attributed to the excessive use of coffee. This opinion has been confirmed by the opinion of European physicians living there. Atlanta Constitution.
