A RELIGION CALLED FOR What is wanted now is a great amount of religionï¿½that which is deep and true and abiding. Something is called for, and loudly, too, that will of itself and in secret, compel a man to give honest weight and measure ; to deal by a customer as he would by himself; to leave oft* lying and stealing for a better reason than the fear of being found out; a religion that banishes small measures from the counters, pebbles from the cotton bags, sand from the sugar, chicory from the coffee, alum from the bread, and water from the milk-cans. This is something that everybody understands It is not itself religion, but it is the unmistakable fruits of it. The man who has genuine religion will practice none of these tilings. The religion, which is to save the world, will not put all the big strawberries at the top and the little ones at the bottom. It will not make one half a pair of shoes of good leather and the rest of shoddy, so that the first shall redound to the maker's credit and the second to his cash. It does not put bricks at five dollars a thousand into a chimney it contracts to build with seven dollar material, nor smuggle white pine into floors that have paid for hard pine, nor leave yawning cracks in closets where boards ought to join. And so on to the end tf the chapter. The first thing to do is to stir up human souls to their depths with fundamental principles, and reach down to the motives and springs of action, that things may begin at the beginning. There is dire necessity of a radical change like this. Affairs are running wrong now, and there must be a turning back to first principles, which are always those of truth. ' Whatsoever a men soweth, that also shall he reap. ' 'Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give unto every man according as his work shall be. ' Pacific Christian Advocate.
