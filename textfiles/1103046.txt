SPIRITUAL HOME Emily Offord Canaan, N. Y. 1. There's a beautiful home on the mountain of God, Where flowers in purity bloom, 2. There is joy and delight in that beautiful home, And sweet is the peace reigning there, 3. We will sing of that home thro' the journey of life, While crosses we faithfully bear, 4. And we joy in the conflict rejoice in the strife That we may inheritance gain, And the fair beams of glory in radiance bright, The heavenly mansions illume. And a rest happy rest for the weary and worn, A glorious freedom to share. For a blessed fruition of eternal bliss These trials our spirits prepare. Even now to our vision the shadow's revealed, The substance e're long we'll obtain. Home, home, O, beautiful home! Heavenly graces are there, Where pxire love each heart controls, We long of its glories to share.
