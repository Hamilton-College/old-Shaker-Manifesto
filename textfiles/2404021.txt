To our Sister Adah Z. Potter. By Asenath C. Stickney. A spiritual pillar finely wrought Is present to our view, No earthly beauty need be sought To add a charm thereto. A chastened life, a worthy soul, Beloved by many friends Who in return loved without guile Such, love to each extends. Her charity was very marked For any who had erred. No envy, bitterness nor hate Her mother spirit stirred. Dear patient one! How welcome thou To thy parents' fond embrace! How children circle round thee now To greet thy shining face! They call thee blessed,ï¿½well they may, For thou hast nurtured them, Fed them with strength from day to day, Such form thy diadem. Blest angels wait with joyous hope To bear thee company, While saints with angels gladly ope The pearly gates for thee. Canterbury, N. H.
