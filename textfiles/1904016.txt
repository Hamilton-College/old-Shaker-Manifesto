A BRIEF REPLY. Nancy G. Danforth. This question is asked many times,ï¿½ How do you increase your members? On what do you depend since you discard the marital relation? We answer, God will take care of his own work ; if we follow his guidance we need take no thought for the result. Again, your manner of life, if carried into general practice, would run the world out.' Did not Jesus say, ;'The harvest is the end of the world?' Gad never intended the life of man to be one continued season of seed sowing ; but there should come a time of harvest when he would be reaped or cut off from those elements which have their roots in the earth and be gathered into the garner of the kingdom of heaven. Every field of grain is not ripe at the same time and ready for the harvest. The husbandman has a care to gather it iuto order as it ripens lest it fall back iuto the earth and be lost. So the great Husbandman sends forth his reapers, who are the angels of conviction to gather those who are ready to be harvested from the earth life. The first Adam was of the earth, earthy, the second Adam, the Christ, was the Lord from heaven a quickening spirit. The tendencies of those who follow the first man incline toward the earth plane, while those who follow Christ are wholly cut off from the earth life which is the life of generation or seel sowing. Grain, after being cut, is threshed and winnowed before it becomes serviceable in the household. Even so the soul, after receiving sufficient conviction to cut it off from the pleasure of a worldly life, must pass through a cleansing and refining process ere it can be of much service in the house of the Lord. 'The soul that siuneth it shall die ' The death is proportionate to the trans gression Under the law every siu had its penalty and the offender could not be restored without bringing the appropriate sacrifice or sin offering. From this we learn, since 'the law is our school master,' that not only is confession necessary, but also witnesses who can testify of our sincerity and humility. The priests stood as witnesses and leaders to the people. From that time down to the dark reig:i of Anti-christ, the Lord always had an order where lie had placed his name for salvation. During the dark ages this was corrupted and lost sight of for a season, but in great mercy it is again revealed and is now manifested through the second revelation of the Christ spirit, which admits no offering for siu, but a sacrifice of sin itself upon the altar of confession and repentance. Thus has Christ appeared the second time without siu, or a sin offering, unto salvation. The promise was that lie should so appear to those who look for him and that he would save his people from their sins, pot in them. It is not to give up his natural life, in the hands of cruel persecutors, but that his daily life may be a crucifixion to the nature of sin which he took of 'the seed of Abraham' that he might leave us an example that we should follow in his steps even to the laying down of the natural life, rather than deny the faith which prompts us to follow Christ our Redeemer.
