Sabbathday Lake, Me. Oct. 1899. One glance at the beautiful October woods reminds us that lovely summer has gone; that winter will soon take the place of autumn, and we shall all once more gather around the evening lamp, beside a cosy fire, away from the bitter winds that are so sure to accompany that dread season. Notwithstanding the long drought we have a fair harvest. Of ensilage corn crop never was better. The silo is filled with choice food for the cows. While cutting the corn the Brethren run the ensilage-cutter with a belt 160 feet long to prevent fire from the boiler. It worked nicely and no power was lost from length of belt. It may be of interest to add that the potato-field from which our main crop was raised, is 70 rods long and is in two towns, two counties, and two congressional districts. Although we expected very few apples the harvest brings us a goodly supply. The past week 13 bbls. of Baldwins were picked from two trees, in one p.m. We were very glad to hear from the new Shaker Home at White Oak Ga., and we wish it every success in its spiritual and temporal growth. The Trustees in Maine say they are sorry that the other Trustees did not feel able to furnish means to keep The Manifesto moving. The people in Alfred and Gloucester are united with the Trustees in the same spirit. Ada S. Cummings.
