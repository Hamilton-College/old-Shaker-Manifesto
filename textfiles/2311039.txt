THANKSGIVING. Daniel Orcutt. 'Wiiosoeveb he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he can not be my disciple,' is true to-day, as well as when it fell from the Teacher's lips, and his command 'follow me,' comes to each one as distinctly as if spoken at Galilee. And when he firmly insists that all must be forsaken, it is simply from pure love to us and the most intense desire that we may be saved from sin and its consequences. It is essential that those who follow him must make it the one great aim and object of life to deny self, and shun all that would destroy the union between Christ and the true disciple. 'Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning;' and its full significance is realized by every one that is born of God. When joy and gladness come, let us accept them with thanksgiving; when sorrow is our portion, bow meekly and trustingly and say, 'Thy will, not mine.' Let the joy of our lives flow out into other lives. 'Rejoice with those that do rejoice, and weep with those that weep.' It is the true Christian traveler that is entitled to heavenly joy and gladness ; all who are at peace with God. 'Time, time is calling, arise and be living for eternity.' Eternity! With what solemnity the word drops into the restless sea of human life. How it broadens and deepens the meaning of all we do here. Oh the joy of living where time and eternity are blended into one; where the life here is linked in an unbroken chain with the life beyond. We rarely meet with a deeper or purer pleasure than that which we feel in receiving the assurance that we are doing good; that our words and deeds are bearing fruit of helpfulness and use. We 'should not forget Thanksgiving. Shaker Station, Ct.
