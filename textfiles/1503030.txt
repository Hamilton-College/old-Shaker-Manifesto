A.�is declared by scores of its subscribers to be the best, ablest and cheapest missionary Magazine in existence. Ignoring all previous failures to jriake such a periodical self-supporting, it began in 1878, and now, after seven years, besides meeting all its expenses from its origin, it reports $1000 of its avails sent in small sums to different foreign missions. We are glad lo call attention to this Review and commend it to our readers. Its editor, Rev. R. G. Wildei-, a missionary of 30 years experience, deserves success and has won it. His Sketches of Mission Fields�their climate,products, people and missions, from their origin to the present time�are accurate and exhaustive; the Letters from workersabroad are fresh and full of interest; his annual RevUws of all Foreign Missions, and their Boards in Christendom, are just, impartial and stimulating;, his notices oi Independent Missions are considerate and generous, nor less so lis annual reviews of.

We have received from the Fowler &amp; Wells Co.. their Almanac for 1885; in addition to the monthly calendars and usual astronomical calculations, it contains a sanitarium for each month of the year, giving special and seasonable health hints which should enable its readers to shun most of the ills that flesh is heir to. The principles of Phrenology are explained and fully illustrated, and a most valuable feature is the explanation of the qualifications needed for the principal pursuits of life, showing what each person can do best. There are portraits of Drs. Gall, Spurzhiem and Combe, with brief sketches, and a great deal of miscellaneous matter which with a list of books published on Phrenology, Physiognomy, etc.* fills 128 16mo. pages, handsomely printed on fine paper, and sent for 5c. in stamps.
