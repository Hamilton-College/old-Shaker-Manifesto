THE REJECTED STONE. Ernest Pick. Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation. Isa, xxviii., 16. The stone which the builders rejected. Matt, xxi., 42. When the Spanish conquerors entered Mexico they found, we are told, the children playing in the dust of the streets with marbles of gold, the abundance of which greatly diminished its value. Often, it seems to me that our gospel treasures are treated likewise by those who have been called recently or even a long time ago, but have not yet entered into the very spirit and faith. Having fled from social evils of all and every description they are satisfied to have found a city of refuge, where hunger, thirst and destitution are never known; to have found a resting place, where to lay down their weary heads and tired bodies in sweet rest and ease. They are the children, playing, tossing, trifling with their golden privileges in the streets of our holy city. Forgetting the pit of corruption, the abode of the natural man, we should appreciate the more a pure and clean home. Escaped from the fathomless depths of injustice and iniquity we ought to be thankful for a government where all are weighed in the same scale, to be justly dealt with in the accuracy of the scales and not with the inconstancy of a weather-vane. Having escaped being engaged in pugilistic contests for the daily crumb, we ought to praise daily the peace and all temporal blessings, resulting from a united labor of hearts given to God, and hands busy in consecrated diligence and industry. O that we never may lose sight and appreciation of the gain, beauty and treasures of Zion, which we exchanged for the dross and vanity of the world! Considering that even the best of men, in their unredeemed state, are prone to fall, to be unjust, overbearing and tyrannical, every one in our ranks ought to stand by and zealously work for a cause which strengthens and protects the weak and encourages the strong; ought to defend a gospel which respects neither persons nor beliefs, which suffers no government by purse or person; where all have an even chance and fair play and none are oppressed or defrauded. Where we may join a host of pure, true, honorable and upright souls; and where standards of purity and love are waving. O fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, what a glorious achievement is ours ! Our hearts may well sing praises and thanks that our lot has fallen in such pleasant places. May that spirit forever increase in our souls which hungers and thirsts for righteousness and integrity and which fears no sacrifice! May we feel that faith which knows no fear, which calls no mortal master; which prays in humility to God for deliverance from all evil and for a heaven on earth where Brethren and Sisters shall dwell together in purity, peace and unity. A prophet said of Zion : 'Violence shall no more be heard in the land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders ; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation and thy gates Praise.' Isa. lx., 18. Again, the prophet saw the coming day of peace and plenty, thus : 'For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron ; I will also make thine officers peace and thine exactors righteousness.' Isa. lx., 17. How simply and truly these prophecies are actualized among Believers each one can bear witness according as they have individually become 'the ï¿½Resurrection.' Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
