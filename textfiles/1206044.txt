Kindness in horse training .—Nothing contributes so much in modifying high temper in animals, or in the enhancement oi their physical beauty and powers of productiveness—as the case may be—than good treatment and patient kindness. Prof Wagner, speaking of its effect in the training of young horses, says : Many think they are doing finely, and are proud of their success in horse training, by means of severe whipping, or otherwise arousing and stimulating the passions, and then crushing the will through which the resistance is prompted. No mistake can be greater than this, and there is nothing that so fully exhibits the ability, judgment and skill of the real horseman, as the care displayed in winning instead of repelling the action of the mind.—Exchange.
