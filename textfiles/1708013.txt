HOW EASY IT IS How easy it is to spoil a day! The tho'tless words of a cherished friend, The selfish act of a child at play, The strength of a will that will not bend, The slight of a comrade, the scorn of a foe, The smile that is full of bitter things- - They all can tarnish its golden glow, And take the grace from its airy wings. How easy it is to spoil a day By the force of a tho't we did not check. Little by little we mould the clay, And little flaws may the vessel wreck. The careless waste of a white-winged hour, That held the blessing we long had sougiit, The sudden loss of wealth and power, And lo ! the day is with ill inwrought. How easy it is to spoil a life!- - And many are spoiled ere well begun- - In home light darkened by sin and strife, Or downward course of a cherished one ; By toil that robs the form of its grace, And undermines till health gives way; By the peevish temper, the frowning face, The hopes that go, and the cares that stay. A day is too long to spend in vain, Some good should come as the hours go by ; Some tangled maze may be made more plain, Some lower'd glance may be raised on high. And life is too short to spoil like this, If only a prelude, it may be sweet; Let us bind together its thrt ad of bliss, And nourish the flowers around our feet. Selected.
