Small Means The power of money is, on the whole, overestimated. The greatest things which have been done for the world have not been accomplished by rich men, nor by subscription lists, but by men generally of small pecuniary means. The greatest thinkers, discoverers, inventors and artists have been men of moderate wealth, many of them little raised above the condition of manual laborers, in point of worldly circumstances. And it will always be so. Riches are oftener an impediment than a stimulus to action, and in Â¦many cases they are quite as much a misfort{ une as a blessing. The youth who inherits wealth is apt to have life made too easy for him, and he soon grows sated with it, because he has nothing t left to desire. Having no special object to t struggle for, he finds time hang heavy on his 3 hands ; remains morally and mentally asleep j and his position in society is often no higher than that of a polypus over which the tide floats.
