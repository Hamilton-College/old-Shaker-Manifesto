Our thoughts are the parents of our words... Our thoughts are the parents of our words, and our words are soon crystallized into deeds. Therefore our deeds are as our thoughts, as certainly as the sapling only produces the tree, ' each after its kind.' He who talks vice will become vicious, so far as his courage will permit. He who loves impure thoughts will naturally illustrate these thoughts in daily life, while he whose heart-tablet is free from the impress of unholy thoughts and vicious desires will naturally be kept from the outcropping of sins.
