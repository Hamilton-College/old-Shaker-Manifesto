MRS. MILLER NOT DEBARRED BY SEX. An impartial examination of her qualifications as master of a vessel ordered. Washington, Feb. 2.�Secretary Folger to-day wrote to the Supervising Inspector General of Steam Vessels as follows in regard to the application of Mrs. Mary A. Miller, of Nhw Orleans, for a license as the master of a steamboat plying on the Ouachita Eiver : 'A woman, Mary A. Miller by name, seeks to be licensed as a master of a steam vessel on the inland waters of the United States. I know of nothing imperative in the reason of things, in natural law, in public policy, or in good morals, why a woman, if she is skilled, honest, intelligent, hardy and prudent enough, may not have command of a steam vessel, and navigate it, and manage and conduct the business carried on with it. To do that, is to be a master of a steam vessel. There is, however, statute law upon the subject. 'The United States Revised Statutes, Section No. 4,4,58, says : ' That the Board of Local Inspectors of Steam Vessels shall license and classify the masters of all steam vessels ; and that it is unlawful for any person to serve as a master on any steamer who is not thus licensed.' Section No. 4,439 says: 'That whenever any person applies to be licensed as master of a steam vessel, the Inspector shall diligently inquire as to his character, and examine the proofs which he presents, and if they are satisfied as to his character, etc. etc., shall grant him a license to serve as a master.' Doubtless these sections speak in the masculine gender. If it be said that, therefore, they do not contemplate the licensing of a person feminine, it is no more technical and close to reply that they are statutes in derogation of the common law, by which, or not in a contravention of which, any person, whether female or male, may paddle her or his own canoe, or steer or conduct her or his own vessel under sail or driven by steam. Being in derogation of the common law, these statues are to be strictly construed. If then, the power to licence being couched in the masculin) gender, they do not permit the licensing of a person of the feminine gender, so the prohibition against serving as a master, being couched in the masculine gender, does not prohibit a person of the feminine gender. 'But I am not crowded as close to the wall as that. It has been held by courts that statutes 'vhich speak of males [as of peers,] and confer personal privileges, include females [as peeresses] though only males are mentioned ; but still nearer to the heart of the matter :�The United States Revised Statutes, Section No. 1, gives definitions, and says : That words imputing the masculine gender may be applied to females; so that Section No. 4,438, when it speaks, that when it is unlawful for any person to serve as a master on any steamer who is not licensed, means and says ;hat it is as unlawful for a woman as a man to serve without a license, but in as nv.:ch as its anguage is a negative pregnant, it is quick with the implication that a woman as well as a man, who is licensed, may thus serve, and Section No. 4,439, when it speaks, that when ever any person applies to be licensed the Inspectors shall diligently inquire as to his character, etc., etc., means any person, female or male, and her as well as his character, etc., etc. THE SECRETARY'S CONCLUSIONS. 'I see no reason then, in unwritten or in written law, why Mistress Miller may not lawfully demand an examination, and if she prove herself duly qualified, have a license to serve as a master of a steam vessel. Nor is there need of talk, pro or con, on social status, or ' Woman's Rights,' so called. Having been put on God's footstool by Him, she has the right to win her bread, in any moral, decent way, which is open to any of His toiling creatures. She chooses to do so, as the master of a steam vessel. It is an honest calling. If she is fitted for it, though clothed in skirts rather than breeches, she has a right to follow it, and no man should say her nay. ' Let the local inspectors, putting behind the small thought of her sex, without antagonism and without partiality, make diligent inquiry as to her character, carefully examine her and the proofs she offers, and if they are satisfied that her capacity, her experience, her habits of life and character, warrant a belief that she can be safely intrusted with the duties and responsibilities of a master of a steam vessel, let them grant her a license, according to Section No. 4,439.
