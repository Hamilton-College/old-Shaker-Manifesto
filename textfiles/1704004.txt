'ONE AT A TIME.' C. G. THARIN. One step at a time, and that well placed, We reach the grandest height; One stroke at a time, earth's hidden stores Will slowly come to light; One seed at a time, and the forest grows; One drop at a time and the river flows Into the boundless sea. One word at a tinu1, and the greatest book Is written and is read; One stone at a time, a palace rears Aloft its stately liead; One blow at a time, and the tree's cleft thro' And a city will stand where the forest grew A few short years before. One foe at a time, and he subdued, And the conflict will be won; One grain at a time, and the sands of life Will slowly all be run. One minute, another, the hours fly; One day at a time, and our lives speed by Into eternity. [stored; One grain of knowledge, and that well Another, and more on them ; [shine And, as time rolls on, your mind will With many a garnered gem Of thought and wisdom. And time will tell. 'One thing at a time, and that done well,' Is wisdom's proven rule. Golden Days.
