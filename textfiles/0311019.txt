'NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE.' Words of charity unequal'd, Breathed by one who bore the cross, Who had fathom'd human sorrow, And could feel for human loss. How like the balm they must have fallen On the poor transgressor's heart, Courage to her soul imparting, Ne'er from virtue's way to part. O that all the fallen mortals, Dwelling on this earthly shore, By these words might be encouraged, And go forth and sin no more. But, alas ! the cold world hearkens Not to their deep cries of woe ; They have fallen, and are trodden Down to earth by high and low. Hear ye not their bitter wailing, You who boast of Virtue's gift ? Pride or hatred will not raise them, Only love their souls can lift. Shall we mortals, prone to evil, Slight, despise, or censure them ? Shall we crush, adjudge, or injure Those whom Christ did not condemn ? Place ourselves in their condition, Just imagine for awhile, 'Were we earth's poor outcast children, With no friend on us to smile, Would it prompt us to seek virtue, If all hearts had callous grown, And exulted in the contrast Of their station with our own ? Nay, one kindly proffer'd feeling, E'en a word or look of cheer, Oft will turn a soul from evil That would sink were we severe. Think of men engross'd in business, False unto the very core, Holding up their heads in honor, Welcome guests at every door. While their feeble, helpless victims Are rejected and cast down, They are courted, they — the spoilers — Never meet the sneer or frown. God is just: his mercy floweth Not to person, name, or sect; In his eyes all sin is hateful, But the truth He doth respect. Those who (sin-sick and forsaken By their fellow mortals here) Seek the Lord, He will protect them; For to Him all souls are dear. Then arise, O sinning sister, Knock at Virtue's pleasant door, Christ, your Savior, will receive you, Enter in, and ' sin no more.' Rosie Morse, Shirley, Mass.
