Tribute to Sister POLLY LEWIS. PASSING AWAY OF THE ANCIENTS. By Cecelia DeVere. When the ancients of the city pass away, Sorrow gently mingles love with pain, And the sombre portals dim and gray Vibrate with the angel's lifting strain. Golden latch and golden hinges are not slow to ope, Aud our glorious banner's fringes glow with cheering hope, Yet we feel a human sorrow and a human cross, And we know that earth's to-morrow holds our heavy loss. Ah ! we miss the forms we cherished thro' the vanished years, Long for voices that have perished 'mid our falling tears. She whose soul was pure and lowly as the sweetest flower, With a faith divinsly holy walked in dauntless power, No display of gift or treasure brought she vainly forth, Yet we could not guage the measure of her innate worth, 'Twas a daily revelation in her temporal place, As her spiritual salvation shed translucent grace. In the mart of custom standing, meeting with the world, Honor's highest mesd commanding e'en where folly whirled. Lightest minds grew staid before her, wild emotions settled down, 'Neath the halo shining o'er her, she was never known to frown. ''Dear Aunt Polly' strangjrs named her, with a reverent look and air, While they felt the light that framed her was the circle of soul prayer. Fragile form and quiet bearing yet a tower of strength, Labor's heavy burdens sharing through her brave life's length. Round the loved ones she is leaving in her little central home, We our tenderest thot's are weaving that some signal good may come. While the ancients of the city are a potent unseen band, To life's changes bringing pity, and the wise and helpful hand. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
