TRUE LOVE. AMELIA J. CALVER. When the sky is cloudless and we pursue our journey in sunshine, with buoyant hopes and a glad heart, we sigh not though much of the love we feel from others, is manifested in a bow of recognition as we pass. But when the storm beats down upon us, and blinding sleet obscures the way, ah! then how our hearts long for the love which opens the door, and with a hearty welcome, calls us in, to share the hospitality of the glowing fireside.
