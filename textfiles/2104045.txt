Beloved Elder Henry;--The box with the books came safely to hand... Sonyea, March 23, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry;ï¿½The box with the books came safely to hand. Thank you kindly for the same and am sorry if it has caused you any trouble. We prize them much and in reading the book realize more keenly our great loss, but have a strong and an abiding trust in those principles and that faith which produced such a good, grand and noble character. One of the Saviors that were to come up upon Mount Zion, pointing the way to a higher and holier life. Zion needs many such and humanity is looking for just such leaders to lead them out of the darkness of an unregenerate life. We hope the book will prove a blessing to all who may have the privilege to read it. Kindest of love to all and for all. Your Brother, A. L. Work.
