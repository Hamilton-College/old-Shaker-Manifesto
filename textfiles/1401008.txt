SIGNS Wheke spades grow bright, And idle swords grow dull; Where jails are empty, And where barns are full; Where field-paths are With frequent feet out-worn, Law court-yards weedy. Silent and forlorn; Where doctors foot it, And where farmers ride ; Where age abounds, And youth is multiplied; Where poisonous drinks Are chased from every place ; Where opium's curse No longer leaves a trace— Where these signs are They clearly indicate A happy people And a well-ruled State. —From the Chinese.
