In Memory of Elder JOHN VANCE. By Eva M. Libbey. Lo, an angelic reaper, Hath borne from earth away, The spirit of our father, To dwell in endless day; Where hosts of shining angels Await with outstretched hands, To welcome our dear Elder To that bright and happy land. His life was one of blessing While journeying here below; He was loving and forgiving, And did to each one, show A spirit of true patience, Of charity and love; He was blessed with holy wisdom That cometh from above. He gave his life for others, Nor did one moment spare For selfish ease or pleasure, But every thought and care Was for his gospel kindred, That they might safely be Guided through all dangers, On life's tempestuous sea. A life of self-denial He taught from day to day, And on from simple childhood He walked the narrow way. O may his pure example Be our guide while dwelling here, As the upward path we travel May we feel his presence near. And now beloved father, Thy blessing o'er us spread As a mantle of protection, And as our daily bread. Farewell, we all shall miss you, Grief and sorrow fills each heart; May we meet again in heaven Never more from peace to part. Alfred, Me.
