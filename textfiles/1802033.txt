Juvenile. Orcutt, Beloved Elder :--Allow me to say to you this fine morning... Shaker Village, N. H., Feb. 1888'. Daniel Orcutt, Beloved Elder :�-Allow me to say to you this fine morning that we find ourselves at Canterbury still giving thanks for the countless temporal and spiritual blessings which seem to environ as. Among the most noteworthy of these let us mention the kind encouraging words, and the virtuous influences, which reach us so often through the columns of the little Manifesto. And you must not be surprised if we send to you personally a special tribute of thanks from the youthful class, which you will please accept. Your manifest interest in their mental and spiritual growth is very apparent and has been felt and realized in the many instructive letters which you have kindly addressed to them through the medium just mentioned. I trust that we need not quote scripture to prove that yourself and many other worthy contributors to our paper, are entitled to a special expression of gratitude from the many readers. You are, no doubt, already aware of what is stated in 2 Cor. ix., 6, 7, and of its personal application ; thus�'� lie which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully'�and again, ' God loveth the cheerful giver,' therefore you must easily be convinced that our special tribute is mailed to the right address. As we are all learners in the school of Christ we must also all become children agreeably to his teachings if we would enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Thus v,':' include ourselves always in that class whom you are wont to favor with good advice. A significant jtliought in one of your letters most seriously impressed me. It was this.� ��While you are wai.ingfor opportunities to come, present opportunities are passing away forever:' Could we all properly realize this truth how many golden moments would be saved to us! Another pertinent saying re curs to me by a certain writer who said 'A wealthy man who obtains wealth honestly and uses it rightly is a great blessing to any community.' So I think that the individual who is rich toward God having obtained a spiritual competence by honest soul labor even while he toils for an earthly subsistence is by far the more wealthy of the two, and the more useful in Society. In this light we view those progressed individuals who always have some good spiritual gift to give to the hungrj poor. It has been my happy privilege to dwell with many worthy characters who are thus rich toward God and who are daily sowing the seeds of virtue in youthful hearts; and they too whose lives are so hid with Christ in God that their good deeds can never be numbered in Time, but Eternity keeps the record. Now, dear Elder, please accept our offering and feel blest in the efforts you have made for the youthful readers of today. That you will realize some satisfactory results from your labors of love, in the future, is our latest petition. Please accept with this an expression of kind regards from all within our home circle, which includes the whole household of Brethren and Sisters. Jennie H. Fish.
