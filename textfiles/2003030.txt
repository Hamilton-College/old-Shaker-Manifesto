Canaan, N. Y. Feb. 1890. Bel .ved Elder Henry;ï¿½The two copies of the Memorial Services in memory of Sister Mary Whitcher, were received in duo time, for which accept our kind thanks. You may be sure they weve pretty thoroughly read and much appreciated by all. There is no life that develops such strong ties of friendship like the true believer's. In health in sickness, in joy or sorrow, it is the same. How different it is from the friendship of the world. I am always thankful to hear of the departure of the spirit from the mortal form after it has completed its work here, aud our worthy Sister Mary has passed to her beautiful home in the spiritual world, there to enjoy the fruitage of a long life of sacrifice and consecration to God while in the body; my sincere prayer is that we all may become purified aud glorified spirits like unto her. We are very much interested in home notes in the Manifesto ; like to know what our good Brethren and Sisters are about occasionally. We have just finished harvesting our yearly ice crop; the quality of it is very good. The Brethren are getting some sleepers out for the R. R. Company to keep the world's wolf from the door. La Grippe thought it had considerable work to do in our family and took hold quite strongly for a few days, but found the company so uncongenial that it concluded to move on ; I hope it will not stop until it plunges into one of the large oceans or twines itself around the North Pole Be so kind as to a.-cept the love of the Brethren and Sisters. Hoping when you again visit Mt. Lebanon you may be able to materialize your presence in our midst, we remain Your Brother, George W. Clark.
