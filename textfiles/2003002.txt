ENCOURAGEMENT. Cecelia De Vere. The hour of Zion's transit is at hand, Glory or failure just before her lie, 'Tis hers to shine o'er earth, a beacon grand, Or, it is hers to sink to ease and die. Her truth will never die; the rolling years Shall keep it on the bosom of all time, Until a noble race on earth appears Who will accept it as a boon sublime. Her own true heirs are noble, now, to-day, While they receive the pentecostal might, One soul can chase a thousand wrongs away, And two can put ten thousand sins to flight. For sin and wrong are all that can oppose, They are the enemies that compass round, They are the only lurking deadly foes, That can invade the consecrated ground. The Lord his faithful messengers has sent To cry aloud, to warn and to inspire, To teach all souls how best they may repent, And how draw down the altar's cleansing lire. The pure in heart arrayed in vesture rare, In reconciliation's diadem, Meet God's Anointed in the gift of prayer, While deep sustaining love encircle them. The pure in heart will not contest the right With caviling word, with ha,ughty, blind self-will; But seeking holy counsel, heavenly light, Shall, like the firmament, with gems upfill. Not for ambition, not for self at all; For Zion's sake, for Zion's cause they live; Awa.ke, they hear the onward, upward call, And gladly, thankfully, new effort give. When they remember Jesus with his few, And Mother with her number smaller still, And then the promise, 'greater works to do,' They will come forth their destiny to fill. And they will dwell before the suffering earth Her last, last hope, the Way, the Life secure, Possessed of all that hath intrinsic worth, And blest as only can be blest the pure. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
