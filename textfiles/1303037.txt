GENTLE WORDS. A lesson for the year 1883. OTIS SAWYER. More precious far than mines of gold Or fragrance sweet that flowers hold, A wealth that never's yet been told,— • Are Wisdom's gentle words. What so adorns in every place, And qualifies with Christian grace, Lights, beaming halo on the face— Like pure and gentle words. What power can calm the passions wild Like pleadings breathed in accents mild, And melt in tears the erring child— Like earnest, gentle words. The soul sin-laden, sorrow feels,— With bleeding heart each wrong reveals, Then, what the wound so soothes and healsLike sweet forgiving, gentle words. What draws the soul in valleys Ioav, From giddy heights, and bids to go Where angels can their gifts bestow,— Like Jesus' gentle words. 'Come unto me ye weary souls, For I have rest that love unfolds' We yield,—the heavy burden rolls ! O power of gentle words. What surer proof can e'er be given, That we, within, have formed a heaven That peace is not by passion riven,— Than calm and gentle words. This is the test, the heart within Is purified and cleansed from sin, That from it flows expressions clean,— Chaste and gentle words. These are the gems in silver set, The golden fruit that worth reflect, The gift, the godly man perfect,— Christ like, gentle words. When dying, then what pleasure given To know our words were fitly spoken, Then sure as God, so sure of heaven,— Immortal fruit of gentle words. West Gloucester, Me.
