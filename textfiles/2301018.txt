Alfred, Me. Dec. 1892. The winter term of school commenced Nov. 22, with sixteen scholars. An Otto Gasoline Engine has been put into the Dairy to take the place of the hot air engine formerly used for separating the milk and churning the butter. We hope it may prove as satisfactory as anticipated. The old year is nearly at a close and the New Year about to dawn. As we look back through the past, can we count as many victories as .we hoped for when the year began? if so, it is well with us, if not, let us pray for more courage, strength and Christian fortitude that the coming year may bring to our souls that growth of the Spirit we all sincerely desire. We extend to every one in our Zion Homes, our purest and earnest prayers, that the coming year may be a happy and prosperous New Year. F. C.
