1883. The world is growing better Every year; It throws off many a fetter Every year; There are many things to relish, Though the ancient things must perish, But the beautiful we cherish Every year. Many changes have come o'er us Every year; Many friends have gone before us Every year; Through many a strange mutation We have reached a higher station Every year. We have had our slight vexations Every year; â€¢ And pleasing jubilations ' Every year; There are visions to remember Of flowers in September, u THE MANIFESTO. 57 And Christmas in December, Every year. The sun shines now as brightly Every year; And the snowflakes fall as lightly Every year, As in days when we were younger, And the years appeared much longer To our hearts, which then felt stronger, Every year. Afflictions have not shrouded Every year: And troubles have not clouded Every year; But hope the whole discounted, While the former were recounted, And the latter all surmounted Every year. The end of life comes nearer Every year; The friends left become dearer Every year; And tlv3 'goal of all that's mortal' Opens wider still its portal To the land of the immortal Every year. And thinner grows the curtain Every year: That divides us from the certain, Every year : We look forward to the morrow Which shall close all earthly sorrow With the calmness Hope can borrow.Every year. William Reed, in Taunton(Mass.) Gazette.
