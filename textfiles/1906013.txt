Dear Manifesto:--You are ever a welcome visitor in our home... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Mar. 1889. Dear Manifesto :ï¿½You are ever a welcome visitor in our home. A source of comfort and joy as month after month we grasp each number and eagerly feast on the good things therein, kindly bestowed upon us by dear, beloved, gospel friends from the several Societies. The Editorials are able, instructive and highly entertaining. Personally, I have found encouragement and strength, and oftentimes much comfort in the perusal. I was much pleased with the March Number. It came replete with goodness and blessing, illumined with bright hope bearing tidings of good cheer to all. The letter from our Sister, A. C. Stickney is a model of kindliness and true-hearted Christianity, and the doubting heart may well be strengthened after perusing the article from the pen of Br. Louis Basting. To sum it all, there is the deep, Fatherly wisdom, sweet Motherly love and counsel, the sturdy compaoionship of youth combined with the precious utterances of childhood, to be found in the March Manifesto. For twelve years or more, I have been an interested reader of the beautiful and encouraging articles from Br. Daniel Orcutt, and long ago anticipated sending a word of thanks for the same. But oh! procrastination, the thief of time, stole away the opportunity, and lo ! in the March No., I find a kind and appreciative soul has heartily responded. I gladly join with my unknown Sister in far away Kentucky in t! e tribute of love and thanks for the good Brother's untiring zeal in behalf of the youth. Dear Manifesto, may your light ever continue to shine brighter and brighter. I believe the ties of brother-hood and sister-hood are strengthened through your pages and can be more and more. There are those in every Community that I love and most eagerly are the articles read when a familiar name is attached, and when there is no signature we feel that it comes from some beloved co-worker in the field of action. The other day I asked a Brother, 'have you read a certain article in the Manifesto ?' He answered, '1 have not yet come to it. I always begin at the beginning and go through it.' May this interest in the Manifesto increase. With the new year came new hopes, and new promises, and one of my resolutions was to cheerfully perform every duty that presented itself. I felt that it was my duty and indeed a pleasure to address these few lines to you, dear Manifesto, and will conclude in the words of a song. 'Oh praise ye the Lord And rejoice in his goodness, Bright, living souls who in Righteous works abound, 'Tis your right to be joyful And sing holy praises, And glorify Him For the prize you have found. Oh sing hallelujah, glory and honor be To those who have brought the Gospel on earth, We bless the pure source And we'll drink the sweet waters That fill us with joy, Thanksgiving and mirth.' Ever yours for truth, Lizzie A. Kidd.
