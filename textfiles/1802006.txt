REVIEW Of ' Fighting Negations' in January No. of Manifesto, 1888. Giles B. Avery. ' My heart is inditing a good matter ' �45th. Psalm 1. If my pen but follow the dictates of my heart, I shall do good, and good only; this is my purpose, my desire. I would be a Friend. And, ' Whoever undertakes a friend's great part, Must be renewed in nature; pure in heart, Prepar'd for martyrdom, and strong to prove, In thousand ways, the force of genuine love !' 'Thereis a river that maketh glad the city of God,' and, it is evident our Author, whose article we criticise, is striving to have all souls bathe therein. We will help him, and, would be Godlike, of whom the Psalmist says, 'Thou lovest righteousness, and hateth wickedness! ' Criticism, in the spirit of speculative strife, is unkind,�unbrotherly, and productive of no good. But, performed in love, both to Author and reader, with a purpose to avoid misleading the simple, and making more clear to the understanding of the experienced, it must be acceptable to the spirit of sincere friendship to man, and love to God, and man, as a true philanthropist. We will now leave our Author, in the Parlor, with the Psalmist, while we go ont into the field of investigation ; to criticise what is written and seek out truth, because, truth alone can make us free ! In the article 'FightingNegations' we find so much gold, it is painful to feel obliged to criticise some of the sentiments therein. Yet, fearing, without a better digest of the same, honest souls might be led in a wrong path, by sophistry, we proceed. The article, as it now stands, to us, appears conglomerate, and, to speak Geologically, like a pudding-stone, which needs the mental geologist to analyze, and refer each idea to its appropriate shelf, or position, preserving the gold in its pure state, and relegating the quartz and pebbles to their proper den. To properly understand a sentence, we need a clear idea of the meaning of words. Let us, then inquire the meaning of ' Negations.' It is a declaration that something is not, does not exist. In other words ' The absence of that which does not belong to the thing we are speaking of.' 1st. Now what is our Author speaking of? Ans. Love, and interest for virtue ; mercy, purity, goodness, righteousness. 2nd. What is it that does not belong to these things? He tells us, '�'�Appalling cruelty, disgusting sensuality, sinful habits, courses, evil propensities, violated laws.' The absence of these qualities, would be negations of evil. Thus, if there were no such qualities, or habits of evil, there could be nothing to fight! What does experience and observation teach us? Ans. that those properties, qualities, and habits exist as powerfully acting agents, with a vengeance ! Is there not, therefore a something left to ' fight' and be ' hated?' Look at the destructive and desolating forces of evil that destroyed kingdoms and empires ! Blotted from the face of the earth, billions of human beings by the most barbarous, devilish, and inhuman means of cruelty that human ingenuity could invent; and destroyed thousands upon thousands of large and beautiful cities, as Thebes, with its hundred gates, and multitudes of polished marble temples; a city 25 miles in circuit, with streets eight miles long. The Satanic Crusade Wars, that made holocausts of millions of human beings by burning them alive. Look at the devilish martyrdoms, that wrenched the life from millions by every means of torture that a barbaric and hellish imagination could invent, rack, gibbet, thumbscrews, hanging by one foot, head downward, flaying alive, suspending on stakes, &amp;c. These, were, indeed, something besides 'negations' they were active forces with a witness. These selfish fiendish influences of robbing the poor of their earnings, depriving them of the land, forcing them to beggary and starvation, to sell their innocence for bread, still exist, threatening the destruction of kingdoms and empires, as of yore. All this arises from the selfishness, the lust for power and dominion, and the gratification of sinful appetites and passions. Call these 'negations?' As well call the ei,rth a soap bubble ! Who, in any use of reason, can imagine these evils, 'negations?' And, what living soul, sensing the terrible havoc of human happiness produced by these evils can feel that they are not to be hated, and, in reference to them ' a godly man�a Christian, is under no necessity to hate anything!' Perish the thought. Jesus Christ, and his true followers hated these propensities in themselves so forcibly that they put their carnal lives to death. Is not that hating with a vengeance? Thus did Mother Ann Lee and thus do all the Saints of the Church of Christ's Second Appearing. Yet, truly it is a great grace to attain that government of the soul, by the Christ spirit that we can hate sins, and not hate souls! But, we opine, that to every enlightened aud living soul it would seem to be a very great 'wonder, to eventually come to find that a godly man, a Christian, is under no necessity to hate anything!' Not much less wonder would it be indeed, that the Heavens should go up in smoke ! Our beloved Author of 'Fighting Negations' evidently mistakes the state militant of soul, and of the Christian Church, for the state triumphant! But, until the Christian Pilgrim, and every soul of humanity has entirely subdued every evil propensity, every quality op- posed to goodness, human intelligences striving for goodness must be militant; must hate evil in every form, as an active force against good, not treat it as a mere creature of the imagination, a 'negation !' When complete redemption of the entire race of man is attained, then, hatred may cease ! But never will the hatred of a heaven born soul cease against all the wicked propensities that deluge the world with sin, while one sin remains in the human family; it would be impossible. To be a Christian, a person must love as Christ loved, ones enemies' souls as really as ones friends, and hate as Christ hated ; and he taught 'No man can serve two masters' (at one and same time,) 'for either he will hate the one and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.' Matt, vi., 24. And again 'If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple' cannot be a Christian. In the face of this doctrine, how is it, our brother Author 'that we eventually can come to find, that a godly man�a Christian, is under no necessity to hate anything?' Where may we find the authority to impugn the teachings of Christ? And, if we do, what right have we to assume the name of Christian? But, what Christ here taught to hate, was not the souls, as persons, of any of these relations ; but the carnal life, that constituted them sinful beings, and, whose life element was in a sinful nature. To hate souls, the brother, sister, parent, neighbor, is cruel. St. John says, 'Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer ; and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding iu him.' 1 John iii., 15. St. Jude helps the good sentiments of our Author's article, in that he says, 'And, of some have compassion, making a difference. And others, save with fear' (as well as love,) 'pulling them out of the fire.' (But) 'Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.' Jude 23. The angel of the Church of Pergamos told the Church he ' had a few things against thee, because thou hast there those, that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols 'negations' and, to commit fornication !'(no negation here.) 'So hast thou also, them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.' Rev. ii., 14, 15. Here, the angel finds something to be hated besides 'negations !' Let us not, then, my Brethren, while we would be traveling for the Kingdom of God, be deceived by sophistry, mixing good and evil qualities of doctrine ; nor lay down, or sheath our Gospel swords of hatred to sin while even one soul of humanity is unredeemed to God. At that Advent we may love, and love ONLY ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
