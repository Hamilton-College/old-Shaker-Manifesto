MEETING. John G. Whittier. The breath of a diviner air Blows down the answer of a prayer, And all our sorrow, pain, and doubt A great compassion clasps about, And law and goodness, love and force, Are wedded fast beyond divorce. Then duty leaves to love its task, The beggar Self forgets to ask; With smile of trust and folded hands The passive soul in waiting stands To feel, as flowers, the sun and dew, The One true Life its own renew. So, to the calmly gathered thought The innermost of truth is taught, The mystery dimly understood, That love of God is love of good, And chiefly, its divinest trace In Him of Nazareth's holy face; That to be saved is only this� Salvation from our selfishness, From more than elemental fire, The soul's unsanctified desire, Prom sin itself, and not the pain That warns us of its chafing chain ; That worship's deeper meaning lies In mercy, and not sacrifice, Not proud humilities of sense But love's unforced obedience ; That Book and Church and Day are given For man, not God�for earth, not heaven, The blessed means to holiest ends, Not masters, but benignant friends ; That the dear Christ dwells not afar, The king of some remoter star, But flames o'er all the thronging host The baptism of the Holy Ghost; Heart answers heart, in one desire The blending lines of prayer aspire ; 'When in my name, meet two or three,' Our Lord hath said, 'I there will be!'
