LIFE SAVED BY LAUGHTER. A Scottish bishop in the seventeenth century, Dr. Patrick Scongal, being earnestly besought by an old lady to visit her sick cow, the prelate after many remonstrances, reluctantly consented, and walking round the beast said, gravely, 'If she live, she live,and if she die, she die; and I can do nae mair for her.'' Not long afterward he was dangerously afflicted with a quinsy in the throat. Hereupon the old lady, having got access to his chamber, walked round his bed, repeating the words which the bishop had pronounced when walking round the cow, and which she believed had cured the animal. At this extraordinary sight the bishop was seized with a fit of laughter, which broke the quinsy and saved his life. The School World.
