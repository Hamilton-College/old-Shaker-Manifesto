[Contributed by Joseph Woods.] JOHN AND THE MINISTER How to Improve the Time. John having hired out to work for the Minister, was directed by him, one morning, to take old Buck and Berry and the harrow, and harrow a certain piece of plowed land, so that it might be suitable for planting. John look the cattle and harrow and went to work. The weather being warm and the old harrow hanging back, in about one hour the oxen began to show unmistakable signs of approaching resolution, and soon came to a halt, having their mouths open, their tongues protruding, and making sounds which John wisely interpreted to be their funeral song. Being of a merciful turn of mind and somewhat serious, he caught the inspiration of the hour, and quietly seated himself as an attentive listener,�if so be he might learn the tune. The good Minister, ever watchful, made the discovery very soon that John was idle. He thought it would not be profitable at such wages, fifty cents per day to so 3pend his time. Accordingly, he leisurely walked to where John was seated, his attention in the meantime being toward some surrounding objects. John could not really design what it was ; but was soon enlightened by the Minister. John, said he, would it not he a good plan for you to have a scythe, and hubble a few bushes while the oxen are resting? John, knowing the Minister was hired for $800. per year, to preach and make himself otherwise useful to the people, and that a part of his own low wages went as 'Minister's tax, ' did not answer the question, but asked him if it would not be a good plan to carry a sw ingle and knife and a bunch of flax into the pulpit, so that when the choir were singing the hymn, he could swingle a few handfuls of flax?�Selected. P. S.�We have not learned whether John lias bubbled a bush, or whether the Minister concluded to swingle his flax in the pulpit, but are inclined to believe he kept it at home for John to swingle some rainy day.
