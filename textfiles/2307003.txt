GOOD NIGHT. Anna B. Goepper. How sweetly falls the gentle 'good night' into loving hearts, as members of a family separate and retire for the night. What myriads of hasty words and thoughtless acts, are forever blotted out by its benign influence. Small token indeed ; but it is the little courtesies that make up the sum of a happy home. It is the small courtesies that round off the square corners so beautifully in the homes of laboring men and women. The simple 'I thank you' for a favor received, will fill with happiness the heart of the giver. True wealth is not counted by dollars, but by the gratitude and affection of the heart. If a home be happy, whether the owner possess a patch of ground of one or a thousand acres, they are in the end wealthy beyond calculation. Then how much more lovingly are the folds of night gathered around the happy homes ; how much more confidingly do its members repose their weary bodies in the care of Divine goodness, soothing their overtaxed minds to realities of a beautiful dreamland, awakened, refreshed and invigorated for labor of the coming day, by having bid their loved ones an affectionate ' 'good night.' And if during this life we have faithfully attended to all these little soul needs, at the close of its brief, yet eventful period, how much easier to bid all our dearly beloved ones a final 'good night.'
