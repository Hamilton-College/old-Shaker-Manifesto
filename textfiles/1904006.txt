RETROSPECTIVE. Catherine Allen. The screen to all external things Around me now doth gently close, And in the silent vale of thought My spirit findeth calm repose The changeless record of my life Before my vision here is placed ; The thoughts and motives of my heart By memory's pencil clearly traced. I turn its numbered pages o'er, And retrospectively behold The years of sentient consciousness, That from my life have onward rolled. All shadowed in uncertainty My childhood's winding paths appear, Its joys to sorrows oft were changed, And hope was dimmed by mingled fear. But through those mists of dawning morn, I know an unseen guide was near, A friend whose tender, pitying love My faltering steps directed here. And when I count the fleeting years Borne from my grasp in rapid flight, I pause to mark that season blest, time's pages gleaming bright, When first that angel minister Dropped in my heart a burning coal, And kindled faith's unfailing fire Upon the altar of my soul. The love of God had warmed my heart, And given courage for the strife, And taught that through the gates of death We pass to realms of angel life. Increasing hope, and love and peace, Since then my years with joy have fraught As brighter in my soul have glowed The flames through which these gifts are [wrought. And while upon the Book of Time, The rolling years new records write, From memory shall never fade The index of that season bright. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
