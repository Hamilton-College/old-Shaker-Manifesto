GOOD WORKS Op what profit is faith unless it be made manifest by good works f Good words, when timely and fitly spokon, often give solace to the afflicted, and comfort the mourner ; but to the naked and famishing, ' Be ye warmed and clothed,' in word only, would be of little account. By good works we not only ' lay up treasure in heaven,' but like Dorcas of old, confer benefits upon destitute humanity, and blessings return to us manifold. We may be very correct in our faith, and love, admire and laud others, who show their faith by works, yet, if we lack the courage and energy to reduce our faith to practice, it would be as unavailing as implements in the hands of the husbandman who is too indolent to use them. Deeds of charity toward individuals, and acts of kindness and generosity, attended with soft and gentle words that will prevent or turn away wrath in communities, would form a heaven on earth, and pure, peaceful spirits would delight to gather around and hold communion with such souls, for they are nearly allied to angels.
