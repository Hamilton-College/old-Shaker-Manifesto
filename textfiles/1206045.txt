PRESERVING HARNESS The first point to be observed is to keep the leather soft and pliable. This can be done only by keeping it well charged with oil and grease. Water is a destroyer of each of these ; but mud and saline moisture from the animal are even more destructive. Mud, in drying, absorbs the grease and opens the pores of the Lleather, making it a ready prey to water; while the salty character of the perspiration from the animal injures the leather, stitching and mounting. It, therefore, follows that, to preserve a harness, the straps should be washed and oiled at intervals as required. To do this effectually, the straps should all be unbuckled and detached, and washed with warm,-soft water and crown soap, and hung by a slow fire or in the sun until nearly dry, then, coated with a mixture of neatsfoot oil and tallow and allowed to remain in a warm room for several hours, and when perfectly dry rub thoroughly with a woolen rag. The rubbing is important, as it in addition to removing the surplus oil and grease, tends to close the pores and give a finish to the leather. In hanging harness, care should be taken to allow all the straps to hang their full length. Light is essential to the care of leather, and when the harness closet is dark the door should be left open at least half the time during the day. All closets should be well ventilated and, when possible, be well lighted. To clean plated mountings, use a chamois with a little tripoli or rotten stone. But they should be scoured as little as possible. Harness Journal.
