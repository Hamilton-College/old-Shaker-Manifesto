LIFE THOUGHTS Equalizaton of emotion There 3 is no worldly gain without some' loss I so there is no worldly loss without some s gain. If thou hast lost thy wealth, thoi r hast lost some trouble with it; if thou art degraded from honor, thou art like wise freed from the stroke of envy; i sickness has blurred thy beauty, it hath delivered thee from pride. Set the al lowance against the loss, and thou shal find no loss great. He loses little or 3 nothing that reserves himself. Com s passion is an emotion of which we ought never to be ashamed.—Graceful, particularly in youth, is the tear of sympathy, and the heart that melts at the ale of woe. We should not permit ease and indulgence to contract our affections, and wrap us up in selfish enoyment; but we should accustom ourselves to think of the distress of human life, of the solitary cottage, the dying parent, and the weeping orphan. Nor ought we ever to sport with pain and distress in any of our amusements, nor treat even the meanest insect with wanton cruelty. — Blair
