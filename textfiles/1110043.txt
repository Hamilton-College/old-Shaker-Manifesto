How to Tell a Good Potato .â€” Here is a good place in which to impart what is a secret to the vast majority of people, and it is one well worth knowing. It is simply how to tell a good potato ; that is, as well as it can be done without cooking it, for sometimes even experts are deceived. Take a sound potato, and paying no attention to its outward appearance, divide it into two pieces with your knife and examine the exposed surfaces. If there is so much water or 'juice' that seemingly a slight pressure would cause it to fall off in drops, you may be sure it will be ' soggy ' after it is boiled. These are the requisite qualities for a good potato, which must appear when one is cut in two : For color, a yellowish white ; if it is a deep yellow the potato will not cook well; there must be a considerable amount of moisture, though not too much ; rub the two pieces together and a white froth will appear around the edges and upon the two surfaces; this signifies the presence of starch, and the more starch, and consequently froth, the better the potato, while the less there is the poorer it will cook. The strength of the starchy element can be tested by releasing the hold upon one piece of the potato, and if it still clings to the other, this in itself is a very good sign. These are the experiments generally made by experts, and they are ordinarily willing to buy on the strength of their turning out well, though, as stated above, these tests are by no means infallible.
