THE CITY OF LIGHT Prof Felix Adler Have you heard of the Golden City Mentioned in the legends old? P&gt;verlasting light shines o'er it, Wondrous tales of it are told. Only righteous men and women Dwell within its gleaming wall; Wrong is banished from its borders, Justice reigns supreme o'er all. Do you ask : where is that city Where the perfect right doth reign? I must answer, I must tell you That you seek its site in vain. You may roam o'er hill and valley, You may pass o'er land and sea, You may search the wide earth over— 'Tis a city yet to be. We are builders of that city ; All our joys and all our groans Help to rear its shining ramparts ; All our lives are building-stones. Some can do but humblest service— Hew rough stones, or break the soil: 248 SHAKER MAN IFESTO. While the few alone may gather Joy and honor from their toil : While the few may plan the arches. And the fluted columns fair, And immortal thought embody. And immortal beauty there. But, if humble or exalted, All are called to task divine, All but aid alike to carry Forward one sublime design. What that plan may be we know not; How the seat of justice high, How the city of our vision Will appear to mortal eye— That no mortal eye can picture, That no mortal tongue can tell, We can barely dream the glories Of the future's citadel. But for it we still must labor, For its sake bear pain and grief. In it find the end of living And the anchor of belief. But a few brief years we labor; Soon our earthly day is o'er, Other builders take our places And 'our place knows us no more.' But t-he work that we have builded, Oft -with bleeding hands and tears, And in error and in anguish, Will not perish with our years. It will be at last made perfect In the universal plan; It will help to crown the labors Of the toiling hosts of man. It will last and shine transfigured In the final reign of right; It will merge into the splendors Of the city of the light. Religio P. J.
