NOBODY The publisher of The Shaker sent the following poem to the editor, o?i Valentine's day. Unable to decide whether any thing personal was intended, we lay it before the jury of our readers. We do not know to whom to give credit, but there's gospel, wit and wisdom in it.—Ed. If nobody's noticed you you must be small, If nobody's slighted you you must be tall; If nobody's bowed to you you must be low, If nobody's kissed you you're ugly we know. If nobody's envied you you're a poor elf, If nobody's flattered you you've flattered yourself; If nobody's cheated you you are a knave, If nobody's hated you you are a slave. If nobody's called you a fool to your face, Somebody's wished for your back in its place; If nobody's called you a tyrant or scold, Somebody thinks you a spiritless mold. If nobody knows of your faults but a friend, Nobody will miss them at the world's end; If nobody clings to your purse like a fawn, Nobody'll run like a hound when its gone. If nobody's eaten his bread from your store, Nobody'll call you a miserly bore; If nobody's slandered you —here is our pen, Sign yourself ' Nobody '—quick as you can.
