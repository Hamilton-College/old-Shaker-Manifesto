SWEET CONVICTION. JOSEPH BUCKINGHAM. Come sweet conviction, reign in me. Spare not thy chast'ning rod, Forsake me not, lest I forget The precious way of God. Conviction is a father's gift To mortals here below, Shows them the wretched state they're in, Exposed to signal woe. Confessing is a glorious work. It makes the angels sing, To see each soul on fire of truth, Exposing ev'ry sin. This is a precious gift of God, It stains all human pride; It drives the devil from the soul, Leaves him no place to hide. Forsaking is the richest gift It is the power of God, It turns the sinner short about, Into the heav'nly road. This is the resurrection power Which God has freely etiven. It frees the soul from every lust, And leads it up to Heaven. O sacred truth, come dwell in me, And make me strong to fight, The devil and his wicked hosts In darkest hours of night; Help me to cleanse my vessel clean From all impurity, That I may stand before God's throne From all pollutions free. O thankfulness come fill my soul That I may truly hate The filthy state of fallen man And all his deeds forsake, Help me to hate my nature base Which God will never own, Nor can it be conformed at last, To His Beloved Son. 0 help my soul Almighty God, Through Christ, thy precious son That I may honestly repent Of ev'ry sin or wrong. Help me to find new life and peace, And in obedience shine, And then all praise and glory shall Forevermore be thine. Watervliet, N. Y.
