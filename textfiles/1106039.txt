What the Microscope Says . â€” Insects o'f various kinds may be seen in the cavities of a grain of sand. Mould is a forest of beautiful trees, with the branches, leaves and fruit. Butterflies are fully feathered. Hairs are hollow tubes. The surface of our bodies is covered with scales like a fish ; a single grain of sand would cover 150 of these scales, and yet a scale covers 500 pores. Through these narrow openings the perspiration forces itself like water through a sieve. Each drop of stagnant water contains a world of living creatures swimming with as much liberty as whales in the sea. Each leaf has a colony of insects grazing on it like cows on a meadow. Yes, even the ugliest plant that grows shows some remarkable property when closely examined.
