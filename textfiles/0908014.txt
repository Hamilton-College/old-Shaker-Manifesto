A NEW PENTECOST F. W. Evans ELDER EVANS TELLS WHAT HE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE IF THE TRIBUNE'S IDEAS WERE CARRIED OUT. To the Editor of the Tribune : Friend : Saturday's editorial—Pentecost indeed ! ' Incredible events ' ! ! What were they ? The iconoclastic Tribune tells us to our face, and is it not to our shame ? Was not the editor inspired to preach to the preachers 1 God will speak, and will be heard, even if ' these stones ' have to be the mouthpiece, and a universe the auditor. If, as Professor Mapes claimed, it is by evolutionary processes that God moves the material world from primates to ultimates, is the mental and spiritual world in humanity to be alone fixed, stationary, until it is not the head, but the tail, of human motive forces ? Until the spiritual—religious—element, instead of being the life of God in human souls, becomes a myth, a snperstition, a bundle and jumble of effete priestly nothingarianism, a la Beecher and Talmage trials, a World's Protestant Evangelical Alliance, a prophetic conference about the second coming, logically ending in a Pocasset tragedy, by simple, sincere believing Second Adventists ? Freeman-was just what the Tribune urges the preachers to become —like Catholic Inquisitors, Protestant, Quaker and Witchcraft persecutors, religious warriors of all false systems—doers of their theology. Grant said : ' Put a bad law into practical operation—enforce it, or repeal it.' This is what the Tribune is at with the theologies—do them, or change them. Let the old Pentecost alone, or let us have a modern Pentecost, and the faithful Tribune will record the results. That is right—the editor is right. Let God speak through the secular press, through Infidel Communists, or through the Shakers, to test what is, and establish what should be. Any thing is better than this body of death. Let us all, as you suggest, ' look into the matter a little,' if we dare to do it. An upper room, filled with ordinary people—tax gatherers, fishermen, inn-keepers —fanatics all, who were sure to act out what they fully believed—hence how important that they believe right. The little house (a la Kiddle) suddenly shaken by a mighty rushing wind, and these men, with no cultivation, genius, or special gift of mind or body, instantly filled with the Divine Spirit—whatever that may be—but it is something that caused these common people to become, in a degree, as God's inspired to speak to every man in his own language, or tongue. Is it fanaticism, enthusiasm, or inspiration that asks the question, ' Why is not this thing done now ? ' The world surely needs the truth just as much as then. Drunkenness, fraud and unchastity, in the men and women of our Broadway, are as rife as in those who crowded up the Oriental mart. Terrible truths these to set before the clergy, the Wall street brokers, the Fifth Avenue dwell- THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 181 ers, and common people. ' Their God was really our God — why does not the mighty rushing wind come to us, and the tongues of fire?' These questions are put by the secular press, cognizant of the fact that beneath the shell of our modern hollow civilization there do flow on forever, irresistibly, the great currents of right and wrong, up to a true civilization that will secure, to the greatest number, the greatest possible good —or down to (Russian) brutality. Now, my dear Tribune, I ask, in the name of my old friend Horace, who often stands at your elbow, what would happen in New York if all your readers should fall into line and look at the Pentecost in that practical common sense way? If these internal fires —eternal, abstract truths—which do exist, as you declare, in the very souls of the population of the great city and its suburban villages, being merely crusted over with the conventionalism of society as it now exists, should burst up, as Mt. iEtna is doing, and overflow, would it not sink the whole system in a moment, like a great mill-stone dropped by an angel into the sea? If, in the next morning's issue, the Tribune should announce, with Divine authority—'Henceforth, all things are common, and let no man nor woman say, of aught they have possessed, it is mine, but ours,' would not the priests, if a great company of them were willingly obedient to the new faith, rise up in a body, as the heart of one man, and declare, in these words: 'It is a Spiritual force, and has come, like a mighty, rushing wind blowing through great masses of people, or the mind, perhaps, of our commonplace neighbors, changing instantly, and without apparent rational cause, their motives, lifting them suddenly to new planes of thought and action?' Are not many hungering souls ready for such food, or has the Tribune ceased to plead the cause, and give voice to the wants and desires of its constituents—the People ? Mt. Lebanon, June 2,1879.
