DRUGS Most happy have I just been made, by reading, in the last issue of this monthly, the strong testimony of such eminent physicians as Johnson and Magendie, against the false science of medicine. Having no basis on facts, it can never become a science whereby the cause of diseases can be removed. Alopath and Homopath imply other and new diseases, by means of which the absurd effort of curing the old one is put forth. As well say, two wrongs make one right — that evil spirits may be cast out by Beelzebub. Strictly speaking, disease is the merciful effort, nature puts forth, to remove an enemy from the body. It is a friend, not a foe, to be drugged, or doctored. Snuffis an enemy. Sneeze is a disease. Instead of restraining, or fighting such efforts, we should befriend them. Professor Magendie says: ' Nature does a great deal.' Yea, in the truest sense, all. We may, and ought to, undo what we have done amiss. If the sick be cold, warm. If too warm, cool — cleanse, inside and out, from all filthiness of flesh — acting, in all respects, with, not against, the wise efforts of nature. Dr. Franklin, in his celebrated almanac, had, among others, this wise saying — God cures — the physician collects the fee.' A fine poet expresses the same sentiment thus: ' Nature resists the injuries done her, Drugs and doctors get the honor.' Thousands, who have not yet, the moral stamina to adopt the great Shaker reform — apply the ax to the root of evil — lust and avarice — will gladly join them in applying it to bad diet, and even more destructive drugging.
