Juvenile. ACROSTIC. Promises from the Scriptures. Fear thou not; for I am with thee : be not dismayed; for I am thy God : Isaiah xli., 10. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad : for great is j-our reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Matt, v., 12. Every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is. 1 Cor. iii., 13. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. James iv., 8. Delight thyself also in the Lord and He shall give thee the desires of thy heart. Ps. xxxvii., 4. If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 John i., 9. Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 1 Cor.ii., 9. Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts li. 38.

Cod so loved the worli, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. John iii., 16. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. IF YOU WOULD BE HAPPY. Beware of the man of two faces. Persevere against discouragement. Take a cheerful view of everything. In all promised pleasures, put self last. Trust in God and mind your own business. Pray for a short memory as to all unkindnesses. Do not talk of your private, personal, or family matters. Put not your trust in money, but put your money in trust. Cultivate forbearance till your heart yields a fine crop of it. Give your tongue more holiday than your hands or your eyes. Examine into your own short-comings rather than those ol others. Be content to do the things you can, and fret not because you cannot do everything. Do the duty that lies nearest thee; thy second dut} will already have become clearer. Never reply in kind to a sharp or angry word; it is the second word that makes the quarrel. Make the best of what you have, and do not make yourself miserable by wishing for what you have not. The Good Way. HINTS TO WRITERS AND SPEAKERS. My young friends, I observe that you have used several French expressions in your article. I think if you will study the English language that you will find it capable of expressing all the ideas that you may have. I have always found it so and in all that I have written, I do not recall an instance when I was tempted to use a foreign word, but that on searching, I found a better one in my own language. Be simple, unaffected, be honest in your speaking and writing. Never use a long word when a short one will do. Call a spade, a spade, not a well known oblong instrument of manual industry, let a home be a home, not a residence, a place, not a locality and so of the rest. When a short word will do, you always lose by using a long one. You lose in clearness, you lose in honest expression of your meaning, and in the estimation of all men who are competent to judge, you lose in reputation for ability. The only true way to shine, even in this false world, is to be modest and unassuming. Falsehood may be a very thick crust, but in the course of time truth will find a place to break through. Elegance of language may not be in the power of all of us, but simplicity and straight forwardness are. Write much as you would speak, speak as you think. If with your inferior speak no coarser than usual, if with your superior speak no finer. Be what you say and within the rules of prudence. No one ever was a gainer by singularity of words or in pronunciation. Tiie truly wise man will so speak, that no one will observe how he speaks. A man may show great knowledge of chemistry by carrying about bladders of strange gasses to breathe, but he will enjoy better health and find more time for business who lives on common air. Wm. C. Bryant.
