A key to Heaven People make a great mistake about Heaven. They think it begins up yonder, but it really begins down here. If you can be happy in the basement story, you are fitted to enjoy the happiness of the upper stories. But if you whine and moan here, Heaven itself can't change your mood. N. Y. Herald.
