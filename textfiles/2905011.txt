Enfield, N. H. April, 1899. Easter day with its annual incentives to work for full resurrection from the tomb of earthly entanglements and pass into the light of God and partake of soul energies that embellish life with Christly attributes, was appropriately observed by our Church with a morning service full of short sermons and inspiring songs, and in the evening held a service of music, songs and recitations referring to the arisen Christ, and the immortal work of his followers. In reviewing some of the events of the past year our hearts waft notes of gratitude to the powers that have levelled the unrighteous forces that enslaved the Cu- TJ IE MANIFES TO. 11 ban and Philipino people; never again, we hope, to pass into the state of barbarity. The world wide resurrection movement seeks egress from the dust of material desolation into a sphere of better order and life, thus enlarging the silver lining of Christian affinity fringing the clouds of human grief and turmoil, and making it possible for the white dove of peace to fly from heart to heart, from home to home, and nation to nation with its spotless love, caroling notes of resurrection's truths, joys and works. The few days that Brother A. G. Hollister sojourned with us last month, and his visit was one of profit and pleasure. What tine testimonials in favor of mortal resurrection from error and evil are souls like our brother, who devotes his all to resurrecting laws, that raise the whole organism above earth's corruptions and pleasures. We also entertained our friend Kev. T. l^osco, of Rochester, Vt., who has lately accepted a call to preside over the Universalist church of Enfield. The bond of union made will be conducive to reciprocal associations that work for greater righteousness. George H. Baxter.
