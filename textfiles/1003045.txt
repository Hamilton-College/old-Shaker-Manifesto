Watervliet, Ohio. Elder S. W. Ball we learn has been transferred to the Society at Whitewater, O. Wherever he goes, he has our unbounded respect. He is that man of whom that lovely saint, Joving sister, and loved-by-everybody-Eldress, Elizabeth Fanonce said: ' With all his faults, lie's as good as God ! '
