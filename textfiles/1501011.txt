INTERCESSION Kind Guardian Spirits guide my pen AVhile I a line do write, I'll say within my heart amen To what they do indite. 0 ! could I soar to regions bright And view that peaceful shore, Where angels dwell in sweet delight And live forevermore. 1 feel I soon shall pass away From mundane scenes belowr, Do me receive, where love's sweet ray Will guide me as I go. But patiently I'll wait the time WThen my kind Parents call, And say, ' not my own will but thine' To them resign my all. â€” Arabella Shepard. Aged 85 years. North Union, Ohio
