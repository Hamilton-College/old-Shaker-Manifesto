Social Life Letters. COOK'S MANUAL My DEAR S.: Since I esteem you as a good cook, and an excellent counselor in this department. per, mit me to call your attention to a subject which occupied my thoughts while at breakfast this morning. It is not a startling om however, though it has a surprisingly long title; and was suggested on seeing a dish 01 nicely prepared mashed potatoes close at hand viz: The advantages derived frcrn ' Labor-Saving Machinery,' as applied to modern cookery. Do you marvel that my thought: took this directlcn P \~ell, I sat speculating upon the healthfulness of this vegetable as food; of its early historic reputation as a poison, c., c, when I seemed to hear audible tones proceeding from some sort of a 'labor-saving machine,' (constructed on the pestle and mortar principle), and anon me-thought I saw the pestle materi,alize, and strike a most imposing attitude, giving me to understand by sign, that I must partake of a vegetable which had been so nicely prepared, 'Observe,' said the mechanical voice, 'to what a refining process it has been subjected, since removed from its native soil, through our efforts.' ' Again, how long and faithfully we have served your people, in helping them to facilitate the ready dispatch of cooked vegetables! Are we not entitled to your fullest confidence, and a place on the list of 'labor-saving machines' in the record of arts?' Almost confounded by this singular manlfestation.T meekly replied: Indeed; now I think of it, the amount of dental labor \\'hich you have saved us, as wel l as a nation of patrons, for many years is quite astonishing! The tons of vegetables, which have yielded to your powerful impression, are almost beyond computation! Do not these facts prove to YOlT. that your reputation is established, as well a s popular? Yeu should be estimated truly, as a successful rival of the machines used in the extensive fouring mills ef the great West. To« pulverize vegetabes, they reduce the hard gra:ns of wheat : to an almost impalpable POWd_I', which is subsequently fashioned into [aky, snowy loaves, to tempt the Franklin: cf our day to purchase. 'L~tbor-saving 111a. hinery' in deed, which saves one from chewing the hard substance of boiled potatoes! which renders teeth no longer a necessity, save in speech! It follows, then, that food reduced to the consistency of a sern i-so lid, invites the epi-cure to swallow some, digest less, and ch e w none at all. Hence the process of eating, which once occupied thirty minutes, can no w be performed in one fifth of that time, Mighty progress in science and art! A hundred years of experience and scientific experiment in the culinary department, culrni nating in such results! The word 1llast/ca!/OJ1, which occurs so frequently in subjects tre.rting upon Hygiene, and which was n lW,l)'S ineuphonic, n1:1,v soon become obsolete, if lexicographers do not object. (Exit ma- i c'r i ne.) Have patience, my dear S., for thought expands by exercise, and I am disposed to see another side to this subject, for the question arises: Why did the AIl- Wise design such a convenient apparatus for our usc, if it was not intended to serve some grand purpose in the economy of nature? Ph'ysi()logists and dentists nll claim that the teeth were made to use, and are an essential part of the digestive npparatus ; and, is it not a fixed law of our physical being, that every faculty must be exercised in order to maintain health? In my opinion more teeth decay for want of labor than trorn any  ther cause, save want of cleanliness. That here are triumphs in art as applied to machinery, I am not inclined to dispute; but some machines denominated labor-saving, are, in the strictest sense, labor-making; this fact allow me to prove. First, then, food prepared in a manner to I dispense with chewing. is not onl)! unhealthy, but leads to the pe rn icious habit of eating too rapidly. I have frequently observed that children accustomed to soft food, show a disposh ion to reduce all hard substances given them to cat, to the same semi-solid consis-l te ncv. Give such a piece of bread crust to eat. I and plump it goes into the cup of milk near, or it is baptized with water till mellow enough to swallow without mastication; and what are some of the unfortunate results of such a course P Dyspepsin , with its legion of ills; teeth, prematurely decayed for want of use; while around' the last sorry fact. cllH:t',rl: ' series of facts too .doleful to forget when once experienced in the form of grumbling, aching teeth. And now comes in the extra effort, in acquiring the money used for repairs, the labor expended, the time spent in repairing carious teeth, all these I present to prove that our so-called' labor- saving machinery,' is labor-making in more ways than one. ' Gold and si lver have I none,' enid one, years ago. 'Of gold and silver I have some,' might a nation of young folks exclaim, (though not born with a silver spoon in the mouth,) since many carry mere geld in the teeth than in the purse, at least the value of this metal concealed in the savings bank of a carious tooth, might purchase man)' a desirable object for the wealthy passesser. Taking a retrospect of these facts, then, shall we not conclude that the direct source of much -do mestic or physical infelicity ex-ists in our modern process of cookery? I am aware that this co ncl us io n brings but poor con-elation to the fa.thful time-serving ceo!', who caters to our perverted tastes, prov ided she seeks reward in culinary achievement-: but •. Truth is mighty and must prevail.' even in the kitchen. 1';O\V S., if after reading this medley of t viis, you can devise a remedy, please manifest it in writin g, and by so doing coris ider yourself the contributor of a benefit to the Cook's Manual, Please answer through ItS columns as ccc n :1S convenient.
