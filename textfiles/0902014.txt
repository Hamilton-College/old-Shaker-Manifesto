THE SUM TOTAL While theology is good as a guideboard, the end to be accomplished is to live the very best, possible life. 'Tis not to live under illy-considered denials to self, nor to make ourselves unhappy with the idea that our unhappiness is in the least pleasing to God, or • to mediators between us and God. Self-denials and crosses are ever accompanied by tribulations, and out of these tribulations, if the denials and crosses are well-considered, as means to better ends, the denials and crosses will cease to be such —will be worn out as such denominations—and a re-generation ensue which will shed a halo of happiness from a course of life which once was obnoxious, and thought to be unbearable. If there is any system of life, whose sum total will foot up for our benefit a greater amount of a happiness which gold and silver cannot buy—which the world cannot give nor take away—than Christianity gives us right here, we want to know of it. We do not now know of it. Skeptics decry Christianity because of its supposed selfish, carnal, fleshly and its many worldly attachments, but any system called Christianity having such features, hanging like barnacles to it, is unworthy of the name, and the end thereof is disappointment. There are many professions called Christianity; there are many noble men and women who are as yet unable to deny themselves of all that Jesus, the Christ, denied himself, but whoso would be an uncompromising, radical Christian, and reap and en joy the sum total which Jesus right- fully earned, will accept the ' follow me' as meaning all that it meant in him, and his followers cannot engage in the good nor bad of worldly principles which Jesus discarded, and at the same time expect to share in the glories, which shine out as sums total in his career, and to which we all pay such fulsome praise in admiration, song and speech, but which too many think cost too much to earn—too much of self-denials. 'When Jesus comes,' he will ask of us, not what we have believed, but ' how nearly have you followed the example I have set you in purity, peace and unselfishness ?' How useless then to talk of creeds; how more than useless then to say : ' I thought,' ' I was told,' ' I had faith to believe,' ' I hoped, etc.' ' Where is your unselfish manhood or womanhood?' 'Where, your selfdenials to live better than the world, and like unto me ? ' ' My virgin purity, meant consecration of self to higher purposes, where is yours ?' 'My life taught peace and unretalia- 38 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. tion, does yours v ' 'I might have been owner of wife, children, houses, lands, and been King in the world ; these I denied as an example for all who would be my disciples—Christians —nobler men and women than the surrounding world.' ' Why have ye called me Lord, Lord, yet followed not me, nor done the things I commanded you ? ' ' Go, learn now, that as you sow, so shall you reap; and as you choose to live like Christ, or rather as a worldling, so will be your sum total in the eternal world.' Such will be some of the utterances of Christ to the world, ' When Jesus Comes.'
