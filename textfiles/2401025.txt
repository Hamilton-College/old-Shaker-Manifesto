Watervliet, O. Dec. 1893. Beloved Elder Henry :â€”We are having very slippery weather, at present. Thermometer stands 18 above zero. I have just reached home, having been at Union Village on a visit. I had the pleasure of meeting our beloved Elder Joseph Holden, from Mt. Lebanon. The time spent with him was very pleasant. I also attended religious serv- ice with the Brethren and Sisters and found many well tried souls who were zealous in the cause of gospel truth. I enjoyed the season very much. I was also interested in those who had just entered the gospel work. It is good to know THE MANIFESTO. 23 that they are bearing a daily cross, and making their lives pure before God. They manifested a desire to support the gospel and were not anxious to introduce the ways of the world. We want the treasures of the Kingdom of God and let the world take care of itself and its ways. Henry W. Fredrick
