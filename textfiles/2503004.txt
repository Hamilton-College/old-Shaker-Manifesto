Dear Friend, Elder Henry... [The following is a little pleasantry, taken from a letter that was not written for publication, so we withhold the name. Ed.] Dear Friend, Elder Henry ;I think you and we will have to blow the blast a ''leetle' louder before the dead will awaken. How about going to Florida, to the miasmatic swamps where the bull-frogs croak, and the crocodiles play hide and seek? Where the flies and fleas abound, and the humming-birds bask in the tropical sun, where all can sing praises and where the banana, fig, pine-apple and oranges all grow, even in the night while we are asleep. All this without labor. It is a fine place. There we can have plenty of hoe-cake and bacon, all for the asking, as it flows as freely as the milk and honey did to the children of Israel when they entered the promised land. O what a glorious country;let us flee ! Where? to the land of promise, where we can sing praises without working, as all we will need will grow spontaneously. Let us give all that we have to the poor that are around us, and flee from the wrath to come that we enjoy the blessings of the solid south where some things rule and other things abound. O it is a beautiful prospect and we are interested in all good things. Yours kindly, A.
