In Memory of our Brother GEORGE M. WICKERSHAM. Amelia J. Calver. 'For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.'1'2 Cor. v., 1. The Master-builder from the heavens, came To view the handiwork of one to which In early life, he gave a contract, thus : 'I give thee here a building site; thou must Erect theieon, an edifice, which will Defy the storm of time, and nobly stand A monument of skill without, and all Within, shall prove that love and faithful trust In my employ, have made a home complete, Where virtues rare shall find abiding rest. I only give thee tools; materials Shall come to thee, as recompense for each Day's faithful toil. If wise thou art, no lack ()f brick nor clay, nor wood, nor wire shalt thou E'er know; and as thou bulkiest here in time, A counterpart is reared eternal in The heavens, which thou shalt find when here Thy toils are o'er. So faithful be and I Will oft return to view thy work, unseen By thee. But when 'tis finished then I'll come And place my seal divine upon thy work, Ami it shall live for aye.' Thus read the contract which the Master held. And satisfaction beamed in every glance As o'er and o'er he paced the spacious halls, And with his 'Well Done' seal stamped every room; And beckoning to the weary toiler, hand In hand they passed from sight. And we are left. But O how sad our loss; yet may we hope That his example, an impetus strong May be, to others blest writh talents rare, To use them only for the Master's work. Dear Brother thou shalt ever live, within Our hearts and home. Where'er our eyes may rest, Thy consecrated toil shall meet our gaze. And still we hope and trust that thou wilt oft Keturn, to aid, to bless and comfort those Who've loved thee here in time. Farewell, Farewell. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
