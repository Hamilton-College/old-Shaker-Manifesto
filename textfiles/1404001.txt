FORGIVENESS. ANNA ERVIN. How beautifully falls from human lips that blessed word Forgive ; it is the attribute of God. The sound which openeth heaven, and renews again on earth lost Eden's faded bloom. It also flings Hope's halcyon halo o'er the waste of life. Thrice happy those Avhose heart has been schooled in the meek lessons of humility, and sweet Forgiveness imparts celestial grandeur to the human soul, aud maketh man an angel. Enfield, Conn.
