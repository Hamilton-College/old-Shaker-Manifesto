Narcoossa, Florida April 8, 1896. On April 4th, Elder Louis Basting came to see us, lie will return to us Thursday and stay over the Sabbath. We have just sent to market 10 bbls. of nice potatoes. Today it looks and feels like Indian summer. The garden is suffering for want of rain, of which we have had but two light showers for a month. The days are often hot but the nights are cool. There are beautiful flowers in front and the rear of our house, which Sister Minerva has planted and tended, with great care. Brother Egbert has assisted in watering the same and so we all do what we can. Our pasture is at its best and cattle are recuperating from the effects of dry forage and cold weather. Brother Charles has commenced a six acre clearing next to our station gate on the north, in dry pine woods. We expect to cattle pen it and raise corn and sweet potatoes. Elder Andrew takes care of the crops at home while Br. Egbert and writer are clearing the oak hammock at the center. 86 THE MANIFESTO. 87 We have good meetings here, and en- mons,'Well done, good and faithful joy it much when we receive such good servant, enter thou into the joy of thy letters, for which we are greatly indebted Lord.' to you all, our gospel friends. Henry Hoilisier.
