East Canterbury, N. H. Nov. 1899. Beloved Editok:â€”The last Notes about Home are certainly due you for your kind and prompt service to the public for so many years. While the last echoes of our written notes will soon die away on the wintry breezes that King Winter has already briskly set in motion, the music of grateful acknowledgment in the hearts of the many readers who have profited by the faithful circulation of our beloved 'Maxifksto' Avill not soon be hushed. One writer happily asserts, 'We live in deeds, not years,' and in this sense the magazine has lived long and well. We thank you as the motive power of its success. To the staff of printers we bid an affectionate farewell. If they have been unfortunate enough to make j&gt;t'.s behind the scenes, we have no proof of the fact, and while we know they must have needed many a stick in their work the public have been spared the sight. It is pleasant to cast a loving glance ininto every home at this season and believe 189 190 THE MANIFESTO. that all are working toward the upbuilding of our holy cause. We shall not greet each other again, perhaps, through this medium, but we can never forget that we are children of one rich inheritance, and as such, are pledged to a loving consecration to which there are no boundary lines and upon which the sun can never set. Farewell, dear faithful 'Manifesto;' and to our beloved gospel kindred, we say, God speed thee and us to higher trustworthiness, broader conceptions of our Christian work and to a deeper abiding love to the Zion of our God which can never be destroyed.
