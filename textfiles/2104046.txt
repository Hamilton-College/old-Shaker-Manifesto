Mr. Blinn, Sir:--For some unknown reason, the March number... Waupaca, Mar. 18, 1891. Mr. Blinn, Sik:ï¿½For some unknown reason, the March number of the good Manifesto has failed to reach me. Perhaps it has been lost on the way, or it might have been overlooked at the Publisher's Office. I do not wish to lose even one of the pamphlets, for I find much salutary instruction in each one, that has a tendency to lift the soul higher in the realm of thought and consequently in progression.
