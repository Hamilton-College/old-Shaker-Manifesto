A Square Talk to Young Men about the Inspiration of the Bible A Square Talk to Young Men about the Inspiration of the Bible. A book bearing a title so singular as the above must attract the attention of an interested reader. A Square talk about the Bible would signify thtit it is a straight forward and fair illustration of the subject. The work contains about one hundred pages, and has been written so simply that even the common people can read it with pleasure; and to show the interest that has been taken in the little book the Publisher says that more than two millions of copies have gone abroad into the world. We will now let the 'Square Talk' speak for itself and you will see how nicely it does it. 'Suppose for example, all the good people of this town should try the Bible, say for a single year. Suppose you start to-night, and say, 'We have heard about that book, and now we will begin and practice its teachings just one year.' 'What would be the result? There would be no lying, no stealing, no selling rum, no getting drunk, no Jtattling, no mischief making, no gossipping, no vice, no debauchery. Every man would be a good man, and every woman a good woman.' After having been so extensively circulated through the world, the good work of this little Book must be far beyond calculation. Read it and see for yourself. Published by H. L. Hastings, Boston, Mass.
