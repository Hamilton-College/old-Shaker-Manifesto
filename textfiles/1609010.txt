MERITS OF LABOR. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. The great Teacher says, 'If any one believe in me, the works that I do, shall he do also. My Father worketh hitherto and I work. I must work the works of Him that sent me while it is day, for the night cometh wherein no man can work.' He has promised to reward every man according as his works shall be. Act maketh joy or woe. A man is, what he does, and what we do is ours. And nothing but our own works, or their equivalent, is absolutely and permanently ours. Hence another teacher says ' If any will not work, neither shall he eat.' Happiness comes not as a gratuity to any, but is gained by labor, and merited by toil. Emerson says truly, 'Every man is a consumer, and ought also to be a producer. A man is not a whole man who knows not how to earn a blameless livelihood. A man fails to make his place good in the world unless he not only pays his debts, but also adds something to the common wealth.' Therefore, 'Work and thou shalt bless the day, ere thy toil be done. ' ' Tis toil that over nature Gives man his proud control, And purifies and hallows The temple of the soul; It startles foul diseases With all their ghastly train, Puts iron in the muscle And crystal in the brain, The noblest types of manhood, Are those who work to live. '� //. Clay Preuss. Steady, persevering physical laber under the inspiration of a high purpose, toughens nerve and muscle, puts feebleness and fidgets to flight, and renders the body less pervious to the attacks of disease. Of course it should not be too exhausting, but there is nothing like work, temperately pursued, to drive away the blues, dissipate mists and melancholy, cleanse the humors of the body and clarify the mental horizon. Among the most prolific causes of human misery, hard times, oppressions and poverty, are licentiousness, tobacco, opium, intoxicating drinks, novel reading, and immense swarms of drones who contrive to sponge a living out of society by their wits, or apathy, without rendering an equivalent in useful service. The law appointed to man acquainted with evil, is, 'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread, until thou return unto the ground.' Experience proves that attempts to evade this law, are followed by penalties. Idle persons in their desires for ease and pleasure, not only expose themselves to temptation but invite it, and fall an easy prey to its inroads. Hence it has passed into a proverb that idleness is the parent of vice and misery, and it has become an article of popular belief with some, that 'an idle brain is the devil's work-shop. ' In this way, one vice becomes the progenitor of many, until ignorance, crime, and wretchedness, mar all the pleasant land. 'Put your hands to work and give your heart to God,' is a divine precept. ' Godliness doth not lead to idleness. The devil tempts others, but an idle person tempts the devil. ' 'To work, to work, is man's divine vocation, All work is worship, holy all employ, And God reultimates His vast creation [joy-' Through human minds who share his perfect '' The weight of the universe is pressed down on the shoulders of each moral agent to hold him to his task. The only path of escape known in all the works of God, is by performance. You must do your work before you shall be released. No matter how much faculty of idle seeing a man has, the step from knowing ^� doing, is a step out of the chalk circle of imbecility, into fruitfulness. Work is victory. Wherever work is done, victory is obtaiucd. There is no chance and no blanks. A man or woman accustomed to work, is equal to any achievement resolved on. It is the privilege of every human work that is well done, to invest the doer with a certain dignity and self-poise, which enables him to deal on even terms with men of any condition. Every one's task is their life preserver. The conviction that his work is dear to God, and cannot be spared, defends and sustains him.' �Emerson. The greatest and most perfect of all good things, are usually the result of laborious exercise, and energetic, vigorous toil. It is absurd for a man in persuit of excellence, to flee from labor by which excellence is acquired. Good associates only with the directing will and permanent purpose. Mt. Lebanon, 2V. Y.
