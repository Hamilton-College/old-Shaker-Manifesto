VEGETARIANISM. Daniel Fraser. Your favor came duly to hand. Calm deliberate inquiry, and an acceptance of truth when presented, however strong our educational and conventional prejudices, may be, betokens the true man. There are conditions of mind favorable to the reception of truth ; and of spirit, to the reception of good impressions�the elemental seeds of happiness.The person who is never in a condition to receive good impressions, will never be happy. As that which is natural is first, suppose we have a little talk about vegetarianism, you being favorable to that way of living. Our experience in that line extends over a period of nearly thirty years. It has given entire satisfaction. No deficiency of, or want of strength in muscle or bone has been felt. It is a blessed way of living, clean, sweet and economical. Again, a little more of that which is natm*al. We take the same view of the procreative subject that Jesus did, (see Matt, xix.) Not dogmatically, nor even by the authority of the scriptures. The germ of the Divine Life being quickened in the founders of this people, the works of the flesh dropped off as a consequence� they rose in the resurrection, and lived out on earth, in their natural bodies, the same principles, that are lived out by the angels who are in a heavenly state. A community of all good things was, and is the happy result. A community with us is not a manufactured article ; it springs up of itself, and is the result of the internal Forces of the Divine Life. We never present celibacy as a dogma ; with us, the word is, whomsoever is able to receive the Divine Life, let him receive it. And who so wills to live the Adamic life, let him. And all who act rightly therein, the blessing of God will rest on them, and on their children. But we cannot see, how any person can hold on to the old man Adam, of the earth, earthy, and to Christ the Lord from heaven�a quickening spirit, at the same time�ye cannot serve two masters. An eminent German wrote as follows : ' Why wait for the Millennium to overtake us ? Why not cultivate now the principles which create the Millennium ?' Why should we wait any longer in the world,�the kingdom of the Beast�-of brute foi*ce�the kingdom of the propensities? When we can enjoy a higher, and a happier life, and be now, as the angels are. What good will it do to us, to wait till after our bodies are in their graves ? The same work will have to be done then, that we are doing now ! In his day Jesus thought it no robbery to be equal to the manifestations of God to him. And we think it no presumption to follow his example, and all who will, may do the same. You allude to the fact, that the converts from Paganism married. I have inclosed a small tract bearing on that point. They belonged to the outer court, and were not to be measured as Christians. And much less the so-called Christians of our day. The questions at issue with me, are not, Can I have a wife and be carnal, like the so-called Christians of to-day, and like those of old Corinth. Can I be a slave-holder like Philemon, and like the late slave-holders of the South, and still be called a Christian ? Naj, the questions at issue with me are, Did Christ come to lay a foundation for, and to institute a new order of human society, or did he not? Did he only come to patch up Adam's old clothes, and so make the rents worse, or did he come to create all things anew ? If the latter, then every act of man or woman not logical, with that foundation, is not of Christ. He said ' my kingdom is not of this world,' if it was, then would his servants fight. The children of this world marry and are given in marriage, and they do fight. The so-called Christian and the Pagan, no difference, only the former the worse of the two. Again, Christ declared, 'that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of Heaven ' Now, what is heaven, and where is it? Is it a state or a place? according to our ideas of locality. The Savior promptly settles these questions. Heaven is ;n you, and it is peace and joy in the Holy Spirit�a state of mind ; and not gratification to any propensity. F.urther, what is flesh and blood, and what are they of? They are of the propensities�the Forces which create flesh and blood. And if flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven, how can the Forces of the flesh inherit that kingdom. The spirit that moves in the propensities, is the spirit of a beast. The world lives, moves, and has its being in the propensities. Whence are wars? They are of the propensities, which war in our members ; they belong to that division of our nature�the animal part, which cannot appreciate Grod, nor inherit his kingdom. Intrinsically, are not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Under the Mosaic dispensation the propensities were required to be subject to the following laws. The Dietetic, the Moral, the Financial, the Agricultural, the Sanitary, the Agrarian, the Sabbatical, and the Procreative. These laws, were the shadow of a coming day. The Dietetic, taught discrimination in eating, that every thing should not be gobbled down by man ; and that there is a certain order of diet suitable to him. And pointed to a day, when animal food would form no part of human sustenance, as was once the case. The Moral, on the action of the propensities on the neighbor. The Financial.�take no usury, prevented the creation of a moneyed aristocracy. The Agricultural, restrained from cultivating the land recklessly. The Sanitary, to be cleanly in their persons, and places. The Agrarian, restraint on the propensity of getting all the land next to one's farm. The Sabbatical, withdraw from business one day in seven. And every seventh year, rested the land, and turned the whole country into a common. The poor had access to the plantations of the rich, and all debts were canceled. And every fiftieth year, lost social equilibriums were restored�every man who had lost, went back to his inheritance. The Procreative, imposed restraint on the lusts of the flesh. People now a days have little idea of the extent of the restriction. Probably, such a subjection of the propensities, had no previous parallel. It was a schoolmaster to bring souls to Christ! It was a shadow, it cut off a little. The mission of Jesus was to do the whole work! Now, the axe is laid at the root of the animal in man�the accuser of the brethren�the propensity life, was to be cast out, root and branch. So that the man, the Divine man, enshrined in every human being, may be brought forth�resurrected. Hence, Jesus said 'I am the Resurrection.' It is a commonly received error, that when persons professing Christianity behave with conventional decorum, as regards the propensities, that they are Christians, and may marry. Jesus said, 'Such are the children of this world.' But those who are in the resurrection, live in the Divine, of their being, do not. To this life, exclusive of the propensity life, we draw the attention of those who have eyes to see. And, be assured, that even as the natural man, under some degree of restraint, has brought forth a system of natural law, and a kind of order and civilization ; so also will the Divine man bring forth law, order, and a civilization corresponding to the Divine of his being. ' Eye hath not seen' etc.�a civilization of love, not of force and fraud. It is very true, what you say about the advantages communities might afford. But the almost universal failure of communities, made up of a number of families, afford ground for suspicion (seeing some of the truest men of our day have given their best energies to establish them) that the Adamic man and woman cannot sustain such an order of human society�that they occupy, inherently, a position antagonistic to that of having goods in common. And that the organic laws of that order cannot be set aside by the willing subjects of said laws. To alter the form of human society, from the individual family relationship, to a community, embracing a number of families, and yet leave intact the organic laws which gave existence to the family relationships, seems to be illogical, and absurd, and the practical results favor this view. Jesus understood that matter, in its positive, and negative bearings. ' He who will lose his life'�the selfish life, represented by the propensities�dies to them, 'will find it'�the Divine Life, to life eternal. And he who will seek to save his life� the former one, will lose eternal life! I will now say a few words on particular points in your well considered letter. Your idea of the resurrection includes the body, as you and I were early taught. Christ's idea of it wa9 different from that, and so is ours. Martha said ' I know he will rise again at the last day.'' Jesus did not prgue the matter, but simply said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life,' and left her to ponder the matter. Christ being the Resurrection, though in the body, could not marry; and those who are in his spirit, neither can they marry. And when two or three are gathered together in Christ's Spirit, they will constitute the Resurrection Order, whether they be on earth or in the Spirit land. The more that this matter is looked into, the clearer it will be seen that the Adamic Order, and the Divine, are organically distinct. You state ' that the religion of Christ was not intended to cause mankind to ignore, abrogate, or extinguish any of the natural faculties, or powers of the body. Here I will remark that Jesus did speak of a daily cross, of losing a certain,, life. 'If any member offends, pluck it out, cut it off.' 'Better to enter into life maimed,' etc. Again, of those who are pure and good and use all their faculties to the highest reason, purity and temperance; we would say, that they are perfect in their Order,�as Noah was. But they are no more Christians than he was. Further, if there be any such, we would like to know where they are. Supposing such do exist, (seeing men are progressive,) what would such people progress from, and what would they progress to ? To me, it seems clear, that their course would be upward, toward the Divine of their being, where Christ is. However pure men may be, it will do no harm to glance for a moment at the Law, and observe how the Spirit that dictated that Law, viewed the works of generation. Lev. xii. There you will find, that the most orderly, and legitimate works of the flesh, are declared unclean, and treated as sinful ; a word to the wise is enough. You remark, '-that Paul hedged marriage round with Christian rules' a proof that said institution was recognized. To me it is proof, that said Church was carnal, and not an integral part of the body of Christ, it was under restraint, and open to the objection �'forbidding to marry.' Again, the marriage at Cana. It is a rule in logic, imitations of the Pentecostal Church. Paul wrote to Timothy, at Ephesus, as follows: 'But the younger widows refuse, for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry ; having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.' The form of these associations, (sayiug nothing of the power,) exists, eveu at this day, in the monkish institutions. In speaking of propagating the race from a sense of duty. All who are so exercised, may claim a right to multithat, that which proves too much, proves ply. But we are not aware of the exisnothing, on the same principle, publicans aud sinners might plead justification. Marriage, in the Gentile Church, was a great advance on Polygamy,�the Mormonism of that day, .and other abominations. Finally, this Gentile Christianity, overspread the Church at Jerusalem, trod it down to the level of the outer court, which was not to be measured. And, from that time, the witnesses testified in sackcloth, during the dark ages, down to the Second appearing of Christ�of the Pentecostal Order, in the Shaker Societies. With regard to the virgin character of the Pentecostal Church, I am not aware that any reliable historian ever successfully called its purity in question. I am confident 'hat no philosopher who has got the key, to an analytical knowledge of the Forces of the Adamic man, would dispute the virgin character of said Church, for a moment. But would rather declare, that, for a body of people to exist for more than three hundred years, having goods in common, and still he under thefower of the Procreative Forces, was a moral, ajid spiritual impossibility. Indeed, in the Gentile Christian Church, there were virgin associations� tence of any nation, or family, who do propagate from a sense of duty. If such do not exist, then no nation, no family have a right to propagate. In conclusion, we earnestly desire, that the Adamic man and woman may so conduct themselves, as not to precipitate the extinction of the race, before the appointed time! I seriously believe, that it is the mind and will of God, that the Divine Order of human society on earth, shall be a protection to the race, and prevent the Procreative Order from running itself out, before the time. The two Orders will run parallel through the ages. But the Divine Order, as a general thing, will never be very numerous. With regard to the Mormons, and the Oneida people, i may say, that all communities, nations, and civilizations of the past, have gone to decay, through, and by, the action of the propensities. Aud the more intense the action, the sooner the end will be ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
