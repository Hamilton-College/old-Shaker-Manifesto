HEALTH Dear Shaker and Shakeress : Much might be said and written on the subject of health. We should consider the health of the soul as well, or even more, than the health of the body. If we transgress the laws of nature the body has to pay the penalty, and it is just that it should. If we transgress the laws of God the soul must pay the penalty. It behooves us, therefore, to watch; be careful what we eat and drink, that our bodies may be a healthy abode for a righteous soul to dwell in, as the body and soul are so closely connected now, until this body shall have ended its course; then let us think how are matters with the soul. The soul that sinneth shall die, was, and is and forever will be the irrevocable decree of the Almighty. All men have sinned and fallen short of their duty ; and the 144,000 who stood on Mt. Zion with the Lamb had all been sinners, but now are without fault, etc. O, what a happy and cheering thought that the way is now opened that sinners may return, for now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ. Then let us begin the reform now, to-day if ye will; let us have a healthy soul and body ; let us cut off all that is offensive to either ; let us cut off all unnatural stimulants, should it even be as dear to us as the right eye or arm, or even no matter how long we have been accustomed to them ; let us all be new creatures in Christ, and let the time past suffice to have lived after the course of the world; but now let us come out and be separate. I am ready, willing and anxious for a step forward, upward and onward for ever. Jacob S. Kulp, Pleasant Hill, Ky.
