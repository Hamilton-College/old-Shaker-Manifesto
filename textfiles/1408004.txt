THE TESTIMONY OF ETERNAL TRUTH. God of salvation, power and grace, Unknown to man's apostate race. Thy glory, veil'd within a cloud, Eludes the searches of the proud Thy nature and eternal law, The wisest mortals never saw; Nor can thy works be truly seen. But by the soul that's pure and clean. Now from a carnal nature tic i\. Thy everlasting name ytv trad ; And love that lull parental name, From which our living spirits came. Long ere this fleeting world began, Or dust was fashioned into man, There Power ami Wisdom we can view, Names of the Everlasting Two. The Father's high eternal throne Was never fill'd by one alone : There Wisdom holds the Mother's seat, And is the Father's helper-meet. This vast ereation was not made Without the fruitful Mother's aid; For by the works of God we know The fountain-head from which they flow. The Holy Spirit then did bear The anointed one, the second heir, A virgin soul, a holy child, A Mother pure and undefiled: In her the heirship is complete, In her the types and figures meet, And God's last building stands upon The sacred truth ot two in one. The law and prophets all unite To seal this true eternal light; Two tables did the law complete, Two cherubs on the mercy-seat, Two silver trumpets plainly show That gospel truth proceeds from two : And though the priest one goat did slay, The second bore their sins away. The order of eternal rest, Next by the temple was expressed : This building was laid off in two, The one concealed from public view : Thus in the female and the male, The flesh was still the parting vail: But when this vail is rent and gone, The building is complete in one. The prophets saw in visions clear, By whom redemption would appear, That 'two anointed ones' would stand Before the God of all the land. Two olive trees supplied the bowl, As life from Christ supplies the soul: And certain as the vision's true, The male and female are the two. Ezekiel saw a river wide, With many trees on either side: The tree of life appeared to John, And truly there were more than one ; On either side the tree was seen, While living waters flow between ï¿½ This'tree of life on either side, He calls the Spirit and the Bride. We surely know by what we feel. Their leaves will yet the nations heal: Ye lame and blind ye deaf and dumb, ' The Spirit and the Bride say, come : ' Let him that heareth swell the sound, And let it go the nations round, That all who will their sins forsake, May everlasting life partake.
