It would be quite unreasonable for us to sit in mourning... It would be quite unreasonable for us to sit in mourning and whine away the precious hours of our life, because we were not in Jerusalem with Jesus, and privileged to hear and enjoy the loving words which he gave to his disciples. And yet, some people will fret away many hours of their precious lives over some things quite as foreign from the duties of the present hour. They have the idea, 'If I had lived, if I had seen, if I had heard,' and a score or more ifs, they would have been just right and not the unwilling and unhappy resident of the earth in these last days when men are lovers of their own selves, covetous, blas[)hemous, unthankful and unholy. The apostle could have no hesitancy in saying that such a state of Society should exist in the latter days, for the days in which he lived were designated as the latter days, and the apostles had informed the church that anti-christ had already made his appearance. From the days of Cain, men had been disobedient to parents, covetous and blasphemous. These states seem to have exercised a predominant influence in the crude, selfish man, and even at this late date, there are strong indications that such a state will exist for some time to come. Better conditions can be formed, only by a better discipline over our own selfish, worldly lives. If the kingdom of heaven is like the sower who went forth to sow some seed, then for us to be in harmony with that kingdom, as children of light we must be in active service, and engaged in the same occupation. While the sowing of seed is a matter of such special importance to those who look forward for an anticipated harvest, it might be advisable to give careful attention to the kind and quality of seed we are sowing. Not all who are apparent heirs of salvation and include themselves among the children of light are so discriminating as to be positive of the seed they sow even in this vital, Christian work. The two disciples in their zeal for the teacher were led to ask that fire might come down from heaven, as it came down in the days of Elijah, and destroy those men who were healing the sick, simply because they were not engaged in the name of their little church. And yet these two disciples were children of the light, heirs of the promise of salvation. They were evidently good men and zealous in good works, but in this instance they were sowing some of their old seed of selfishness and ignorance. Jesus palliated their error as well as he could, and then gave them a consistent rule for their future guidance. It may be very much to our advantage that our race takes the precedence of all others in the creation of our God. We glory in having progressive and inventive minds. We can determine what may be and what should be. Although we have accepted a standard by which to act there is often a strong inclination to interweave something that bears a close resemblance to our own individuality. If we carry with us the good seed of the kingdom, the spirit power of God, it will be that of the pure in heart, of the meek, of the merciful and of the peace-maker. In our labors for God and his kingdom much of this may fall on stony ground or among those who are absorbed in the interests of this world, and fail to return anything that may prove valuable in the time of harvest. But that which may chance to fall on good soil and, indeed much of it must, will bear an abundant harvest of good and precious fruit. There: can be no failure to-day of the promises of God, any more than there has been in the past if we work in his love and in his spirit. The encouraging gift of inspiration which the prophet received, is well worth our attention. There was a blessing for the man that kept his hand from doing any evil and for those who should honor the Lord, ''not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own wTords.' Although this was not particularly acceptable to the people of th it day, any more than it would be to the present generation, the prophet, in order to confirm them in the spirit value of his advice, added these emphatic words :ï¿½'Behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save ; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.' The difficulty was not on the side of God and his promises, and indeed, it never can be. If our union with that which is pure and holy is by walking uprightly before God and man, then our separation from that which is pure must be by our departure from an upright life. In this there is no mystery, for the gospel of Christ is a savor of life unto life, to all who abide in it.
