THOU ART MY HOPE. MINERVA L. REYNOLDS. This earth is not my final home I cannot tarry long; My home is in Thy Truth, 0 God, And victory is my song. Oh give me strength to stand the te*ty I ask not length of days; But wheresoe'er my feet shall rest My heart shall give Thee praise. Though thro' deep waters Thou may'st Unflinching I will go ; [call Thou art my hope, my trust, my all, No other will I know. With Thee I'll stem the rolling tide And keep my spirit calm, And safely o'er the billows ride Secure in Thee, from harm. But 0 my Father ! hear my prayer, O turn not Thou away, For Thine own heritage, prepare A bright and glorious day. Remember the afflicted ones, Lift them, from earth above, And until life's short day is done, Refresh them with Thy love. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
