East Canterbury, N. H. Weather Record for January, 1894. Highest Temp, during the month, 47 ' ' 10 ' ' 20.5 ' ' 16.5 ' 2.58 in any 24 consecutive .61 N. A. Lowest ' Mean ' ' Snowfall in inches ' Total Precipitation Greatest ' hours, Feb. 1894. An old-fashioned New England winter, with its bracing and health-giving properties is one of the many blessings which we THE MANIFESTO. 71 have thoroughly enjoyed thus far. Such prolonged absence of general illness during the winter months has hardly been realized in this vicinity since the advent of 'La Grippe.' Death, the angel Reaper has indeed visited us, but with one exception, (that of our precious Sister, Helen Taber,) his selections were persons advanced in age, and perchance ripe for his sickle as well as ready for the transition to the 'Better Land.' While holding them in loving remembrance we are under still greater obligations to perform our duty to the living. With us, the problem of how to make the best use of time is an important one. We often find ourselves subject to the fluctuations of the present social and political elements, hence realize to some extent the straitened circumstances of the world's workers. Yet honest industry brings its reward, and agreeably to the counsel of Mother Ann with 'hands to work and heart to God' we hope to earn our daily bread. Our active farmers have already started the early potatoes within doors. Work is also being carried forward at the saw-mill, it having heretofore been delayed on account of scarcity of water. The continuous snows of the season have proved a great blessing in water supplies. For all the uncounted benelits we receive we daily thank our Heavenly Father, and in his blessing will continue to work and pray. Elsie York.
