Work and Win BY DANIEL ORCUTT However difficult the obstacles may appear to the novice in the self-denying way, remember, that if you commence the work with earnestness of purpose, your efforts will be crowned with success. A wavering, doubting mind never did, and never will accomplish anything worth naming. There is nothing like a fixed, firm, steady aim in the gospel cause, that will ensure victory. The true crosshearer, by vigorous, persevering effort, wins crowns of bright glory. It has been truly said, that no excellence is gained without earnest labor. How did our blessed Saviour overcome, and win that bright crown ? And how did our ever blessed Mother gain that spotless robe which she wears ? By resolute perseverance and patient toil. Oh, how worthy of imitation ! Now, what has been done can be done again; and it is only those who work, that win. Therefore in our passage to heaven over life's rough sea, should billows arise to impede our progress, let us remember that constant, earnest labor will conquer all things. Be not discouraged at slow progress. Work on, discarding vices one by one, and ' adding to your faith, virtues.' Work patientlyâ€”Work and Win.
