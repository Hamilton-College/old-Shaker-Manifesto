Written for and Read at the Funeral of Sister AMELIA LYMAN. E. S. Copley. How sudden, and unexpectedly, the Lamp of Life has gone out. We have long known that your earth-life has hung by a slender thread; yet you were always so pleasant and so bright, that we were more than willing to put far away the day when we should see you no more. Ah! how sadly we shall miss you, for we were always welcome in your presence. You favored no select company, for we were all yours to love and assist whenever opportunity offered. During times of trial you always found special reason for more thoughtful kindness. If faults were seen virtues were not lost to sight. Do we think you have left us to return no more? Not by any means. You have loved us too long, have shared our joys and drank of our sorrows too often to withdraw your Spirit influence. Even now I can seemingly hear you say, 'I have laid aside the poor earth casket; it will return to its kindred dust. My Spirit is free. I will do all in my power to have you share of my care, my interest, and my affection.' Farewell, and this we know, you will, for in our 'Father's house are many mansions,' and among them we feel assured there is one prepared for you. Yisit us often precious Sister, till we meet with you beyond the vale, and while the earth form is taken from our sight, love pleads from the depths of our souls not to be forgotten by dear friends just gone before. Earth's love may sometimes fail us, but we believe, thank God, in a love heavenborn that knows neither frost nor blight, and trust our merciful Father will grant us a portion. Shaker Station, Conn.
