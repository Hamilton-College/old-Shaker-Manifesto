GOD'S REST. AURILLA FURBER. [Contributed by Harriet Hastings.]God give you peace! your life will have its longinj I would not ask they be less keen and deep; The soul that firmly stand, upon the mountains Must know the footing of the pathway steep: It must have trod the vallies dim and^low And tented where the streams of silence flow. For you no blank content of heart or brain I crave, but I would have you, friends, to drain The cup of all wide living, feed and grow Full rich in wealth of feeling, have you know The strength of strong desire, and bruvely face The close temptations of our struggling race. [ would not spare you strife and weariness Nor beg that powers of darkness never press Anear your feet; yet ever do I pray The rest of God be with you all the way! Cottage Grove, Minn.
