OLD AGE. By Martha J. Anderson. I would not couple age with weary care, Or closely link it unto sorrow's load Which, lowly bowed on time's long dreary road Must lonely walk in silence and despair. Ah, nay! 'tis day's decline all bright and fair, The genial rest that nature has bestowed; No heated strife life's waning powers to goad, But tranquil peace diffusing everywhere, Not like the gilded morn of childhood's gaze, Not like the glowing day of youth so bright, But softened with the kindly mellowed rays That temper the full beams of glowing light, And robe the distant hills with purpling haze Ere falls the shadowy curtain of the night. And hides the mortal traveler from sight. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
