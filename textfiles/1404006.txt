Allow me to thank you for your kind remembrance of one who, in turning the kaleidoscope of Time back to the days of childhood and early youth, recalls many pleasant and grateful memories of you and yours. I seem to see them pass in review before me as I write, my young companions, my dear Sabbath School teachers, yet, above all, my beloved Pastor, whose tender care, and loving protection was ever extended to me, the youngest of all those, who, one never-tobe-forgotten Sabbath, were baptized in the name of Christ, and partook of the symbols of his life and sufferings. Think not, because I am not with you, nor yet likely to be in earth-life, that your wise counsel and interest, your prayers, for my prosperity, have fallen unheeded by the wayside, for, life, as in Nature, so in Grace, oeing a perpetually recurring season of seed-time and harvest, even so, the seeds of righteousness sown within my heart in childhood's hour, shall yet bring forth fruit, an hundred fold, iinto everlasting Life. Inheriting strong spiritual and religious tendencies, my life, from earliest childhood, has been filled with an instinctive longing, a reaching out for the immortal and the trueA constant prayer for light, that I might receive salvation from sin in the present tense, and be made a fit temple in which the Christ Spirit might dwell forever. ' There is a Divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them as we will. ' Even so, have I abundant reason to give thanks to that God who has, indeed, led me by a way I knew not, into the 'city of peace,' even the pure, virgin life of Christ, which, faithfully lived, day by day, in meekness and simplicity, is daily renewing my soul with immortal life from the fountain of Love divine; with that baptism of the ' Holy Spirit and fire, ' which will effectually consume all the dross of the soul, and raise it into the very heavenly nature and life of Christ. You did, indeed, baptize me with water, and give the symbols of the 'blood and body ' of that absent Savior, who said, ' do this until I ccme,' but to the soul who has been harvested from the earthly, generative order, to whom the Savior has already come, in very truth, whose life is ' hid with Christ in God, ' ï¿½who has been given to eat of the 'hidden manna, ' with the promise of ' Eternal Life, ' there can be no farther need of the 'types and shadows ' of earth and time, save the remembrance of them as stepping-stones to the substance. Send, if you please, the letter, if it is in accordance with your rules, but, it is, to me, a mere matter of form, as the Shaker church demands no other recommendation from its members, save the wedding garment of purity and righteousness which is prepared for all souls who are willing to make the sacrifice which the Lord requires. Once more, accept my love and thanks for all your efforts in my behalf, which have been attended with such blest results. Louisa Bates.
