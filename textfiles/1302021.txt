PAIN. Written for the Manifesto. Oh Pain! Oh Pain! What canst thou be? A chastening agency of Fate Sent to inflict a penalty Upon our frail mortality, And bring us caution all too late? Or dost thou come Death's votary, To frighten us and aggravate; Or art thou the supposed sequence Of N ature and Necessity? The will divine of Providence To silence mortal will and sense? Or art thou horn of sympathy? Which suffers nameless woe immense, Nameless, because too sweet to be Called pain, or rather miseR Iled so. Or-as an Angpl comest thou To teach us well to brave and bear Our griefs and trials here and now, This crown of thorns upon the brow, Teach patiently this crown to wear, To all thy mandates meekly bow, And without protest take our share? Ere we subscribe to this we pause, And criticise thy origin, The ill effects of some bad cause, ' By violation of life's laws, Through iguorance or folly vain; No less a penalty, because Of ignorance, 0 Conqueror, Pain! The sour grapes our fathers ate, Still set the children's teeth on edge; And then the case to aggravate, The children also try the bait Ignore Life's laws nor deign to pledge To seck the right, thus change the fate But still perpetuate the dregs.
