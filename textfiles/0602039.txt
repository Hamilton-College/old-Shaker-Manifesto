The signal recently erected on the summit... __The signal recently erected on the summit of Mt. Shasta, Cal., by the coast survey, is a hollow cylinder of galvanized iron, twelve feet high, and two and a half in diameter, surmounted by a cone of nickelplated copper. The reflection from this cone is so strong that it is believed the signal can be used for observations at a distance of 100 miles.
