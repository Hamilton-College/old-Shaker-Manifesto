OVER THE RIVER No longer we shrink on eternity's brink, or wish for a further delay; Clean robes are prepared for the justified souls, and angels are guarding the way. Over tho river of death, only just over there! The spirit released from its burden of clay, lives when made pure, in an eternal day. 2. While nearing the stream, in vision I see a structure rise noble and grand; 'Tis not built on any false dogma nor creed, 'Tis a bridge to the fair summer land. Chorus. The shadow of doubt is forever dispelled, And kindreds are joined heart and hand ; For messengers cross on this bridge: every day, From their horne in the bright spirit land, Chorus. 4. Each day that we live, some gem we may store, The work of our own willing hand; The garment we weave in this valley below, We shall wear in the bright summer bad. Chorus.
