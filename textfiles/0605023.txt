KEEP Keep to the right as the law directs, Keep from the world thy friend's defect, Keep all thy thoughts on purest themes, Keep from thine eyes the motes and beams; Keep true thy deed, thy honor bright, Keep firm thy faith in God and right, Keep free from any sin and stain, Keep from the ways that bring the pain; Keep free thy tongue from words of ill, Keep right thy aim and good thy Will; Keep all thy acts from passion free, Keep strong in hope, no envy see; Keep watchful care o'er tongue and hand, Keep free thy feet, by justice stand; i Keep true thy word, a sacred thing, Keep from the snares the tempters bring; Keep faith with each you call a friend, Keep full in view the final end; Keep love between thy God and thee, Keep from all hate and malice free, Keep firm thy courage bold and strong, Keep up the right and down the wrong; Keep well the words of wisdom's school, Keep warm by night and by day keep cool.
