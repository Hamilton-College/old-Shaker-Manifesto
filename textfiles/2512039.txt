The Journal of Hygeio-Therapy The Journal of Hygeio-Therapy for October lias interesting articles in reference to the 'Invalids' Home,' and to the 'Last Annual Reunion.' The Journal is also beautifully illustrated in connection with these anniversary exercises, which gives us a much more pleasant introduction to the people and their place of abode. Not only are the good Physicians introduced to us but an illustration of the 'Invalids' Home' is presented and also an illustration that would make glad the heart of the animals' friend, George T. Angell. With this we also wish abundant peace and prosperity for all the dear friends who are working in the interest of humanity.
