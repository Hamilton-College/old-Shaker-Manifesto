Friend Fraser; I have had in my mind... May, 1884. Friend Frasek ;�I have had in my mind sometime the intention to write you of- the loss of our friend John Bain, whose heroic death occurred in rescuing the Stewardess of the ill fated SteamShip State of Florida, of which he was the Chief Engineer. After getting into the boat after the collision, he saAv the Stewardess Jane McFarhne, on the deck of the sinking ship ; he had the boat put back, but the timid woman refused to get into it. He leaped upon the sinkingvessel and by main force tossed her into the boat. But before he could get off, the ship gave a lurch, and carried him �down to a watery grave. So perished our noble friend. The despairing cry of a helpless woman touched his heroic heart; lost to every thought of self or danger, amidst that terrible crash, and the midnight darkness of the lonely sea, Iiis noble soul went up to his Maker, a bright example in this self-seeking world, of god-like self-sacrifice. The tender memories of such heroic men, has a strengthening influence for .good upon our lives. The last time I saw him, three months s'go he spoke of you and expressed a wish to again pay you a visit; I think we would have come up your way this Summer had he been spared. My dear friend I often think of you, and of the life work you and others are engaged in. If you could have some of the younger members of your community write your recollections, it would be a matter of great interest, and incite some to persevere and carry out any good work. I would be pleased to have a few lines from you at any time. I am happy to say my family, and myself are well. Yours very truly, Charles Law.
