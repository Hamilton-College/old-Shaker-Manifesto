Enfield, N. H. Aug. 1897. Nitmekous have been the companies to inspect our premises and carry away some home made fancy article, this season, amusing were some of the expressions of astonishment when they learned that we are unlike hermits, allowed to, laugh and converse with each other as brothers and sisters. Can we marvel at such false ideas when so little is done to flood the world with knowledge about our moral and social life? Does not the spirit of selfishness and narrowness grow larger through laxity of personal life in regard to laws that not only better self-hood, but reveal the Christ spirit and life? Separation of law abiding mortals from society, benefits not humanity. . Such know there is a nobler life and a richer soul satisfaction than that found by a selfish, narrow life. We are in the world, buknot of the world. Aug. 8th we celebrated the 123rd anniversary of the landing upon America's ' shores, the founders of our Faith. An excellent program of instructive essays, with songs and music, afforded us and the large number of invited friends, much pleasure, and we trust that they as well as ourselves will have clearer conceptions about the essential features of our order of life. Heavy and many have been the rain falls the past month, retarding the harvesting of the hay crop, which is more abundant than that of last year. Pears will be plentiful, but apples a small yield.
