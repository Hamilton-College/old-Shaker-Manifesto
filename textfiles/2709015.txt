Grass crops have been very abundant, but the month has been so very wet we have barely commenct harvesting the crop. 16 rainy days giving us 15 inches of water, averaging about half an inch a clay the entire month. One continuous rain gave us *l% in. in twenty-four hours causing the water to overflow our dams, and making the valley below a lake from two to four feet deep. It has been such a month that we desire never to see another so destructive and so wide spread. It has spread E. W. N'. S. destroying millions of property and multitudes of lives. One woman with her two children and house were taken by a tornado, carried to the center of the Hudson Hirer and sunk and they were drowned. There might be a volume written if the entire sr.d catastrophies were chronicled that have occurred during July 1897. With all the prevailing destruction, we are very much blest. At present we have plenty to eat and to drink. We are well clothed and housed from the storms. We have purchased cement and paint to preserve the roofs of the Meeting House, Office, Infirmary and Laundry, so they will not leak, if paint, cement and solder will prevent it. A half mile more of the State Eoad between us and Hancock is being constructed. This will prove an additional blessing to travelers. We have gathered from our garden thirty-three bushels of strawberries and nine bushels of raspberries and have more of the last named to gather, then will come the blackberries. The early apples are fit for use. Cherries have been abundant. Our fruit crop is good, and abundant. The hot weather is injuring potatoes. Sister Amelia Calver has become an apiarist. She has at present eight swarms. Yesterday she was taking up box honey. In doing so she became a veiled Nun. Elder Timothy Kayson is a Shaker Trustee. He takes Br. Benjamin Gates place who has resigned. Thursday July 22nd the MinistrMount Lebanon, and are now at Colonie. They left here in usual health. At present it is healthy among us. No one is in- disposed to my knowledge. Calvin G. Reed. Shakers, N. Y. August, 1897. The past month gave us a taste of tropical weather. One hundred in the shade! We were careful not to make any uncomplimentary remarks about 'Old Probabilities' for we might regret it when the blizzards of December were blowing; but we thought of the pleasure of Professor Andree's trip in an air-ship to the North pole or of Dr. Nansen's arctic explorations. But we will try and be philosophical and make the best of it whatever the variations of the temperature. Those grand and inspiring words of Gladstone in the Manifesto were like a benediction rebuking the narrow spirit of sectarianism that would contract the sphere of human thought making it less able to comprehend the universality of truth which is the true goal toward which life is advancing. We admire the character of the man and have his picture framed in oak guarding the doorway of our domicile. We think our little Manifesto is doing even better than the son of Erin's isle who said he had 'started with nothing and had held his own.' May blessings be with those who have the burden of its publication, and if interest could be quickened to the extent that would make it a semimonthly, its work in the missionary field would be strengthened. Hamilton DeGraw. Shaker Station, Conn. North Family. August, 1897. It is needless to say that we are having more cloudy than sunshiny weather, for this seems to be the general complaint. Farm work is much delayed by almost constant rain. The Sisters have been, several times, to the distant hills, some two or three miles away, for huckleberries, but success did not crown their labors as the berries are quite scarce. Two of our Sisters, Angeline Brown and Florence Staples in company with Eldress Sophia Copley of the Church family are about to return from the sea-shore after an absence of sixteen days. They have been selling Shaker bonnets, fancy goods, confectionery etc., with considerable success. Since our tarry in Enfield we have had occasion to attend one funeral,�that of Clarissa Lyman. She was an aged Sister of eighty-three years. Her acquaintances all declare her to have been a good, true mother. Elder George Clarke is busily engaged in the laundry, making everything as convenient as possible. We have alreadj a large engine and boiler combined, an improved mill, and at the end of another week our new wringer will be completed. We bless the labor of consecrated souls and great will be their reward. Edith E. Shu felt. [As the following letter was received too late for insertion in the August Manifesto, we have thought best to hold it for the Sept. number. It contains some items that may prove profitable reading for many months to come. Ed.] South Union, Ky. July 21, 1897. Beloved Bkotheb;�It has been some time since we heard anything through The Manifesto about South Union. We have past through a very heated and dry season, the thermometer ranging from 100 to 105 degrees. From the first of May to the 10th of July we had but very little rain and the land was intensely dry. Within the last ten days we have received about one inch, with a prospect of more. As it is we have great reason to be thankful. We have been bountifully blest in a good wheat crop, and the Society has thresht some 5700 bushels. This we now have on hand waiting for a satisfactory sale. The prospect for a fair corn crop is good, but the hay harvest is quite limited. Our home in the valley will afford us but few peaches, but there will be a better crop on more elevated land. Apples will also be scarce. Of blackberries we shall have an abundance and then best of all, our Society is not in debt. In the East family we have canned not less than fifty gallons of blackberries, while the other families may have done as much or even more. John W. Perryman Mount Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. August 6, 1897. our last writing more rain has fallen than in any previous month remembered by the 'oldest inhabitant.' Our houses being on sure foundations remain secure, but tons of the best garden soil and some of their produce have been swept to other regions. Hay and grain have been greatly injured, some entirely ruined; damage to fruit has been as yet, comparatively slight. Trees and shrubs are being much benefitted under skillful pruning by one of our young Believers, our lawns and gardens by the care of others, while a markt interest is manifested by all in adding to the attractiveness and comfort of our home. Many pleasant hours have been spent in the associated labor of Brethren and Sisters in gathering fruit, also when the entire family have met for pea-shelling where singing added much to our enjoyment. Twice we have assembled to have heart and mind renewed from the thought treasury of Annie M. Moody, from Maiden, Mass., a visiting friend of high culture whose soul development enables her to use intellectual attainments only, as the channel through which to draw the vital substance essential to a noble character and exalted life. The date of our writing is the 123 anniversary of the arrival in America of Mother Ann Lee and her eight brave companions, and marks an epoch in history which we believe will be much more widely and clearly appreciated in future years than at present. It seems a fitting time for all Believers who realize the value to mankind of the Gospel testimony, to recount the accomplishment of the past, consider the means of success and the causes of failure, distinguish between customs and principles, understand whether certain habits and rules had their origin in consideration of principles or of the necessities of the times, and while comparing present conditions of society with those which existed more than a century since let us adjust ourselves for present duty and future advancement. Catherine. Allen. East Canterbury, N. H. Aug. 1897 June and July have given us an abundance of rain and two unprecedented freshets for this season of the year, have visited the valleys of New England. At our own home the roads and gardens have suffered the most. To 'make hay while the sun shines' has been a difficult matter for the farmers, as the showers were of daily occurrence. As a climax to this 'down pour,' we must note the 23rd of July. The heavens became darkened by the accumulation of clouds in the north, and at the same time in the southwest. One could hardly have believed that the winds would, in a few hours bring these together and form the severest thunder-storm of the season. However, at 10-30 a. m. the clouds had met directly over our village. The 'windows of heaven were opened' and the thunder and lightning of that hour, we would not wish to have repeated. Our large barn, 240 ft long, received one thunderbolt on the center cupola and passing down an iron rod into the barn, it made kindling wood of several boards, and in some mysterious way hurled a fire brand into the hay. The bolt then past out of the barn at the lower edge of the cupola and markt its path by splintered boards on the roof. Two young men were in the building on Since the lower floor, and both were rendered unconscious for a few moments. A second thunderbolt immediately followed, but this was at the extreme east end of the barn. It was a mischievous flash as it tore the shingles from the side of the barn, demolisht a window sash, splintered the boards, and then spent itself by splitting some timbers. The young Brethren soon recovered consciousness and found the hay on fire and the smoke pouring out at the windows. By wonderful self-possession they were enabled by the use of water and a fire grenade which were near at hand, to subdue the flames, and fortunately to save the building from destruction. Through the ringing of bells and the cry of fire, there was for a short season an intense excitement in our home. Many of our kind neighbors, altho living one or more miles distant, hurried to the Tillage to aid in preserving the property, and this friendly care was much appreciated. Henry C. Minn. Narcoossee, Fla. Aug. 1897. Happy are they who can see the nobility of living like Christ, tho their lot is pitched in among the pines and palmettos of Middle Florida. They receive the hundred-fold reward for the sacrifice of a life of transcient pleasure and animal sensation. It is well worth the labor to be so consecrated that place noi condition will take away the enjoyment of a contented mind. Nothing in this life, will spoil the peace of that soul who takes his life in his hand and marches out to duty with every coming day. It is now about three years since we struck the first ax and bog hoe into the pines and palmettos of our new home, and to-day we are receiving the reward of our labors with much satisfaction. A good comfortable house has been built and painted and ten acres of land have been cleared. A pinery built and planted and now we are harvesting the crop which will be about seven hundred good, saleable apples. Four hundred peach trees have been set out, from which we expect a small crop, another year, Rice, orange, semen, persimmon, with smaller varieties of trees and pines fill the gap. The garden in which the writer has toiled with unbounded patience, begins to show the bright side. With the addition of our wind mill, tank and water pipes, we feel we are well fortified against the coming drouths which invade Florida during the months of February, March and April. The past month has given us plenty of rain to put in winter crop of sweet potatoes, also to re-set the shoots of pine-apples, from which we expect a crop the coming year. We have had two valuable additions to our numbers, Brother Egbert Gillette, a noble young man from Alabama, all ripe for the sickle of truth, and our well tried, veteran Sister, Elizabeth Seers, from the Center Mount Lebanont. Lebanon. She is a mother in Israel, and fills a niche in our little home that but few can fill. Why need we fear the future as 'Heaven helps those who help themselves.1' There is virtue in suffering patiently and cheerfully. When the trial comes look up, take in a long breath and go forward. Dear friends, when you send us a thought it meets a response in us in being loyal to our faith. Let us not judge a character hastily, for in the web of many a life, a golden thread twineth unseen, which may be woven into a crown of glory. Andrew Barrett. Enfield, N. H. Aug. 1897. Nitmekous have been the companies to inspect our premises and carry away some home made fancy article, this season, amusing were some of the expressions of astonishment when they learned that we are unlike hermits, allowed to, laugh and converse with each other as brothers and sisters. Can we marvel at such false ideas when so little is done to flood the world with knowledge about our moral and social life? Does not the spirit of selfishness and narrowness grow larger through laxity of personal life in regard to laws that not only better self-hood, but reveal the Christ spirit and life? Separation of law abiding mortals from society, benefits not humanity. . Such know there is a nobler life and a richer soul satisfaction than that found by a selfish, narrow life. We are in the world, buknot of the world. Aug. 8th we celebrated the 123rd anniversary of the landing upon America's ' shores, the founders of our Faith. An excellent program of instructive essays, with songs and music, afforded us and the large number of invited friends, much pleasure, and we trust that they as well as ourselves will have clearer conceptions about the essential features of our order of life. Heavy and many have been the rain falls the past month, retarding the harvesting of the hay crop, which is more abundant than that of last year. Pears will be plentiful, but apples a small yield. George H. Baxter.
