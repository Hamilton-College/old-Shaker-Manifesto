WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. Kate Lawrence. It might have been that the sky was green, and the grass serenely blue; It might have been that grapes on thorns and figs on thistles grew; It might have been that rainbows gleamed before the showers came; t It might have been that lambs were fierce and bears and tigers tame; It might have been that cold would melt and summer heat would freeze ; It might have been that ships at sea would sail against the breeze; And there may be worlds unknown, dear, where we would find the change From all that we have seen or heard, to others j ust as strange â€” But it never could be wise, dear, in haste to act or speak; It never could be noble to harm the poor and weak; It never could be kind, dear, to give a needless pain ; It never could be honest, dear, to sin for greed or gain; And there could not be a world, dear, while God is true above, Where right and wrong were governed by any law but love. in Wide Awake
