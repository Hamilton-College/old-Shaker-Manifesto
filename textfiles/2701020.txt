To the Memory of our Brother WILLIAM THRASHER By Genevieve DeGraw uAnd in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart and prospered.' â€”2 Chron., xxxi,, 21, And the doors of heaven swung open A soul past thro' to stay, Freed from the snares and cares of earth And freed from mortal clay, And that soul found a joy holy A peace which the angels know For his life was pure, good and true While he journeyed here below. And the angels came down to bless him His deeds they gladly record And now they come commissioned To pilot him back to his Lord. They sing him the glad song of welcome As he enters the mansions above. Well done Oh! thou faithful good servant Enter thou in the joy of God's love. Tis the day of thy grand coronation Go, wear the bright crown you have won, Go, dwell with the ransomed in glory Rejoice now your work here is done. Rejoice and be glad it is wisdom That dust unto dust must return, Unhampered the soul may the better The soul's needed lessons there learn, We count it not death but awakening This wonderful transfer from earth A passing from shadow to substance To treasures of immortal worth, Our life there shall be restful action With friends who have gone on before Who know of that beautiful country And dwell on its 'Evergreen Shores.' Our brother has there found a haven, A home by angel hands made, In vision we clearly behold him In garments of splendor arrayed. 'And thus this man died leaving his death for an example of a noble courage, and a memorial of virtue, not only unto young men but unto all his nation.'-2 Mac, vi, 31. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
