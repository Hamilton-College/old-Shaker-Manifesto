Canterbury, N. H. Weather Record, for Oct. 1891. Highest Temp, during the mo. 76. Lowest ' ' ' ' . 19. Mean ' ' ' ' 45.1 Total Precipitation ' ' 5. in. N. A. Bkiggs. Nov. 1891. While thousands of human beings in other countries are hurrying to escape from the flooded districts, all of the New England states are suffering, more or less, from a protracted drouth. Springs, rivulets and rivers are quite below the usual low water mark, and the well-springs that are indispen sable in the blessing of life are fast growing less. With a long winter before us, a thought of greatly increased labor is brought forward and we are, at once, reminded of our finite position in nature. If the readers of the Manifesto fail to observe that they are looking at the impression of a new and beautiful face type, we shall recommend them to visit some oculist for defective eyesight. In 1792 the Community at this place built their 'Meeting House.' The shingles which were placed on the roof at that date, have just been removed and the house now has the adornment of a new covering. Religious service has been held in the family Dwelling during the summer and but few spectators have been admitted. The family Dwelling which was built in 1792 has also been under repairs, and with its new A 1 oven for the bakers, its new chimney and eight dormer windows for the attic, it may be expected to hold its place for another one hundred years. On the 12th inst. Elder Abraham Perkins and a younger Brother,ï¿½Frank Theobald of Enfield, N. H., called to see their gospel friends at this place. They leave for home on the morning of the 16th. Elder Abraham was for a long term of years the senior Elder in the Order of Ministry, and during that time became strongly identified in the general prosperity in the Society of Canterbury. We are very glad that they loved us so well as to make us this pleasant visit. *
