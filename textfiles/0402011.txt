AN INCIDENT On Thanksgiving day, a visitor, attending our meeting, arose and spoke as follows: ' I have been a silent witness of what my eyes have seen, and my ears have heard, and I am reminded of that beautiful passage in Scripture, where Jacob (after leaving his father's house, knowing not whither he was going), saw in vision a ladder, reaching from earth to heaven, on which the angels of God ascended and descended ; and he said,' Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not; this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.' So I feel that the Lord is with you, and good angels are among you. The words of the Psalmist will apply to you. ' Give thanks unto the Lord, praise and exalt His name, for He is good; let the redeemed say so, whom He hath ransomed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered out from all lands, from the east and the west, the north and the south ; they wandered in a solitary way ; they found no city to dwell in; hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them ; and He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.' It is my sincere desire to be joined with you in spirit and be one with you, that I also may be led in the right way unto a ' city of habitation.' His desire is granted.
