Shaker Station, Conn. Dec. 1893. We have an excellent market for stove and furnace wood. Management means a great deal in poultry business. A good poultry man is as important as good fowls. To feed well is the secret of success. Pure water with plenty of egg-producing food will tell. The needs of the poultry must be studied. Ground meat and ground bone, with milk, are among the essentials in winter food for hens. A sameness of diet should be avoided. Hens will give a good account of their work on a varied diet.
