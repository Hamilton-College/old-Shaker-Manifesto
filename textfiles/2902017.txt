Sanitary. A physician who is connected with an institution... A. physician who is connected with an institution in which there are many children, says: 'There is nothing more irritable to a cough than coughing. For some tiine I had been so fully assured of this that I determined for one minute at least to lessen the number of coughs heard in a, certain ward in a hospital of the institution. By the promise of rewards and punishments I succeeded in inducing them simply to hold their breath when tempted to cough, and in a little while I was mys-elf surprised to see how some of the cliildren entirely recovered from the disease. Constant coughing is precis lv like scratching a wound on the oi.tside of the body; s long as it is done the wound will not heal. Let a person whin templed to cough draw a long breath and hold it until it warms and soothes every air cell, and some benefit will soon be received from this process. The nitrogen which is thus refined acts as an anodyne to the mucous membrane, allaying the desire to cough and giving the throat and lungs a chance to heal. At the same time a suitable medicine will aid nature in her effort to recuperate.' San Francisco Examiner.
