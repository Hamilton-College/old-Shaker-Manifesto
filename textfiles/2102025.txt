White Water, O. Jan. 11, 1891. Dear Editor :ï¿½Here I come again with a small item. Not much to say, only that we have purchased a new laundry engine at our family, the old one being played out. We have been drawing wood for fuel. It requires about 50 cords of wood for our family one year. We put a new floor in our horse barn and it is improved by it. We had a very good Christinas. Santa Claus was very good to us here. Snow all day Christmas, on an average about one foot. Elder Lafayette Parker from the North, and Pernall Berry from the Center families went to Union Village on the 9th of December to purchase two holstein cattle. We are having about 500 rails made and about 60 cords of wood put up for the coming year. Brothers Charles Sturr and Augvist Frederick are helping us arrange our new engine. H. W. Frederick.
