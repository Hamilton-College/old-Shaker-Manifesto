LIVING WATERS JANE CORNELL Give us, dear Lord, that living water Which thou didst offer to Samaria's daughter Thirsting we cry ; All other streams to quench this thirst we've sought; Not one of them did e'er avail us aught To satisfy. Vain pleasure, too, hath filled her chalice up And to our lips the world hath held the cup, And we did drink. Until an angel touched our eyes with light, And in the draught we saw sin's deadly blight, And back did shrink. And those who deepest drank the tempting draught, Who to the dregs, almost, the cup have quaffed, Now thirst the more. And to thy fount now press with eager hope ; Lord, on these thirsty *ouls the flood-gates ope — The waters pour. We know Salvation's streams are free to all; For we have heard thy loving, gracious call, Bidding us come ; But, Lord, our wanderings have made us weak; Thy wells are deep ; and we thine aid must seek ; Help us to draw. Do thou in love our empty vessels fill, That we may drink and feel the inward thrill New life doth bring. For in the soul these waters pure shall swell Into a clear, deep, everlasting well — A living spring. Shakers, N. Y.
