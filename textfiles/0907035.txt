The Noise of the Fingers In the carrent number of the Medical Record, Dr. Hammond says that when you poke the end of your finger in your ear the roaring noise you hear is the sound of the circulation of your finger, which is a fact as any one can demonstrate for himself by first putting his fingers in his ears, and then stopping them up with other substance. Try it, and think what a wonder of a thing your body is that even the points of our fingers are such busy workshops that they roar like a small Niagara. The roaring is probably more than the circulation of the blood. It is the noise of all the vital processes togetherâ€”the tearing down and building up processes that are always going forvvard in every living1 body from conception to death.
