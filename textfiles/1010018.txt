FOOD AND RELIGION Our reverend friend J. F. Clymer continues in the good work of stirring up sensible people to the consideration of vital topics. In the September number of the American Phrenological Journal may be found a most wholesome sermon by him upon the kind of religion our food incites. The theory has long been accepted that the dyspeptic has a most gloomy way of looking at religious devotions, and the terrors of an impossible hell have been most graphically described by those who have made grave-yards of their stomachs by the consumption of murdered, animal innocents. We have much to learn yet, and to practice, physiologically, before we can boast of much real spiritual perfection. We would like to see this sermon and another by the same talented writer — ' Who Killed Chief Morris? ' — sent broadcast the world over, the first as a lesson upon Christian diet, the second as a most terrible arraignment of the rum-seller. We copy some important extracts from the A. P. Journal.
