Children's music THE CHILDREN'S MUSIC. We asked were the music came from That made her so wondrous fair, As she stood with the sunlight touching Her gloss of golden hair, And her blue eyes looked toward heaven As though they could see God there. ' Hush,' said the child, ' can't you hear it, The music that's everywhere ? ' God help us ! we could not hear it, Are hearts were heavy with pain, We heard men toiling and wrangling ; We heard the whole world complain ; And the sound of a mocking laughter We heard again and again, But we had lost all faith in the music ; We had listend so long in vain. 'Can't you hear it?' the young child whispered, And sadly we answered ' No.' We might have fancied we heard it In the days of long ago ; But the music is all a delusion, Our reason has told us so; And you will forget that you heard it When you knew the sound of woe. Then one spoke out from among us Who had nothing left to fear; Who had given his life for others, And been repaid with a sneer. And his face was lit with a glory, And his voice was calm and clear And he said, ' I can hear the music Which the little children hear.' Good Words
