CALLING THE ANGELS IN. We mean to do it. Some day, some day, We mean to slacken this fevered rush That is wearing our very souls away; And grant to our loaded hearts a hush That is only enough to let them hear The footsteps of angels drawing near. We mean to do it., O, never doubt, When the burden of daytime broil is o'er, We'll sit and muse while the stars come out As the patriarchs sat at the open door [eye Of their tents, with a heavenward gazing To watch for the angels passing by. We promise our hearts that when the stress Of the life-work reaches the longed-for close When the weight that we groan with hinders less, We'll loosen our thoughts to such repose As banishes care's disturbing din, And then�we'll call the angels in. The day that we dreamed of comes at length, When tired of every mocking quest, And broken in spirit and shorn of strength We drop indeed at the door of rest, And wait and watch as the day wanes on� But the angels we meant to call�are gone! �Selected.
