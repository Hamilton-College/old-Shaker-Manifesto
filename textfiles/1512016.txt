RIGHTFUL HEIRS. ELIZABETH STIRLING. While reading in the Manifesto, seme historical sketches, I was led to compare the noble spirit of consecration which actuated the founders of these societies, with that which is manifested by the present inmates. They, as �pioneers endured persecution for their faith's sake ; yet were happy in the consciousness of serving God. With what steady, unwavering zeal did they pursue their course of self-abnegation and devotion to a cause dearer, to them, than life. Are we true sous and daughters of such a parentage ? Can we claim an heirship with the truly consecrated. Some in our ranks are giving daily �evidence of self-sacrifice by their willingness to spend and be spent for the interests of Ziou, and the salvation of souls ; but is not that number comparatively few ? If we believe that we have found the pearl of great price ; the revelation of the gospel of Christ through Mother Ann, why should not every one, even those of the least experience, be anxious and earnest to help sustain the cause? Is it to our credit that the religious element wanes among us? We know that such is the case in the world at large, and that such conditions are liable to effect us to a greater or less extent, yet with greater religious fervor we may be able to combat and conquer the spirit of the world. We can have but little confidence in the spirit which says, 'It is God's work, and in his own time and way lie will sustain it. We believe that God's work is a soulsaving work and whether we devote ourselves or whether we forbear, He will assuredly raise up agencies through whom to accomplish the same, leaving us in a condition similar to that of the Jews who, after waiting so many years for the coming of the Messiah neither knew nor accepted him when lie appeared, and as a consequence, are still waiting his advent to return them to their 'place and nation. ' Our fathers set us an example of activity in the work of God, they established homes, and went from place to place preaching the testimony of selfdenial and the cross. They braved all opposition with an ardor and zeal which proved their sincerity and devotion. We have the benefit of their consecrated interest in the things spiritual and temporal, and unless our consecrations are equal, according to the day in which we live, can we reasonably expect to be counted as rightful heirs?
