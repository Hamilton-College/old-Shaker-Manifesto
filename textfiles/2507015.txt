Shakers, N. Y. June, 1895. IN reviewing the obituaries in the June Manifesto, we find it recorded of one of the saints that has journeyed on, that she was 'faithful unto death.' In the conflict of life it is grand and glorious to be able to have it said when we enter into rest that we were worthy to be counted with those who are faithful. The boy who, taken prisoner was ordered to sound the retreat on his bugle under penalty of death, and sounded the charge dying like a hero at his post with his face to the enemy was 'faithful unto death.' Since our last we have had very changeable weather; the month of May giving us some frosty nights, injuring gardens more or less according to the advanced condition of the crops. We escaped with slight damage when compared with the loss of crops in some sections. We have been favored with a visit from our beloved Sister Ann Cummings of Enfield, N. H. and also we hear it reported that the Ministry Sisters from East Canterbury are expecting to visit Watervliet. We enjoy these seasons of social and spiritual communion with our gospel relation, they are our interest and our treasure. We have had a delightful rain that has refreshed vegetation and made us realize how dependent we are, and how grateful we should be for the care extended over us by the hand cf divine Providence. The editorial in June Manifesto is timely, 'Aggressive evangelism' is absolutely necessary in the advancement of the truths of the Divine Life with a strong emphasis placed on Aggressive. That spirit is far removed from the one that seeks to breed contention. Only by a vigorous promulgation of the advocates of the truth are the advocates of the higher life able to stand the assaults of the opposing powers that seek to hold down to the lower stratum of thought and life the expanding powers of the soul.
