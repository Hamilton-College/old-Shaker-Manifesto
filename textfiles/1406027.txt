NOTES To be like him,�to grow in his likeness, to be baptized and resurrected in the divine spirit of our Lord and Savior,�Christ, is the work of those who are effectually turning from darkness toward the beauties of a spiritual light. Christ is above, and it is an upward march toward the kingdom of peace that carries us away from the follies and sins that so largely beset us. A glorious hope abides with us, as the morning dawn has so far advanced that the heavenly pathway can no more be obscured. To run or to read is within the province of each one, ' Before us lies a fruitful field, Behind, a wilderness. ' To stimulate ourselves to stand steadfast in our high calling, now becomes au imperative duty. God's word has not been au idle sound that we should forget from whence our blessings flow. We have been called as devoted laborers in the fruitful field of our Heavenly Father's love. The harvest, indeed, is great and an invitation is extended for living and active workers to gather of the bountiful blessings that may now be found within the boundaries of this spiritual kingdom. The great Teacher has wisely said,� If you are not faithful in the things of this life,�in the abundance of temporal blessings that are prepared for you, how feebly developed you will be to become stewards of the true riches. The usethat we make of the first will more or less correspond with the use that we shall make of the last. To feed the hungry, clothe the destitute and afford shelter to the weary is simply the voice of humanity. ' Inasmuch, said Jesus, as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me. ' A kindness in the dispensing of earthly blessings has its sure reward, and if presented in Christ's spirit, a gift, even so trifling as a glass of cold water will bear its corresponding recompense. But there has been a class of professors who walked in other ways, and Jesus accepted their course as a lesson to his followers. They gave no food to the hungry, no drink to the thirsty, nor sheltered those who were in need. Selfishly looking beyond the sphere where their ministrations should have been, they presented their gifts only as a form of godliness. How very much we need to learn from these lessons of life, and to incorporate the good into our religious system. How very much we need to study the spiritual necessities of the day in which we live and to be the good Samaritans and the untiring messengers of love and peace to those who are walking in paths, not illuminated by the love of Grod. Consecrated and devoted fathers and mothers have prayed for and watched over us, and in turn it becomes our duty to p: ay for and watch over others with a manifestation of the same loving, spiritual care. On the other hand, it is no less our duty to contend against all forms of wickedness wherever they may be found, than it was the duty of those who have preceded us in the gospel work. Equipped with the whole armor of God, we have no reason to fear. The victory will be with those who trust in the Lord. 1884.
