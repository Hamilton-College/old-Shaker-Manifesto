A BIBLE LESSON. ELMIBA BLKINS. Christ fastetb, is tempted, and overcometh. He begins to preach, and calleth some to be his disciples. Matt. iv. This is preliminary to the most impressive chapter throughout the Bible. What better conception could we have of the character of our Savior, than is given through evidence of his triumph over the tempter. We read that he was led by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the evil one. There he was requested to do a miracle that would prove whether or not his mission was ordained of God. The tempter said to him, ' If thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread. ' Hence, the wisdom of his answer. 'It is written that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. ' Next, he Avas taken into the holy city and seated on a pinnacle of the temple, where the tempter said, ' If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down, for it is written. He shall give His angels charge concerning thee ; and in their hands they bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.' Then Jesus said to him, 'It is written again, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.' Again, he was taken up an exceedingly high mountain and shown all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. All of these were promised him if he would fall down and, worship the tempter ; but the spirit of good rose triumphant, and a conquest over the enemy was won. Thus Jesus said, 'Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve. ' So the spirit of evil departed and angels came and ministered unto him. It was the dawning of light to the people who lt sat in darkness in the region and shadow of the valley of death.' Enfield, N. H.
