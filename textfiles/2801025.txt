The Ladies' Home Journal The Ladies' Home Journal has secured what promises to be the great magazine feature of 1898. It is entitled The Inner Experiences of a Cabinet Member's Wife. In a series of letters written by the wife of a Cabinet member to her sister at home, are detailed her actual experiences in Washington, frankly and freely given. The letters were written without any intention of publication. They give intimate peeps behind the curtain of high official and social life. They are absolutely fearless, they study Washington life under the search-light as it has never been before presented. The President and the highest officials of the land, with the most brilliant men and women of the Capital, are seen in the most familiar way. As these are all actual experiences the name of the writer is withheld. The letters will doubtless excite much shrewd guessing by readers and study of internal evidence to discover the secret. The 'Experiences,' which will be beautifully illustrated, begin in the December number and will continue for several months.
