Just sunshine and shower enough to make a perfect growth. Our hillsides take kindly to every variety of weather. The blasting east storm of May, did not injure the fruit blossoms. Cherries are abundant, large and fair. Two and a half and three inches in circumference, are a common measure of cherries from some trees. One thing to be observed in passing through the fruit orchards is, that whenever a tree fails, either by age or disease, it is removed and a new growth takes its place; thus giving a hope of a continuous supply of fruit. It often costs the pomologist a pang, to hew down a bearing plum or cherry tree, because of the black knot; but as there is no better remedy for one thoroughly infected, down it comes, and a healthy tree fills the vacancy, with an assurance that hereafter the disease will be attended to as soon as it appears. Does not this teach us the lesson, that to be thrifty in spiritual fruits, every moral disease must be eradicated; for if, 'Angels wait on Providence And mark the sundered places To graft with gentlest instrument^ The heavenly graces.' Should we not work with them? Sti'awberries have yielded well for a second year's growth. Fifteen bushels have been taken from the vines, and berries four and a half inches in circumference were numerous, while a few measured five and even five and a half inches. The vegetable garden under the care of Elder Calvin, and the root garden adjoining, are an honor to the workers therein, and a pleasure to the beholders. Often observing our faithful Elder Joseph out as early as the birds, and late in the evening, using every moment that can be spared from his spiritual duties, to assist where the burdens lie heaviest, we are led back in thought through the century wliich has witnessed the building up of our Communities and can readily see where the success lay, which transformed a swampy wilderness to our now comparatively fertile plateau. There is no measure of time for labor in any real home. Stated hours belong to the hireling, whose employer's interest is not his. Still it is a positive duty to so wisely garner our strength that we may not fail when most needed. 187 188 THE MANIFESTO. We were lately cheered by a few hours visit from Elder George Wilcox and Eldress Sophia Copley, of Enfield, Conn., and if 'short visits make long friends' our friendship stands a chance to be very much j elongated in these days of fast movements. Our Central Ministry leave us on the 11th inst. for another prolonged absence, to be missed so much; for with all the spiritual strength extended, their hands are ever active to lend temporal aid, proving that 'I serve' is a kingly motto, and the way royal to human hearts.' Amelia J. Culver. North Family. July, 1894. On the evening of June 26th, our family had the pleasure of the presence of our beloved Ministry Sisters and Br. Alonzo Hollister during an informal and entertaining talk of an hour and a half with our old and esteemed friend, Dr. Dewey of New York. The doctor remarked that he understood and experienced the religious impulses, motives, and inspiration of the higher or spiritual life, and desired most earnestly to impress upon us the importance the life and principles we stand for to be to humanity at large, and to encourage us in the high cause to which we are consecrating our lives. He would, in the presence of a company so much more able to speak upon the experimental and practical side of religious life, occupy the time he had in presenting ideas from the philosophical and intellectual standpoint, whicl might stimulate thought and be interesting as leading up to and supporting the same principles. It has been said 'True religion and true philosophy must ultimately arrive at the same conclusions.' What better definition can religion give than the philosopher Plato, who defines pure love as a 'pure spiritual love, free from carnal desires, having regard to the excellencies of the mind only.' Dr. Dewey believes in the law of evolution. In the rise, not in the fall of man. He believes that all things have souls, or a spiritual prototype. We notice that recent scientific investigators are inclining to the spiritual rather than the mechanical origin and evolution of life. The late Prof. Tyndall writes, 'Two courses, and only two, are possible. Either let us open our doors freely to the conception cf creative acts, or abandoning them let us radically change our notions of matter. If we look at matter as defined for generations in our scientific text books, the absolute impossibility of any form of life coming out of it would be sufficient to render any other hypothesis preferable. But the definitions of matter given in our scientific text books were intended to cover its purely physical and mechanical properties, and, taught as we have been to regard these definitions as complete, we naturally and rightly reject the monstrous notion that out of such matter any form of life could possibly arise. Dr. Dewey's belief is that the planets were projected and all species of life evolved for the sustenance and production of man as a medium and instrument for the expression of the Divine Mind (God) which he believes to be pure spirit, impersonal, the projector, energizer, life principle of all created things and inspirer of man. That the quickening of the vital spark of the Divine Mind in man, the consciousness of spiritual unity and responsibility, is awakened in souls in all conditions of environment, that it is not conditional upon a degree of preparedness, (here the doctor was closely questioned) that it immediately produces a change of heart, is a birth, but the full stature of man as a spiritual being is not attained until he has risen out of all selfishness and carnal desire and lives wholly in the moral and spiritual qualities of his being. The doctor spoke of the five physical senses and also a sixth and seventh sense, the sixth intuitional, the seventh the sense or consciousness of the through-flowing of the Holy Spirit. He believes heaven to be a condition of union and harmony, that THE MANIFESTO. 189 man can not reach this condition of himself, but must do so in union with his God and in fellowship with his brother. The idea of re-incarnation is repulsive to the doctor's mind. He believes in the illimitable possibiliti s of the progress of man under divine inspiration. ? God is and always has been a moral idea. God is that moral power, n&gt;t ourselves which makes for righteousness. Jesus gave the world an inspiring and consoling idea when he taught humanity to think of and pray to God as our Father. Mother Ann completed the idea when she revealed the Mother Spirit in Deity, giving us a still more loving, intimate, and sympathetic idea of the love and wisdom of the Divine Mind. Visiting us at the same time were two lady friends. One of them H. Rathburn, an earnest worker in the woman suffrage cause, read the following evening a very interesting paper on Woman's Sphere. We give our blessing and words of encouragement to all workers in a righteous cause. A company of four Sisters and one Brother start for Enfield. Conn., to-morrow to enjoy a good gospel privilege with our generous friends there. Wiiiitr S. Sheyhei'd. South Family. July, 1894. Beloved Elder Henky: We take this opportunity to announce that our worthy Sister, Jane (Sutton) Brainard, passed away June 13th at the age of 88 yrs. and 6 mo. The funeral services were, held in the afternoon of the 15th, and lasted about two hours. The several families were well represented, over twenty members from the North family being present. Many words of praise and regard were spoken in honor of our dear Sister. Elder William remarked that he felt more in earnest to be upright and exemplary in all things, as the departed Sister had been, and not be a hindrance to others in any good work. One good Sister expressed deep affection for Sister Jane, an 1 for mxuy other aged ones who have lei't the shores of time, as well as for tli.se who stiii remain with us. Eider Ciintun Brainard remarked that those who do the will of our heavenly Father, are his fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers. He also thanked the family for the kind care extended to his aged parent. We ara glad to inform you that a new pointed, iron fence will soon take the place of tiie old wooden one. This is a great necessity. We now hive the two volumes of the 'World's Parliament of Religions,' and like then very much. Last week we received Elder Henry's photograph, for which please receive our sincere thanks. I have just received another that I prize very much, that of Edward Bok, editor of 'The Ladies' Home Journal.' S-trah Collinx. Watervliet, N. Y. North Family. Jnlv, 1814. Wtitle we enjoy communing wit'i our dear Brethren and Sisters through tin medium of the 'Home Notes,' and lake great pleasure in the perusal of the communications from the different Societies, we also want to remember the old adage that, 'short visits make Ion.'; friends,' and not crowd those who aie more worthy. On our National day, the Fourth, we enjoyed a season of social communion with our gospel relation of the Society, who met in the Church grove and tasted of the good things in a material sense that were pleasing to the palate, and with diversified forms of innocent amusement, the hours passed pleasantly away until after the dinner hour, when the rain compelled an adjournment to the North family, where the balance of the day was spent in speaking pieces, reading, and in social intercourse. Such recreative seasons properly conducted, are beneficial to tue 190 THE MANIFESTO. partakers in the cultivation of the social feelings. As it is in order to note the weather, we will observe that July opened with a tropical climate. The thermometer registering at one time, 102 degrees in the shade. At pi-esent writing, the 8th, it is like autumn; this morning it stood at 55 degrees, quite cool for July. We are reaping the fruits of our labors in vegetables from the garden. The farmers are busy securing the hay crop and in plying the cultivators and hoes in the care of the farm. Hamilton DeGraw. Canaan, N. Y. July, 1894. It is truly said, 'time waits for no man.' It seems but a few weeks since 1894 was just dawning upon us, and now July, is reminding us that the harvest is near at hand. On this stony hill-side with changeable climate, if one would gain an honest livelihood he must be awake and alive to the pressing duties of each day. Our Brethren have commenced haying, and this as every good farmer knows calls forth energy and willingness on their part. Beloved Eldress Ellen from Harvard, formerly a resident of this place, has lately spent a week with us, which was very enjoyable, and I trust she returned home strengthened by the opportunity of social and spiritual interchange with many of her gospel relation, as this tends to strengthen both soul and body. Dr. Dewey from N. Y. has been spending a few days with us. His humanitarian labors will be better appreciated, and more generally accepted as the great truths they involve become demonstrated. He very kindly consented to give us several lectures, which were very edifying. . His visit afforded us much pleasure. The meeting of the Floral circle occurred on the fourth of July. It was adapted to the occasion. Several appropriate articles containing excellent ideas, were read. The younger portion of the members marched to spirited music each bearing a white flag to denote that they were followers of the Prince of Peace. The room was brightened by nicely arranged bouquets, and the evening was spent very pleasantly and profitably and afforded enjoyment to all the family. Such simple social entertainments shared at home, serves to animate and cheer every heart and thus truly give a zest to life. Angeline Brown.
