Canaan, N. Y. July, 1894. It is truly said, 'time waits for no man.' It seems but a few weeks since 1894 was just dawning upon us, and now July, is reminding us that the harvest is near at hand. On this stony hill-side with changeable climate, if one would gain an honest livelihood he must be awake and alive to the pressing duties of each day. Our Brethren have commenced haying, and this as every good farmer knows calls forth energy and willingness on their part. Beloved Eldress Ellen from Harvard, formerly a resident of this place, has lately spent a week with us, which was very enjoyable, and I trust she returned home strengthened by the opportunity of social and spiritual interchange with many of her gospel relation, as this tends to strengthen both soul and body. Dr. Dewey from N. Y. has been spending a few days with us. His humanitarian labors will be better appreciated, and more generally accepted as the great truths they involve become demonstrated. He very kindly consented to give us several lectures, which were very edifying. . His visit afforded us much pleasure. The meeting of the Floral circle occurred on the fourth of July. It was adapted to the occasion. Several appropriate articles containing excellent ideas, were read. The younger portion of the members marched to spirited music each bearing a white flag to denote that they were followers of the Prince of Peace. The room was brightened by nicely arranged bouquets, and the evening was spent very pleasantly and profitably and afforded enjoyment to all the family. Such simple social entertainments shared at home, serves to animate and cheer every heart and thus truly give a zest to life. Angeline Brown.
