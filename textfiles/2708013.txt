East Canterbury, N. H. June 24, 1897. B. L. GMy Eternity Sister;ï¿½So short a time since you left us for your long-anticipated, happy visit to our dear friends at ' Enfield, yet we have missed you. How could it be otherwise! Faithful stewards you have been, and for this claim our love and blessing. This is another seal placed upon your loyalty to your friends, your Church and your God. We are all the while breathing prayers that the Father's Angel messengers attend you.' I am sitting at the type case and as I think of you and your dear companions, there rushes to my mind so many thoughts of days of happy interchange, now past, yet to be renewed in days to come, that I can set them in type as readily as I could write with the pen. I shall be glad to welcome you again to the dear old Printing Office where you and I have loved and lived and worked together until- - - - -Let us draw the curtain, and at the holy shrine whereon we have offered our vows of consecration as a sweet-smelling savor before the Lord let us ask angels to bless our past efforts to do the right and so chasten us, in the wisdom of the Divine Spirit, that we may become subjects of the Resurrection order wherein old things have passed away. May our friendship be after that pattern which makes us friends of God, and friends to each other whose love never vvaxeth cold. Whisper comforting messages to each one, to the Mother Queen of your party, Sister Ellen Myers, crowned with her years of rich and ripened experience; give her the kindest wishes of her girl subjects at home. Love to your mates, and kind remembrance to the dear Sisters in the Office, to our absent Ministry, and finally to all. Lovingly, Josephine E. Wilson.
