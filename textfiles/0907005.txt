BEAUTIFUL THINGS LEWIS HORTON Beautiful words are blossoms and flowers, That grow in the gardens of God ; While mercy and love, in beautiful showers Make blooming the paths we have trod. Beautiful thoughts ennoble the mind, And make our lives pleasant and bright; Gems of the soul are jewels we find In the paths of spiritual light. Beautiful deeds bring happiness here, And cheer the sad heart on its way ; Tho' but a smile, a glance, or a tear, They lead to an eternal day. Beautiful souls are the bright and the pure, The kind, the loving, and true ; White-robed they will be, where treasures endure. When earth and the heavens are new. Beautiful lives—in the angelic sphere— Which bedeck fair memory's hall, With beautiful scenes from every thing dear, In Him who reigns over all. Enfield, N. H.
