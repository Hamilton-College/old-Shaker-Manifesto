Watervliet, Ohio. Oct. 1893. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½Since our last letter, we have enjoyed the company of some visitors from Union Village. Srs. Jane Cowen, Anna Mills, and Locette Rider. I trust they enjoyed the season with our little family. Br. Benjamin Gates also gave us a short call, and presented us with some very fine peaches. We all enjoyed them very much. Several of our Sisters have been on a visit to the friends in White Water, and have returned with an inspiration of good gifts. Our love is for all good Believers, and to make their lives happy and pleasant will make ours the same. 266 THE MANIFESTO. We should consecrate all to God, crucify self and live a pure, clean life. Our potato crop is not large, but we shall have enough for our own use. For these blessings we are very thankful. H. W. Fredrick.
