It is not every year, nor in all localities, that we can say, 'Nature puts on her brightest robes to die in;' but we find that our pleasant summer is being followed by an equally delightful autumn. Early and severe frosts sere the leaves, causing the russet and brown to prevail; while fully ripened foliage, minus the frost, gives a predominance of the brilliant red and yellow, as is seen in the autumnal pictures of to-day. Frosts as yet have not been heavy enough to hurt either the tomato or the morning-glory vines; both of which succumb readily to the frigid touch. Sweet corn, tomatoes and peaches appear upon our table up to date. Apples this year a light crop, but will be so well cared for during the winter, that they will last until the early fruit time of next year. Pears and peaches have been as abundant as the number of trees would allow. It was not two-fifths of a mile of pears that our garden produced but peas. When we have time we will count our pear trees, and allowing a rod between each they will make a long, long row. Forty years ago peaches were abundant on our hillsides. Later the severe winters killed the trees, and peach culture was considered an impossibility. Twenty-three years ago delicious peaches again appeared on every branch which had out-lived the storms, and an interest in home grown fruit again revived. Trees were again started everywhere, to be again and again winter killed. But now comes the reward to those who amid failure still planted trees. How nicely this illustrates the adage, 'Get your spindle and distaff ready, and God will send you the flax' and shows us how amid every discouragement, we should be prepared to bear the perfect fruits of righteousness, to feed those who, when the harvest cometh, are seeking only that religion which yields a life practice of good works. But spiritual progression like all other reforms, comes not without sacrifice. If we would march on to conquest, we must leave self behind, hew down our prejudices and idols, and let the sunshine of truth light us out of the dismal haunts of selflove and self-worship, into the grand highway where each seeks to serve God, by serving his neighbor. Amelia J. Calver. North Family. Oct. 1893. We are just home from Society Meeting. This day will probably close what has been a most remarkable season of Society Meetings. Not once during nearly five months has the weather prevented our assembling for worship. To those Societies who are not aware of the fact, we would say that we have issued a new music book (a 1,000 copies edition.) To those who have not had experience in this line, we would say that it costs considerable money, very much time and a scarcely conceivable amount of careful, exhausting work to publish a music book. We have undertaken the expense and give the time and labor freely from love of the public weal, and hope we may confidently rely upon the patronage of all good, interested and progressive Believers. The book is a credit to all concerned. It is issued at bare cost. We trust every family will want some. The celebrated Congress of Religions is closed. What is the result? Many speak ' THE MANIFESTO. 263 slightingly of it. But the fact of the representatives of all the Religions of the earth coming together, to be listened to with patience and respect, while expounding the central principles of their respective system?, ought to produce an increase of fraternal feelings, a broader charity, and less narrow egotism on the part of all. We thought prior to the opening of this Congress that Believers ought to be represented in it to testify of an unadulterated, radical Christianity. To this end Elder Daniel, with the consent of the Ministry, opened communications. Much pleasant and friendly correspondence has passed in regard to it. We expected for some time to be invited to arrange for a deputation to attend, but the ultimate concession granted to us was the preparation of a brief paper on our system, which the Chairman of Committee would read before the Congress. Our Sisters promptly prepared the paper and sent it out. We expected the still small voice would not be noticed during the confusion of tongues; but if our paper gets into the records it may meet the eye of the student, suggest thought and answer our purpose. Walter S. Shepard. Shakers, N. Y.. Second. Family. Oct. 1893. We have Providence to thank for our fortunate escape from frost thus far. Here we are, October 10th, canning tomatoes and drying sweet corn and cutting ensilage. We finish sweet corn to-day. Also have our two silos filled, holding about 150 tons. Apples a light crop. ? Isaac Anstatt. North. Family. Oct. 1893. The department of Home Notes in our dear little Manifesto is a blessed source of union and social communion with gospel relation. We read with great pleasure the monthly reports of different Societies. Owing to sickness in the Church family our meetings have been held, lately, at the different families, and on the last Sunday of Sept. the Society met at the North family. The heavens were opened; many realized the presence of those blessed souls who formerly resided here, and some were seen by our clairvoyant mediums. The spiritual aroma of their presence pervaded the house and was plainly felt. The cycle of a year is about run since we made our advent in this Society, and it has been a year of spiritual blessing. We were told by a beloved Elder and Minister that we would find good Believers here, and it has been verified. We have found those who are saints of God, who are ready, both physically and spiritually, for the heavenly messenger to say, 'Come higher up.' We have also found those who have put on the whole armor of God and are valiant soldiers in maintaining the testimony of virgin purity, which is the foundation pillar of our faith. Blessed Mother, may we be worthy to commune with thy dear children; and not be a dead weight bringing tribulation on the faithful ones. In a temporal sense we have had a prosperous year. The earlier part was somewhat dry, but crops have averaged fair. To one reared in a wheat section it seems a little strange not to see any wheat growing. We understand the Second family are sowing some this autumn. Of garden vegetables we have had a good supply. Our melons were excellent, but our beloved Editor did not appear as per invitation. Hamilton DeGraiv. [Dear Br.�We read your 'Home Notes' with pleasure and enjoyed the appreciation you manifest for all that goes to make up your new home. In this spirit the great crosses will become as little crosses, and the little crosses will wholly fade away. Please do not cancel the pleasant invitation, even though the melons are gone. Other blessings will spring up 204 THE MANIFESTO. r.ud create a wonderful thanksgiving, aiid then the invitation will be just nice to take us to your beautiful home, when our revival meeting opens for new light, life and love to God. Ed.] Shaker Station, Conn. Oct. 1893. 'It is impossible for any one to count a liillion. At the rate of 200 a minute there would be counted 12,000 an hour, 288,000 a day, or 105,120,000 a year. To count a trillion would take 9,512 years.' Poultry wisdom. Bone meal is an excellent thing to use in growing poultry, A cupful mixed with each gallon of soft food will make them vigorous and strong. We should be sure that we can make a success in growing one hundred hens before we try to grow a thousand. 'Too many fowls should not be kept in contracted quarters with but small opportunities for exercise. The profit from poultry depends much upon economical feeding, from utilizing materials which would otherwise be wasted. When grain must be bought for their needs, close figuring is ncsessarj to avoid loss.' Darnel Orcutt. South Family. Oct. 1893. How much has been accomplished the past month by a steady perseverance in the daily routine of harvesting. Potatoes proved a fair yield of extra good quality. The dry weather has left its mark. Every thing seems dry, including the springs. The rains we have had do not seem to show much effect. The weather has been quite warm and showery of late which is helping on late sowed grass and rye, also beneficial to the strawberry plants of which sixteen hundred have been set, and are looking well. We are changing our cow-mangers into stanchions with water in front of the cows. This is an improvement as the cows can be left in the barn all winter. The apple crop is good, and we find a ready market for all we do not want for home use. Temporalities require much attention, but we are striving to live in the spirit of the gospel. There are, no doubt, many in the great Babylon who are wrought on by the spirit to desire a way of escape from the evil days. These are the proper fish for our net. And the Father and Mother spirit is .surely at work seeking for some to worship in spirit and in truth. May many be guided by conviction into the ways of peace and purity. May we work with the spirit in striving to minister the life of the gospel to inquiring souls. Maria Witham. Canterbury, N. H. Oct. 1893. We, who though very pleasantly located on an eminence, have recently had reason to perceive that the 'North Wind' has little respect for persons or places in elevated positions, i. e. if we judge by its unwonted rudeness in our vicinity on the 10th inst. It injured the roof of our large barn so badly in a freak lasting twentyfour hours at least, that to repair the same will involve quite an expense added to that of a silo with a capacity of one hundred tons, which at present date is being built in north side of same structure. We have recently put a circular saw with other machinery into our saw-mill, instead of the 'Mulay Saw' the work of which has been so unsatisfactory in the past,�Now anticipate sawing a large quantity of lumber the coming winter for the market. Our potato harvest is abundant this fall. The best yield we have experienced in years; and thus we need not repeat the cry 'O give to the hungry, potatoes,' since five acres with three hundred bushels to the acre, must be ample supply. Apples are scarce and almost worthless as ia other localities, averaging only about one third of a crop. While we enumerate our material successes, our abundant harvests, and our many blessings, let us always keep in view THE MANIFESTO. 265 our dependence upon the Giver of all good, and like Him dispense to the poor and needy.

Multitudinous are our blessings; among which is pure language; clothing all themes with comprehensible wisdom. The beauty and wisdom of the Infinite is illustrated at this time in the autumnal foliage, which is indeed inexpressible in its grandeur; superior to the grandest painting ever made by human skill, and which is a fine similitude of the superiority of Christ's teachings over all manmade theories; the trutli of which, the writer U&gt; reminded was first made known to him through the instrumentality of our Manifesto. Christ's teachings, soul-refining and redeeming powers which are the strong fulcrums of daily life, causing the soul to rejoice in the knowledge. 'I know the voice that calls me From darkness into light. I know the hand that leads me And guides my feet aright.' Out from the darkness of ignorance and sin into the light of God, prompting the soul to live to its purest ideals of Christ discipleahip. But what about home? The harvest season is upon us. Dock root of fair quality. Potatoes, apples and pears a medium crop. So numerous are our blessings that all of our earth lite is none too long a ti me in which to serve God and humanity, as well as to cultivate self-hood in Christ-like virtues. George H. Baxter. Sabbathday Lake. Oct. 183:3. As we see tlie loads of corn drawn to t':e garden house for husking, we are reminded of Whitier's Corn Song: 'Heap high the farmer's wintry hoar 1 Heap high the golden coin ! Xo richer gift has autumn poured From out her lavish horn!' Many blessings are now being poured out to us from autumn's lavish horn, and while troubles are increasing between Capital and Labor in the manufacturing cities around us, all is quiet in our Communal homes. We abide under our own vines and fig-trees and there are none to make us afraid. Four young Sisters from Alfred have lately visited us. They manifested in their deportment a planting of gospel principles which we feel assured will grow and bear fruit for the upbuilding of Zion.' Since their return we have sent a company of our young Sisters to visit them. They spent a number of days in that lovely home and have returned to us renewed in spirit and are telling many stories of the pleasures they enjoyed and of the love and kindness they received. These seem like the golden days, not yet 'The melancholy days, the saddest of the year.' Ada S. Cumminc/a. Watervliet, Ohio. Oct. 1893. Beloved Elder Henry:�Since our last letter, we have enjoyed the company of some visitors from Union Village. Srs. Jane Cowen, Anna Mills, and Locette Rider. I trust they enjoyed the season with our little family. Br. Benjamin Gates also gave us a short call, and presented us with some very fine peaches. We all enjoyed them very much. Several of our Sisters have been on a visit to the friends in White Water, and have returned with an inspiration of good gifts. Our love is for all good Believers, and to make their lives happy and pleasant will make ours the same. 266 THE MANIFESTO. We should consecrate all to God, crucify self and live a pure, clean life. Our potato crop is not large, but we shall have enough for our own use. For these blessings we are very thankful. H. W. Fredrick.
