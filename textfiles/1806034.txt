CRUELTY TO BIRDS. F. W. Evans. When I see women disfigure themselves by wearing feathers, wings and stuffed dead birds, I am disgusted. Instead of enjoying the sight of what are termed the better half of humanity. I loathe their presence, whether on the street, in the cars, or in the boat. I keep thinking of Bergh, and wondering if an action would not lie against any one of these 'dead bird women' for cruelty to animals. Are not birds, animals with wings? Is there not some humanitarian, some person of means and leisure, who will help Bergh to abate ihis offensive nuisance? In the 'Tribune' of recent date, there was a notice of a society woman in London who, intending to surprise her affianced husband, at her wedding, had a gown made of dead cauary birds. She succeeded beyond her most sanguine anticipations : For, when he saw her come before the altar thus clothed, he was horror struck, and broke off' the ceremony at once, exclaiming 'I am afraid to trust my life destiny with a murderess !' Now it is announced that 'a rich New York woman has sent two skilled hunters to Africa to kill 500 birds of paradise, with which dead birds she is going to have a garment made.' When that woman appears in public in that raiment of blood, every woman seeing her, who does not hang her head in shame or raise her voice in indignation at the murderess, should be marked by men. If married let her husband restrain his anger and not use '' a rod larger than a broomstick in correcting her.' Human life should not be endangered. Buddhists.�Are not the Buddhists right in making the first article of their religious creed, 'Thou shalt not kill ?'� assuming that the killing of inferior animals leads to murder�to war�the killing of human beings. Commission.�The presence in America of a Peace Commission, composed of prominent Englishmen, is a sign in the old heavens and earth to be marvelled at. But wherefore was the Com- mission not half composed of women ? Were there not enough, after omitting the 'dead bird women,' to fill out the Commission? Make woman a citizen, give her the right to vote and the responsibility of office, aud she will soon cease to befoul herself with dead birds or deform her body with bangs or bustles. Wars will never 'cease to the ends of the earth,' except through the instrumentality of woman. But woman must become more womanly by removing from herself the proximate causes of war, before she will be endowed with power from on high to redeem man from the absurd and bloody art of war. Mt.
