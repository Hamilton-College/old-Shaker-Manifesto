Sabbathday Lake, Me. Dec. 1891. The pages of the New Year lie before us, every one of which is clean and white. Let the record that will be engraved upon each as we turn them from day to day be as clean and as white. There does not seem to be much that is new going on here now. The Sisters have lately been filling orders of their work for parties in Chicago, Buffalo and Washington D. C. We have also been sending Shaker Apple Sauce to the markets of Lewiston and Portland. Thus far the month of Dec. has in our state been very fine, much warmer than Nov. No snow on the ground and but very little rain. It has been interesting to us to read the notes in the Manifesto describing the weather in different localities. We anticipate Â¦ the coming week, the pleasure of having our good Brother James Pinder of Alfred with us. The communion of worthy and tried souls always brings an increase of gospel love. Our dear Sister Mary Ella Douglas has returned from Alfred and is spending the winter months with us for the renewal of her health, which blessing we very much desire in her behalf. We close by wishing all our dear friends a Happy New Year. A. S. C.
