THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS. Alonzo G. Hollister. Jesus, whom a large portion of mankind are pleased to call Savior, and perhaps rightly, is recorded to have said, 'To this end was I born, to bear witness to the Truth.' And ought not this to be the end, for which every one of us should live? Cer- tainly every one claiming to be Christ's disciple, or that has the privilege of knowing the true Christ of God. Can any one make a better use of life, or is there a nobler end to live for, one more elevating, purifying and redeeming? What was the character it formed in him ? One of strictest integrity and rectitudeï¿½one of purest benevolence and self-sacrifice for the welfare of his kind ever known ; fearless in the defence of right; bold as a lion, 3ret meek. A character approved and admired by the best minds of every race and religious persuasion. How did he form this character which is not known to have been surpassed, and rarely if ever equalled by any other recorded in history ? By practicing in daily life, all the truths of his understanding, the highest and noblest conceptions of his soul, stamped thereon by the impress of the Almighty. Because of his determined obedience, even to the sacrifice of every earthly interest, when necessary, and the complete subordination of every appetite and passion to the primary end he received power from the Almighty to overcome all obstacles. This is the pattern we have placed before us, and this is the end we have proposed for ourselves. Do any suppose that our aim is too high, and that Jesus was designed to be an isolated example of unapproachable perfection ? Far from it. He is the first-born of many brethren, and Ann, which means' grace, or a gift, was the first-born of many sisters. Jesus is our Elder Brother, Teacher and Exempler, and Ann is our Elder Sister, Teacher and Exempler likewise. How did they bear witness to the Truth? By living it perfectly, and totally renouncing the service of error. Can any one _ ever bear effectual witness to the Truth of salvation from sin without living as Jesus lived? that is, a spiritual life free from sin and carnal joys? We believe none but such as he can know the truth above its merest rudiments. How can they bear witness, who are traveling in an opposite direction? Jesus testified, 'The words which I speak to you, are spirit and life.' They came forth from his life and marked a clear line of distinction, between good and evil, and placed it in the heart, which contains by nature a mixture of both, and never could make a clean separation till his testimony drew the line.
