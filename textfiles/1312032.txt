Give up Medicines How precious is health! Wealth, hono-, luxury, associations and friendship are of less value than health ! Thousands of highly educated persons exclaim; 'I wouli give all for health.' Multitudes who can talk intelligibly of nebula, leucocites, moriads and of equations have become a trial to themselves and their friends, are fretful, hysterical, sensational and even lax in morality ! What is to be done? First, stop medicines of all sorts! Give up the gauntlet of tonics, stimulants, alteratives, sedatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, diuretics and narcotics, which have been applied in every conceivable way to the gastropulmonary and genito-urinary surfaces, to the nasal and serous membranes and external skin. Give up your liver pads, supporters, specifics and relate yourself properly to nature's materia medica! Give up your blue mass, quinine, iron, ipecac, opium, chloral and bromides and you have made the right start! Now try to take hope in your soul! Believe you may become well and vigorous and useful, for it is true, the most of you are curable. Second, Put yourselves in proper relation to 'deep breathing,' sun-light, food, dress, sleep, motion, rest, water and selfhood ! Do this at home or in the best institution you know, it will make no difference, only as you continue and persevere in doing it. L. in Herald of Health.
