AN INSPIRATION. By Ann Cumings. I sat in quiet musing, while all around was still, And felt an Angel presence, which did my being thrill. It whispered, 'Be thou joyful; cast off all doubt and fear ; For to the loyal number, deliverance is near! Look up, and see the sunshine; the night has past away ; The night of creed-bound fetters, all hail the coming day ! The day when truth shall triumph, and error disappear; Sing, Zion's sons and daughters, deliverance is near. The clouds of doubt and darkness, shall disappear from view; The Lord is thy salvation, his promises are true. He'll be thy rock of refuge, thy fervent prayers will hear; O sing aloud for gladness, deliverance is near ! The work of separation, most surely has begun; Heed ye the call in mercy, O heed it, every one; Come to the fold of safety, you have no need to fear, The Lord, thy God is calling, deliverance is near! Array thyself, 0 Zion, in vestal garments fair, And thus thy habitation for angel hosts prepare ; Then will they come with blessing, with courage, hope and cheer And cause thy inmates all to know, deliverance is near.
