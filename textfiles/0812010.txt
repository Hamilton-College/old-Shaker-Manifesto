JEW OR GENTILE T. Dewitt Talmage 'Last summer the land was ablaze with discussions about the Jews being excluded from one of the leading hotels. I have this to say : A Gentile is no better than a Jew—no better in morals, no better in providence and forethought. There are more Gentiles in Sing Sing and the Tombs and on Blackwell's Island than there are Jews. The Gentiles are no better in the profession of law—Moses, the greatest lawyer who ever lived, was a Jew. They are no better in banking—Rothschild, the greatest banker, is a Jew. They are no better in military—Joshua was a Jew. They are no better statesmen— D'Israeli is a Jew. They are no better theologians—the Lord Jesus Christ was a Jew. The Jews are not .physically inferior to the Gentiles. Why is six feet high any better than five feet high? Did you ever hear of Wellington or Napoleon? They were small. I know a great many tall fools. A crane is taller than a dove. Their features are not so attractive. Who decreed that a nose curved up is any better than a nose curved down? Uncleanly? What a charge to be made by the smoking Gentile nation. Think of the floating pigsty attached to all railroad trains, and the gentlemen's cabins in our ferry-boats. Most of the smoke belongs to the new dispensation. The weak point of the Gentile is not washing too much. Look at the city court room after a trial, or a public hall, after a democratic convention, or a republican meeting. Is that atmosphere all Jewish ? Analyze it, and you will find it to consist of 5 parts of 29S THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. whiskey, 3 parts of garlic, 1 of cologne and 1 of oxygen. I have baptized people who were so dirty that I was tempted to leave them in the tank. Flash jewelry ! That is not peculiar to the Jews. The American nation is covered up with it. You can get a 'gold' watch for $7,50 in Chatham street. Jewg sell them, but Gentiles buy them !
