We have received from the publisher, C. C. Pearson, Concord, N. H., a noble volume, entitled, ilA Practical Treatise on Vocal Physiology.' It is the result of years of study, by that musical adept and scholar, Dr. Chas. Alex. Guilmette. It is recommended to universal study by the first musicians of our country, and will soon bear fruit of as just a criticism over the waters in other lands. That it has long been needed, every one who reads it, will be at once convinced. We have given it a casual reading; but will only be satisfied by a thorough acquaintance. We recommend this work to every Shaker in our land, and to all the Shakers of the future. That it will be extensively appreciated, there can be no doubt. Shaker societies may address N. A. Briggs, our publisher, with advantage, in ordering it. Its price is $1.50, only.
