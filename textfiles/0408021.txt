CHRISTIANITY Jesus of Nazareth, the founder or exponent of Christianity, came from the exclusive Order of Essenes, and became the corner stone of a more perfect system than had yet obtained among that sect. He opened a new fountain of inspiration to priests and people ; and advanced the great work of progress toward the millennium of humanity. In practical life he was a pattern of holiness ; and all orders of people have admired him in his virgin character, even if they were not willing to follow his example in that respect. Although, at the time of the first advent of the Christ-Spirit on earth — embodied in the baptized Jesus — the civil governments were not sufficiently progressed, nor the people prepared for the permanent establishing of a Christian Pentecostal Church upon a basis that could stand; yet, from that time unto the present, effective forces have been at work to prepare the way for a new heavens and earth that would be based upon the Rock — Sexual purity — Non-resistance — Love to God and to neighbor, which would be manifest by an equal distribution of all things that pertain to physical life. Those principles, when received and reduced to practice, will give freedom from many vexing troubles which attend those who live in the generative order. Strange as it may appear, to the more spiritually progressed, whenever the higher Christian order and work is perceived and accepted by Truth seekers, there is mourning in the land ; especially in the nominal churches ; and indeed, all who love the world and the things thereof, mourn, because the Gospel testimony is like a sharp sword, proceeding from the mouth of those who bear it, to slay the carnal mind. Those who rise above the generative plane of life receive divine inspiration and power from the inner, or Seventh heaven, where souls, aggregated as Christ's ministers, pass through the spheres of God's creation, whenever and wherever sent.
