And I must tell you, Friends, about the first of each month The Manifesto is looked for — in fact anxiously. It has been tardy of late — the December number was received on the 7th. Now I like The Manifesto above all other journals it has been our fortune to read, so if you will send it to me for another year I will be able'to thank you very kindly. Hamilton Arnot
