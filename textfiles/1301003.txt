WRITING BOOKS BY ANNA EDWARDS SAMUEL 'Our lives are books, and God is the binder.' Writing books for eternity, Writing books for angels to see; Leaf after leaf, page after page, We're writing books from youth to age. Writing a page fair as the sun, With noble deeds and duties done: Writing a page darker than night, Soiled with envy, malice, and spite. Writing a page blotted with tears, Filled with pain, anguish, and fears ; But when God's light on it shall fall. It may be the fairest page of all Writing a page of many mistakes, Filled with errors that folly makes ; Blushing with shame we would fain revise But as we write 'tis sealed for the skies. Fair as heaven, or foul as perdition, Of this life-book there's no new edition. Lord help us write with much more care The pages of each future year. N. Y Weekly.
