FAREWELL COUNSEL WILLIAM H. WETHERBEE May God in His mercy be near and direct you. While passing along the rough journey of life ; Blay His angels at all times watch o'er and protect you, Whene'er you sojourn where temptations are rife. Should the phantoms of earth shine brightly upon you, With their promised pleasures that fain would allure, Then stand ye with firmness, let no one take from you The garment of innocence, spotless and pure. When far in the west (if perchance you should go there), And trials and troubles you still there should meet; When you find in your rambles true comfort is nowhere, Then hasten ye back to this lowly retreat. Here peace and true icomfort and justification Are free for the honest, the humble and low ; And though they are found in a meek, humble station, They are worth more than all this earth can bestow. A few days will flit, and will end earthly pleasure, Then tangible objects will vanish like dew ; The spirit immortal will then need a treasure â€” Remember this, Rose, for 'tis written for you.
