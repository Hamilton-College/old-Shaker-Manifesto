Cement for Petroleum Lamps. —A cement particularly adapted for attaching the brass works to petroleum lamps is made by boiling three parts resin with one part of caustic soda and five of water. The composition is then mixed with half its weight of plaster of Paris. It sets firmly in half to three quarters of an hour. It is said to be of great adhesive power, not permeable to petroleum, a low conductor of heat, and but superficially attacked by hot water. Zinc white, white lead, or precipitated chalk may be substituted for plaster, but hardens more slowly. To Get Rid of Foreign Bodies in the Throat. —A British naval surgeon, Dr. Beveridge, states that for foreign bodies in the throat, such as pieces of meat, etc, a simple mode of relief is to blow forcibly into the ear. This excites powerful reflex action, during which the foreign body is expelled from the trachea. The plan is so -easy of execution that, if there is anything in it, it ought to be generally known and applied.
