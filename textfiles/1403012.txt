COMMON SENSE. ALFRED E. DOYLE. Truly there is nothing like it, either in quality or value. It is the golden key that unlocks and delivers to our keeping the hidden riches of rational growth and development; brings us into harmony with the world about us, giving us to see the necessity of adapting ourselves thereto to secure those nice adjustments so essential to our welfare, without which the most brilliant genius, the most profound learning, prove only a flame to burn or a light to blind the possessor. Holiness might be written to illustrate and confirm the foregoing and still leave much unsaid. However as our observation is confined to th^ common-places of every-day life, a few disjointed thoughts on the subject from a fellowworker might not be out of place. We are all so alike and yet so differ- ent, still the pursuit of happiness, present or future, is the aim of all although the means to attain that end differ ever so widely; some have the will and knowledge to adapt the proper means to the end that others have not, and do noti is evident. Life is a many-sided problem with many phases ; of the dark side we know but little and that only by hear-say ; from even the relation of which the sensitive nature must shrink with horror, where vice stripped of every covering stands revealed in all its frightful ugliness, like ' The pestilence that walketh in darkness and slayeth at noonday, ' drawing in its train, crime, want and woe. Much has been done to remedy these evils but the great work of removing the caine remains. How the feelings of all lovers of our common kind must go out toward the innocent helpless youth and childhood born and growing up in these surroundings ; nothing short of a miracle can save even one from destruction. Who shall judge these justly ? Where is found the wise perception, the skillful hand, that shall lay hold of the twisted, gnarled and knotted tree of Nature, in all its branches producing a healthy, graceful growth ? Chir faith in the right leads us to believe all good possible in time. Who has not at times prayed as one of old ' Come, Lord, come quickly 1' In all and through all let us not be unmindful that, 'To whom much is given much will be required. ' The more we are led to observe the peculiarities of individual character, the more we are convinced of the al powerful influence, early surroundings have and always will have, in moulding the mind and shaping its course, drawn n as it were with the first breath of life becoming stronger than any process of reasoning, and by a still more subtle Dower even beyond this world. A certain eminent physician once said, the reason why most people die of disease was because the doctor was not called in time, adding that the right time was about a hundred years before the mtient was born. This is more truth than jest; we may go still further by saying the same rule applies as well to the mental and moral disposition, the lurtful tendencies of each to be considered as a form of disease to be studied with a view of discovering the cause and if possible, applying the rational cure. To this end let the gospel of Common Sense have ' free course to run and be glorified, ' teaching that Purity, Love and Peace are the only enduring riches here and hereafter, to gain which we have only to cast out Selfishness and its kindred evils, the old man with his deeds. We are of necessity and by nature compelled to associate in our various callings and conditions of life ; seeing it is so, it becomes us to turn it to the best account for comparison, discipline and development. Sometimes we may think if we but had a little world of our own, secure from the intrusion of our fellows or only those of our own choosing, we might lead lives above reproach; perhaps so, but such a scheme is, and must ever remain impracticable. It is not possible however free we may live from fault, to wholly escape censure and adverse criticism, even from our best friends, much more from the majority who are at least indifferent to our interests as perhaps a few who are hostile ; in all cases if we can rely on the conscious rectitude of our intentions we shall triumph over all such trifles and be thankful for the experience thus gained through trial. However much we might wish to, we cannot shield even our nearest and dearest from all the trials and temptations of life ; it may be in the wisdom of an over-ruling Providence to have it so. It is for each one after reaching years of understanding to take up the burden of life where others have laid it down, and learn wisdom through suffering; happy are they who hearken to good counsel and profit thereby ; still more so such as have a conscience quickened by spiritual discernment to judge rightly, united with a firm self-reliance in the right. These are they of whom it is writtenï¿½' The kingdom of Heaven by violence is taken. ' If we labor for a spirit of contentment, count over the many blessings we have daily, we shall thereby develop the highest type of Common Sense receiving new ajid higher views of life, and each day have cause to be thankful ' that our lines have been cast in pleasant places.
