ANOTHER YEAR. Agnes E. Newton. We hail the new, while of the old No sad refrain have we to sing; The arm so strong to save still guides And will complete salvation bring. God's word to-day as in the past Is as a lamp to guide our feet; It giveth light unto our path And is with love and truth replete. Of choice alone we heed his voice From love to Him our service flows; 'For grace bestowed, rich mercies given Our gratitude still deeper grows. The hours of life pass swiftly on No human power may bid them stay ; Nor change the record that they bear Creation's law they must obey. The past has proved that God is good The present that his love controls ; We know that our Redeemer lives In Him our confidence repose. We turn the page, upon the new To write with no uncertain hand; We've felt the power of worlds to come Seen glories of a better land. We ask for wisdom from above For grace to mould the inner life, Until the Christ is there enshrined And hushed the waves of earthly strife. Ye swift revolving years roll on And nearer bring the promised day ; Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done In Heaven and earth, 0 Lord we pray. Canterbury N. H.
