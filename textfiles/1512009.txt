Elder F. W. Evans, Dear Sir: You will greatly... Elder F. W. Evans, Dear Sir:ï¿½You will greatly oblige me by answering the following questions, which you may depend upon are not prompted by idle curiosity. First, What is the whole religious creed and doctrine of the Shakers? Second, What are their various rules and regulations and the benefit to be derived from the same? Third, do the Shakers believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God, and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and our only Savior? Fourth, do Shakers believe that miracles can be wrought in modern times as they were of old? Fifth, do Shakers believe science, knowledge and good morals, by their general diffusion, to be the most effectual instrument in the warfare with sin and the lusts of this life? Sixth, do Shakers believe ignorance to be the root of all moral depravity? Seventh, are the principles and rules of the different Shaker communities the same, or do they differ? Eighth, would the Shakers in the case of a boy nearly 17 years of age, who wishes to free himself from his kindred and the practices and modes of living that he detests, and join himself to your noble sect, be willing to pay a reasonable sum of money to his parents to whom he is in bondage until he is of age, in consideration of his services for the interval of four years? I am the said boy. Hoping to receive a speedy and satisfactory reply, I remain yours most humbly. Frederick G. Obermain,
