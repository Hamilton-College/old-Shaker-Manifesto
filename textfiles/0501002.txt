REALITY OF MATERIALIZATION IN PHILADELPHIA To the Editor of the Banner of Light: I am sorry to know that certain Spiritualists, who have not attended a single one of the sittings for materialization by the Holmeses, in June and July last, assume to decide, iti advance of personal observation, that these manifestations are the result of imposture. I attended forty of the sittings then held. No one who saw ' Katie King ' walk about, and heard her speak, and touched her, ever doubted, for a moment, that she was a living, thinking being. Either, then, she was what she professed to be — a spirit from another world — or else she was a confederate, secretly introduced by the Holmeses for purposes of deception. But if human beings cannot pass and repass at pleasure through the substance of a brick wall or of a stout walnut partition, then, under the con- ditions we obtained, entrance to or exit from the cabinet except by the door into the parlor where we sat, was a physical impossibility. It follows that, if human senses are good for anything as evidence, the 'Katie King' whom I and four or five hundred others saw and heard last summer was a spirit not of this world. Of all this, and especially of the precise con- ditions under which these materializations were obtained, the public will be better able to judge by reference to an article, to appear in the January number of the Atlantic Monthly, which I am preparing with the strictest care, containing a record of what passed during these sittings. I stake whatever of reputation I may have acquired, after eighteen years' study of Spiritualism, as a dispassionate observer, upon the genuine character of these phenomena.
