The Impersonality of Truth We recently received the few lines following, from Elder G. B Avery, of our Central Bishopric; intended as instruction for us in dealing with personal controversies. We hope, all, from Kentucky to Maine will take warning, and leave personal, argumentative collisions where they more properly belong— 'without'—see Eev. 22 : 15. ed. 'Truth will not arrange any person's opinions in the capacity of a target of error, for some other erring gunner to shoot at. It will simply, kindly shine, and lovingly enlighten all concerned with it. However rusty any may be, few, or none will sit willingly still, and quietly be rubbed until they shine brightly; for they will think, and with some good reasons too, that the dust, made in the process of scouring, will so blind the eyes of the operators, that they will never see the shining.'
