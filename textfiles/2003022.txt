Enfield, Conn. Our home market for stove and furnace wood is excellent. Wood means warmth, and so dots food. There is life in heat, and. all life must have food of some kind Then there is a food of the mind and soul as well as of the body. It wont do to forget that. Growth is the law of life, and all growth must have something to feed on. To grow good and do good, to well perform our duties the brain must work as well as the hands. As a rule, the best disciplined people will do the best work at the best time and in the best way. Most farmers cultivate too much land for the amount of manure applied. Less land with the same amount of manure will produce almost the same quantity of crops with a great reduction of labor. When sulphur is added to the soft feed for hens during the moulting season, it makes a good tonic. It purifies the blood and is the principal property in the growth of new feathers. Sulphur is a useful article. In orthodoxy it is said to be 'the purifier of sins.' The poultry man may not need sulphur so much as the hens, and therefore it is recommended for the latter. D. Orcutt.
