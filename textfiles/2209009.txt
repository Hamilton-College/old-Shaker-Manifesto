THE WEB OF LIFE. By Edith L. Swain. [Contributed by Eldress J. J. Kaiine.] Weaving, weaving, weaving, weaving, Still the living shuttles fly, While the Master, never sleeping, Holds the pattern o'er us high. Holds the pattern and unrolls it Thread by thread, and day by day Blue and golden tints and carmine, Mixed with weary lengths of gray. Fain the weavers are to linger, Fain to scan the pattern o'er; But they know not till they weave it What the future holds in store. Flash the golden threads of sunlight, Gleam the purple tints of fame, As the weavers' gliding fingers Kich and beauteous figures frame. Throbbing, throbbing, throbbing, throbbing, Beating fast and beating slow, Never pausing, never resting, On the busy shuttles go. Now the threads are dark and sombre, Dim the weavers' eyes with tears, Trembling to the pattern looks he, Numb the halting hand with fears. Now the threads are black and broken, Tangled, intricate and crossed; Figures rambling, weird, unlovely, And the Master's thought seems lost. Sick at heart and worn and weary, Toils the weaver at his task; For the web must e'en be finished Ere he rest or respite ask. Weaving, weaving, weaving, weaving, Slow the shuttle works its will; Throbbing, throbbing, throbbing, throbbing, Faintly beating,and is still. Happy now the patient weaver Who the Master's plan hath wrought, Tracing carefully the pattern, Marring nor neglecting aught. For the web the Master turneth, And before his dazzled eyes, Shining in its wondrous beauty, All the thought completed lies; And the weaver joyful learneth That the wrong side was his own Till the beating, throbbing shuttle All its faithful work had done.
