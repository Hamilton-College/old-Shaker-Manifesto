Sabbathday Lake. Feb. 1893. The harvesting angel has made us two visits within the last three weeks. The first time he took away our aged Sister Lucy Field. She had long been very feeble, and was waiting to be called home, so we could but be reconciled when she was released from her sufferings. His last call was on the 9th inst. when he took one of our most precious lambs, even the choicest of the flock, our dear sister Mary Ella Douglas. We were not wholly unprepared for the change, but when the final blow came, we found it was very hard to bear the sorrow of parting. During the past week Br. Henry Green of Alfred has been with us assisting in preparing material for some of our sale work. We were glad to have our good brother with us, if only for a short time. His believer-like spirit has left its influence with us to abide. Our school closes the present month. Eighteen pupils, average attendance seventeen. A goodly number will be entitled to first pi'izes for punctuality. Ada S. Cummings.
