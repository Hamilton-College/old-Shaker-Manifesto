HOUR OF WORSHIP Canterbury, N. H. 1. I love the hour of worship, Where angels gather nigh, 2. I love to know, my spirit Is blending with the pure, With heav'nly inspration To raise our thoughts on high. That I am storing treasures Eternally secure. I love to offer pledges Before my Father's throne, And thus I feel exalted Yet humble, when I see Which will redeem from error, And draw his blessing down. How good in all his dealings My God has been to me.
