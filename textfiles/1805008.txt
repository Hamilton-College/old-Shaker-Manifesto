Four Queries about the Shakers. No. 3. Chancy Dibble. The Virgin Life. This leads to a consideration of our subject which I do not think can be explaiued to the satisfaction of those who wish to live a worldly life. A worldly life is not a Christian life, by any means. Now, the question rests just here,ï¿½Which do we choose to follow, Adam or Christ? To serve God or Mammon ? To deny ourselves of all low, selfish gratifications and pursuits, or follow our own inclinations and cravings ? We cannot serve both. We shall hate the one and love the other, or hold to one and despise the other. If we love the world and hold to it, then let us go and live as the world should live ; live honorably, be faithful in the service of Mammon, but do not call it Christianity. If we choose to be Christians, let us come away from worldly practices and live as did Jesus. Do we not know by that holy faith which is in us that a chaste life is most acceptable to God? But, says one, How will we get along without generation ? How will the earth be peopled ? Why, this is easy enough. Let those who have a call to help people the earth, do their duty, according to the laws of generation, that when they are through with the generative order, they may come into the work of regeneration and be born anew into higher elements. Then, as they have previously been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, the true riches may be trusted to their care. The natural order is proper for each class of creatures, to bring forth its own likeness, but there is a higher sphere for man and woman, as intelligent beings. It was intended that they should be brought forth by natural laws like other animals, into animal life, but the spirit must progress upward. The spirit is immortal and cannot be satisfied with material pleasures. Its aspirations are for a life superior and angelic. Its love cannot be confined to earthly objects, only for a time ; it must soar away into higher scenes. Partial love is Hot enduring. It may do in the absence of true love and it may be, and doubtless is, better than no love. There is a universal love, an impartial love, that worketh no ill to any one, that has no lust, or envy, or malice. A love that is free and equal to all; a love that is founded upon principle, that never will desert the needy ; not emotional, does not proceed from passional sources. A love that is ever kind, that sttives to befriend even an enemy if there be any. Such is the love of good Believers in Christ. This love will bear cultivation. There is nothing vile, neither shame nor darkness about it. This love satisfies the soul and will accompany it beyond the tomb. It is the bond of union which unites pure spirits together, and its links are coupled in that endless chain which reaches from heaven to earth where aucrels hold a place, and all the faithful are joined to God their Creator.
