Tyndall's Champion. At a late assembly of ministers in Scotland, a proposition was made to pray for Prof. Tyndall. One aged clergyman arose to his feet and exclaimed : ' How dare you pray for Prof. Tyndall, whose shoe latches you are unworthy to unloose?' 'He is an infidel,' cried one. The aged man continued: 'I dare not pray for a man whose whole life has been devoted to doing good without a selfish thought, without hope of reward. I dare not pray for one so much better than I am.' That old man had caught the spirit of the age — the spirit of the new religion. Tyndall has fired the heaviest shot at the ancient system of selfish and superstitious Christianity; he believes in nothing but what his mind can discern and elucidate from solid principles, and hence — he is an infidel. Let us have more of them. He has done his age more good than this whole generation of clergymen who tell the story of the crucifixion in a way to melt the tender to tears, but have nothing in aid of the trouble and sorrow in their midst.
