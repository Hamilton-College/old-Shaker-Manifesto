Lafayette Lafayette visited Mother Ann Lee at Watervliet, in the early and trying season of her settlement there. She told him his time had not yet come to be a Shaker; that he had much suffering to undergo, and a great work to perform in this world; but when he went into the spirit world he might then unite with her children. Abijah Worcester, being a medium of the Spirit, was violently moved by the unseen influences while Lafayette was there; and Lafayette would touch him, as with a view to receive the influence. Abijah said to him: ' You love this power, don't you ?' ' It seems very desirable,' was the reply. (Witness) Lucy Wood. It is a curious fact, that fifteen days before Lafayette's death was published in the United States, the same was made known by himself to a medium at Watervliet (now Shakers), N. Y., and was a matter of common conversation among our people. He, at the same time, referred to his visit to Mother Ann, when on earth, and of her remarks to him. The above Lucy Wood was an eye and ear witness of Lafayette, in propria persona. *
