TEMPERANCE, Tobacco and Strong Drink Many persons use tobacco who do not u«e strong drink ; few use strong drink who do not use tobacco first. These two poisons are peculiarly fitted for close companionship. Alcohol is a stimulant, exciting and irritating; tobacco is a narcotic, benumbing, stupefying, and depressing ; hence either of them, if used, prepares the way for the other. When a man is wearied and exhausted, a glass of liquor excites and exhilarates him ; when he is excited and worried, a few whiffs from a pipe may make him calm as a summer evening. When he has stupefied himself day after day with the benumbing narcotic, he then excites himself with the irritating stimulant. The poisons work together like the halves of a pair of shears—alcohol exciting, tobacco soothing, and both killing! When a man is dull and heavy from the use of tobacco he drinks until he is excited and stimulated, then he smokes his pipe until he is calm and quiet, and then drinks again to wake himself up. So the two poisons work together, like the upper and nether millstones ; and between them both the man gets ground up. Every time he uses tobacco he feels the need of a stimulant; every time he drinks strong drink he cultivates the desire for a narcotic. Such habits, like hounds, hunt in pairs. When one vulture has fastened his claws in a victim others are always at hand to assist in destroying him. So wherever one of these vices may beset a thoughtless mortal the other one is usually not far away to assist in dragging him down to the pit.—Christian
