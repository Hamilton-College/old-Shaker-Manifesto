DO WE ACT THUS It is certainly wrong to talk of a member's faults behind his back, with a view of injuring him. If you have any thing to say about his faults, go to him like a Christian, and tell him all about it, and if he is the person he ought to be, it will do him good. It does no good to talk of a man's faults behind his back, nor is it right. Such things ought not to be allowed in any congregation that wishes to retain peace and harmony, nor should any, professing the name of Jesus, permit himself, or herself, to drift into such a sinful practice.
