Trampism â€”The legislation of New Hampshire has practically abolished 'the tramp ' from that State. Amid the terrors now so prevalent in this and other States, accumulated and accumulating by these pestiferous walkers, wise and determined legislation must be enacted, that life and property be made secure. We opine New Hampshire laws are not sufficiently merciful to the tramp; but these are infinitely better than lawless trampism, with the nightly dread of robbery, arson and assassination.
