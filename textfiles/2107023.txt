June 6, 1891. Deae Editor :�Farm and garden crops are looking well, but would be improved by a bountiful supply of rain. Cherrie s and pears promise fair results. We are having four of our buildings painted which improves their appearance somewhat. Door-yard lawn is looking nicely and this has a tendency to beautify our home and make it attractive externally at least. Health of family good. Your Brother, T. E. !N'ortli Family. June 10, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�Your kind letter and hints about forwarding home notes so as to reach the printers by the 14th. of the month is certainly very reasonable. We all like to have the Manifesto by the last of the month, and I hope we who have been behind will hereafter be prompt and in season. I will. On the 7th. we commenced our Society Meetings and it was a good beginning. I hope every Society will bear in mind, that next year will be our centennial of the gathering of the Church of Christ's Second Appearing into gospel order; without order it would be impossible to maintain our Communal relation. The gathering of the Church into order was a very important event in our history. There was more in it than the carnal mind has any idea of. The establishing of a system under which all nations could gather and live in harmony and peace for a hundred years must have a great deal of divine goodness in it; human skill alone could never accomplish it. The United States are making extensive preparations to celebrate the discovery of America, the home of liberty, or will be when the true earthly order is established therein. Let us have a grand festival in 1892! 'Kaise the gospel standard higher, let its banners be unfurled.' We are in the usual business of the season; battling with weeds, lice, fleas, bugs and moths and everything with which vegetation is cursed; it is a constant warfare: no time for idleness. The late frosts we have had, did little or no damage in our section. Have tried quite extensively the spraying of our fruit trees with London Purple to kill the curculio &amp;c. At harvest time we hope to gather fruit without worms. A few weeks ago we enjoyed a short visit from Elder Alexander Work of Groveland. He reports that the frost has destroyed all their fruit, of which they had such glowing promise. This is the third year their fruit has been cut off, and not only their fruit but the crops upon which they depend for material subsistence have been destroyed by flood and frost. They really need some practical love administered to them packed well in bbls. �of dried fruit or cases of canned fruit with the freight prepaid; or perhaps what would be better, some well-filled checks sent by mail. Gospel love is like the widow's cruise of oil; it never grows less by pouring on the needy. Bring forth tithes from our stores and pour them into Groveland and prove the blessedness of gospel love. Our Ministry all in usual health start for Watervliet this A. M. ~s In kindest love, D. O. Hancock, Mass. June 12, 1891. Dear Editor�There seems to be nothing note-worthy in our locality at the present time. Most of our family are in usual health. We are endeavoring to brighten up the interior of our buildings a little, by the use of paint. Have also a good opportunity to contemplate the beauties of nature with which we are surrounded. The maple trees which line the street also are robed in beauty. The blackberry bushes, planted by our venerable Elder, are in full bloom and present a charming appearance. We are pleased to learn that a company of our Gospel friends from Enfield, 'N. H. contemplate journeying hither. A cordial welcome is extended them in advance. The Teachers of our County held their annual convention on the 29th. ult., which had a large attendance and was very interesting. Oats and other crops are looking tolerably fair, but are somewhat affected by the drought. Fruit is doing well. J. L. S. Enfield, Conn. The past month gives evidence of industry in our Community and peaceful home. 'Hands at work, and hearts to God' seems to pervade the heart of every sincere laborer in the vineyard, and look from any point of observation the view is cheering, and inspires us with courage to persevere in adding new attractions to home and surroundings. Painting has been successfully cai'ried forward about our premises for the past two weeks, fences and buildings receiving their share. The garden has suffered from the long drought, yet water has been supplied to some of the smaller vegetables and kept them growing and at present lettuce, spinach and radishes are ready for use daily. Asparagus is doing well now although backened by the cold winds. Potatoes and peas are looking well considering the drought and severe cold winds that seemed to threaten everything with destruction. The currant worms came in quantities, but they were soon dispatched by a free use of helebore. The prospect of fruit not very cheering. The apples look the most promising at present. The prospect for grass is that it will be light. Rye and oats good. One of our wagon-sheds has been raised two feet making it more convenient for protecting loads of hay and grain. A wall has also been built to turn the water from cow-barn cellar all of which requires time and patience before we realize the benefits arising therefrom. With the blessing of God all difficulties will be overcome. M. W. PeRSEVERE to the end. Few and simple as these words are, if we put them in practice in our daily lives all our hopes of future happiness will be fully realized. The self-denying way is delightful and safe. The broad road may seem pleasant, but let us beware. 'There is a way that seemeth right, but the end thereof is death.' If we are wise we shall follow virtue's path though the way seem rough and rugged. We shall never regret this constant persevering,�this continual effort in the path of duty, The progress we make may not appear very great, at times, but if it be sure and steady, we shall win the reward. We should not only persevere in that which pertains to our own happiness, but also in our efforts to help others. Freely we have received, let us freely give. The largest sandstone drawn from the Somer's quarry to our station weighed eight tons and four hundred pounds. 4536 spaces of cream were sold in May. A small number of fowls properly cared for will produce more eggs than double the number neglected. Crowding the fowls calls for two much competition, too many struggles for existence, and the weaker ones will be unprofitable. The plan to pursue is to keep as many as may be easily managed and no more. We should not attempt a wholesale business with retail facilities. There is both pleasure and profit in poultry, but also loss where they are mismanaged. D. Orcutt. Harvard, Mass. June 4, 1891. Dear Elder Henry:�On the ,16th., we had an unexpected visit from Elder John B. Vance of Alfred, Me. Being in Boston on business and finding he could not get through to his place in time, he concluded to come and stay with us over Sunday, and we found it a very profitable and beneficial visit. In our service he spoke words of wisdom and strength, and dwelt largely in his testimony upon the spirit of Charity. His expressions, many of them were new and therefore interesting. Since having time for reflection, thoughts have passed through my mind, and none with more weight and force than upon this redeeming spirit,�charity. We are here as Brothers and Sisters claiming relationship by obedience to a faith made sacred to us by the fruits we have thus far realized. But all possessing a nature a little stronger for our own ways and wills than for the general good and benefit of the institution. Should we not in judging and giving our opinions, use a little of this spirit, knowing we are not capable of judging another's motives. Many of the faults that come into society germinate in an overtaxed brain and go no farther than the head, while the heart is as true and genuine as the purest gold. The spirit of charity and cheerfulness go hand in hand. A wise author once made the remark, 'I never knew a cheerful man to be a bad man.' What a glorious element a sunshiny person throws over society. While this melancholy spirit may be sure evidence to some of extraordinary piety, the cheerfulness which I mean to represent is not a momentary mood, but a lasting temper. It has not the noise of mirth, nor the emptiness of levity. It is a serious and abiding joy, resembling the flame of a wax candle, so steady, bright and pure. Forebodings of evil, rob the mind of cheerfulness. Ills that never have happened have mostly made people wretched. Casting a glance ahead we see lions in the way, difficulties which we are sure we can never overcome. Not satisfied with our present troubles we borrow misery from the future. 'Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.' This is what the cheerful man and woman sings through the day, and this gives them the golden promise, 'As thy day, so shall thy strength be.' Disease may have a tendency to cast a gloom over the spirit. As the body sympathizes with the mind, their union is so intimate and delicate that what affects one affects the other. Therefore, it becomes our duty as Christians, if we have health to study the laws of our being and compel ourselves to labor and to rest; avoid all unnecessary exposure, abstain from all that is injurious, by living prudently and temperately, and by every means try to preserve what is so essential to our spiritual comfort. Count up our mercies instead of our miseries. Try the medicine of cheerfulness. It may not insure you a full recovery, but it will certainly produce a pleasant alleviation. 'A merry heart doeth good like medicine, but a broken spirit drieth the bones.' A. D. B. Canterbury, N. H. Weather Record, for May, 1891. Highest Temp, during the mo. 80. Lowest ' ' ' ' 38.

While some of our western and southern friends are reporting the blossoming of trees and the ripening of fruit, those of us who live in a more northern climate must patiently wait the allotted time for our seasons to roll around before we can enjoy the fruit that grows by our own care. It was not till the 18th. of May that the cherry trees were in full bloom, and the passing of another week before the apple trees were arrayed in all their blossoming glory. The farmers and gardeners may have been a little in advance of last year, on the opening of spring, but the continued cold weather has prevented the crops from making a very rapid advance. The wild strawberry plants made a very liberal dis- play of flowers and some one has said that some other one has just found a ripe berry. The plants under cultivation are receiving the much-needed care and in a few days will reward us bountifully for all the labor that has been expended. The currant pest has again made its appearance. After the worms are ready for action they Avant but a few hours in which to destroy the whole crop of currants, and a liberal sprinkling of helebore over all the bushes is, at present, our only remedy. As we are more anxious to save the currants than Ave are to save the worms, a supply of helebore is near at hand to be used as often as may be needed. It is quite too early to know much about the fruit for the coming months and avo can only anticipate the days of a rich harvest. The grass crop is all that one could desire at this date. If and if all things work together for good there may be an abundance of hay and great rejoicing among those who are interested in the keeping of stock. But what of our pastures? They are fast being overrun with trees and bushes, and the surface for grass, where the cattle can feed, is diminishing very rapidly from year to year. The dogs of New Hampshire have for many years prevented the farmers from the keeping of sheep, and the ruin of the pasture lands has been more or less the result. At this eleventh hour the state has aroused from its slumbers and the thousand and one useless members of the canine family are to be kept more carefully at home or incur the penalty of the law. It is better to be aAvakened at the eleventh hour than not at all, but it would have been better for the farming population of N. H. if the much-needed protection had been secured some years sooner. Alfred, Me. June 12, 1891. Beloved Eldeb Henry:�It has been a long time since 'Home Notes' included Alfred. The only excuse I can make is in distributing 'Pencils' you left out Alfred. However I have borrowed one of Beloved Elder John and Avill try to bring our little Society into union. If: I were a poet I would tell you how beautiful is Mother Earth, clothed in her mantle of green, and how joyfully the feathered songsters fill the air Avith musical sounds. But not being a poet I Avill report that the grass is rather thin because of the cold weather through May. The Brethren planted live acres of potatoes in April, earlier than ever before known in this Society. In May, thirteen acres of corn were planted besides beans, cucumbers &amp;c, which the Brethren are now hoeing with the help of one hired man. Fruit trees blossomed out fairly well. We hope the promise thus given may ultimate in AATell grown fruit next Autumn. The green pastures increased the floAV of milk making the amount of cream sold in May 4253 spaces according to Br. Daniel's definition. 275 feet of pipes have been laid from dairy to cowbarn to convey the milk after it has passed through the Separator, back to the barn, while it is still warm just right for the calves. A now walk has just been laid from Ministry's Shop to DAvelling House. Health of our little Society physically and spiritually good; 'Hands at work and hearts to God' still our motto. If I am taking too much of your valuable space, remember we were away behind; can be more brief next time. F. C. Sabbathday Lake, Me. June 9, 1891. Beloved Elder Henkt:�I was just a little too late for the last Manifesto, so you see I am trying to be more prompt for this month. The planting is done. We purchased a National Keversible Sulkey Plow, and one young man sixteen years old avIio had never turned a furrow before did all of our ploAving except about eight acres, which was done last fall. The Brethren have worked thirty acres of ground this Spring with no help from hired men and they feel greatly rejoiced with their success and the prosperity which has thus far attended their labor. The unsightly fences are being removed and new ones put in their places as fast as possible. The second pasture for the hens has been made, containing about a square acre which will prevent them from destroying garden crops. Meanwhile, the Sisters have not been idle. We are busy with our flower-gardens. Have set out aster and pansy plants Marguerite pinks, and verbenas that were started early under glass. Eoses, geraniums and Carnation pinks were conveyed to the garden in season to receive slight touches from Jack Frost, from which they have bravely recovered. The sweet peas are growing finely. We hope to supply the guests of the Poland Spring Hotels with all the flowers they will want this summer. Our success depends upon the blessings of sunshine and rain which we trust our Heavenly Father will send in the future as He ever has in the past. A. S. C. Groveland, N. Y. June 10, 1891. June with its birds and flowers Sunshine and showers, And June with its duties most varied, Is filling the cup to the brim quite up As the spring months go and are buried. In our last Notes we talked of fruit uninjured by the work of frost out of season. Our report this month is a plain contradiction; all fruits with the exception of raspberries and currants, have met with a fatal blight, it is positive that another fruit famine year will mark the record of the present season. Vegetation is fast becoming withered, for the rain so much needed has not yet appeared; the dust is something fearful, the air is hot and oppressive and more comfort is obtained indoors than out; the cellars are the best resorts for coolness, quiet and moist atmosphere during these days when the mercury is pointing to one hundred degrees in the shade, and rising and rising till the dew begins to fall. About fifteen acres of sweet corn have been planted for drying, if the frost and drought and all other harmful agents are removed from the field we shall witness some busy hours as the harvest days come and go. During the early part of May while workmen were burning brush stray spai'ks were caught up by passing winds and transported to adjacent woods and pastures, burning brush, grass, stumps and nearly forty rods of fencing. With the timely assistance of many hands the fire was extinguished. With disasters we learn anew the lesson of caution in all things. G. D. G.
