Groveland, N. Y. June 10, 1891. June with its birds and flowers Sunshine and showers, And June with its duties most varied, Is filling the cup to the brim quite up As the spring months go and are buried. In our last Notes we talked of fruit uninjured by the work of frost out of season. Our report this month is a plain contradiction; all fruits with the exception of raspberries and currants, have met with a fatal blight, it is positive that another fruit famine year will mark the record of the present season. Vegetation is fast becoming withered, for the rain so much needed has not yet appeared; the dust is something fearful, the air is hot and oppressive and more comfort is obtained indoors than out; the cellars are the best resorts for coolness, quiet and moist atmosphere during these days when the mercury is pointing to one hundred degrees in the shade, and rising and rising till the dew begins to fall. About fifteen acres of sweet corn have been planted for drying, if the frost and drought and all other harmful agents are removed from the field we shall witness some busy hours as the harvest days come and go. During the early part of May while workmen were burning brush stray spai'ks were caught up by passing winds and transported to adjacent woods and pastures, burning brush, grass, stumps and nearly forty rods of fencing. With the timely assistance of many hands the fire was extinguished. With disasters we learn anew the lesson of caution in all things. G. D. G.
