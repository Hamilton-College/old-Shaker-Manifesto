South Hingham, Mass. Jan. 12, 1873 Dear Friend: In the afternoon of this beautiful day, I find myself alone, or with no visi- ble companion at least, and am thinking how many things I have to be thankful for. Your little paper for January in its new dress is before me. I have read and re-read, and am very thankful that it still lives and goes forth to the world to teach and help truth-seekers. It is a welcome visitor here, and I am happy in its perusal, and always receive strength and inspiration as I read. I write in haste and inclose fifty cents for the paper. Long may it continue. Yours for truth, M. D. B.
