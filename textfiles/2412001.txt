INSTRUCTION DIVINE. By Abraham Perkins. OUR Heavenly Father draweth nigh, and our Heavenly Mother appeareth. They give us words of eternal life ; a testimony that teaches the power of salvation, and the means to obtain it. 1 hear it every day. I hear it in the hills and in the valleys. I h ar it at my work and in my hours of rest. I hear it at our convocations for worship, which then especially awakens my responsibility. It causes me to question my life and to examine my works. It scrutinizes closely the preparation made for that baptism for which so much is asked in our prayers. It seeks to know how thoroughly the work has been done to prepare the soul for Chrisiian baptism, by honest confession in the order of God, thus showing my deeds, bringing them to the light, as did Achan in the presence of God's image, a living witness, without reserve and no dissemblance, as was witnessed in the act of Ananias and Sapphira for selfish ends. It teaches where the light of God is revealed and is to be found,a trust committed to the Christian Church, where stands the altar with its Melchisedec priesthood, unto whom is committed the keys of Christ's kingdom with power to bind and to loose as it is done in heaven, as Jesus declared. It teaches us to prune and dress our own gardens and not look for weeds in others; to cast the beam from our own eyes ere we can see clearly, motes in other's eyes. It teaches thankfulness of heart for the degree of goodness we have found, even though we have not obtained all we seek, or attained to the condition which gives the most perfect control of our spirit. It teaches that our ministrations should portray the best, the strongest and brightest side of life, and not the weakest, the discouraging and hopeless conditions; and teaches the spirit of kindness, love and peace, opening channels to sanctum sanctorum, the holy of holies.
