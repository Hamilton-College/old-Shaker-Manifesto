TWO POPULAR DELUSIONS. Among the beliefs prevalent with the laity these two stand prominently forwardï¿½that fish is a brain food of great value, and an exceedingly good diet for invalids, and that ice is always pure, no matter how filthy the water from which it was formed. Nor is it at all certain but that the profession has held, at different times, these same^sadly erroneous beliefs ; indeed, it is feared that some even yet cling to the fish as an article of diet especially created for the sick room. The truth is that fish, as a brain food is worth no more, nor as much, as many other foods, and, as an article of diet for sick rooms, in the majority of cases, is absolutely injurious. Relapses have been caused frequently by fish when given after fevers and nervous complaints. Loss of weight followed a fish diet, and very promptly. It should be stricken from the diet card for the sick rooms. To convince the average man that ice is or can be filthy is a hard task. But it can be done, and the people should be taught that ice may be as unfit for use as water, and for the same reason, that freezing does not remove all impurities, nor kill disease germs. It is true that some of the frozen matter is eliminated in congelation, but not all. The fact should be proclaimed that ice from stagnant pools or water that contains refuse of any kind, is not fit for use, that it may breed disease and death. Health and Home.
