Temperance, says Dr. Franklin... ' Temperance, ' says Dr. Franklin, 'puts coals on the fire, meal in the barrel, flour in the tab, money in the purse, clothes on the children, vigor in the body, intelligence in the brain, and spirit in the whole constitution. ' ' The religion of Jesus Christ is a vast remedial system, made up of many mighty forces, and containing, within itself, capacities of adaptation and adjustment to every phase of the world's progress in real virtue, and to every necessity of individual life. These mighty forces, are, to some extent, dormant, and they must be awakened into action: and the outlying field around the church must be filled by all the agencies which God has placed in our power. To develop these inner forces, and to cultivate this outer field, is the bounden duty of this age, and the Christian church.' Selected.
