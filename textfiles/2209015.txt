Shakers, N. Y. Second Family. We had a few days in July that made us think the old version expressed the heat best, it seemed as if the very ground would burn up. We have finished haying and trying to get in' the oats and if it will only stop raining long enough, we shall succeed. The Sisters say, if we do not know as much as we should, we do know beans, and how to can them. We are now engaged canning string-beans for sale and home use. The Society have put up several hundred doz. cans; expect to put up several hundred more, before the season is over. We had a pleasant visit on the 18th. ult. with our good friends from Groveland, Elder Alexander Work, Eldress Polly Lee and Sr. Lavina Dutcher. We believe them to be worthy, cross-bearing souls, true followers of Christ and Mother. We have also been privileged to enjoy a visit with our dearly-loved mother, Eldress Ann. We were over-joyed to see her among us as of yore, with her even, inimitable grace of mind and person. She seemed an angel of goodness with her pleasant smile and kindly word for all. Dear precious, Eldress Ann, you know we deeply, truly love you, and it must be a comfort and consolation to you in your declining years to know how much you are loved and honored by those to whom you have always been such a wise counselor and friend. We have all shared of your love and goodness of heart, and may we be worthy children. We thank the dear Sister who wrote the beautiful tribute of love to our mother. We believe it expresses the feelings of all Zion's sons and daughters. Here is an example of practical Christianity. For what end the gospel of Jesus Christ, if not to make us more like the Divine. Let n% so live while on the earth, that we may honor our cause, be a blessing to our Brethren and Sisters, writing in their memory an epitaph, by the doing of kind deeds, for if we do not live so as to merit the blessing of the faithful and consecrated, here, we cannot expect to win it in the world to come.
