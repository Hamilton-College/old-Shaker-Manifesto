LAMENT Impressed ~by a Sister who (prematurely) died at 28. —o— I reached this comma, in the continuity of life, Ere it was noon. I could not longer hold the body to the strife. Hence, left too soon. I had fondly hoped to reach earth life's fruition Full ripe with days; I feel a sense of premature transition To life's second phase. My twenty-eight should be transposed to eightytwo, Soul growth to gain ; My work is left for other hands to do — My earthly claim ; My body poor, depleted— wan imagery of God — Served not the soul. My spirit, striving with this broken rod, Fail'd of life's goal. When all of Nature's laws are rightly understood, And well obeyed ; When life shall culminate in man or womanhood, N( r ills invade ; When the ripe sheaf displays earth's full bequest, With noble deeds; When the developed spirit bids the clay to rest, And from it speeds ; Then, casting back upon a well-till'd field, Full fourscore years; Then will earth's fruitage, ripe, full harvest yield To higher spheres ; Then shall the new earth effect a nobler generation For work in time ; Then the new heavens will hail the transmutation To life divine. I once believed all angels of celestial birth And all divine, My retrospection finds them first on earth, Mortals in time. When first I learned their origin was human, Progressing higher, Then marvel'd I this compromise 'twixt bird and woman, Which men admire. I long to see inherent laws redeem'd from degradation, Bodies symmetrical and sound, And moral justice to abound, The intellect with wisdom crown'd, Pure spirits hallowing all around, Proclaiming The Millennium's found—the new creation. Then this depicture will not be in vain, If its portrayal count to human gain; For naught but love's pure wreath can bind The human to the heavenly kind. Elijah Myrick
