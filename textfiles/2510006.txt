MANHOOD. Second Paper. By Edwin P. Sevester. AN, endowed with so many noble faculties, is so grand, so far supe.rior to the brute creation, that his higher spiritual nature allows him to commune with angels, drawing heavenly influences around him, receiving divine inspirations which cause him to aspire after those durable riches which never pass away. M 228 THE MANIFESTO. Our manhood is progressive. Those animals that have the fewest faculties to develop are the first to arrive at maturity. Man, the lord of all created beings, has the longest and most helpless infancy, and it takes him the longest to grow to mature age. The same is true with our faculties. The noblest are the longest in developing. In childhood we manifest sensation, in the youthful period our intellect is developed, in mature age the moral feelings, farther on in manhood the reasoning powers, judgment, religious aspirations, love for the beauty of the soul, dignity of character, nobleness of mind, and the spiritual part of our being is developed. After we have undergone the great change and left this body as a worn out garment, our minds will be still more expanded. There are abstract truths, principles and motives, invisible things, although not seen by the external eye, neither heard by the corporeal ear, nor felt by the material hand, that are yet really true and substantial as the material things around us. To beautify our characters, form good habits, live by just principles, and grow in righteousness and holiness, this is a real and true life, which will prove an everlasting source of enjoyment, Shakers, N.
