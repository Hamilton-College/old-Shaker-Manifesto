THE RIVER OF LIGHT. LOUIS HORTON. ' Though I walk fhrovgh the valley of the shadow of death, 1 will fear no evil, for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.' Psalm, xxiii., 4. I've heard it called by a different name, This river so deep and wide, And voices that over its waters came, Were lost in a whirling tide. 'Twas the Tliver of Death ; and a boatman With sorrow and grief and fear- - [pale. And the worn out theme of an old, old tale, liehearsed 'mid floods of tears. But times have changed and the dark cold Throws off its mantle cf night, [stream From shore to shore like a beautiful dream, Behold a River of Light. And white robed souls in radiant throngs, Across bright waters sail, While shouts of joy and heavenly songs Are borne on the balmy gale. These have walked through the shadowy vale, That spans our River of Light, Singing loud Hozanna's, Hail, all Hail! 0 Land of pure delight. The 'boatman' now is an angel fair, And waits by the 'gates ajar,' To show the pilgrim entering there, Where heavenly mansions are. E- Sornercillc, Mass.
