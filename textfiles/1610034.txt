CHRISTIAN EFFORTS. I am always glad to read or hear of commendable efforts made for Christianity or even morality in the various fields abroad by whatever method the laborers feel called to operate. Would to God there were more ardent effectual workers in the cause of elevating poor humans from degradation, especially from intemperance and the evils and miseries it engenders. I sometimes cry out in spirit, How long, O Lord, how long shall this demon be permitted to exist and bear such sway? ruiningbright intellects, brilliant talents, and making brutes of men! Thank God, there are some self-denying, self-sacrificing Christians,�the salt and savor of the earth,�who are rendering their best efforts to bring about a better state of things. God bless and prosper such efforts. M. E. H., Canterbury, N. H.
