A real Shaker girl's letter Dear Editor :—Enclosed find names and stamps for ' Shaker Child's Prayer' for our little girls. A new prayer is to them a source of great delight, and all they can learn are adopted for their various needs. 'Dear little angels, put a little crumb in a little cup, to feed a little lamb,' is so short that our little Mintie says she ' tan say it six times 'fore I dit up.' We little folks have become very interested in The Shaker, now that we have a 'Grotto' in its territory; and I personally congratulate you in your successful efforts to have a living Shaker to represent the truths we ought to embody in our daily lives. We want our paper, while it enlightens inquirers after our theology, to strengthen the weak; encourage the strong; guide the youth aright; be a solace to the aged; and be a living assistant to our every-day lives. Thanks for remarks on ' Common Error;' and please introduce more prominent points upon etiquette; for I sometimes think that by our reclusiveness we should be led to sanction some things that are really low breeding! Your article ' What shall I do to be a Shaker, No. 1,' I think is the best answer I ever read on the subject—so plain and truthful--unencumbered by the mystification of an endless theology! You probably do not need encouragement from such as your humble correspondent, but my appreciation may not be out of place. Your sister, Amelia J. Calver Mt. Lebanon, April 1
