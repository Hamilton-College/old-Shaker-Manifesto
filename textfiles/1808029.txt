SECRET THOUGHTS. Ella Wheeler Wilcox. I hold it true that thoughts are things Endowed with being, breath and wings, And that we send them forth to fill The world with good results or ill. That which we call our secret thought Speeds to the earth's remotest spot, And leaves its blessing or its woes Like tracks behind it, as it goes. It is God's law. Kemember it In your still chamber as you sit With thoughts you would not dare have known And yet make comrades when alone. These thoughts have life, and they will fly And leave their impress by and by Like some March breeze whose poison breath Breathes into homes its fevered death. And often you have quite forgot Or all outgrown some vanished thought; Into some mind, to make its home A dove, or raven, it will come. Then let your secret thoughts be fairï¿½ They have a vital part, ad share In shaping worlds and moulding fate ; God's system is so intricate. Truth.
