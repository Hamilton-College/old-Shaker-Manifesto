RETROSPECTION. [Contributed by Louisa Greene.] Day is done, and the dusky night Is brooding oer hill and lea, Ten thousand stars are in the sky, Ten thousand in the sea. As the shades of twilight deepen, . And the night steals slowly on, I am borne on memory's pinion To the day forever gone. Sad memories of by-gone years Come thronging thick and fast, Familiar faces,ï¿½those I loved, Start from the shadowy past, And every little joy I knew In childhood's happy day, Seems like a thing of yesterday, Though long since passed away. Yet 'tis not all of life to live, Not all of death to die. Death opes the mystic gates of life, Blest immortality. Hope is the star that guides us on In all life's joys and woes, And hope and faith will point us still To Heaven, at its close. Selected.
