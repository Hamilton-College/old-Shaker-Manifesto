Sabbathday Lake, Me. April, 1895. March has gone. With us it was a cold disagreeable month, and on leaving roared like a lion. It came in like a lamb but the lamb was soon frozen. Now April comes with its sunshine and showers, making muddy roads and walks. Soon the waters of the lake will yield to the sun's hot rays and come forth sparkling as brightly as ever. These are fine days for the maple trees which are giving us an abundant harvest. It is a pleasure to the young people to be out early, these bright mornings, gathering the sap which is brought to the evaporator in barrels. Our dearly loved Eldress Lizzie Noyes oversees the whole business. The hum of the wood-saw has been heard for the past fortnight. That job is over now. Our portable engine has done its part of the work very faithfully. The banks of the mill pond are piled with logs waiting to be sawed into lumber for the Lewiston market. Many a noble tree lies there whose beauty has been destroyed by the woodman's ax. We manage to get along from year to year by united and consecrated efforts, and have not yet thought of migrating to Florida, but Believers can not be separated in spirit, though their homes may be far apart.
