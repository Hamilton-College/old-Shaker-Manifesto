NOTE What is probably the most important pro and con discussion that has ever appeared in print of the great question regarding religious instruction in the public schools is published in this week's issue of Public Opinion, of Washington, 1). C. Cardinal Gibbons openi&gt; the controversy in a most remarkable paper. The other writers are ex-President Hill, of Harvard; Rev. Minot J. Savage, of Boston, and Prof. Win. T. Harris, editor The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. Public Opinion lias long since taken its rank among the great periodicals of America, and lias added another good feature in opening its columns for original discussion of timely topics by leaders of the various lines of thought.
