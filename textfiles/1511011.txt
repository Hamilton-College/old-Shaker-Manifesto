ORDER OF GOD. No. 2. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. ' Touch not mine Anointed and do my prophets no harm.' Psalms cv., 15. We have evidence to believe the Order of God is more perfect in its organization in this day than it ever was in any preceding age of the world, of which we have any knowledge. During the dark ages and even in Christ's first appearing, it was a one-sided thing, because it was all in the male order they only saw in part and prophesied in part, because only a part was revealed in that day ; but in this day of Christ's second appearing, through Mother Ann Lee, the ' urim and thummim, ' light and perfection have come, and that which was in part is done away. Woman is as fully established in the order of God, by divine Wisdom, as was the man. Two of each sex, when the order is full and complete. Thus the spiritual house of God is four square, equally balanced, and on all sides equal. Thus the foundation principles were laid in the first millennial church formed at Mount Lebanon, Col. Co., N. Y. in 1792, of which all other churches of ' like precious faith' were but branches of this. This church has stood almost one hundred years, in tact, without a schism, and stands yet, and is like to withstand the wreck of time ; because it is founded on the Hock of revelation, of Christ's second appearing its principles are divine, and cannot be overthrown. It is built on the divine, and not on the human, i. e. It is built on the divinity of Christ, and not on his humanity. That which is divine is eternal, and abideth forever. Moral reformers will yet be delighted to find in this church a living example, an embodiment, of all their reforms, especially, the ' equality of the sexes,' practically illustrated and thoroughly tested, by long experience, and found to be superior to anything in the natural order. Mother Ann of her self, was not divine, she did not claim to be, but the revelation of Christ through her was divine, and this revelation of Christ's second appearing, which can no longer be questioned, was that which gave her the pre-eminence over all other women. She was the first and only woman of the human race, that was perfectly redeemed from the fall, while in the body. The first born among many Sisters. The Lord's Anointedï¿½pi*oved by many infallible proofs, and testimony of living Witnesses. In the spiritual order of Grod it was necessary, that two of each sex should be appointed, that in the absence of the first, the second might fill the vacancy, that the body might not be left without a head, and the church never be left without a visible lead. Each sex stands first in its own order, and on its own side of the house, except by mutual agreement. If any man or woman undertakes to govern both sides of the house in this day, independent of the established order, it will fail. I have seen this tried, and proved a failure, in every instance, and always will. Why? Because it is built on the human, and not on the divine. And God will not own and bless it. It is building up the elements of the world more than the spiritual order of God. ' Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm, ' was a sacred and divine injunction. Thus the order of God is established in this day of Christ's second appearing, forever more to stand. It is to be perpetuated by a regular line of succession. Noah was the order of God to the ante-diluvians, and as they treated him, so God treated them. So, it will be with the present generation ; if they heed not the warnings given through the order of God in this our day. North Union, Ohio.
