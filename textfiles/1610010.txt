THE HIGHER LIFE. DANIEL FRASER. In the day 'of the restoration of all things' it will be evident that all the dispensations will harmonize and become a unit. We speak of past dispensations ; in reality, no dispensation passes away. Jesus came not to destroy, but to fulfill the Law and the Prophets. It is only the human coloring�the compromises to meet the conditions of the lower life that pass away. The law was weak through the flesh. Hence, the subjects of ' the carnal commandment multiply and replenish;' could not enter the Holy of Holies. The Church of the Resurrection, being as the angels are, they can enter, and abide within the Holy of Holies. Constituting a virgin church having goods in common. Results�No want, no crime. Yielding obedience to Hygienic law ; the results are, no disease ; no untimely deaths. Means to attain the higher life. First. Right every wrong. Second. Come out of the bottomless pit of selfgreed. Third; Give lovingly of the fruits of your toil and care, to sustain upon earth the economy of said life. Resting under the assurance, that goodness is religion, and that to be beneficent, is to be divine. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. If the brain sow not corn it plants thistles.
