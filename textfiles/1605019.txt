From generation to generation, since the day that Abel went out from his home with a slaughtered lamb as an offering to his God, people have been 'ï¿½getting religion.' Whatever else he might have done, that act was an evidence that he had Ci got religion.' Even at the present day religion is obtained, many times, by offerings no less earthly than the one brought forward by the son of Adam. It is not uncommon to hear the subject discussed with about the same interest as one would have in the ordinary affairs of business, and taken up or deferred to suit the convenience of the times. Bible reading, church going and hymn singing have been considered the most propitious avenues through which to reach this peculiar qualification. A formal declaration of some creedal ceremony or belief and the whole work is consummated and religion is obtained. Some persons talk of 'getting religion' as they do of buying and selling cattle. Its value rises and falls, agreeably to the demand. One day in seven is set apart as being essentially necessary for the religious development of the mind, and for the recitation of long, formal prayers. Jt is the display of churchal attainments rather than an incentive to the work of righteousness. The Rev. Samuel Jones, the southern evangelist, does not hesitate to inform the people that some of the worst enemies of God's word are tho?e who occupy the pulpit, and in that assertion, as broad and as uncalled for as it may be, it has a marked agreement with one of the scathing rebukes made by Jesus. ' Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men. You neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering to go in.' Matt. xxiii : 13. This style of religion may do for one class of people, but it does not impress the mind with a very high, moral tone. Its tendency is strongly toward the world, in which selfishness occupies a prominent place. It was not so with Jesus. He was enthusiastic on the subject of the kingdom of God. To him this was the kingdom of righteousness. A place where people did that which was right. He prayed that the kingdom might be with his disciples, even within them. They had thought of it as a distant city into which the Christian will march to the music of the harp, and to the waving of palm branches. Jesus gave his disciples to understand that while they were moving toward the kingdom of God that kingdom was coming toward them, and finally the two would be one, and that union, was religion. A major general of the army may may, TERMS. have religion even while ordering the destruction of life and property anc while making thousands of his fellow men to endure a miserable existence. He is a member of the church militant and its prayers and psalms have securec him a place in that kingdom over which they may have a dominant right. But this would hardly stand by the side of that doctrine which we have learned from the Teacher. What does he say ? 'Blessed are the pep.cemakers for they shall be called the children of God, ' and by this it would seem that the children of God or those who accepted the religion of Jesus were to be known as peacemakers. All the acts of his life gave abundant evidence that the establishment of this divine quality of the mind was an essential feature of his sacred mission. With Jesus, the getting of religion was to get into a merciful frame of mind. The selfish, dominant spirit that so thoroughly ruled in the hearts of the children of this world, could not be permitted to enter within the boundaries of the kingdom of God. Jesus was not only generous to an especial friend, but he gave his whole life for the benefit and spiritual blessing of his fellow man, those who would be his disciples must follow his example. In his discourse the Gentiles were brought forward as the representatives of a selfish class who speculated and contended about their articles of diet and no less about the wearing of their garments. Religion with them consisted largely in the observance of some rules that had reference to food or clothing. The religion of Jesus moved in another channel and observing the strong inclination that occupied the minds of his disciples on the subject, he very wisely remarked, ''Be not over anxious about what you shall eat, or what you shall drink or about the garments that you shall wear. It is better to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.' Learn to do right, agreeably to the best light that God gives and the religion of Jesus, or the heavenly home will not be far from us. Jesus manifested very little interest in the religious ceremonies of the Jewish Church. He could heal the sick on the Sabbath or provide food for the sustenance of his disciples, and considered himself as doing quite right, although the Pharisees strongly objected. With them, Sunday was holy. Fires were not to be built, and of course no food could be cooked, and if a person was so unfortunate as to be taken sic-k on the Sabba'h, the physician was not to be called till the next day. Jesus made religion a practical righteousness. The welfare of man stood first. If he was sick, he should be healed. If he was hungry, he should provide food. If he was cold, he should build a fire. All this was a reasonable service for the protection of the body, and the maintenance of health, that the owner might be better able to govern the influences and passions of his own mind and then have more of humanity with which to serve God.
