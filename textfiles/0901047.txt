SOWING CLOVER IN WINTER Clover seed may be sown upon the snow, or when a frost has hardened the surface. One great advantage of sowing upon the snow is that a very even spread can be made, as the seed can readily be seen, and the foot marks remain as a guide for the next breadth sowed. The most inexperienced need make no lapse or misses. A good quantity of seed for each cast is as much as can be held between the first and second fingers and the thumb. Walking at an easy gait, this will use up about eight quarts of seed per acre. If the wind is blowing, walk so that it blows across the path ; the effect is then equal both going and returning ; but it is not so if it blows first on the face and then on the back.
