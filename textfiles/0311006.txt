Opium seems to be the continuing and increasing curse of China... Opium seems to be the continuing and increasing curse of China. Dr. Legge, who has been traveling from Peking to Shanghai, with a view to ascertaining the condition of the people of Northern China, makes the melancholy report that the growth of opium in that country is increasing at a prodigious rate, to the exclusion of the cultivation of food. In one district large tracts of land were entirely covered with poppies, and the doctor was in- formed that the cultivation only began last year. Some land will yield a profit by opium greater than that of wheat by two, three, four and even six times. The Chinese peasant's love of the debasing drug is attributed to his being '' tied down to the soil of his own district and shut out from intercourse with his fellows by unjust regulations of every sort.'
