Beloved Elder Henry:--We wish personally to thank you... Sonyea, N. Y. Nov. 1892. Beloved Elder Henry:We wish personally to thank you for the excellent appearance of our 'Manifesto,' and hope you may be sustained in your labors. The last number, when I opened it and read articles from our beloved Elder Abraham Perkins and Elder Oliver Hampton, I felt that I was in the presence of the 'redeemed from among men,' and was thankful to be counted worthy to sit at the feet of such purified souls and receive their ministration. Your Brother, H. DeGraw.
