HE LEADETH ME. Ada S. Cummings. Where Thou leadest, I will follow, 'Neath the shadow of thy love I would linger, while I journey To that land, a home above. I will follow where Thou leadest Even in the vale of tears, Where the smile, the joy and sorrow Mingle with the hopes and fears. Where TIiou leadest, I will follow, Though the path may tangled be; I will travel in Thy footsteps, Where Thou ever leadest me. Though temptation may assail me, Fellow travelers are but few; Yet with courage I'll press forward, Keeping Thee my guide in view. Though Thou leadest me at even, Through the dark'ning shades of night; I'll not let my heart grow weaker, But witli Thee await the light; For the sun of truth and gladness Shining from Thy face divine Will illume the darksome valley, As the rays of morning shine. If Thou leadest on the mountain, Where the winds are cold and drear; 'Tis within Thy path of safety, I will go without a fear; Knowing that Thy steps are leading Where the purest waters flow, Still my voice in accents echo:ï¿½ 'Where Thou leadest I will go!' Trusting in Thy saving guidance, I shall safely anchored be; Where no wind, no storm, nor tempest Can default my faith in Thee, Thee I'll follow ever, ever, Till I've reached the shining goal, Till I've found the port called Heaven, Home immortal of the soul. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
