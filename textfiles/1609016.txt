There are very few... 'There are very few churches that will strike your name off if you do go to worship with tobacco in your mouth, and few will condemn you if you drink whiskey for your stomach's sake, and none will condemn you if you follow the fashions of the harlot of the streets of Paris. But thank God, He has raised an army t&amp; fight for deliverance from all that is worldly, sensual and devilish. We hate humbug in religion as in everything else. '�Col. Hunter in The War Cry. [Good and strong words in the cause of practical righteousness cannot otherwise than produce a good effect upon men's minds. ' Every plant which my Heavenly Father hath not planted must be rooted up, ' and certainly those plants that are worldy and sensual and devilish, must all be destroyed before an entrance can be obtained into the Holy City.�Ed. ]
