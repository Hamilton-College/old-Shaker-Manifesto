A CURE FOR SLANDER The following very homely but singularly instructive lesson is by Philip Neri: A lady presented herself one day to him, accusing herself of being given to slander. ' Do you frequently fall into this fault?' inquired Neri. ' Yes, father, very often,' replied the penitent. ' My dear child,' said Neri, 'your fault is great, but the mercy of God is still greater; for your penance do as follows: Go to the nearest market, purchase a chicken just killed and still covered with feathers ; you will then walk to a certain distance, plucking the bird as you go along; your walk finished, you will return to me.' Great was the astonishment of the lady in receiving so strange a penance ; but silencing all human reasoning, she replied : 'I will obe}7, father; I will obey.' Accordingly she repaired to the market, bought the fowl, and set out on her journey,*pluckijug it as she went along, as she had been ordered. In a short time she returned, anxious to tell of her exactness in accomplishing her penance, and desirous to receive some explanation of one so singular. THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. 131 ' Ah ! ' said Neri, ' you have been very faithful to the first part of my orders ; now to the second part and you will be cured. Retrace your steps; pass through all the places you have already traversed, and gather up, one by one, all the feathers you have scattered.' ' But, father,' exclaimed the poor woman, 'that is impossible. I cast the feathers carelessly on every side ; the wind carried them in different directions ; how can I now recover them ? ' ' Well, my child,' replied Neri, ' so it is with your words of slander — like the feathers which the wind has scattered, they have been wafted in many directions — call them back now if you can. Go and sin no more.' History does not tell if the lady was converted; but we have the lesson, and all should profit by it.
