SHEPHERD'S FOLD Anna White. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Over the land, over the sea Hasten O heavenly dove! 2. Come to a land where waters flow Clear as the crystal sea, 3. Thus shall the wilderness rejoice, Bud and blossom anew, Bear good tidings of liberty, And scatter the seeds of love; Come to a haven of joy below, From sorrows of earth be free; Hills and valleys shall lift their voice, In anthems of praises due; Unto the heavy laden say, Enter a haven of rest, Come to the resurrection morn, Dawn of a glorious day, Righteousness, as a fruitful field, Stay to gladden the earth, Cast the garments of sin away, And with the pure be blest. Peace doth flow to the weary worn, And love doth light the way. War no more will a harvest yield, Or fill the land with dearth. O list to music soft and sweet, From harps the angels hold, While heavenly breezes waft Onward to the shepherd's fold.
