Our Absent Sisters;--You may be a little surprised to learn... East Canterbury, N. H. June 27, 1897. Our Absent Sisters ;ï¿½You may be a little surprised to learn that this letter was written by one who gives you so little attention at home, and yet you may have heard that distance lends enchantment, and it may prove so in this case. At an earlier date we visited Enfield where we formed new friendships and learned new lessons and made new resolves. May you do no less. Our pilgrimage through this life is not upon flowery beds of ease, neither are we obliged to wear a crown of thorns. If the thorns are our choice, we must submit to the pain they cause us. You all, doubtless, admire the rose, but did you ever examine it closely in the different stages of its growth? As you read this do you not call to mind the little rosebush all covered with thorns up to the very buds. What do you find ? A bush without beauty, without fragrance, but not without form. All that is lovely, all that is fragrant, all that is beautiful is developing within. Here then is the lesson. From a rough exterior, you can develop a well ordered and symmetrical character. From the rough ledges of granite and of marble have been wrought the most wonderful pkces of mechanism and art that the human mind is able to comprehend. Is this grand power of fashioning and forming to be left to be displayed on inanimate things ? Is there not a possibility that the good things of God's Kingdom can be realized and perfected to the honor and glory of a virtuous cause by those who have shared the blessing of spiritual guidance for so many years ? As you walk over the consecrated grounds in the Community at Enfield, think of those devoted souls who have given their lives for the upbuilding of the Zion of our God, in that beautiful valley. I have nothing very sentimental to say and I need not tell you that my only anxiety is that you walk worthy of the vocation vrhereunto you are called. Be an honor to yourselves and to the Society that you represent, and whatever you may chance to see even if it be of a worldly character, that may attract your attention from the path of duty, remember, that beneath every rose however beautiful, there is always a thorn. Your brother, Wm. W. Briggs.
