LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS. ANNA P. CARLL. How blessed, sounds to us, the sacred words ' Lift up your hearts ! ' What everlasting comfort they afford What hopes impart. For it is mete and right that so we should, [good. Give thanks to God the source of truth and Lift up your voice and sing altho' the strain Be sad and low. Your song will melody and power gain As on you go. Lift up your hands and do with cheerful mind Your daily task. The blessedness of giving you shall find To those who ask And thus you shall lay up a goodly store To be returned an hundred fold and more. Lift up your soul in never ceasing prayer For heavenly grace. So shall the light of peace beyond compare, Shine in your face. Your many pray'rs in secret said, Will bring you strength and never failing aid. Arise and go ye forth to do his will. Be strong and true. Continue thou in all good work until He calls for you. Then as you lay your earthly burdens by, You shall with Him find rest eternally.
