THINGS TO BE REMEMBERED Remember that tea should not be infused for more than seven minutes. Have the water boiling and use a teaspoonful of tea for each person and one over. Put the tea in the pot and pour the boiling water over it, and let it stand for seven minutes. If it is allowed to stand the tannin in the tea is drawn out and dyspepsia is the result. Remember that mirrors should never be hung where the sun shines directly upon them. They soon look misty, grow rough or granulated, and no longer give back a correct picture. The amalgam or union of tinfoil with mercury, which is spread on glass to form a looking-glass, is easily ruined by the direct, continuous exposure to the solar rays. Remember that lemons can be kept sweet and fresh lor months by putting them into a tight, clean cask or jar, and covering with cold water. The water must be changed as often as once every other day, and the cask kept in a cool place. Remember that a teaspoonful of black pepper will prevent grey or buff linen from spotting, if stirred into the first water in which they are washed. It will also prevent the colors running, when washing black or colored cambrics or muslins, and the water is not injured by it, but just as soft as before the pepper was put in. Remember that one can have the hands in soapsuds with soft soap without injury to the skin if the hands are dipped in vinegar or lemon juice immediately after. The acids destroy the corrosive effects of the alkali and make the hands soft and white. Indian meal and vinegar or lemon juice used on hands when roughed by cold or labor, will heal and soften them. Rub the hands in this; then wash off throughly and rub in glycerine. Those who suffer from chapped hands will find this comforting.â€”Maiden Mirror.
