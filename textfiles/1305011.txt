THE SPIRIT OF BLESSING. WILLIAM WILSON. It is to those who have transmitted to us the greatest of all blessings ; the ever lasting gospel; the light of Christ's Kingdom ; the dawn of a new day, that we iu the fullness of our souls express a thankful and a grateful remembrance. We have been shown the manifestation of the Coming of Christ, the object of his mission into this world, and the manner in which his testimony was received by those unto whom he was sent. We have been shown the magnitude of this mission of Christ and have learned why a manifestation of the same spirit should appear the second time through the medium of a woman. These are true principles, the light of man, which is life everlasting. The spirit of Christ appeared to man through the man Jesus. To make complete that Almighty Arm by which all creation is sustained, the same Christ spirit has its second appearance in the person of Ann Lee. Indeed, and the light of this little company with the assistance of your ancestors have laid the foundation for this our gospel home, and the principles by which it is sustained can never fail, nay never. Those who build upon this THE MANIFESTO. 109 foundation are sure, they have built on the everlasting rock, the Rock of Ages. In this day of great blessings we ask of the fathers and mothers whose tender care and prayerful spirit are always over us, to remember us in the trials of life, that we may share the protection of our Heavenly Father.
