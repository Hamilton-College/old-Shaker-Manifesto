Lice on Poultry The best as well as easiest remedy for getting rid of vermin on fowls, and keeping them clear afterward, is first to clean and whitewash the roosts, adding a liberal supply of salt to the wash. Then have the entrance to and from these roosts sufficiently small, that a sponge saturated with kerosene oil, hung over the entrance would come in contact with the back of each fowl every time it goes in or out. We know this to be a most excellent remedy. Supply the sponge with oil once a week. Hens with chickens, not before hatching, should be liberally smeared with a mixture of lard oil and kerosene, immediately on leaving the nest. The chicks will show a rapid and lealthy growth, being free from gapes and pip.
