THOUGHTS FOR TO-DAY Different Lives In a letter of a correspondent of the Christian, , London, Eng., writing from Cannes, said: 'A skeptical young German said, ' Plead for your Christianity as eloquently as you like, but till I see your professing Christians live different lives frona other men, I cannot believe in Christianity.'' It is indeed the test by which every religion must rise, or fall. Blessed am de dead 'I hab hearn,' said a colored preacher, while enforcing the duty of liberality on his congregation, ' ob many a church what hab died bekase it gib away too little for de Lord, but I neber hearn ob any what died bekase it gib away too much. Ef any ob you know ob any church ob dis kind, what died from liberality, jes tell me where it is, and I will make a pilgrimage to it, and by de soft light ob de pale moon I will crawl upon its mosscovered roof, and write upon its topmost shingle : ' Blessed am de dead what die in the Lord.''
