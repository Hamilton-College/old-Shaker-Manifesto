A SENSIBLE GOVERNOR Governor Roberts of Texas, the last to respond to the request to have a day of thanksgiving and jubilee for the recovery of the President, sends the following: 'My failure to answer you favorably is not on account of any want of sympathy for thu President, but because I do not deem it consistent with my position as Governor to issue proclamation directing religious services where the Church and State ought to bis KEPT SEPARATE IN THEIR FUNCTIONS. I doubt not that the people of Texas havu as strongly wished and will as devoutly pray for the recovery of the President as any people in the United States.'
