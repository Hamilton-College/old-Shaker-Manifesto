'Home is where there are friends to lova-us.' This simple sentence seems to peep out from between the lines of Home Notes on every page, and as we count over the several Homes of our Communal relation, we rejoice that there are so many strong pillars supporting our household. If in each of these homes every member is striving to the best of his ability to contribute time and talents for the general good, no failure need be feared. A few brave, earnest, unselfish workers, are worth a thousand whose only aim is to sap the good from Society, and contribute nothing to its material, mental or spiritual support. I like the little story which represents a timid woman at heaven's gate, who, when asked of St. Peter what her credentials were, by which she was entitled to enter, could only reply in the negative to all inquiries regarding Church work, foreign missions, almsgiving, etc. St. Peter nearly discouraged, at last said: 'Well, my good woman, was there no one to give you a recommend.' 'O,' she sighed, while tears filled her eyes, 'I have never needed a recommend, let me return, for I was loved at home.' At these words the gates flew open as if by magic, and orders were given to place her among the fairest of the many mansions, for, said Peter, 'those who are loved best by those nearest them, need no transformation to complete their angel-hood.' At a recent Sabbath evening gathering on the lawn at the North family, Elder Daniel Offord urged upon all the necessity of so caring for our premises, that no corner, however remote, need fear inspection. This clarion call should reach every home, for there are none so young nor so feeble, but what might contribute their mite of labor to beautify Zion. An interest in home asks for no stated hours of labor. Strength should be our measure, and this to be used and not abused, lest like the spendthrift, we find our inheritance gone when we most need it. Amelia J. Calver.M Shakers, N. Y.. June, 1893. As we have had an editorial invitation to concentrate, we will try and boil down our contributions. Will our beloved Elder Oliver please tell us how to prepare Okra in using it as a substitute for coffee? To any of the readers of the Manifesto who have never tried it, we will give a very simple method for canning rhubarb. Peel the stalks and cut in pieces one half inch in length, fill the glass sealers as full as it can be pressed in and pour on water until the jar is full so as to exclude the air, and put the cover on tight. It will keep in perfect condition. Thou Lily of the Valley, fair Watervliet, our life's destiny has been cast with thee. In thy prosperity we will always rejoice, and in thy tribulation we will share. We read with pleasure the Home Notes from the dear Brethren and Sisters and the expressions of faith and hope by the faithful ones. May their hearts be encouraged and their hands strengthened to do battle for the truth. Hamilton DcGraw. Second Family. June, 1893. A whiter says, 'No task is well performed by a reluctant hand.' Therefore, if we would succeed in any undertaking, 167 168 THE MANIFESTO. we must go about it with a cheerful heart, whether it be temporal or spiritual. Crops are rather backward and planting a little late on account of cold, wet weather; have had one good crop only, and that is cut worms. They have been extra busy and quite numerous. The past' week has been very warm and good growing weather. We are glad to say that the health of society is much improved. Elder Josiali Barker, who has been a short time at Mt. Lebanon to recuperate, has returned much improved in health, thanks to kind friends at the Mt. We endorse the editorial in June number, that our mission is a home work, a spiritual calling. While others are pulling down, let us build up a home for those sick of sin and sinning. Let us keep our lamps full of oil, as wise virgins. Isaac Anstatt. Shaker Station, Conn. June, 1893. 'Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, and be ye thankful,' says the Apostle. This is an absolute command; therefore we must not despair of peace as if it were unattainable when the command is to let it rule in our hearts. If we follow Christ we shall be partakers of his peace which He gives unto those who walk in his footsteps. Peace reigns with the pure in heart. How many there are who seek in worldly pleasure for that peace which they never find. Denying self brings true peace within. Youth is a fit time for the reception of truth, purity and peace. May the sunshine of peace and honest endeavor brighten all our days. One half of the year is forever gone, let us wisely improve the remainder. Pure air to breathe and pure water to drink, are certainly worth much time and thought, and there is nothing like making an effort to obtain them. Weeds give us an endless fight and the chance is often against us. ****** Rogers and Hubbard's pure ground bone in sacks is just the thing for fowls, it helps to form shell, bone and muscle. As summer and winter layers, Brown Leghorns are excelled by none. There are great possibilities to every farmer, in poultry, for on most all farms the conditions are such as to make poultry profitable if they are managed in a common sense manner. Daniel Orcutt. Canaan, N. Y. June, 1893. So much rain has greatly retarded the season's work; but, notwithstanding, our gardens are looking finely. Peas, onions, tomatoes, and other plants are growing vigorously. Every opportunity for outdoor work has been zealously improved by Sisters as well as Brethren, and it seems as though Nature was putting forth extra exertions to make up loss of time. Our cherry trees, which last year blossomed full and bore nothing, are quite full of green cherries. We hope to secure a good crop this year. The Psalmist said, 'I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread;' and we believe by faithfulness, carefulness, prudence, and economy, we shall have sufficient for all our physical needs. Jesus said, 'Take no thought of what ye shall eat or drink, but seek first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, and all these things shall be given you.' And this we know by experience to be true. All who turn to Zion for the resurrection life of Christ, are freed from all burden concerning temporalities. A beautiful home wherein every need is supplied is already prepared for all such, besides affording abundant opportunities for ethical and spiritual development. Surely we are blessed an hundred fold; and for all these blessings the Lord shall be praised. In our last evening meeting our Elders, Brethren and Sisters, united in sending their kind love to our good Editor for his THE MANIFESTO. 169 consecrated labors. We bless every faithful burden-bearer in Zion. We are deeply interested in the Manifesto, it is a gem we would not willingly part with. Emily Offord. Ayer, Mass. June, 1893. Beloved Elder Heney:ï¿½For some time I have threatened to trouble you with my pen, and fear I should not have put it into execution only that Elder Andrew has asked me to represent Harvard in next issue of Manifesto. Business first, is the motto. Will ask you to be so kind as to send us one dozen of your last issue of Hymns and Songs with bill of the same. We shall also want a few copies of the 'History of the Shakers' when ready. It is a work often called for. Time has hurried us through a long, severe winter, but it has not obliterated from our memory the splendid visit we were privileged to enjoy at your charming home; neither has it robbed us of the great good we received at your hands, nor the pleasure we enjoyed with your people. We are very much interested in the June Manifesto, especially in 'Halt and Consider.' It is a seasonable call and may we heed it. Are we not fulfilling the prophecies uttered in the days of our prosperity, of what would occur if we did not yield obedience to God's laws, as He has often manifested them, in all ages, to his people? In the twenty-eighth chapter of Deut., is recorded the terms of prosperity which holds good to this day. The late season has necessitated an amount of push and tact to accomplish the farm and garden work on time; but it has been ably and heroically done, and we are now ready for harvesting the hay crop, and praying for a blessing upon our labors. Marda M. Bullurd. Canterbury, N. H. A fixed and abiding faith in God and especially as regards his great works in the earth, instead of suggesting a tendency toward inactivity on the part of his people, points in the opposite direction, to that of the greatest activity. The entire strength of the household being fully put forth in obedience to the convicting spirit within every Brother and Sister is the only condition that influences the supply of our needs by God out of his riches in glory by Christ. Those who thus help themselves will be helped. All of us, without exception, have talents and energies entrusted to us as stewards for use, development and improvement. Inactivity means decrease and decay. If the wilderness and the solitary places bloom and blossom as the rose, it will be done when hands are at work and hearts given to God. I can never look around until I have thus looked within the walls of Zion. Our gardens have been highly favored by the weather and are becoming useful as well as beautiful. The early product of the salad kind are finding their way to the kitchens and on to the dining rooms. Our general crops including hay, potatoes and fruits are full of promise. The main water supply is engaging close attention just now, the machinery all round, being in process of reconstruction and improvement. The water supply being thus cut off, we are now using water from the wells in our door-yard, which is being delivered by the faithful and diligent hands of those who find themselves compelled by stress of circumstances, as temporary water-carriers, to man the pumps and grip the pails. It is quite a lively occupation, to pay the oft recurring visits to kitchens, bakery, dairy, and Infirmary. The obsolete hand churning in our dairy has come back again, with its twin brother, water-carrier. Let us hope not to stay. Albert Events. North Family. Weather Record for May, 1893.
