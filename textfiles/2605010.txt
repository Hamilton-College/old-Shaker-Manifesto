Pleasant Hill, Ky. Mar. 1896. I have in mind a sermon by Dr. Talmadge on 'Lost Opportunities.' How many of us can say, we never have passed carelessly by an opportunity where we might have added comfort to some one by a kind word or deed. Our example will live when we are gone. What an amount of good we might do by obeying the precepts of our Lord, Jesus Christ. A kind word, a helping hand may have assisted some fallen discouraged brother or sister on the highway to happiness. We have had a very mild and pleasant winter. The mercury reached zero only twice and in the next twenty-six hours was 16 degrees above. We had four light snow falls, none of which lasted more than four days. The grass is quite green and birds of various kinds are now singing- , We are being blest with all the necessary comforts of life, but regret to say that our ice-house will remain useless the coming season. However we have a never failing spring of pure, cold water, and for this we have many thanks. Nancy L. Rupe.
