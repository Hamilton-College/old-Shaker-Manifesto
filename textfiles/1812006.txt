THE MARCH OF EVENTS. B. F. Bailey. [written for the manifesto.] The cumulative evidence which forces itself upon the attention of thoughtful men as they watch the march of events, in favor of the opinion that we are living in times marked by the eye of prophecy and fulfilling the destiny marked out for the human race, is rapidly convincing many that such is the fact, and that behind the apparently chaotic and spasmodic condition and effort of the various reform and progressive movements of our age, there is both method and wisdom. Each step of humanity, onward and upward, in the past, can be distinctly traced by the evidences of an all-wise plan for their successful accomplishment, and nothing that the world has ever produced in the way of larger liberties, and grander opportunities, for accomplishing the ultimate happiness and prosperity of the race can do aught but attest this truth. Hence, we assume that the present movement toward industrial and social freedom and equity is not only in accordance with the divine plan for the redemption of the race from the curse of riches and poverty, but that it has been foretold in the prophecies of the Bible whose divinely appointed seers were selected to place in the sacred record an outline of events now upon us. That humanity is being stirred to the very depths of reason and passion, preparatory to entering upon a tremendous struggle to restore Liberty and Justice in the State, and righteousness and spirituality in the Church, is as evident, as that honest citizens are being driven from the arena of partisan politics, and honest clergymen from the pulpit in accordance with the injunction to 'Come out of her, my people that ye be not partakers of her sins.' Yes! great Babylon, which is the church and state of our boasted nineteenth century civilization is fallen, and the proclamation which is resounding through the blue vaults of Heaven will soon reach our earth. Well may the crowned heads of Europe hesitate, ere they hurl their standing armies at each others' throats for the 'Time of the end' of all crowned heads is near at hand. Well, also, will it be, if the uncrowned kings of monopolies and corporations here in America take warning, ere they place the last needle upon the camel's back of labor, for a spirit of righteousness is abroad filling the hearts of God's poor children with a sense of outraged justice, and equity too long delayed. Well may our daily press cry out against the rapidly increasing abomination of class distinctions and worldliness in our so-called Christian churches. Says the Boston Herald Jan., !&gt;, under the head of 'Socialism in the house of God.' 'The whole of our Protestantism has the taint of an individualism, which has expressed itself in the cruel and godless distinctions of class, and these distinctions have poisoned the atmosphere in our places of worship.' 'Not one set of people are to blame for this state of things, but all sorts are responsible, and one of the best fruits of the present social discontent in industrial life will be secured if the churches in their inner life can realize in truth and freedom what is meant by the brotherhood of man.' Alas ! Mr. Editor, it is too late for the poison of the asp of mammonism has entered the bosom of our Cleopatra churches and they are doomed. 'For all nations have drunk of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.' The editor of the Herald in his superficial range of vision, has failed to discover that there is something deeper and grander than 'discontent' in the present industrial movement, for there are myriads of God's angels employed, in preparing the 'working classes' so-called for this second coming of the Christprinciples, of socialism, communism, spiritualism, righteousism and all other 'isms' for which Jesus gave his life iu the first century. What the world needs, and is going to have, is a Church without hypocrisy and a State without tyranny, a people without wars and bloodshed and a planet redeemed from sin and disease. Many people may say 'Oh ! well we know the millennium is coming a million years hence,' but pause and reflect, the time when 'old things' are passing away and 'all things' becoming new, is right here for we are daily witnesses of the same, aud the beginning of the end of the worldliness and the selfishness of the present condition of society may not be as far off as many imagine, 'My spirit shall not always strive with- man' and there are many startling events which the nineteenth century will disclose to open the eyes of the blind and compel that attention to the necessity for individual and social reformation which the times demand. We close this article with the relation of a vision. 'And I looked, and be- hold! a vision of the world was before me, every nation and people were rapidly being resolved into three classes with banners. The first came marching with a banner the color of which was black, with red fringe, and letters. On this banner was written as follows ! 'Great is the God of Mammon, the Creator of Monopoly and organized wealth.' In the center was a red skull and cross bones surrounded with the words 'Legal piracy and plunder in the name of Law and Order, Babylon the Great.' These people were dressed in black wearing black masks. And I heard a voice, saying, 'This is the banner under which march all those who believe in the divine right of Kings, the sanctity of Popes and the rights of property, the conservators of society, Church and State, worshipers of Babylon the Great. And I looked, and behold ! the second class marched with a red banner trimmed with black fringe and letters. On this banner was written 'Great is the God of War and Vengeance, Anarchy and destruction of human Law and Government.' In the center was a red torch and bomb surrounded with these words : 'The torch and bomb are legitimate agents in warring upon organ ized wealth.' 'The Law protects the rich and oppresses the poor.' These people were dressed in red and wore red masks. And again I heard a voice saying : 'Under this banner march all those who smarting from a sense of wrong and injustice organize to destroy the present fabric of society and government, the destroyers. And I looked again, and behold ! the third class marched with a white banner trimmed with golden fringe and golden letters. And I heard a chorus of angel voices singing, 'Behold ! we bring you good tidings of great joy, the annunciation of the second coming of the principle Christ, and beginning of the millennial era, the New Jerusalem descending out of Heaven adorned as a bride for her husband.' On this banner was written : 'Behold ! what saith the God of peace and righteousness! proclaim the Social Republics and the United States of the World.' In the center of this banner was a golden cross and crown with the words 'No Cross, no Crown.' Surrounding these emblems and words was written : 'The Divine Community of the Sons and Daughters of God.' 'Socialism and spiritualism, are the two witnesses against Great Babylon the modern Church and State.' These people were dressed in white and their uncovered faces shone like the sun and their peace and happiness was supreme. And once again I heard a voice saying ; 'Under this banner march the lovers of peace, justice and fraternity. The Builders.' ï¿½ 'And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell! and great Babylon came in remembrauce before God to give unto her the cup of the vvint of the fierceness of his wrath.' Rev. xvi., 19. Cambridgeport, Mass.
