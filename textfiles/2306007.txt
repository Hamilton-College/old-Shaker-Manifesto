A KIND WORD. Sabrina Whitmore. Kind words cost little, but they convey much to those to whom they are spoken. Some loving words have been uttered which have lived in the heart through years, finally bearing fruit of joy and hope, to the consolation and reward of the speaker, as of the one addressed. As 'bread cast upon the waters,' they 'return to us after many days,' bringing blessing and peace in their wake. Life is short at the longest; then let us speak kindly to one another. We all have burdens and worries, which try the heart and cloud the brow, but let not our words betray the sorrow to those we love. Christ calls us to 'Feed his lambs' with love, that we may save them to his heavenly fold ; then let us wisely hide all unloving influences fiom the knowledge of those near to us who demand at our hands the bread and water of life, and let us administer to them those cheering, vitalizing words of blessing, encouragement and kindness, which are but the fruits of a thought in due season. One writer presents a similar thought in these impressive words :� 'Speak kindly in the morning, it lightens the cares of the day, and makes the household and all its affair move along smoothly. Speak kindly at night, for it may be that before dawn, some loved one may finish his space of life for this world, and it will be too late to ask forgiveness,'�a good lesson for the readers of our dear Manifesto, as for all.
