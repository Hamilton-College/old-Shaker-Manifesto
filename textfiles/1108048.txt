ICES It is a very customary thing to eat ices after dinner ; those whose digestion is not strong should never touch ices, and should avoid them most determinedly. How ever hot the weather may be, a too sudden cooling process injures a weak digestion, and creates a peculiar feeling of weight in the region of the stomach. Ices do not encourage the flow of the gastric juice, but discourage it, and where this flow is already weak it must not be diminished. A great wrong is committed by the constant consumption of iced and very cold beverages in hot weather; instead of really cooling, the reaction creates an irritation which almost amounts to inflammation of the walls of the stomach, and does not allow the natural flow of the secretion, which is necessary for perfect digestion. It is necessary to warn those who suffer from a weakened digestion against very cold foods or drinks, because these bring about a peculiar suffering and diminished vilality. The temperature of the stomach has to be maintained, and any sudden chill is fatal to it.
