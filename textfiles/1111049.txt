Time TIME. In the great square of a city, dreamily, a figure stands. With the water dimly flowing through its eyes and lips and hands, And the throngs that pass and ponder, tha weird masterpiece sublime Little think it is the picture of the solemn lapse of Time; Of the thoughtless lapse of Time, With its melancholy music and its- sad heart-broken rhyme. Oozing, trickling, bubbling, gleaming, Laughing, weeping, sobbing, streaming, Wailing, murmuring, sighing, dreaming, Flowing, flowing on. So, stand we that fountained statue, God, great masterpiece of art, And the lapse of time is flowing on thro' each oblivious heart; Seconds, minutes, meeting, fleeing into days, and months and years, Swell the rapids of the ages till at last Time disappears, With its flood of hopes and fears, Through life's dimly-lighted valley, thro' the valley of our tears. Tinkling, plashing, rippling, sleeping, Bounding, sparkling, dancing, leaping, Foaming, billowing, tumbling.sweeping, Gliding, gliding on. A Princetonian. A Princetonian
