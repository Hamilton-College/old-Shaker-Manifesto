WHAT TO DO WITH A BAD TEMPER Starve it; give it nothing to feed on. When something tempts jou to grow angry, do not yield to the temptation. It may for a minute or two be difficult to control yourself, but try it. Foi-ce yourself to do nothing, to say nothing, and the rising temper will be obliged to go down because it has nothing to hold it up. What is gained by yielding to temper? For a moment there is a feeling of relief, but soon comes a sense of sorrow and shame, with a wish that the temper had been controlled. Friends are separated by a bad temper, trouble is caused by it, and pain is given to others as well as to self. The pain, too, often lasts for days, even yearsï¿½sometimes for life. An outburst of temper is like the bursting of a steam boiler; it is impossible to tell beforehand what will be the result. The evil done may never be remedied. Starve your temper. It is not worth keeping alive. Let it die. Presbyterian Banner.
