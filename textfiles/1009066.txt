Iron rust , it is said, may be removed by tying a little cream of tartar in the stained spot before putting the cloth to boil. If this does not succeed, thicken lemon juice with equal parts of salt and starch, add some soft soap, apply the mixture to the cloth, and lay it in the hot sun. Renew the application several times.
