Shaker Village, Mer. County, N. H. Dear Sister S. ;â€”I shall be very happy while I am writing to you. I would like you to please answer this letter. I have a good deal to do today. I am going to meeting, and I am going to study my Scripture lesson. I love the Sabbath day. I mean to be a good, obedient girl. I kindly thank you for taking care of me. I have been to meeting and it was very nice. I did not speak, but I wish I .had. What should you think to have a little girl eight years old speak in meeting? Shall I tell you I have just looked at the Time Table? I am going to have a nice time tomorrow if I am a good girl. My teacher says so. I hope I will. I shall tell you all about it sometime. Most all of the girls are writing today. I am sorry I did not help you wash the dishes this morning, I will next time, so good bye. From your little girl, L. D.
