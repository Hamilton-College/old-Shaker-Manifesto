Although it has been but a few days since the mercury sank to lodegrees below zero, still we know that 'Spring is somewhere in the land For we hear the bluebirds sing,' and we wish, if we dare not hope, that our cold weather which has come to us in such 'huge lumps' during the past two months, has spent itself. Nevertheless we shall not mind if there is 'more to follow' as we dare not trust an early spring in these uncertain latitudes. We best like the close covering of winter; until it is ready to make its final bow. Since our last notes we have been somewhat afflicted with an epidemic, borne to us either by ill winds or defective drains. If by the former we must study to keep the blood so pure, that the seeds of disease may not germinate in the system. If by the latter we should remember, that 'God is the safety of his people, but we tempt Providence, if we do not use the necessary means for our preservation.' Still in every evil there is a good, and when affliction comes we learn the real worth of true friends, whose religion has banished all thought of self, and whose loving hearts speak of the angel within. Our loved Ministry left Lebanon, the 7th inst., for Watervliet, N. Y; and since the Bishopric of Enfield, Conn., and Hancock THE MANIFESTO. 91 Mass., is added to their care, we know that the snows will melt, and the blossoms fall, ere they return permanently to their central home. We miss their loving ministrations, but strengthened by the good received, we ask the blessings of heaven to supply the fountain from which so many draw. Our dear mother Eldress Ann is still permitted to be one of earth's angels, active and happy as ever; and we wonder as we cling to her with tender affection, if these filial cords have not an influence to hold her still with us. Brother Frederic Sizer, now released from his many years of burden, is another blessing we hold and prize. A good brother remarked this morning, 'I wonder if when I am eighty-seven, I shall be moving about as rapidly as brother Frederic.' We do not like to feel that our blessings are like birds of gay plumage, best seen when flying away. We intend to prize them while they are ours, and thus enhance their present and future value. Amelia J. Calver. Center Family. Mar. 1894. Writing for The Manifesto seems to be kept up with as much interest and zeal by our Brethren and Sisters of different Societies, as in former years. The weather for a few days past has been remarkably good for March. Our Brethren are very busy sawing, splitting and storing wood for future use. Our dairy is in a splendid condition. We have at this place some of the best Jersey and Guernsey cows in the village, a fact of which we are justly proud. Our dairy sister, Florinda Sears, also understands her part to perfection. Some of our Sisters are doing a little sale-work, trying to make a few 'mighty dollars.' Our school will soon close, we are sorry to say, as school is the means of keeping the children out of mischief as well as fitting them for the future battles of life. . . . . Esther Marion Scott. North. Family. Mar. 1894. We have had a spell of spring-like weather for a week past. Have taken full advantage of it trimming fruit trees and preparing for spring work. We are ready to plant some 137 pear and 24 plum trees, 150 currant and 750 raspberry sets when the land is ready to plow. They were secured last fall and buried in the earth. We bought them, thinking we were more likely to get what we wanted and of better stock than by ordering in the spring when nurserymen are usually pushed. Fruit raising is the most agreeable and profitable part of our business. We are aiming to develop and improve this branch. The future is with the fruit grower. More fruit and fewer animals. This is in the line of physical and moral evolution. It has been said that he who plants a tree is a benefactor to his race. We are under a deep debt of gratitude to those who have gone before us for the legacies of well stocked and fruitful orchards bequeathed to us. We are under obligations to do our part for those who will follow us. 'Seed time and harvest shall never fail.' Now is the time to plant and to sow. Conditions look gloomy, but prospects will brighten, and they who have prepared the ground and put in the good seed will reap the harvest. As in the physical, so in the spiritual, sow with a broad and liberal hand; never doubting. Be encouraged, beloved companions, the hearts of the people are stirred. Gospel testimonies were never listened to with more respect and appreciation than at the present time. The 'old heavens and the old earth are passing away.' Tiie people are anxiously listening for the heralds of the new. The article sent by us to the Congress of Keligions is included in the official report of the proceedings of that body just issued. Walter S. Shepherd. Watervliet, N. Y. Second Family. Mar. 1894. We have the past month realized that the weather, like humanity, is very changeable and prone to go to extremes. The thermometer ranging from 60 above to 18 and 20 below zero. We have had some sleighing the past month and we have improved it to secure our fire wood. La Grippe has afflicted many, the North Family having an extra portion. WThen I realize how frail poor humanity is, and how uncertain is life, I am reminded of the words of the poet,�'Why should the spirit of mortal be proud?' The writer enjoyed a short but pleasant visit at Enfield, N. H. Also made a call at Harvard, and would return kind thanks to all for blessings received, both temporal and spiritual. Isaac Anstatt. North Family. Mar. 1894. Aside from the Manifesto, no periodical coming to our table is read with more pleasure than the 'World's Advance Thought and Universal Republic,' published by Lucy A. Mallory, Portland, Ore. It is brimful of sound testimonies that are needed to awaken the consciences of men and women and bring them to a realization of what is necessary to lift from human society the incubus that is hanging like a death pall over our nineteenth century civilization. We have perused with pleasure the report of the proceedings of the 'World's Congress of Religions,' and it brings joy to our spirit to know that ministering angels are at work with humanity and that the divine Brother and Sisterhood of the race is a possibility. An essay was delivered by Frances E. Willard, on 'Social Purity,' which is the testimony of eternal truth and it has gone forth into the world bringing them to judgment in the natural order and Believers can send forth a fervent prayer that the testimony may be sustained as it will prepare them for the higher life. Besides our Society meetings and singing meetings we have Saturday evening meetings and Sabbath evening singing schools for our own family. It keeps an interest awakened on spiritual and social subjects which can not fail to be beneficial. By the time these notes appear, your humble contributor will be actively engaged, as far as the weather will permit, in the occupation of preparing the family garden, and our earnest prayer is that all of our Brethren and Sisters may have a prosperous year and that the tillers of the soil may have occasion to rejoice in the bountiful harvest they will reap. Hamilton DeOraw. West Pittsfield Mar. 1894. Oue present environments are mud and water. March took his temporary position as chief ruler, in a most bland and pleasing manner. Hope he may continue in this agreeable mood and display none of his capricious habits. The sun's golden rays, and the mild breezes that now fan the earth are fast diminishing the once lofty banks of snow. Should the present fine weather continue, Br. Charles Prescott, the racy writer, may soon be favored with an opportunity of resuming his rather forced occupation of tilling the soil. As mutation however is stamped on all things terrestrial, we know that changes are inevitable and must be met. A blizzard or cyclone may be next in order. What a happy change might ensue were a cyclone, or some other effective agency, to sweep from this broad country of ours, the oppression, wrong and consequent suffering and misery which exists and are daily increasing�-and this in a land of boasted civilization and liberty. Our loved friends of Mt Lebanon and Canaan who wisely embraced the advanta-,, ges presented to enjoy pleasant sleigh-rides took the opportunity on some of these occasions to give us a call which was highly appreciated. Sisters Emeline Hart THE MANIFESTO. and Eliza J. Aiken of Canterbury, N. H., who tarried with us over Sunday a short time ago, were messengers of hope, love and cheer and we deeply regretted that their stay could not have been longer. Our family responded to the call from the St. Vincent De Paul Society of Pittsfield, by sending a large amount of clothing to be distributed among the needy suffering ones, also sent to the little ones of Tennessee who are unprovided with mental food, a well filled barrel of papers, magazines, books, etc. Our little folks, whose sympathetic hearts were stirred with pity, generously donated many of their valued toy treasures, some of them being useful as well as ornamental. Julia L. Sweet. Shaker Station, Conn. Mar. 1894. We are counseled to make our calling and election sure. Not only to be called but to be Christians. The labor is great and unceasing, but the reward is also great. The requirements for the work are to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit, which is peace, purity, meekness, love, and other virtues. Those who are true cross-bearers have the assurance that 'neither things present nor things to come shall separate them from the love of God.' We should let the sunshine of peace, virtue, and earnest endeavor brighten all our days. Our spiritual atmosphere must be very cold when we can not find sunshine anywhere. It is well to pray but better still to watch. That is our work. Are we in our' duty? Let us do our best. The Manifesto is pure reading. Let every one who reads this number do something to broaden its field of usefulness. 'The first newspaper printed in England was in 1622. The first newspaper printed in the United States was the Boston News Letter, issued in 1704. The smallest newspaper in the world is said to be 'The Little Standard,' published at Torquay, England. It is but three inches square.' 'The greatest wall in the world is the Chinese wall; 1,250 miles long, 25 ft. thick at the base, and 20 ft. high.' ******* We should breed the best fowls to the best and the flock will be improved. A larger profit is made from hens in summer than in winter. Where a free range is open to the hens, upon which insects, grass, seeds, young weeds, and an abundance of gritty material may be easily found in summer, there should be but very small cost. Daniel Orcutt. South Family. Mar. 1894. Makch has opened quite warm and spring-like but the old adage will probably prove true and the lamb will change to a lion before long, but we can enjoy the warm sunshiny days so long as they last. Now the tree pruner, apple and peach, puts in his best endeavors. It is the proper thing in this day to spray fruit trees to destroy blight and noxious insects. In a few years it will be as common to spray fruit trees as it is now to eat the fruit. We could send some recipes, for spraying fruit trees if acceptable, but we will report the result of spraying in the fall if considered desirable. Our wood is all housed ready for use. We have been dealing off old, worthless apple trees and think by taking better care of the thrifty orchards we can have more and better fruit from a smaller area than before on a larger and neglected area. Our orcharding will be plowed and fertilized with ground bone and muriate of potash. It is considered advisable to avoid nitrogenous fertilizers on most fruit orchards, especially a peach orchard, unless you want wood and no fruit, and keep the shoots cut back. These last two items are considered the secret of peach raising. Our dairy has done fairly well this winter, and we are encouraged to renew our efforts. The modern dairy Shibboleth is 'Babcock and Scales;' let him that readeth understand, no explanation is needed surely in nearly the 20th century. Many are looking for great social and political changes in the 20th century; may it prove 93 94 THE MANIFESTO. to be a time of great advancement in the spiritual unfoldings of our race. There never was a time when more destructive war engines were being invented. Dynamite is a pretty plaything for anarchists, I saw lately that it is intended in case of war to send a ship, loaded with dynamite, into an enemy's squadron and explode it in the midst, thus annihilating a whole fleet at one time; a seaport city can be destroyed in the same manner. Surely war will soon become so horrible that civilized men will shrink from it. We see indications of a desire to settle disputes by arbitration among powerful nations. We may well bless every good thought. We have to chronicle among other home improvements a cold storage room, one of the greatest comforts imaginable. We would like to mention our appreciation of Brother E. P. Sevester's pieces in the Manifesto. T. J. Stroud. Alfred., Maine. Mar. 1894. The 9th day of March and little snow to be seen. The patches of green grass where so lately were two feet of snow are pleasing to the eye. But 'one swallow does not make a summer,' we may have a good deal of winter yet. Our Brethren say it has been the most favorable winter for lumbering known for years. 200 M. of pine and 40 M. of oak delivered at the mill tell the story of part of their winter's work. Now the hum of the saw as the fire-wood is being prepared for the coming year is not unpleasant music to the farmer's ear. The Creamery Association that purchases the cream not needed for home use, pays for it this year according to the fat shown in it by the Babcock test. We find there is as much difference in creams as in any other food supplies. The last monthly test showed 27 per cent of butter fat in the cream purchased of us and no more than half that amount in some of the other creams tested. Our little Society has been blest with fairly good health all winter. We do not forget to remember with thankful hearts the many blessings we enjoy and would gladly share our home comforts with other souls who may be willing to bring their minds into accord with the holy spirit which purified the lives of that noble company of redeemed souls spoken of in Rev. xiv.
