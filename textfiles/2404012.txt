Alfred., Maine. Mar. 1894. The 9th day of March and little snow to be seen. The patches of green grass where so lately were two feet of snow are pleasing to the eye. But 'one swallow does not make a summer,' we may have a good deal of winter yet. Our Brethren say it has been the most favorable winter for lumbering known for years. 200 M. of pine and 40 M. of oak delivered at the mill tell the story of part of their winter's work. Now the hum of the saw as the fire-wood is being prepared for the coming year is not unpleasant music to the farmer's ear. The Creamery Association that purchases the cream not needed for home use, pays for it this year according to the fat shown in it by the Babcock test. We find there is as much difference in creams as in any other food supplies. The last monthly test showed 27 per cent of butter fat in the cream purchased of us and no more than half that amount in some of the other creams tested. Our little Society has been blest with fairly good health all winter. We do not forget to remember with thankful hearts the many blessings we enjoy and would gladly share our home comforts with other souls who may be willing to bring their minds into accord with the holy spirit which purified the lives of that noble company of redeemed souls spoken of in Rev. xiv.
