THE LOVE OF GOD The love of God, like their universe is boundless. The most depraved being as well as the brightest seraph that dazzles around their throne are alike the subjects of their warm paternal and maternal embrace. The greatest exhibitions of God's love, of which we have any knowledge, can give but a very faint idea of its exceeding riches and power. We may feel it, like repeated shocks of electricity, passing through our physical frames, shaking out a selfish, carnal nature, thereby laying a broad and solid foundation for a new life, a new creation. God waits to fill and purify our hearts with his love. Men, and angels, are led to behold, and admire. The highest order of angels will ever desire to look into the deep and hidden mysteries of the love of God. Their universal testimony will be to all eternity. ' This love is better felt than told.' The love of God should be the mainspring of all Christian effort. Our happiness and our usefulness here, and hereafter, will be in proportion to the amount of true Gospel-love which we possess and maintain. The love of God is wonderful in its origin, mighty in its effects, mysterious, and incomprehensible in all its tendencies. By its power this world must be conquered, and its kingdoms become the kingdoms of our God and his Christ. Gilbert Hubbell, Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
