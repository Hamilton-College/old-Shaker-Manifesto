We see the sunlit mountain peak That rises high and grand,�The 3. Thy saving grace will purify And make our spirits bright; Thy 4. We know our lives with good are blest, And to thee offer praise; 'Tis ask in true humility, For pow'r that maketh free. We truth our yearning spirits seek, And thereon we would stand; So hand will ev'ry need supply, If we but ask aright; And thou who givest peace and rest, That crown our earthly days; But will not shun a needed cross, One duty leave undone, If we will climb the mountain side, The rocks may wound our feet, But through repentance we may rise Triumphant over sin; Wilt still we yearn for an increase Of faith, of hope, and life, That thus we may be cleansed from dross, We'll take them ev'ry one. if thou wilt with us abide, All dangers we can meet, thou anew our souls baptize ? That vict'ry we may win. we may never think to cease The Christian's noble strife.
