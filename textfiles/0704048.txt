EVERGREEN SHORES Sarah Amelia Crooker At Canterbury, N. H., Feb. 13, Sarah Amelia Crooker , aged 50. Mentally, morally, spiritually, a brilliant adornment of our Israel; but physically fragile. Pity it is that such could not have bodies that would last a thousand years. Polly Jones At South Union, Ky., Feb. 10, 1877, Polly Jones , aged 93. Caroline Webber At Canaan, N. Y., Feb. I5, 1877, Caroline Webber , aged 80 years. Influential in bringing some of the most staunch supporters of our faith into our ranks on earth, she has ever deserved the grateful thanks of all Zion.
