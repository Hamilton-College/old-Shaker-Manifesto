NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, New York Average of Weather at Mount Lebanon. May. Thermometer. Bain. 1890. 57.8 5. 5-16 in. 1891. 56.9 1% in. Geo. M. W. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Center Family. June 6, 1891. Deae Editor :�Farm and garden crops are looking well, but would be improved by a bountiful supply of rain. Cherrie s and pears promise fair results. We are having four of our buildings painted which improves their appearance somewhat. Door-yard lawn is looking nicely and this has a tendency to beautify our home and make it attractive externally at least. Health of family good. Your Brother, T. E. !N'ortli Family. June 10, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�Your kind letter and hints about forwarding home notes so as to reach the printers by the 14th. of the month is certainly very reasonable. We all like to have the Manifesto by the last of the month, and I hope we who have been behind will hereafter be prompt and in season. I will. On the 7th. we commenced our Society Meetings and it was a good beginning. I hope every Society will bear in mind, that next year will be our centennial of the gathering of the Church of Christ's Second Appearing into gospel order; without order it would be impossible to maintain our Communal relation. The gathering of the Church into order was a very important event in our history. There was more in it than the carnal mind has any idea of. The establishing of a system under which all nations could gather and live in harmony and peace for a hundred years must have a great deal of divine goodness in it; human skill alone could never accomplish it. The United States are making extensive preparations to celebrate the discovery of America, the home of liberty, or will be when the true earthly order is established therein. Let us have a grand festival in 1892! 'Kaise the gospel standard higher, let its banners be unfurled.' We are in the usual business of the season; battling with weeds, lice, fleas, bugs and moths and everything with which vegetation is cursed; it is a constant warfare: no time for idleness. The late frosts we have had, did little or no damage in our section. Have tried quite extensively the spraying of our fruit trees with London Purple to kill the curculio &amp;c. At harvest time we hope to gather fruit without worms. A few weeks ago we enjoyed a short visit from Elder Alexander Work of Groveland. He reports that the frost has destroyed all their fruit, of which they had such glowing promise. This is the third year their fruit has been cut off, and not only their fruit but the crops upon which they depend for material subsistence have been destroyed by flood and frost. They really need some practical love administered to them packed well in bbls. �of dried fruit or cases of canned fruit with the freight prepaid; or perhaps what would be better, some well-filled checks sent by mail. Gospel love is like the widow's cruise of oil; it never grows less by pouring on the needy. Bring forth tithes from our stores and pour them into Groveland and prove the blessedness of gospel love. Our Ministry all in usual health start for Watervliet this A. M. ~s In kindest love, D. O. Hancock, Mass. June 12, 1891. Dear Editor�There seems to be nothing note-worthy in our locality at the present time. Most of our family are in usual health. We are endeavoring to brighten up the interior of our buildings a little, by the use of paint. Have also a good opportunity to contemplate the beauties of nature with which we are surrounded. The maple trees which line the street also are robed in beauty. The blackberry bushes, planted by our venerable Elder, are in full bloom and present a charming appearance. We are pleased to learn that a company of our Gospel friends from Enfield, 'N. H. contemplate journeying hither. A cordial welcome is extended them in advance. The Teachers of our County held their annual convention on the 29th. ult., which had a large attendance and was very interesting. Oats and other crops are looking tolerably fair, but are somewhat affected by the drought. Fruit is doing well. J. L. S. Enfield, Conn. The past month gives evidence of industry in our Community and peaceful home. 'Hands at work, and hearts to God' seems to pervade the heart of every sincere laborer in the vineyard, and look from any point of observation the view is cheering, and inspires us with courage to persevere in adding new attractions to home and surroundings. Painting has been successfully cai'ried forward about our premises for the past two weeks, fences and buildings receiving their share. The garden has suffered from the long drought, yet water has been supplied to some of the smaller vegetables and kept them growing and at present lettuce, spinach and radishes are ready for use daily. Asparagus is doing well now although backened by the cold winds. Potatoes and peas are looking well considering the drought and severe cold winds that seemed to threaten everything with destruction. The currant worms came in quantities, but they were soon dispatched by a free use of helebore. The prospect of fruit not very cheering. The apples look the most promising at present. The prospect for grass is that it will be light. Rye and oats good. One of our wagon-sheds has been raised two feet making it more convenient for protecting loads of hay and grain. A wall has also been built to turn the water from cow-barn cellar all of which requires time and patience before we realize the benefits arising therefrom. With the blessing of God all difficulties will be overcome. M. W. PeRSEVERE to the end. Few and simple as these words are, if we put them in practice in our daily lives all our hopes of future happiness will be fully realized. The self-denying way is delightful and safe. The broad road may seem pleasant, but let us beware. 'There is a way that seemeth right, but the end thereof is death.' If we are wise we shall follow virtue's path though the way seem rough and rugged. We shall never regret this constant persevering,�this continual effort in the path of duty, The progress we make may not appear very great, at times, but if it be sure and steady, we shall win the reward. We should not only persevere in that which pertains to our own happiness, but also in our efforts to help others. Freely we have received, let us freely give. The largest sandstone drawn from the Somer's quarry to our station weighed eight tons and four hundred pounds. 4536 spaces of cream were sold in May. A small number of fowls properly cared for will produce more eggs than double the number neglected. Crowding the fowls calls for two much competition, too many struggles for existence, and the weaker ones will be unprofitable. The plan to pursue is to keep as many as may be easily managed and no more. We should not attempt a wholesale business with retail facilities. There is both pleasure and profit in poultry, but also loss where they are mismanaged. D. Orcutt.
