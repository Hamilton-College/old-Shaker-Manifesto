Enfield, Conn. The past month gives evidence of industry in our Community and peaceful home. 'Hands at work, and hearts to God' seems to pervade the heart of every sincere laborer in the vineyard, and look from any point of observation the view is cheering, and inspires us with courage to persevere in adding new attractions to home and surroundings. Painting has been successfully cai'ried forward about our premises for the past two weeks, fences and buildings receiving their share. The garden has suffered from the long drought, yet water has been supplied to some of the smaller vegetables and kept them growing and at present lettuce, spinach and radishes are ready for use daily. Asparagus is doing well now although backened by the cold winds. Potatoes and peas are looking well considering the drought and severe cold winds that seemed to threaten everything with destruction. The currant worms came in quantities, but they were soon dispatched by a free use of helebore. The prospect of fruit not very cheering. The apples look the most promising at present. The prospect for grass is that it will be light. Rye and oats good. One of our wagon-sheds has been raised two feet making it more convenient for protecting loads of hay and grain. A wall has also been built to turn the water from cow-barn cellar all of which requires time and patience before we realize the benefits arising therefrom. With the blessing of God all difficulties will be overcome. M. W. PeRSEVERE to the end. Few and simple as these words are, if we put them in practice in our daily lives all our hopes of future happiness will be fully realized. The self-denying way is delightful and safe. The broad road may seem pleasant, but let us beware. 'There is a way that seemeth right, but the end thereof is death.' If we are wise we shall follow virtue's path though the way seem rough and rugged. We shall never regret this constant persevering,ï¿½this continual effort in the path of duty, The progress we make may not appear very great, at times, but if it be sure and steady, we shall win the reward. We should not only persevere in that which pertains to our own happiness, but also in our efforts to help others. Freely we have received, let us freely give. The largest sandstone drawn from the Somer's quarry to our station weighed eight tons and four hundred pounds. 4536 spaces of cream were sold in May. A small number of fowls properly cared for will produce more eggs than double the number neglected. Crowding the fowls calls for two much competition, too many struggles for existence, and the weaker ones will be unprofitable. The plan to pursue is to keep as many as may be easily managed and no more. We should not attempt a wholesale business with retail facilities. There is both pleasure and profit in poultry, but also loss where they are mismanaged. D. Orcutt.
