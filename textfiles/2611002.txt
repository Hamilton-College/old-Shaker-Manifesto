UNTRIED POWERS. By Martha J. Anderson. High soars the bird with undipped wing, Swift moves the steed from rein set free; Far leaps the stag with bound and spring, For love of life and liberty. Thus human minds are fledged for flight, Who feel no curbing of tbe will, And dauntless souls gain crag and height, Yet, greater freedom long for still. Prometheus-like, earth-bound are we While reaching up for heaven's fire, This hope of immortality, Which kindles in us high desire. The vultures of our lower lives. Feed on the soul's vitality; To break its chains the spirit strives, Till boundless Being sets it free. If in the path where virtues dwell, All doubts and fear&amp; we question not, But yield to laws immutable Which hold us to our earth-born lot. THE MANIFESTO. 173 On time's eventful wheel we move, Our destiny is marked thereon, Through such embodiment we prove That good or ill before have gone. Our joys and sorrows we may count The guerdon merited while here, And every trial we surmount Is progress toward the inner sphere. We slowly climb the golden stair That reaches heaven's starry height, And for Nirvana's rest prepare Through countless eon-days and nights. For living, longing beings we, Environed in these forms of clay, With throbbing hearts, nor souls set free To soar from earthly clods away. We bide perfection's blissful state, When life unfolded will be ours, Nor mourn the just decrees of fate, That holds in check our untried powers. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
