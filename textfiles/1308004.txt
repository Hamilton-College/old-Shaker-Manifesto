ACT WELL YOUR PART, DON'T BE SELFISH WRITTEN FOR TIIE MANIFESTO. ACT WELL YOUR PART, DON'T BE SELFISH. Remember that it is by imparting happiness to others, and making ourselves useful that we receive happiness. Stand by this truth, live it out, and always keep doing something useful for the common good, doing it well, and acting sincerely. Endeavor to keep your heart in the attitude of cherishing good will to all, thinking and speaking evil of no one, and always with a kind word for every body. Selfishness is its own curse, it is a standing vice. The man who does no good gets none. He is like the heath in the desert, neither yielding fruit nor seeing when good cometh, a stunted, dwarfish miserable shrub. Let all your influence be exerted for the purpose of doing all you can for the common good and individual welfare of every one.
