Sabbathday Lake, Me. June, 1899. June is here and the days are long and fine. Xo rain of much account has fallen for two months and the land is suffering for the want of it. Xot even a shower condescends to stop in this section. The fruit will probably be spoiled. Hay a very light crop. As for vegetables and flowers we can only hope as to-day is dull and foggy that rain may come and save them. Sister Aurelia's books are now ready and selling fast at a dollar apiece. The guests from Poland Springs are much pleased with them. We are glad as Sister Aurelia has taken much pains to have the work a success and books, we know will live long after the visible form of the author is consigned to dust, so we believe her's will be a testimony to prove her love to her work and her people. We are glad to record success in the sale of our plants, as at this writing the greenhouse is cleared of all salable plants, only enough left for home use. Xot long since, Dr. Bailey, a veterinary surgeon called here to examine our herd of cows, and pronounced them free from tuberculosis. This examination was necessary as the Ricker Brothers 'wished to engage our cream for the summer. We hear that Elder George Clark and three Sisters from Enfield, Conn., are on their way to our home but are stopping at Old Orchard Beach. We shall be glad to extend to them a cordial welcome. Ada S. Cummings.
