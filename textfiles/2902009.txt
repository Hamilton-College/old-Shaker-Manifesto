The closing day of 1898 gave a farewell serenade to the exodus of the expiring year. The incipient ceremonies opened with rain, which changed to sleet, and then to snow which at New Year's dawn was a foot in depth, which has given us a diversified storm as a farewell to the retiring year, and a pure white robe to adorn the infant New Year. We willingly bid a long and eternal farewell to 1898 with its tornadoes, whirlwinds, hurricanes, typhoons, volcanoes, floods, electric bolts, sun-bursts, and all its destructive machinations of life and property of every kind on land and by ocean's foaming, dashing billows. Columbia County has had its full share of destruction by the angry elements and many thousands of dollars will fail to repair the damages. The storm apparently spent its fury in prostrating S. J. Tilden &amp; Co's new steel smoke-stack to their New Laboratory. The N. Y. State Road is less than one half done. At the present time, preparation for putting an iron bridge across the gulley east of our machine shop pond is being executed. The intention is to have it accomplished before Spring opens. There is some physical inability among us, but no death to record. I ran a narrow chance of passing the fatal ordeal but I feel at present that lean stand quite a brush with the grim monster. Even so let it be. Calvin G. Heed. North Family. Jan. 1899. Christmas has come and gone and standing on the ridge dividing the Old from the New Year, we sniff some of the savor of saltness from the dawning century just beyonda century of whose coming the poets and prophets have written. The usual religious Services marked the morning and the usual festal entertainment the afternoon and evening of Christmas Day. At 10 o'clock a. m. we met our friends of the Church family in their pleasant chapel, spending about two hours in singing, reading and speaking. All the services partook more or less of the spirit THE MA NIFES TO. 27 of the day. In the afternoon a number of the Church family made our entertainment the more enjoyable by their presence and showed a cordial appreciation of its program, with the usual Christmas features, singing, recitations, etc. At the close of the exercises, a simple luncheon was served to all. We must not omit to mention that our beloved Eldress Harriet and Eldress Augusta were among the welcome guests. Altogether our Christmas day was full of Jesus, His life, His work and we trust His spirit. G. Ada Brown. South Family. Jan. 1899. The Old Year 1898 was completely frozen out, while the New Year of 1899, has become thoroughly frozen in, with the mercuiy ranging from 10 to 12 deg. below zero. Our years they come amd go All too quickly here below, But we wish they long might stay For the good they've sent our way. Leaving blessings at our door Daily giving more and more, So the years they go and come Benefitting ev'ry one. The holidays, as usual, were scenes of spiritual and social communion, Santa Claus &amp; Co. made their annual tour of gift distributing; each member was remembered by good old Santa and his honored staffSt. Nicholasnoted for benevolence and a marvelous memory. By invitation from our Second family friends, a delegation from this family were present at their Christmas festival on the afternoon of that day. The chapel was decorated with evergreens. The vocal and instrumental music was highly commendable. The reading and recitations were conducted most admirably. The singing of a German Christmas song with an autoharp accompaniment was pleasingly executed by Brother Albert, who not long ago hailed from that far away land of music and song. At the close of the entertainment a bountiful repast was served in the family dining-hall and all were merry as the Merry Christmas.

The Christmas and New Year celebrations, in their active manifestation, have past away, but their remembrance and the joy of their participation will last through the year. Christinas evening we had an Entertainment of one and a half hour's duration which was both instructive and entertaining; and as our beloved Editor and assistants were not here to share in its pleasures, we will, if not crowding other members of the home circle, present the program.

On the evening of the 26th we met to receive the distributions from the Christmas tree, and hearts were gladdened by the mementos from dear friends. Such seasons of pure enjoyment bring those who are striving for the right into a oneness of spirit, and make them strong in their efforts for good. While listening to the recitations of our Christmas party and realizing the ability manifested, our thought in prayer was, Heavenly Father and Mother, bless the rising generation! May their affections be inclined toward Thee, that they may be the ministers of the new dispensation; for only a little while and they will be the directors of that spiritual power which will be called upon to wrestle with the mighty problems which the twentieth century will present for solution. Hamilton DeOraw. Narcoossee, Fla. Jan. 1899. Leaf turning on New Tear's day is somewhat conducive to good habits. Doubtless there are many to-day holding a rehearsal over their life's book. As page after page is reviewed, and the blots and blemishes stand for account, new resolutions are made to be more careful the coining year. To turn over a new leaf is not an easy task, when erratic conduct has blotted many pages. Strong and determined resolutions and long and continued efforts will help us to succeed. We may turn the pages of each Year book with pleasure. On Christmas we sang a hymn in remembrance of our friends in the homes of our childhood. We hoped that the same inspiration that overshadowed them would reach us in our wilderness home. We would wish that it might help us, with them, to usher in the New Year with such strong resolution of heart that the pages of life's book will not be sullied by one blemish. On the 1st of January we dug our fall crop of northern potatoes, and on the 6th we planted the same ground for another crop of the same kind. What a contrast! Our friends who write us from the north, tell us of the snow banks that cover the land, and of the task of keeping the paths open from house to house. Here we are basking in the sunshine of summer weather. The thermometer ranges from 60 to 80 deg. almost every day. We have had but one frost that has done any damage. Then the mercury fell to 40 deg. These occasional frosts make winter gardens very uncertain, and for this reason many do not plant after September. We send greetings to all. Anrfreiv Barrett.
