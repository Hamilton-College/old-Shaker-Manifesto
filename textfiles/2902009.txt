Narcoossee, Fla. Jan. 1899. Leaf turning on New Tear's day is somewhat conducive to good habits. Doubtless there are many to-day holding a rehearsal over their life's book. As page after page is reviewed, and the blots and blemishes stand for account, new resolutions are made to be more careful the coining year. To turn over a new leaf is not an easy task, when erratic conduct has blotted many pages. Strong and determined resolutions and long and continued efforts will help us to succeed. We may turn the pages of each Year book with pleasure. On Christmas we sang a hymn in remembrance of our friends in the homes of our childhood. We hoped that the same inspiration that overshadowed them would reach us in our wilderness home. We would wish that it might help us, with them, to usher in the New Year with such strong resolution of heart that the pages of life's book will not be sullied by one blemish. On the 1st of January we dug our fall crop of northern potatoes, and on the 6th we planted the same ground for another crop of the same kind. What a contrast! Our friends who write us from the north, tell us of the snow banks that cover the land, and of the task of keeping the paths open from house to house. Here we are basking in the sunshine of summer weather. The thermometer ranges from 60 to 80 deg. almost every day. We have had but one frost that has done any damage. Then the mercury fell to 40 deg. These occasional frosts make winter gardens very uncertain, and for this reason many do not plant after September. We send greetings to all. Anrfreiv Barrett.
