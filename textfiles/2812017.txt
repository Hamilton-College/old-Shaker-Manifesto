HUMILITY. Humility is perfect quietness of heart. It is to have no trouble. It is never to be fretted or vext or irritated or sore disappointed. It is to expect nothing, to wonder at nothing that is done to me, to feel nothing done against me. It is to be at rest when nobody praises me, and when I am blamed or despised. It is to have a blessed home in myself where I can go in and shut the door, and kneel to my Father in secret and be at peace as in a deep sea of calmness when all around and above is trouble.
