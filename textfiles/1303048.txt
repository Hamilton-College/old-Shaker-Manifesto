The Tourist's Guide The Touhist's Glide of California, a beai.tifully illustrated work of some 282 pages, has reached us, through the kindness of the Author, Major. Ben.C. Truman. From the first page to the last it is an enchanting volume, taking us as it does through a semi-tropical country, a land of flowers and fruits, and presenting to us such an extended series of 'Natural wonders.' One writer says that,—'Yosemite conveys to the soul of man, through the eye. what might be the orchestra of Heaven, through the ear, were peals of thunder composed into harmonius notes of music, then suddenly silenced, and followed amid instant stillness by nature's most tiny voice.' It tells us of Mountains with an elevation of from 10.000 to 14.000 feet, whose tops are covered 'with fields of everlasting snow?' Of tree* 275 ft. tall and over 100 ft. m circumference at the base!! of Falls and cataracts and cascades from 100 ft. to 2526 ft; ain] one v£ these having 1.500 ft. perpendicular descent: of the wonderful mineral springs that are to be found in erery part of the state, and which are unsurpassed in the mission of doing good, and in healing the sick. The pleasure of reading the book comes next to that «f making a visit to this land of extreme wonders.
