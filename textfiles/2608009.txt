Enfield, N. H. July, 1896. The prophetic tone of Sister Aurelia's essay in the July No. is quite encouraging. We long for the strong spiritual battery that will compel us to use the mowing machine 'of consistency in all things' to cut away the dead growth of virtueless life which chokes the yield of promising virtue. We hail with gladness the good news from Florida, as given by Elder Louis Basting and hope another year's experience may give even greater prosperity in temporal affairs, and a blessed harvesting of souls who regard life acts of consecration to the principles of Shakerism of more importance than mere talking of faith's ideals. On the evening before the 'glorious fourth,' the younger members of our home gave an excellent entertainment commemorative of our Nation's freedom from English rule. The chapel was profusely decorated with the national colors, and all things combined to make the occasion perfect in every detail. Especially pleasant was the display of musical talent. The season thus far has been unusually dry, the result of which is a very light hay crop. Early berries quite abundant, but apples and pears will be very scarce with us this season. On July sixth, sowed a second crop of peas. Gospel kindred, it is a very good time to visit Enfield. Why not come? George H. Baxter.
