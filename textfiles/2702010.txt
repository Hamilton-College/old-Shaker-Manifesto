Shakers, N. Y. Jan. 1897. Beloved Eldeii Henkst;ï¿½We thought while our Christmas celebration was being enacted, how nice it would be if our Editor was with us to view the characters as they were portrayed by the actors. The young people managed the entertainment, which reflected great credit in selections and rendering. We send program as it was enacted Christmas evening at the South family. Our home talent from the North being represented in the following. Golden Bells, Song. The Seasons, Dialog. What ailed the Pudding, Recitation. The Banker's Charity, Holy Song, Song. Little Nut People, Recitation. The Geography Demon, Christ is Incarnate, Song. A Bad Cold, Recitation. Charity that Pays, Dialog. Song by Quartet, The Last Hymn, Recitation. The Fountain of Peace, Dialog. The King of Nations. Song. The young people of the South family entertained the company with the following, which was very nicely rendered. Twelve Christian Virtues, Dialog. Jesus' Seat, Recitation. The Answered Advertisement, The Ship of Life. That ancient and honored prophet of the Lord, Melchisedek, appeared in the entertainment, clad in the robes of his priestly office, on his mission of collecting tithes, with which he set up an altar and offered a burnt offering. The entertainment lasted from 4 till 7 p. m., when, adjourning to the dining-hall, refreshments were served. We have been both entertained and instructed, in the perusal of some of the writings of Thomas A. Kempis. Living in what is termed the dark ages of the Christian era, his was a mind largely free from theological bigotry and had an understanding of spiritual gifts, which places him in the ranks, as one of the inspired teachers of the race. He was translated in the year 1471 at 91 years of age. Our friend, Simon Emery hits the nail on the head in his letter in the Jan. Manifesto. We fully endorse the sentiments there exprest. Whoever receives the gift to minister the gospel, must let their light shine, and proclaim from the house-top, that testimony which has been unfolded to their spiritual understanding. Hamilton DeGraw.
