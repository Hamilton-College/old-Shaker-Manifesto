My Dear Bro. Harvey:--I have received your kind letter... Mount Airy, O. Aug. 30, 1891. My Dear Bro. Harvey :�I have received your kind letter containing your 'farewell sermon'�so said, but I think you will preach many more.� Your sermons were always good, and this is the best one I have seen or heard from you; I think you should keep right on with them. The reproof of the speculator in the horse trade was good; but he ought not to have been allowed anything for his time, as that was an easement for a wrong, fraudulent act. I am glad that I spent a year or more at Union Village, because the prevailing spirit was Love. I am not sorry that I have pursued the religious thought still further�till I can no longer believe that an organized system exists on earth, sufficiently large, to meet the demands of the Universe, (but there is one large enough for our planet. H. L. E.) The Buddhists are a pure, sincere and apparently honest people; and have never murdered any body for their religion, though their population embraces about one third of all on the Globe : (The number in Asia is 295, 000,000,) and yet millions have been put to death for Christ's sake. I cannot regard God as a person, for that means one among many ; but as the Great Soul of the Universe, composed of millions of inhabited worlds, which are ruled by love. God the Infinite, is everywhere, and lives in all that lives�He is in us and we in Him. To constitute the Supreme Divinity, takes all of mind, soul, spirit and matter; so that God is all and in all. To whom then must I pray but God within? I oftentimes pray to my spirit friends, who come to me in answer to prayer; sometimes in materialized bodies, whose language is plain and distinct to my natural ear. If you object to the term, materialized bodies I will say just such a body as Jesus had when he was journeying to Emmaus with the two disciples, the third day after the crucifixion. Excuse my rambling letter, my dear Brother, and give my love to all the faithful friends. Enoch Jacobs.
