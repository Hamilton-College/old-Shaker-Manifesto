REST IN PEACE. Read at the funeral of Sister, EMILY SEARS. Florence Staples. Calmly as melts the dark shadows, In the clear sunlight of day, So hath thy spirit arisen From earthly turmoil away. In pure affection we hold thee, Friendship that never will cease, 'Neath tne sweet care of the angels, Rest,ï¿½0 beloved, rest in peace. All for the right thou'st forsaken Kindred and all earthly gain ; Thine was a life of devotion, Free from remorse and from stain. 0 sainted one ! we behold thee Sharing a happy release, And with rejoicing and gladness Gathering laurels of peace. Bright is faith's star that hath led thee, Guiding thy footsteps aright; Unselfish toil hath thy spirit Clothed in nure vestments of white. Earnest in all thy endeavor, Working for Zion's increase Death brings to thee naught of terror, For thou art resting in peace. Life with its care and its burden Often thy spirit weighed down; Thine was the cross and the conflict, Thine is true joy and the crown. Love brings unto thee her tribut', Freely the promised reward ; Sweet is the peace of the faithful, They who find rest in the Lord. 0 dearest one ! shall our spirits Share of thy blessings no more, Lessens of wisdom and virtue Given from thy garnered store? Yea, we will watch for thy coming, Seek in thy presence to b3; While these as fruits of thy labors Cluster round life's memory. Home to the realms of the blessed, Free from all sadness and gloom, Voices 'mid songs of rejoicing Bid thee, beloved, to come. Blest by thy friends tried and faithful, Blest by the angels above, Take the pure gems of affection Placed in a casket of love. Canaan, N. Y.
