GOOD MANNERS. By Frank Theobald. As a Christian society, professing to follow Jesus the Christ, it should be our aim to cultivate those attributes to morals and good manners, that marked his character, and which always denote the noble man or woman. True courtesy should not be used by us merely as a surface-wash to be put on when entertaining special friends, but it should be universally given; as the manners of persons are the criterion by which the moral and religious life may often be judged.
