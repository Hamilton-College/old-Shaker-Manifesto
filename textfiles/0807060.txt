Editorial Notes. We are using a number of The Bickford Knitting Machines; and they are very satisfactory indeed, Being among 'the wonders in this age' of machinery. Their utility and expedition in business should be exp e rienced by all, at so small cost. Material for Fences of wood variety is getting scarce. We must soon accept the alternative of no fences, or rely on the metal ones offered us by Washburn, Moen Co. We are at a loss to speak as yet, of the best Wat eb Wheel ; but we are at no loss to say that the firms of Leffel &amp; Co. and N. F. Burnham, who enter into friend-, ly competition in our columns, are both most honor able Oftentimes, we are led to regret, that there are unscrupulous persons, who, realizing the solid benefits of judicious advertising, will use it most freely on some useless or worse than useless articles, and soon retire with fortunes of ill-earned gains. But we can still point to thousands who by a wholesome judicious judgment, have used advertising to their exceeding profit! and to the most creditable advancement of useful materials. Such, we believe our patrons to be. We have taken considerable and particular pains to acquaint ourself with Dr. Frazier's remedies, and find from those using them, only a good report. His Bitters are purely medicinal, and not an intoxicant beverage. Elder James S. Prescott gives his endorsement of Dr. Frazier's Cough Remedyâ€”and he is good authority. We find Stinson and Co. very honorable in their dealing. Try them. We hope 'everybody and his neighbor' will send us six cents for a copy of 'Plain Talks;' or ten cents, for two copies post paid. It is a pretty book. Please procure it and present it to your friend.
