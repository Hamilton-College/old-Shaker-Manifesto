A SABBATH PIECE. By Cora C. Vinneo. This is the Sabbath! From my window looking west The stately hills arise, Splendid in all their wealth Of emerald robes broidered with gold and white, Shadowed with mellow light,ï¿½ That light that falls through mist veils, When the sun hides like a priest Kneeling in silence at a holy shrine. And souls sometimes Must take a Sabbath rest, Must gather strength to meet The cares that come with mailed feet, Clanking adownthe chambers of the soul O cares that come! O mighty griefs that roll! Go back and let us rest. All! this is my Sabbath day, My very own! And in it I will meditate and dream Of life and all its blessedness, Of Prayer, the white-winged messenger that steals Noiselessly through our cloister's door ajar Bringing sweet tidings from the world afar. Of Faith, the divine preceptor And Hope, the angel standing at her right. Of Love, that makes us think And do more holy things than aught beside. Prayer is a power, Faith and Hope are powers But Love combines and comprehends them all. So in this Sabbath, holy and divinely still, There comes a bliss Whose name I feel but can not tell. And from the Sacred Place I hear this message to my soul: 'Silence and wait And all things will be well.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
