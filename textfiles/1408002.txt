My Dear Sister Mary; You certainly have a... Mount Lebanon, N. Y. My Dear Sister Mary ;-You certainly have a large and sympathetic heart that feels the needs of the aged, as well as of the youth in Zion. We thank you many times, loved Sister, for your kind remembrance of our aged brothers and sisters, who are such a treasure to us, although they are far down the side of the hill towards the setting sun; but sometimes strange things occur, and some of those who are in the great thoroughfare of life's busy throng find the chariot drawn by the white horse, Avaiting for them, and are forced to enter it, and are carried swiftly by the aged and infirm to the final goal contrary to human calculations. Hence it is wise for us all to heed the injunction, 'Be ye also ready. ' The leading question to-day is, or should be,�how can Zion direct her efforts and use her ability in a spiritual and temporal point of view to the best advantage, in building up and sustaining the one great cause, for which, by profession at least, we have pledged our all! What is life to us, if Zion is dishonored, her bulwarks destroyed and htr foundation overthrown! Can temporal wealth, houses, lands or gold supply the soul's needs? Could all that the natural generative relations, of father, mother, husband, wife and children give, supply the lost treasure? Never! Those who seek pleasure in unrighteousness, will, in the future as in the past, seek in vain. We have a deep and living hope, an abiding confidence, that God is able to accomplish His own designs in the great work of human redemption, whether wo poor mortals will it or not. It is true, we may hasten the work by our firm adhereuce to gospel principles, and willingness to work with God, or we may retard, by refusing to co-operate with the spirit; for men and women are the agents, through whom the work is effected. But, if a few at the present time sell their birthright for the sordid pleasures of a carnal life, others more noble, who have a deeper love of truth, will purchase it by giving the price required ; and will come in and occupy a place in God's spiritual temple and become shining lights therein. We are laborers in the Lord's vineyard ; and if we can do the good Father's and Mother's will acceptably, we shall yield our will to theirs, in obedience to their request, as we have done heretofore, rather than to miss the blessing. The destiny of all the Societies of Believers is linked together in one chain of brotherhood and sisterhood. If one suffers, all are pained ; if one prospers and is made glad, then all rejoice. Love of earthly possessions, means by which creature comforts may be obtained, has swallowed up the love of gospel simplicity in a great degree among Believers, and the cxirrent of thought is turned more towards the world, to know what will be pleasing and acceptable in their sight, than is towards the spiritual heavens, to pray for a renewal of the pentecostal fires that will rebaptize us all with a hatred to the world and all its lusts in our own hearts. In this respect we have all sinned to a greater or less degree, and in proportion, 'have come short of the glory of God 'and the true resurrection power. Shall we continue in this course is the question to be answered ! But, unless we conclude that the earth sphere contains the all of life, and like the animals that are sroverned by instinct, we eat, drink and die, without thought or care for the future, then it seems to me, if Believers retain spiritual life and energy enough to rise and again stand on their spiritual feet, they must return to the waymarks, (as far as principle is concerned.) of the first founders of our institution, which gave them power and pre-eminence over the world; Again we ask,�When and where will the great reform action commence? All mean well; we all excuse ourselves, because A. B. and C want this and that and are unreconciled if it is not provided for them, and we have no other means of obtaining it for them. Well, let us watch closely and see if such members are not unreconciled after their demands are supplied ! The plain truth is, there is no earthly thing that can fill the aching void, in a soul that is destitute of the gift of God. Your Sister, Antoinette.
