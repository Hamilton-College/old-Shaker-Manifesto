Harvard, Mass. Dec. 1894. To the mandates of time the seasons have rendered Perfect obedience, the autumn has gone, The cold breath of winter now forward hath ventured Silenced the notes of the forest-bird's song. The fields are all bare, trees stripped of their verdure, Save here and there stands a lone evergreen, The rivulets yield to the dictates of Mature, Their murmurs are hushed by an ice-bound chain. Winter has come to stay. Its first monition caught us rather unprepared, but the snow was light and soon left. So we came out all right with nothing harmed. Old zero, after several approaches, came upon us the morning of the 5th inst. but we had taken his hints and were well prepared, so there was no mischief done. At present writing we are having splendid weather, Fifteen carpenters keep the air resonant with their hammers making lively work with shingles and clapboards, the painters following on with paint and brush. Appearances now are that we shall soon have a barn. We assembled Thanksgiving day and with grateful hearts, and united prayers, gave thanks for the blessing of health in our Society, and that the fates dealt so lightly with us in our recent loss by fire. The spirit of care and watchfulness was ministered to us, that we may be spared a repetition of our sad experience. We closed Thanksgiving in the tangible manner of reducing three fat turkeys to skeletons. Our dear Eldress Maria Foster is suffering from an attack of tonsilitis. We hope the worst is over and she will soon be in health again. Time has hurried us on to the month of kindly greetings and good wishes. With THE MANIFESTO. 19 sincere and true hearts we wish all and every one an enjoyable Christmas and a happy New Year. Marcia M. Bullard
