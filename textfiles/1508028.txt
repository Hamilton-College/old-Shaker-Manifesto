Beloved Editor; 'baptism,' 'peace on earth,' ... Enfield, Conn. April, 14th, 1885. Beloved Editor;ï¿½'Baptism,' 'Peace on Earth,' ' Be Peaceable,' and ' The One Talent, ' in April Manifesto, are instructive lessons. Who can read such lessons and not be taught? Who can drink at the fountain of truth and not be filled with higher, holier impulses? We thank you for a journal of such pure teachings. Blessings on our Manifesto. May its fifteen volumes be increased to onehundred, and the good you are bestowing upon thousands of people, return to you with ten-fold richness. With full appreciation. Yours, Lovingly. Daniel Orcutt.
