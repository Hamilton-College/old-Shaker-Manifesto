Beloved Sister Eunice Bathrick,— prayers and provender hinder no... Mount Lebanon, 1882 Beloved Sister Eunice Bathrick,— 'Prayers and provender hinder no man's journey' is a Spanish proverb. I am going to prove it this morning by writing you. We are remodeling, or repairing our Old Believer's dwelling house. They did well with it. We are trying to do better. This is about the sixth time we have made the attempt. 1st. We put an addition to the North end, in which is our beautiful Meeting Room. 2nd. We dug a cellar under the North part of the house, in which we put a Boiler for heating the whole house with steam. The steam also goes to and warms the Sister's Shop, some six rods away. Heavy iron Radiators, weighing about (500 lbs., have done good service in warming 26 rooms and keeping the house from blowing over by the powerful East winds that used to tumble down the mountain like a cataract of water, until arrested by the growth of the Union Grove, containing some 70 varieties of trees. Now we have peace, when the East wind roars only a short distance away. 3rd. We added a story to the top of the house by merely raising the ridge 2, or 3 feet and putting on a flat, instead of a steep roof. 4th. We added to the South end of the house, rooms for the Elders and Deacons to labor and lodge in. 5th. Outside, we built a Rain-water Cistern that receives the water from three large and two small roofs. 6th. We are digging the whole length of the house, on the East side, 10 feet wide, from 8, to 13 feet deep. This will make Coal Reservoirs, one at the North and one at the South end of the house, with an Oven in the middle, adding space to the Kitchen and Bakeroom. Two old single brick Chimneys we take down and build one good double brick chimney in place of them— connect the fire from Boiler and Oven with the new chimney at the South end, by 73 ft of 19 inch Tena Cotta Flue Pipe, under ground. Why. should we be bound by matter'' In the Spirit World, the material elements are more plastic than here. Progressive minds can change, model and remodel to express their inward thoughts in outward things, quite easily. But dull, sleepy souls can have every thing 'just as it used to was'—as long as the}' please. Time, there, is condition. There are souls in the spirit spheres, who remain, for age upon age, in the same state— Jesus visited some of these long ago people . Then they saw a great light and heard the last trump, saying 'Awake, theu,that sleepeth, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.' Some did awake, saw, heard and went up one degree. But you, dear Mother Eunice, will never thus die.— You are Resurrected—The body clogs your spirit somewhat, but just as soon as you drop it 'Glory to the Righteous' will be the first salutation you will recognize—Friends will flock around you like doves to the windows, and after a little rest, amid much rejoicing, you will have your field of labor assigned to you. Work will be given that will be worship. To do good, to less favored ones, will be your meat and drink. Love from all of the North Family. F. W. Evans.
