Blessed Gospel Kindred : I REJOICE to meet with you, in this beautifvil Grove of fair Canaan, to-day, where the sun pours its golden rays upon us, as if to make us feel cheerful while we share in this feast of heavenly things, which are pure in the sight of God and his Angels. I always feel thankful to drink in, with you, this pure Gospel love which flows so free from soul to soul. It is good to be here, to sit beneath the shade of these beautiful trees, where the soft winds of heaven are blowing over us all. These gifts and offerings are food to my soul. I am thankful for the many blessings which surround me in my good Gospel home ; and I will endeavor to so improve my condition, that I may be in harmony with every gift. I cannot conceive of any thing better for a young person than to put away all that is worldly, and gather that which is spiritual. My desire is to be more simple in my ways, and to be more humble before God, and my brethren and sisters ; and to be fully given up to the Spirit of Truth. Richard Vanderbeck
