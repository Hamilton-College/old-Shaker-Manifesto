Shakers, N. Y. Nov. 1899. At date of writing these Notes, the 5th inst. we are enjoying a visit from a delegation from Enfield, Conn., comprising Eldress Marion Patric and Sisters Phebe Farnham and Irene Ashley. We prize all seasons of social and spiritual communion with our gospel relation. It was refreshing to peruse the lines of that grand old hymn, 'Soldiers of Christ,'' published in November Manifesto. But such productions never grow old; they are immortal treasures that never decay. The spiritual energy of the testimony ministered by those illuminated and resurrected souls through whom those hymns were given is needed at the present time. Their warfare was not with their fellow beings but with the principalities and powers of darkness enthroned in the human soul. They not only pointed but led the way to the higher life; to an emancipation from the lower, into the spiritual resurrection. We would extend thanks to Elder Ernest Pick for 'speaking out in meeting' in November Manifesto. The nail was hit square on the head. The truth can not be compromised by a bold proclamation of its position, but only by those who with fear and trembling are cowed by the phantom lions in the way and which disappear when bravely met. With this closing essay we would extend thanks to the Editor and printers of The Manifesto and to all who have given their best thoughts silently and through the medium of the pen for its support.
