IDEALIZE THE REAL. By Lucy S. Bowers. 'Tis earnest strife that wins the shining goal; 'Tis glowing hope that lights the clouded way, And life divine turns darkest night to day. 'Tis patience that brings comfort to the soul, And holy thought holds passion in control. Sweet mercy cometh when we love and pray, And wisdom, when God's law our hearts obey, By these is life made beautiful and whole. Although thy duties lead in lowly lines These heavenly states thou mayst realize, E'en if some obstacle thy power confines Within thy limits thou mayst upward rise, But if thou can'st not reach thy high ideal With love and care, idealize the real. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
