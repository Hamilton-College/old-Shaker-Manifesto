I was talking a few days ago with a man who has, perhaps, written more trashy stories for the cheap weeklies than any single writer. For twentyseven years he has done nothing else. He is now comfortably off from the returns which his work has brought him. I asked him how he looked back upon his career and work, and his answer was interesting : 'I count my life almost a failure,' said he. 'This trash which I have been writing has brought me returns upon which I can live comfortably, but look on the other side ! I have no peace of mind when I think of the havoc I have undoubtedly wrought upon young and innocent minds. I can point to nothing with any pride of authorship. I am ashamed of it all. Even my children would hang their heads in shame did they know their father was the author of this trashy stuff.' Do they know it? 'Bless your soul, no ! and God forbid they ever discover itï¿½at least during my lifetime. You saw my eldest daughter at the table. Would I wish her, so beautiful and pure a girl, or her sisters, to know! Oh, no ! no, sir ! My daily prayer is that I may never live to see the flush that will kindle on their beautiful cheeks if ever they learn the truth. Why, there are only five persons, I think, that know of my authorship of the stuff I have put out. No one would certainly suspect it from my nom de plume, and I never write anything else for print, so there can be no comparison of style. Those who know it are, as you are, pledged to secrecy by their friendship for me. I am never suspected of having more than an ordinary passing interest in literature of any sort, and am careful never to start books, authors or periodicals as a topic of conversation. 'But, it doesn't pay !' Why did I start in it? Because it paid me better to write a murderous story than a clean one, and once begun I have kept right on. My first proved so appetizing to its readers that the editor offered me almost double the price he paid me for the first if I would write a second one. Encouraged, I kept right on, until now I hate to think of the number I have written. I have published my stories under fifteen or twenty different names, male and female, and if I have written one I suppose I have written 200 of these beastly serial novels. They're all in the same vein, and there isn't one which hasn't a lot of robberies or murders in it. How people can read them I cannot tell. If they despised their reading as I do their writing, I would be a poor man now I suppose. But with me it is now a thing of the past. I have written my last story. I have laid aside enough to keep my family in comfort and there is no longer any necessity for me to keep up my fiendish work. My girls will soon marry and my two sons are already in business. Does my wife know of it? Yes, the only woman in the world who does, and God bless her! she has never chided me for it, although tears of joy stood in her eyes when I dropped the pen for the last time.' I am not exaggerating facts when I say that this gentleman's total income from his 27 years' work has been fully $250,000. Yet what a lesson is contained in his words for many a young writer of the present day!
