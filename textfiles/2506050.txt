Fourteen Nuts for Sceptics to Crack Fourteen Nuts for Sceptics to Crack. This little book of sixteen pages contains fourteen very pleasant articles and although written especially for those who stand outside of the church, they might be a good accompaniment to the hymn book or even the prayer book, for many who sit in front of the pulpit. The articles are all interesting and instuctive, but the illustration of 'The hen and the Egg' is just cute. Published by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
