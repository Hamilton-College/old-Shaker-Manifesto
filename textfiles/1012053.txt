The Cold Bath .â€” Although the daily cold bath is healthful and reviving, it must not alone be depended upon as a cleansing agent. A man may bathe daily and use his towel even roughly, but remain as dirty to all practical intents as though he eschewed cleanliness; indeed the physical evil of dirt is more likely to ensue, because if wholly neglected the skin would cast off the refuse matter by periodical perspirations. NothiDg but frequent washings in water of at least equal temperature with the skin, and soap, can insure a free and healthy surface. The feet require especial care, and it is too much the practice to neglect the omission of daily washing with water; and the wearing of foot coverings so tight as to compress the blood vessels and retard the circulation of the blood through the extremities are the most common causes of cold feet. The remedy is obvious ; dress loosely and wash frequently. The skin plays an important part in the preservation of bodily health.
