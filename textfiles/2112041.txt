OUR THOUGHT. Mary Whitcher. What is the strife of all our life, The great amount of good to do? To clear the wheat from chaff and cheat And help create all things anew. This honest toil is worth our while, And all that is worth living for; Who doeth well, will here excel In doing most during the war. We ask no gain in earthly fame, The peasant's hearth-stone seemeth well' Or earthly sod where known is God, Or where the truth and love can dwell. So linked is man with all God's plan What care, what fear should him possess, Yea, every breath is life or death, Or works are such to blight or bless. O' er ruling power, leave not one honr The little handful called of God To spirit life through earthly strife, For such would know the perfect word. Or such should stand so hand in hand. That life's fair current bringeth health, An active whole, and very soul Of life and liberty of earth. Canterbury, N. H.
