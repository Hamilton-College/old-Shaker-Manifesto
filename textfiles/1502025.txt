Kind Words. Br. Editor; the manifesto that comes to us... Shaker Station, Ct. Sept. 1884. Bit. Editor ; The Manifesto that comes to us each month so nice and trim, is thankfully received here and eagerly read by many. It contains truths that are eternal; and well worthy to be scattered abroad. As a' soul cordial it serves to stimulate and encourage the weary and care-worn pilgrim to still pursue their heavenly journey. We wish it God's speed on its glorious mission. Also our thanks and blessing for all who contribute in the least for its support, A. G.
