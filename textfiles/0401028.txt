THE NEW YEAR With magic key, he comes to ope Another realm for us to tread ; He bears the shining lamp of hope ; A crown of stars is on his head. All silently the crystal gate Swings forward on the field of snow; We enter, as by power of fate, And list its closing, soft and low. The bridge of ice that spann'd the moat Is drawn up on the other side ; For us there is no ferrying boat, No backward wave on which to glide; But footprints even now are seen ; Time waits not for the tardy feet, But onward speed*, to valleys green, To bloom of spring, and summer's heat. Then to the rainbow of the land — The season born of sun and frost — Whose half-bewild'ring glories stand Like sunset clouds on nature toss'd. But nought alluring can prevail; Though flaming leaves his pathway strew, He presses for the snowy vale, Where once again his life is new. And, as we contemplate his round, And view the miracles that rise, Rich lessons by our souls are found, That we may keep, to make us wise. The year expires upon the snow, And on the snow its life begins ; And, when we leave the life below, How slight the change the transit wins. It is for us to work, and bear Against the curse that bringeth death ; It is for us to gain and share The pow'r of the Almighty's breath. That pow'r that made a living soul Of him who was a mass of clay, Is needed, like the winds, to roll Upon humanity to-day. By revelation's light we read The grand old myths, and draw their worth See God hath sown the spirit-seed Through all the nations of the earth. O that each heart might but unfold, And let its hidden good appear: The treasured joy, all unforetold, Would crown and bless this true New Year. Cecelia Devyr, Mt. Lebanon
