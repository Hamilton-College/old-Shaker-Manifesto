Character Makes the Man.— The man of character is always the man of iron nerve ; he may be neither a great statesman nor politician; he may be humble in his associations and his aspirations ; but with all these exceptions, if he has character, his heart is right, his integrity is unshaken. He looks on truth with a clear vision, acting in accordance with its glorious dictates; he does not fear nor shun the face of his fellow-man, for his heart is white with integrity, and he looks humbly and trustingly up to the source of truth, and his fellowbeings, in a lowlier sense, look up to him because he is trustworthy, and, in short, has character— good and stable character. Character is the corner stone in individual greatness—the Doric and splendid column in the majestic structure of true and dignified man, who Is at once a subject and a king.
