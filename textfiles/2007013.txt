THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND. Martha J. Anderson. 'It was believed in the middle ages that the world would come to an end at the expiration of one thousand years of the Christian Era. This expectation in Christian countries was universal.' Oh age of darkness and of blind belief, When anxious millions waited in suspense To see destruction's flaming sword unsheath, The awful mysteries of Providence. All things terrestrial cringed and swayed Within the balance of his just decree, The Almighty fiat could not be delayed, Its consummation all would quickly see. The Lord of hosts would in the heavens appear, To judge the living and to raise the dead, The myriad throng of all the ages hear, Their doom by the recording angel read. A fearful apprehension seized the mind; The hours were numbered, and as criminals wait The final moment unto death assigned, Souls seemed transfixed in horror of their fate. When came the last day of the triple mines, The madness had attained its dizzy height, Imagination drew her sable lines Across the gleaming brow of morning bright. Palsied the arm of toil in busy marts, Deserted all the market places stood, Farm, field, and home of loving kindred hearts Were voiceless as the lonely solitude. No social meal was spread, no lighted fires, On household hearth gave out their cheerful glow. No gleam of hope the weary watch inspires, Or lights with joy the somber shades of woe. With faces blanched men met, nor even spoke Their hearts were chilled and warped with doubt and pain, An answering stare each others eyes invoke, The import terrible to them was plain. Stillness profound enwrapped all things, save when In churches met a grave and cheerless throng, Where every aisle and transept echoed prayer, Or caught the notes of penitential song. Those who had never sought Religion's shrine Fled to her courts as to a citadel, And with the faithful asked for aid divine, Their keen remorse and terror to dispel. That day and night�on watchfulness intent� No eye was closed, but all the vigil kept, Each knee in humble suppliance was bent. Entreatingly by turns men prayed and wept. No clocks were found in tower, or house or halls, But burning tapers marked the hour's round, And hold suspended little metal balls Which full at intervals with solemn sound. Dread fear intensified, each moment hath When a brief space of time remains between Life's certain end and God's impending wrath That draws the curtain on each earthly scene. * * * * But mercy is the Lord's ; revenge and hate Are the crude offspring of untutored minds, God rules by law, the schemes of chance and fate The progress of his trutli can never bind. Lo! in the east the beams of morning broke, And on the pallid watchers shed their light, A newborn century in glory woke, And superstition vanished with the night. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
