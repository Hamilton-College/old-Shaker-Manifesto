Sound Criticism In his sermon at the Tabernacle, Rev. Phillips Brooks said, as reported, that, 'the great part of life, after becoming a Christian, will be spent as before; we shall buy and sell and get gain ; but the purposes are all changed.' How the life remains the same, when the purposes are changed, we do not see. If religion does not change the life, what good does it do to change the purposes? We of course would not judge of a preacher's whole doctrine by a single sentence ; but this statement is a good picture of the practical effects of the popular religion. With all its professions, rites, and observances, it makes no special or permanent improvement in a person's character and conduct. A man is persuaded that he has had his heart or life ' sanctified,' when there has been no change in the impulses or aims of either ; and the result is, that though there are very good people in the church, the main difference between the 'ins' and 'outs' is a certain flavor or conceit of piety. That religion makes no change in the life, and we can buy and sell and get gain—and a good deal of it—as well after as before becoming Christians, may be popular and pleasing gospel; but to our view religion must go deeper than that.
