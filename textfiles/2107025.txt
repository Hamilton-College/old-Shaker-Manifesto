Enfield, N. H. June 14, 1891. 'We cannot do better in these times of uncertainty, of rearranging of matters dogmatical and ecclesiastical, than to repeat to each other the words of the Son of Man: 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be in the midst,' for the church that is going to satisfy the travail of the heart of Christ, is the one that most truly follows in the footsteps of his most blessed life.' We made a note of the above quotation from one of the Reverends, as being to the point; the opening words of counsel cannot but be good for any persuasion to follow, while the closing declaration is certainly an open question for all interested parties to satisfactorily answer individually. What church of all the many denominations claiming to save, 'most truly follows in the footsteps of his most blessed life.' In the daily Journal of present week, we read an account of one who had just finished reading the bible the one hundredth time, but for what purpose? no one was the wiser; our friend Tolstoi read it a deal less than that with a purpose, and was convinced that Christ never taught creed nor ritual, but a love universal. Evidently, the following to the letter of 'his most blessed life' would shake modern society from its foundations, and create a new order of things, and the change unless supernaturally ordained must indeed be gradual for 'The mills of God grind slow and sure.' But this is not writing about homeï¿½ much might be truthfully said about our valley home on the shore of as lovely a lake, as one need wish; no works of art are here displayed not even a well-ordered flower bed, which might be an improvement, but just a rustic leafy exuberance of tree and plant wTith uncaged birds filling the air with their tuneful melodies. I remember reading, that this season, the lawns and parks most resembling wild natural scenery are to be considered in best form, so while not essaying to bow to dame Fashion, we are in this line guilelessly becoming her subjects. Our thanks are due to the good, thoughtful Brother, who welcomed in advance, the company, who will, before these notes are in print, be on their long-anticipated trip to the several Societies they are to visit. We all wish them a pleasant, profitable outing; they will not leave us with a Saratoga trunk each, as do those who seek for pleasure and (un)rest at the respective resorts of the season, but may they return, with minds and hearts enriched with the imperishable treasure of a broadened love and interest, that shall cast a shadow of blessing, on those of us who remain within the precincts of our own dear home.
