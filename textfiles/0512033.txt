TRIBUTE Weed, Parsons &amp; Co., Publishing House, 39 &amp; 41 Columbia St., Albany. Our Brother, Wm. Offord, was from England, where he was Master Printer and Methodist Minister. After going through the above named Printing House, he remarked, ' I have never seen an office where the system was so perfect, the order so complete.' I indorse that opinion. F. W. Evans
