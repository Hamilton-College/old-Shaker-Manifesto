MARCH OF LIBERTY. I Contributed by Elder C. Dibble.] The cause of human redemption has its pioneers in every generation from Israel down. Succeeding ages, liberty had its adTocates. That nation which advanced according to light, prospered and escaped the curses due to tyranny. In Russia, in England and in our own joasted land of liberty there is a call for reform. Monopoly threatens to control Government and all business enterprise. Seats of Government are becoming theaters of amusement and dissipation, where aristocracy is encouraged and license is granted which makes widows and orphans, and fills prisons and almshouses. The toiling millions are asserting their right to live and breathe, think and speak, and possess an honest compensation. Men are advocating the right of the poor to a portion of the soil upon which they were born. The struggle of the masses is for existence and subsistence. It is no more nor less than the spirit of Moses praying the modern Pharoahs, to let the oppressed go free, to inherit God's blessings. Will they find relief, or shall the result of tyranny follow? We hear from every pulpit that if Christian love prevailed it would bring the Millennium; but how is brotherly love practical, without equality? Is aristocracy on one hand, and destitution and servitude on the other, congenial to brotherhood? Does the possession of millions give a Christian, license to lord it over his fellows? Slavery said so. The millionaires say so. Humanity, says so. Christianity says, Nay ; God is just to his children. The rich man and Lazarus will have their deserts. 'Oh men of wealth and station, Heed how you use your power, For clouds hang o'er our nation, That ioretell a sifting hour. There are little children pleading, For the precious bread of life, And souls the wine-press treading In agonies of strife. There are weary wives and mothers Whom the world might cheer and bless. There are lone despairing brothers, Whom your luxuries oppress.' Selected.
