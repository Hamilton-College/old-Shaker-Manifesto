Guardian Angels The Shakers do not claim that it is their apecial Mission to take cave of Orphans, although it is said that their conditions in life, and especially those of the Sisterhood, are well adapted to the charge of those little sufferers of earth. O were our eyes unsealed, Glad secrets to descry, What shining hosts would be revealed, Divinely hovering nigh. Bright Angels clothed with love, True Ministers of grace, In hovering circles gently move, To guide the erring race. Their gentle wings expand In truth it may be said; ' The lowliest saint, is rainbow spanned, The child is Angel led. And woman also shows She can be Angel too; The gentle mind reflects on those, Our dim eyes may not view. The garland that she weaves, Would grace the Savior's brow; 'Tis fragrant as the perfumed leaves, That by life's river grow. In dungeons, she is day; In sickness, solace mild; To the maimed, a staff; to the blind, a ray; She soothes the lonely child. And never doth she send More golden rays abroad, Than when she shines the Orphan's friend, And leads the child to God. Andrew Benner, Shirley. Mass
