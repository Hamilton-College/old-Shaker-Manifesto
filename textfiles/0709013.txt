WAR The beautiful working of war as a remedy for wrongs and a compensation for injustice is being strikingly illustrated in the East. The war was undertaken by Russia to revenge the Bulgarian atrocities, to improve the condition of the Bulgarians and other Turkish Christians, and advance Christ's kingdom generally. Already some twenty thousand men, Turks and Russians, have been killed, and twice as many mangled and maimed in Armenia, besides thousands who have died of disease. Thousands of Moslem and Christian homes in the track of the contending armies have been devastated and the families outraged or butchered. On the Danube the losses of life have thus far been less, but will be tenfold greater. The Bulgarians, whom the Russians came professedly to help, are being ground into fine powder between the two armies, and their fertile country has been made a complete desert on which the gaunt and famine-stricken people look down mournfully from the mountains in which the remnant have taken refuge. The streets of Constantinople are filled with soldiers' starving wives and children, of which the correspondents tell piteous stories, and all the other cities are similarly thronged. Mothers are selling their children for bread, and brothers their sisters. Famine will soon count its tens of thousands of victims.
