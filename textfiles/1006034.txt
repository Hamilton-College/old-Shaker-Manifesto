Editor Manifesto—A road machine — for repairing roads— made in this vicinity... Ayer, Mass., May 19, 1880 Editor Manifesto—A road machine — for repairing roads— made in this vicinity, is proving to be the best machine for the purpose extant. Towns about here are buying them ; and it is estimated that by their use twenty five per cent of the cost of repairing roads can be saved, and have better roads. Nearly all the work is done with teams, and the entire length of the road is formed in perfect shape. Elijah Myrick
