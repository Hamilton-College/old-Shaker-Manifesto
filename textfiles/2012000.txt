CHRISTMAS. Catherine Allen. Hail, happy season ! ever hallowed to our feelings, as commemorating the advent, not of the mortal birth of Jesus, or any preceding Avatar reverenced by the nations of antiquity, but of that redeeming spirit, the Savior of mankind, the Christ which prompted Jesus to say :�'Now 0 Father glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was;'�that spirit with which Jesus was baptized as he ascended from Jordan, when the heavens opened, and unto mortal vision was manifest a spiritual presentation in the form of a Dove, which abode upon him ; beautifully typifying that gift of peace of which he was the herald, bearing glad tidings of great joy. Then did he receive more deeply, we believe, than had any predecessor, of that divine unction from the 'Christ of the Ages'�which is co-eternal with the Father and Mother of all which has been revealed to mortals under various epochs of spiritual progress, and in degrees adapted to the needs and receptive capacity of those to whom it was given. But throughout all Christian lands, sr-called, how few celebrate the day writh fitness to the occasion ; and the thoughtful will ask, wherefore is the day appointed by the civil government? and why is it almost universally held as a feast day for the physical senses, when the term Christ-mass indicates only religious service? Under the reign of Constantine the G-reat, the Christian religion first became united to the State government, and from that time on, through Medieval ages, the two powers became more closely combined, until the edict of the Pope was the only authority recognized; but, under the constitution of the United States, the civil authorities have no more right to appoint a Christian holiday for universal observance, than special days for Jews, Buddhists, Mahometans, or any other religious sect. In regard to Christmas having become a feast day, we can only say that originally it was a religious ceremony of the Romish Church, in commemoration of the 'Lord's last supper,' and that with more anxiety to increase in numbers, than in spiritual power, the most sacred rites of the church were degraded, in order to accommodate them to the gross conditions of the people to whom they opened their doors. And the twenty-fifth of December having for ages been observed as one of joyful festivity by all nations of the Orient, as the day on which the sun passes through Capricorn, or the renewer of Life, for the purpose of drawing the multitudes then assembled from Pagan rites into those of the Christian Church, (?) no means were spared to render the latter attractive to the populace ; and thus was the Christ-mass held upon that day. Therefore, without the least assumption that it is the period of the birth of Jesus, the event is commemorated in the sternest season of the year, while it would seem that it was a genial season of verdancy and growth ; for we read that while shepherds watched their flocks by night, Bethlehem's star was seen, and under its soft gleamings, while keeping their silent watches, came floating down the strains of angel music which thrilled their souls : 'Peace on earth, good will to man.''' It would see in more appropriate to commemorate the advent of Christ's mission at a season when leaping rills, springing verdure, unfolding buds and all the glad voices of nature's spring, mingle in a chorus of rejoicing for the liberating power received from the sun, which is the most fitting emblem of the Christ Orb. Its life-giving radiance entering the hearts of humanity, releases from gloom and soulfreezing infidelity, awakens from spiritual inertia, melts the icy coverings of selfishness, unsealing deep fountains in the .soul, and quickening with ever expanding power those diviner germs, which bud with immortal hopes, blossom in the sweetness of true and pure desires, and bear precious fruitage in a life wrought in God. But, neither the season, nor the outward forms of celebration are important as compared with the spirit and motives which actuate. Decorating the churches with evergreens and flowers is a beautiful and fitting expression ; also the custom of bestowing suitable gifts, when offered in sincerity as tokens of the heart's gifts of love, peace and good will, especially when the poor and lowly are remembered in a tangible way ; thus bringing to mind one day in the year that equality and competence of blessings which may be enjoyed by all, when Christ's teachings shall have been so far accepted that man, through selfish greed shall no longer rob his brother man of an inheritance in the land, thus making of his labor and very life a mere commodity�practical slavery, resulting from the extensive systems of monopoly, all having their foundation in that of the land. But we, dear gospel friends, have entered the Millennium ;�a perpetual Sabbath unto the Lord�an eternal Christmas� a life in which is practically embodied all those glorious principles which it was the divine mission of Jesus to inaugurate ; and more than any other people, Believers have cause to rejoice in celebrating this day, not alone for the Fatherhood revealed through Jesus, but for the manifestation of the Heavenly Comforter, an unction from the Mother Spirit in Deity, that was poured out upon a little struggling band of whom Mother Ann Lee be- came the first anointed. Thus we, as Brethren and Sisters of the Household of Faith, having a, full Parentage, maj^ enjoy Heaven on earth, and make our home the abode of angels, thus fulfilling the prophecies and mission of Christ.
