[A letter from Br. Alonzo G. Hollister, of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. to Elder Robert Aitken, of Enfield, Ct.-] Mar. 12, 1884. Beloved Elder Robert ;�Your letter of February was thankfully received and entirely consonant with my faith, and understanding of gospel principles. The true followers of Christ cannot equal or excel the world in natural learning, and the investigations of science, without devoting all their time to it, as many of them do ; that would leave the true Christian no time to learn the gospel thus, such Christian professors would continue to be like the world ;� simply natural creatures. Br. William Bussell, of Groveland, N. Y. once wrote to me thus, 'As he cannot be a true teacher of science who has not studied it, until it has become, as it were, a part of his own being, ' So, I think, no one can be a true minister of the gospel of Christ, who has not practiced it until it has become his life clement; his deepest interest, and greatest treasure. For a time, at least, under the baptizing influence of the Holy Spirit, it takes all the power and attention of the mind that can be spared from the performance of temporal duties, to learn and practice the gospel. It is recorded that Mother Ann Lee said, 'You should make the way of God your occupation, the way of Ood is to be learned, as really as any trade; you learn to have faith; you learn to believe ; a man who has a trade is industrious, to work at it, and make a living ; and you ought to be as industrious, and as much engaged in the way of God.' If there is anything that can be called science, in this study, 1 know, by experience, that it is as different from natural, or physical science, as day is different from night, or as the spirit of God, or Divine Intelligence is different from the unintelligent element of matter. And these natural sciences, and their literature, can never form any part of the gospel message ; much less, mere human art, as painting, sculpture, fiction, which, in my estimation, constitute mere rubbish, a lumbering hindi-ance to a child of God. What the special advocates of a larger education desire is larger general and particular intelligence, culture, which I believe we can all agree to, but, let it be confined to the really useful and necessary. The Christian life is really the most intelligent, and most useful life to live, and will develop all the intelligence an individual is capable of, whether educated in book lore or not, that is, if lived earnestly, as exemplified in the life of Jesus, and his true and faithful followers. Education, truly defined, consists in drawing out, unfolding the faculties, and covers the whole ground of culture, directing action, study, letters, investigation, practice, natural and spiritual culture�the formation of character. As the physical body is first (so called) and is the medium for the growth and manifestation of mind, so natural knowledge comes before the spiritual in order of time, and is the medium of our proper relation to, and orderly connection with the affairs and duties of a merely temporal life ; it is, also, to a great extent, the instrumental medium for communicating the higher, or spiritual knowledge, from one to another. Peter and John were regarded as unlearned, illiterate, but the teaching of Jesus, and the enlightenment of the Ho- ly Spirit, and the community of intelligence in their little circle, more than compensated for lack of artificial training, such as Paul had, at the feet of Gamaliel ; and though Paul counted all his attainments as dung and dross, that he might win Christ, his developed and trained faculties became efficient instruments for good. During minority, before the mind has matured to the period for the quickening of the spiritual faculties, young people should diligently improve their opportunities to acquire all useful knowledge possible : not as an end, but as a means for greater usefulness. The more one knows, the easier it is to increase in knowledge ; but it is necessary, for our best interest, to exercise a care as to what kind of knowledge.�Mere knowledge is not grace, nor wisdom, intellectual culture ; educated talent, when consecrated to the advancement of the Cause of Christ, is so much progress toward that eventful epoch when the Kingdoms of this world shall become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ; ' it is beautiful. But, mere learning, or any grace of simple intellectual culture can never be appropriate as a substitute for the graces and gifts of the spirit, which are ample to require the whole time and attention to gain and cultivate, after we have become alive in the resurrectien element. For, when a soul is waked up to God, to feel the need of being born again, it will feel the need of crying to God as though there was no other soul on earth. It will have done with its own way and will, and cry to God, knowing that it must be delivered, or die. We can conceive intense prayer to be compatible with hand labor, but not with intellectual pursuits of the literary productions of the world, nor with the philosophical investigations of natural science. The two elements are as different as air and water. When a soul is born of the spirit, then commences a spiritual education which can be but little assisted by natural learning, none at all by mere worldly literature, and, if souls would progress in the new life thus begun, the spiritual education should be kept in the lead, in all life's motives, but, of course, with due regard to the duties and responsibilities of the temporal life. Society has suffered much pecuniarily, and not a little spiritually on account of persons whose calling was to do business, not keeping proper and correct book accounts of business transactions, hence, it is a necessary qualification to lr-ive a good knowledge of book-keeping; however, it is not needful, in a community, for every person to understand book-keeping ; nor is it needful for every person to understand the science of astronomy, of electricity, of mineralogy, etc., etc. But, eacli person should be qualified for positions appropriate to talents given, and duties assigned, while those branches of science, or philosophy, which prospectively, the individual cannot apply to life's duties and interests, may, with propriety, be neglected, and the time and life be employed in those pursuits which are needful to prepare for the Kingdom of God ; those important to the well-being and happiness of the soul. Elder James Whittaker wisely said, 'The way to labor for the Gospel is, to keep your minds exercised in laboring upon those things which belong to your peace, aud not upon the things of the world, that are not in the line of your duty ; for if you give vour minds to labor upon such : worldly things, they will become corrupt, ed. ' Again, 'I warn you Brethren, not to be overcome with the cares of this world, lest your souls lose the power of God and you become lean and barren.' This is the kind of education needful for a Christian, again said Elder James, ' I Avill tell you how you can always know the way of God ; the way of God is always right against a carnal nature ; and a carnal nature is directly against the way of God.' However, natural learning does not appear opposed to a carnal nature, though we all acknowledge that a degree of it is very serviceable and necessary. The world of mankind will not gather to the Christian fold to obtain that which they possess among themselves, and, probably, in a greater degree of perfection, without the gospel; but for what the gospel contains which they do not possess. Those who have not the gospel cannot get it only from those' who have it in possession. If, when the world come to Zion, her children have not the gospel, that will be Zion's loss, and the loss of Zion seekers. But, the earth has produced a few god like characters in the past; and, we believe the future will be prolific of many, many more. The childhood of the race has passed away from some advanced souls, and they have matured to the perfect dawn of the kingdom of everlasting righteousness, whose teachers, or light bearers, shall not be removed into a corner any more. And the judgment hath been given to the people of the saints of the Most High, who will break the oppressors' rod, and reprove, or argue with equity for all the meek of the earth ; and the curse shall be lifted from rhe sinner who will mend his ways ; and their dominion shall be from ocean to ocean, and their kingdom and glory shall endure forever. Your Brother, Alonzo G. Hollister.
