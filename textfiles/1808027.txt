The most widely known author in the Russian Empire... The most widely known author in the Russian Empire, Count Tolstoi, has resigned from the military service, and, retiring to his estates some miles from Moscow, is engaged in the peaceful pursuits of agricultural life and in writing essays and books, which he believes will benefit the people far more than the pursuits which formerly so engaged his attention What brought about this remarkable change? Simply the study of Christ's Sermon on the Mount, with the resultant conviction that all wars were forbidden by the Prince of Peace. Great need there is that the rulers, legislators, and people generally of professedly Chiistian States should heedfully consider that explicit declaration of our Lord : 'My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight.'
