Union Village, O. Mar. 1894. We have been trimming apple trees off and on all winter. We have two or three hundred more to trim and then we shall 96 THE MANIFESTO. wait for a harvest of fruit with some solicitude; for we have had no fruit of any kind to speak of for two years. But right here one of the gravest questions of life presents itself to me, how much does happiness consist of, and depend on, what we eat, drink and wear? According to the teaching of our Savior there was almost nothing at all in eating, drinking and wearing to make one permanently happy. Indeed, though they are animal pleasures, how very soon they pall! how soon they pass away, their remembrance is scarcely worth calling up. Hundreds of thousands of English, Irish, Germans and French live on two or three varieties of plain, simple food, and among them may he found some of the most happy, contented and cheerful people on earth. I suppose heaven is a condition of happiness, but Jesus said it did not consist in eating and drinking, but in 'Righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.' These elements emanate from, and are the attributes of the Eternal; and when permanently possessed they are an eternal treasure, one that can never fail. For instance; suppose I was in possession of these elements permanently, (and I think that is about the region I hail from,) then along comes the frost and kills all my fruit. What do I care? there are other things I can eat. Next the cattle die in the stall. Still there are bread and vegetables. These are quite sufficient to support animal life and that is all I need them for. But, suppose I am euchred out of my farm, houses and all I possessed, then what? Why I must become a town charge and eat very coarse food sufficient to keep soul and body together, and wear coarse clothes. What now? In such extremity will those elements of 'Righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit' still uphold me, and furnish serenity and contentment of mind and satisfied at-one-ment with God? If they will not, I am utterly undone, for all temporal and earthly resources have failed me. If they will not, then the Savior's words are not true and he has deceived me, broken his promise and left me in suicidal despair. I believe as much as I believe that the sun will rise to-morrow, that though these calamities should overtake me, I could meet them with content- * ment and Christ-like resignation and enjoy all that peace and happiness our Holy Savior promised and which he called the kingdom of heaven. As this kingdom emanates from the eternal source of all good, it is so plenteous in power and such perpetual duration, that no such outward adversities should or could shake it to pieces. I have labored long and seriously on this subject, because I found myself in days gone by placing my interest in the enjoyment of what was good to eat, drink and wear; an elegant home and plenty of every thing even to luxury. I suddenly waked up to the utterly fugitive character of all earthly treasures even 'wealth like London Bank;' seeing that cyclone, cataclysm or holocaust might sweep them away at any time in a moment. Then where would I be if my heart was set upon them to the exclusion of my higher interests? All day after our fearful cyclone in 1886, I sat viewing and pondering over the solemn desolation spread around and it was a very momentous lesson to me of what fugitive materials, houses, lands, eating and drinking were on which to build for happiness. When our South Building went up in fire and smoke, the painful lesson was repeated with agonizing emphasis. These things all forced me to seek first, last, and all the time 'the kingdom of heaven within' and the Shekina of that God who sits enthroned thereon. I have found it and am ready for any thing that may come. We visited South Union on Jan. 30th and returned Feb. 27th. General prosperity there. Ninety-one persons in the Society. No debts. Some little repairing going on and more in prospect. At Union Village the gardens are opening, and the weather delightful. Elder Napoleon has a few hundred grape-vines THE MANIFESTO. 97 with which he is taking no end of pains; also he has an enormous amount of young apple, pear, peach, plum and cherry trees on hand. Elder Joseph has set oft' a piece of ground for a raspberry and blackberry garden. My best love to all the promoters and producers of the most interesting of all magazines,ï¿½The Manifesto. 0. C.
