My Dear Manifesto Daniel Orcutt :—I have long contemplated writing to you from a deep sense* of gratitude, for I feel that I owe you much. I have resolved to do so, as you monthly appear at my Zion-home. I cannot withhold my acknowledgment longer with a peaceful conscience. How earnestly I we]-. come your coming; how eagerly I peruse your columns ; how much I find in them 'hat is pure and elevating. Every article contains good instruction. How beautiful you appear in your dress ; the type so clear, the paper so white and firm. I am made better for having communed with the minds that teach through your pages; and in this I only express the sentiments of thousands of others. Accept heartfelt thanks for holding up such a, pure, standard of life, and inspiring me with earnest endeavor toward the right. When writing to distant friends I tell them of your merits. Let me express my appreciation of your untiring efforts in spreading truth and purity; it is labor that all cross-bearers delight in. Twenty years ago I began to follow Christ, and the prize I THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 183 am bound to win. How sweet are the hours I spend in His service. Can I do too much for the cause of purity ? My spirit answers firmly, nay, not half enough, though I toil incessantly. ' My thanks to God cannot be told, that I was called into the fold.' How .comforting the thought that salvation is free — to all who work for it. 'Work out our own salvation.' Oh ! dear Manifesto you hold a place in my heart that no other periodical fills. That all who read your pages, clean and pure, may be true Christians, is the prayer of one who desires to be 'numbered with the Lord's jewels.' Wishing you all success, in gospel love, , Enfield, Ct.
