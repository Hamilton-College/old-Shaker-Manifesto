Sabbathday Lake, Me. Feb. 1895. Our winter can not continue a great while longer, for here it is Candlemas day, and we have not seen the sun but it has been clouds and storm all day. ISTow if the old saying is true, 'Winter is gone and will not come again.' We have had but very few hard storms, but there is a great deal of snow on the ground and the Brethren are improving the opportunity, hauling out the big logs from the pine woods. Br. Henry Green of Alfred is with us this week assisting in getting out the poplar strips from which the Sisters make their basket work. Our Brother Henry is always welcome here and his coming this time has especially gladdened the hearts of the children as he has brought them the present of a chair swing which will be erected under some shady tree. Thus THE MANIFESTO. 69 they are anticipating a great deal of pleasure, for the coming summer. The integrity and fidelity of Br. Henry is widely known at the Summer Resorts of New England, where he spends the season, making sales of the fancy work for this Society and Alfred. He is a noble representative of our Order of life. The Sisters have woven some very pretty plush rugs which will find a ready sale when the season opens. School is still in progress and will continue for some weeks yet. We record a successful term with twenty-two pupils. Ada S. Cummtnys.
