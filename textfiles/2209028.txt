INQUIRY. No. 7. What is the fee of admission to a Shaker Society? No fee of -admission is demanded of any one. No considerations of property are ever made use of to induce a person to enter the Society, nor to prevent any one from leaving it. Having for its basis a well-ordered, religious life, with its principles of consecrated interest and separation from the life of the world, it teaches the Father and Motherhood of God, and the Brother and Sisterhood of mankind.
