West Pittsfield, June 12, 1877 Brother Albert: Noticing that correspond ence occasionally enters the columns of our neat and good little paper, we venture to send yovi a part of a letter from a friend in Pennsylvania, who visited us about four years since. That visit is the only one she has ever made us. So you see her opportunity for becoming acquainted with the principles, or manner of Shaker life, has been very limited. Her sentiments may, like the single fruit-seed dropped by the wayside, be spiritually utilized by some weary, earthly pilgrim. We trust that all sentiments in favor of right living will assume its proper place in the spiritual unfpldment of humanity. Professing to be children of the ' resurrection,' we feel it our high privilege to be in sympathy with the testimony—with every repeti tion of testimony, purposing restraint to perverted passions and appetites—the sinful ways of an unregenerated self-pleasing class, from which so much misery, suffering and degradation are realized at the present time. ' The Shaker' certainly holds a worthy place in the Christian's cause, and obtains our truest sympathy; hope its vitality will remain so good that it may continue to edify, refresh and instruct us in those things which are ' altogether lovely.' Good health prevails, and our doctors now have a chance to oversee and to make their gardens. We close with kind love. Betsey Johnson
