REFLECTION. MARY WHITCHER. How little we know what awaits us, Yet still we have trust in a God; Who kindly will lead and protect us If subject to his guiding word. Thf heat of our Summer has passed us, And fruits of our Autumn been reap'd, But we have no fears of the Winter While stores of our gathering are kept. We find there's a rest for the weary, Not silent or hid from earth's care, But change from an arduous labor To quiet employment and prayer. We've prayed always, e'en from our childhood When form gave us thought of the same, But now we have no need reminding Our thought is our prayer without name. Canterbury, N. H.
