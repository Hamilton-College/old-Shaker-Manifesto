A Nebraska Custom that Should be Adopted in Every State and Territory One of the most poetical, as well as practical, official papers of the succession of messages and manifestoes that the year has brought forth, is the proclamation of the Governor of Nebraska, wherein he appoints the second Wednesday of April as Arbor Day. Governor Nance sees the beautiful as well as the useful side of this custom, and almost forgets the precise diction of official documents and falls into more elegant phraseology. The people are enjoined to leave their business, to forsake the shop, the plow, the mill, to forget trade and agriculture, for one day, and to plant trees. ' Let it be remembered,' the proclamation concludes, 'that those who plant trees build living monuments to their own industry, and are benefactors of mankind, while benefiting themselves.'
