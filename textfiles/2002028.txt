Enfield, Conn. Shaker 'gilt edge' butter is in good demand. Thirty hundred pounds were soJd last year. The quality of butter depends more on the skill of the operator than on the plan of operation. If choice butter can be produced more easily in one way than in another, and at less expense, that is the way to adopt, regardless of the fact that the same butter can be made in other ways. We shall begin feeding ensilage in February. We should learn how to feed corn, including the stalks as well as the grain, to the best advantage. The silo is teaching us this, whether we convert it into ensilage, or cure it and feed it dry, after running it through the cutter. Care should be exercised in feeding poultry or they will get over fat and lay softshelled eggs. Poultry-men often think softshelled eggs come from a want of lime, but this is a mistake. Hens fed properly will not lay soft-shelled eggs. If there is trouble of this kind, feed bran, hay, chaff and a few oats. Squashes are excellent food for hens if given occasionally, with warm feed. The fquashes should be boiled and mixed with ground oats and cob-meal. This should be tried as it is something not generally fed poultry during the winter. D. Orcutt.
