NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Ja-. 6 1890. Bro. Henry George with some help from one of the young Brethren, finished trimming last week our soutli Orchard, it's appearance is improved ten-fold, the Brethren finished thrashing grain early in Dec, and in Nov. they improved the gravel walk between our family and the Church. I heartily agree with our zealous Bro. Daniel Ofibrd in having a board or commitee to look after public improvements, there have been some responses, let us have more of them and then carry our good resolutions into effect, � T. R. Beloved Elder Henry :�Tin New Year had rather a sad beginning with us Sister Ehoda Hollister fell in the hall fracturing her hip. Some of our friends well know the affliction that brings, and also the opportunity it gives for the exercise and development of the beautiful virtue, patience. We have recently put up a private telephone line through our village, and i\ aching to Canaan. All who will, (of the families) can now, hitch on and make our bond of union stronger. I have been thinking, that in the near fulure we should have a tangible line erected between this, our world, and the summer land we sing about. Spiritualism is the science of sciences, and will in due time unfold to our mortal vision some very wonderful things. No sleighing here, and only a little snow. Have had a few cold days, but to-day it was just like spring. January Manifesto arrived in good time and pronounced good. D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. Cutting fire wood is the work of the day. The Second Family have built a new house for swine, are also building a new ice-house, 20x40ft. They have commenced feeding ensilage from their silo, which, is 12x24 and 22 ft. deep. As this is their first trial they are unable to say much about it at present, only that it already turns out better than expected. Very little snow thus far, but plenty of mud and changeable weather, good for colds. Enfield, Conn. Shaker 'gilt edge' butter is in good demand. Thirty hundred pounds were soJd last year. The quality of butter depends more on the skill of the operator than on the plan of operation. If choice butter can be produced more easily in one way than in another, and at less expense, that is the way to adopt, regardless of the fact that the same butter can be made in other ways. We shall begin feeding ensilage in February. We should learn how to feed corn, including the stalks as well as the grain, to the best advantage. The silo is teaching us this, whether we convert it into ensilage, or cure it and feed it dry, after running it through the cutter. Care should be exercised in feeding poultry or they will get over fat and lay softshelled eggs. Poultry-men often think softshelled eggs come from a want of lime, but this is a mistake. Hens fed properly will not lay soft-shelled eggs. If there is trouble of this kind, feed bran, hay, chaff and a few oats. Squashes are excellent food for hens if given occasionally, with warm feed. The fquashes should be boiled and mixed with ground oats and cob-meal. This should be tried as it is something not generally fed poultry during the winter. D. Orcutt.
