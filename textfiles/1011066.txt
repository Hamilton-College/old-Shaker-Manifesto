IMPURE WATER-TOADS AND SQUIRREL IN WELLS The quantity and variety of filthy matter which is found deposited at the bottom of wells, in some localities, are astonishing. We recently had occasion to examine the debris taken from a well which had been cleaned the year previous, and among the accumulation were decaying toads and squirrels. These creatures had been probably attracted by the water, to reach which they had clambered down the wall till they reached the solid rock into which, for several feet, the well had been excavated, when they were precipitated to the bottom, and could not retrace their steps. To obviate a repetition of the same annoyance the stone well has been removed down to the solid rock, relaid in hydraulic cement, and carried some three feet above the surface of the ground and finished for some distance around the top with cement underlaid with stones. On this solid foundation a curb has been so closely fitted as to exclude even crickets and grasshoppers, which are so apt to find their way into wells. To those who detest impure water and would avoid perhaps the sickness of an entire family, the above plan, or the adoption of some better precaution against the contamination of wells, is recommended. This is the season when springs and wells are usually low of water, and therefore it is the best time for cleaning the bottom of the latter and repairing the walls if found defective.â€”[Scientific American.
