HOPE. MARIA T. SHULTZ. Art thou the Angel Hope? Come in ! come in ! My heart to thee doth gladly ope Its door within. Come in, and bring the light Of thy bright smile ; My soul is tired and sad, to-night, Stay, yet awhile! The world is dark and drear; The skies hang low : Unveil thy face of happy cheer, I need thee so ! A dark-robed Angel walks The world to-day,� Her tears of sad and bitter thoughts Bestrew the way. Dost not know sorrow? Oh ! How blest art thou ! And yet,�that both of thee I know, I thank God now. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
