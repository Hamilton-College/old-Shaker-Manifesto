Beecherisms There is an'ugly kind of forgiveness in this world,—a kind of hedgehog forgiveness, shot out like quills. Men take one who has offended and set him down before the blowpipe of their indignation and scorch him, anc burn his fault with him: and, when they have kneaded him sufficiently with their fiery fists, then—they forgive him. There are many persons who think they are Christians because they have had experience ; but they do not feel it to be their Christian duty to use their tongues according to the laws of kindness. Nor do they think, in the confession of their sins, to confess that day in and day out, they are making somebody unhappy by the manner in which they use that member.
