ANGEL HELP JOANNA RANDALL Floating upon the balmy breeze, And where the evening zephyrs play, Are hovering angel visitants To cheer life's troubled way. They sing to us in purest strains And seek a listening ear. To raise our wayward thoughts, into A holier atmosphere. Welcome sweet guardian ministers, Come nearer to our souls ; Inspire us to nobler deeds Through daily self-control. O'er shadow with baptismal fire Which burns with 'Truth and Light, Forming a principle within,— The maintenance of right. At breaking dawn at dewy eve And noon-day's resting hour, We'll heed your gentle whisperings, Your presence still implore. Stay with us loving spirit friends, For selfish cares intrude Without your chastening influence, So rich in heavenly food. 0 bless us still with living faith Which makes us brave and strong, To meet the seeming ills of life With charity for all. And in this strength we'll soar aloft From selfishness and strife A resolution oft renewed, To live the 'Angel life.' Shirley, Mass. A clergyman on his way to church, one Sunday, was overtaken by a heavy shower of rain. On arriving at the vestry, he exclaimed, rather impatiently, 'I wish, I were dry.' Never mind said his colleague, you will soon be in the pulpit, and there you will be dry enough.—Frank Leslie, Ill
