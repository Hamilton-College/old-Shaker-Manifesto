GROWING RIGHT By S. D. Marsh. We are growing out, or growing in, We're growing in goodness, or in sin. We're growing upward, or growing down, Whiche'er we will to shame or renown! We are growing right, or growing wrong, We stand not idle often, or long! The way's before; the right or the left, 'Tis ours to choose the worst, or the best, ' Tis easy to choose when days are all bright The hills all clothed with verdure and light It needs the furnace, to temper the blade, In conflict with wrong are heroes made, Growing in goodness is growing in peace, As life grows short, will triumphs increase. With face to the right, scorning the wrong, Let's be doing while active and strong, 'Gird on the armorâ€”eyes to the right!' 'Charge!' See, evil has vanished from sight! Selected
