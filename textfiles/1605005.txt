OUR MISSION. ABRAHAM PERKINS. By many the duties of life seem little comprehended; The prophet Isaiah informs us, that a way was to be opened, in which ' wayfaringmen, though fools, shall not err therein. ' This way is before us ; and to walk in it is simply to be faithful in all the demands, concatenations and walks of life, so far as we have a revelation of the principles of truth and right. As the evidence of a thing confirms its existence, so faith is established, the soul is convicted and conscience demands respect thereto, followed by an obligatory obedience to the knowledge of light received. In its embrace, not only our acts and words are evolved, but our habits, our manners and very thoughts must be brought into subserviency to principles that tolerate nothing other than angelic perfection. We are not justified in human frailties, simply because we are human ; indeed we are to become as gods, indued with a power akin to almighty, to be able to fulfill the destined mission of man. Man is subject to many annoyances. He is not infrequently baffled in the execution of the best and wisest of plans and prevented the performance of acts, on which hang the laws of health, the means of the support of life, of prosperity financially, of measures for acquiring knowledge upon subjects vital to manhood, to character and even the destiny of souls. And here comes in the demands for the patience of saints. Under such circumstances, the right of self-defense, of proper and legitimate dignity and securing religious liberty and Christian protection, would present its claims as justice and as a binding force of moral duty, when to fulfill Christian obligation, there existed but feeble power to maintain the Christ spirit. How true the testimony,ï¿½'Strait is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and few there be who find it!' With the knowledge of this fact, the professed Christian can but feel the importance of steps the most careful and well directed, of action the most measured and purpose the most fixed and resolute, lest in some unguarded hour, some moment of temptation or trial, he makes a false move ; consequently his vision becomes obscure, and thus he loses the path which leads to deliverance. We should comprehend that the grand object of the creation of man is lost, unless eternal life, the acme of human labor, the end of human existence is found ; and may it be remembered, this is never obtained, only as it is sought, and which is sure to be acquired, if our physical, moral and spiritual obligations are faithfully regarded. Hence a life in Christ generates godly fear, which is a restraint upon every species of vice, an inhibition of any and every act of defilement, and every color and shade of iniquity ; it is a protest to every habit, manner, word or act, that is uncultivated or gross, and death to every phase of life of a sensual or worldly character. Hence to every well developed and intelligent mind, it is self-evident our mission is perfect obedience to known light, and true submission to every revelation of truth, to the slaying and destruction of every idol and selfish passion of the heart.
