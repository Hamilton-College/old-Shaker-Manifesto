KEY OF KNOWLEDGE. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. It is written in the wisdom of the East, 'All that we are, is the result of what we have thought�it is founded on our thoughts�it is made up of our thoughts.' Why? Because all action begins in the mind, and thought is both the action of mind, and a product that remains to influence future conduct. This being the power of thought, by controlling our thoughts, and fixing our attention on the things that pertain to our peace, we can school ourselves out of the imperfections of our natural birth, and of defective early training, into that which we wish to be. For whatever the mind or attention dwells upon that will grow, and as all deliberate action is first acted in thought, thought is the key to any desired change of conduct. Hence the proclamation of the gospel was introduced by the exhortation to repent, reform�that is, according to the original Greek, change your mind, your purpose, the thoughts and intents of your heart. Detach in a measure your interest from the visible and transient things of the present life, which now absorb your whole attention, and fix your thoughts upon the unseen and eternal inheritance in the life to come, 'for the reign of the heavens is at hand.' Without this necessary preparation, and earnest seeking, how can any one discover the presence of that' 'reign of God' which cannot be perceived by outward eyes? Thought guided by true desires, and duly translated into deeds, overcomes all obstructions to the soul's advance in righteousness, penetrates all false disguises, and scans all mysteries of Divine wisdom, truth and love, bestowed upon mortals for their uplifting from the earthly and transient, to the heavenly and eternal life. Mother Ann prayed three days and three nights without intermission that God would grant her true desires, and when she received the answer to that prayer, it was ample compensation for all it cost. 'If your eve is on the Eternal,' writes an intuitive Seer, 'your intellect will grow, and your opinions and actions will have a beauty which no learning nor combined advantages of other men can rival.' My own intelligence responds, 'it is true.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
