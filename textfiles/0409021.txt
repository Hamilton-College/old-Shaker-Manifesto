TEMPERANCE The things of old must pass away, That long o'er man has held the sway, And trampled on his dearest rights, And closed his eyes and dimm'd his lights. Of such is wine, so long renown'd, That laid the patriarch on the ground ; The Lord of Lords that seals their fate, The King of kings that rules in state. Such is the glory of the cup, The high, the low, the rich will sup ; And from the days of Noah down, The laws could only on it frown. All helpless now before its sway, Yet hope inspires a better day, For God hath said tfhe strong must fall, Before the weak, who conquer all. No crowned heads norscepter'd host Will in that day of courage boast; But truth shall guide the actors well, And prayer and praise in accents swell. Emmory C. Brooks, Groveland, N. Y.
