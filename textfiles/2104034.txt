The Bible Class. Answer to Bible Question No. 19... Answer to Bible Question No. 19, published in the March Manifesto. Name a verse that contradicts a statement made in Isaiah, fortieth chapter and fourth verse. 'Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and bill shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made straight; and the rough places plain.' Mount Lebanon returns this answer which is found in Eccl. i., 15: 'That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.' This was the accepted answer of the whole class which numbers more than thirty pupils. Canterbury returns the same answer from twelve pupils. Enfield, N. H. returns the same from thirteen pupils. It is remarkable that all have sent in the same answer. This decision is unanimous, and the Bible students are worthy of many thanks. As the answer was the same as that received with the question, it need not, necessarily, be repeated. BIBLE QUESTION. No. 20. Who fimb served butter to his guests, and on what occasion?
