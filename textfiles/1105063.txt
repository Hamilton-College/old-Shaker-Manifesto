CHRIST'S DISCIPLE ' If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.' (Luke ix, 23.) Would you be my disciple? Consider again. Can ye follow my footsteps thro' trial and pain? ('an you throw away pleasure and glory and fame. And live but to honor my cause and my name?' . Can ye turn from the glitter of fashion and mirth, And dwell like a pilgrim and stranger on earth. Despising your riches, and living to bless ? Can you follow the feet of the shelterless? Can ye ask from your heart the forgiveness of men? Can ye list to reproaches nor answer again? Can ye pray that repentance in life may be theirs. Who've watched for you falling, who've set for you snares? When ye hear I am coming, oh, say, can you rise, The joy of your heart springing up in your eyes ? Can ye come out to meet me, where'er I may be, Though ye come on the waves of the storm crested sea? When I call can ye turn, and in gladness depart From the home of your sunshine, the friends of your heart? With nought but my promise in which to rely, Afar from your loved can ve lie down and die? Can ye take up the cross that was heavy for me, The scoffing and scorn my discipline to be ? Blest saviour, thou knowest the weakness of man ; With strength that thou givest we answer, we can.
