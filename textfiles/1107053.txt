Agricultural HORNLESS CATTLE A farmer who owns forty-seven head of hornless cattle gives in the Western Rural his reasons for preferring them. He says: ' First they are about as harmless as a flock of sheep ; second, sheep, colts and horses can run in the same pasture or yard, and drink out of the same tank, with perfect safety; third, it is sometimes necessary to milk in a storm, and I have only to open the cow-stable door and twelve cows will not take more room than three pairs of horns ; fourth, a straw rick two rods long and twenty feet wide will make a first-rate shelter for thirty head of young mulley stock; for they will soon have the rick shelved all around, lie down like so many hogs, and be comfortable under the edges of the stack, while six pairs of horns could hardly be accommodated on the same territory. I never have had my horses wounded, or colts, sheep, calves, children, women, or men tossed upon mulley-bull's horns. My stock are descendants of the old English red mulley breed.' WATERING HORSES If after feeding hay and then oats we allow a horse to take a large drink of water, a considerable part of the oats will be carried by the water into the intestines, and he get little of the advantage of feeding the oats after the hay. If such a drink is taken soon after eating hay alone, the effect will not be so injurious, because hay does not need so long a time for digestion as grain. If only one or two quarts of water are allowed, it will pass the food in the stomach without changing its position to any great extent. When the stomach has got rid of a considerable portion of its contents, it seems a difficult matter for it to force out the remainder, and fermentation and colic sometimes result. A drink of water at such a time, by carrying on the substance which has remained long enough, relieves the condition. This probably explains why some horse-car companies have found it advisable to have their horses watered at midnight.â€” Rail's Journal of Health
