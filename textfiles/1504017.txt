Dear teacher; As I have had the... Shaker Village, N. H. Jan. 1885. Dear Teacher ;--As I have had the opportunity to be at school a few weeks, I thought I would write you a short letter so as to let you see how much I have improved the time given to me to learn that which is intelligent and noble. I know I cannot be a good scholar unless I take pains to study for myself. As I have been at school four Summers, I think I should show improvement in all that I do. I feel very interested learning to draw maps and also learning to read nicely. I think we should spend our school days as the happiest days of our lives in trying to see how much we can learn. With much love. Your pupil, C. H. Age, 14 years.
