New England Magazine 'On trial' to new subscriber-six months 50c. An article that will attract and interest all members of evangelistic organizations, is 'The Christian Endeavor Movement' in the June New England Magazine, of Boston, Mass. It is written by three hands, and deals with the beginnings and methods and aims of the organization in a thoroughly comprehensive fashion. The President of the United Society of Christian Endeavor, Rev. Francis E. Clark, whose name is inseparably linked with the movement as the originator of it, opens with an account of 'The Early Days of the Society.' Amos R. Wells, the editor of the Golden Rule, the organ of the society, deals with it as 'A New Religious .Force,' and touches upon its relation and helpfulness to the churches; and John 'Willis Baer, the Secretary of the Society, in 'The Outlook and the Opportunity,' describes the possible growth and future of the movement. The article is very fully illustrated with portraits of many of the trustees and with most of the presidents of the different state organizations. In fact, every Christian Endeavorer will find the familiar faces of old friends there, no matter which part of this great country he or she may hold friends in. This great movement from New England is fittingly present in this great Magazine. '
