Letter Box Shaker Village. N. H. Mar 1883. 'Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation.' Matt, xxvi, 41. By continually watching and praying, we are kept from a great deal of wrong that we would not otherwise be able to resist; because it would keep us always on guard. I was taught from early childhood to pray before retiring to rest at night, and on rising in the morning; but the first time I ever was impressed with prayer, was a short time after I came among the Shakers. My teacher took me into her room one morning, before going to school, and prayed in my behalf. I then for the first time felt and saw the necessity of prayer to God I saw where I had neglected it, and for what I needed to pray most. Mother Ann Lee said that she could say in truth, 'My every breath is continual prayer to God.' May I cultivate this spirit. M. E. K. 14 yrs.
