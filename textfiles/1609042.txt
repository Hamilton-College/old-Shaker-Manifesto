KIND WORDS. Dear sir; Allow me to return... North Carolina Library Department. Raleigh, July 1st. 1886. Editor Manifesto, Dear Sir;�Allow me to return thanks for THE MANIFESTO, which you have so kindly furnished our State Library. There are very few magazines or papers received at the Library that I enjoy reading more than the Manifesto, and I look forward to its arrival with unusual interest. If there is any one class of literature that I en. joy above another, it is such that tell us of the labors of noble men and women who have made sacrifices, and laid down their lives in the service of the MASTER. Such reading I always find in The Manifesto, and after perusing its pages, I feel refreshed, take courage, and return thanks to the Lord in permitting us to live in the 19th. century and giving us the privilege of reading accounts of persecutions, trials, etc., of the saints who have gone before and are awaiting us beyond the river. Again thanking you for The Manifesto, I have the honor to be Yours very truly J. C. Birdsong, Librarian Dear sir: I have the honor to... Greencastle, Ind., May 10th 1886.
