GLORY TO THE RIGHTEOUS. The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.' Ps. CXII. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Glory to the righteous, Who can knowtheir work?'I have heard from the uttermost parts of the earth;' For the praises of virtue will ever be sung,While truth fills the heart and inspires the tongue, And a sweet benediction from heav'ns above, Is a crown of recompense and fulness of love, For those who to God their service have giv'n While creating on earth the Kingdom of Heav'n.
