INTERIOR LIFE CECELIA DEVYR Seek not within the darkness of the earth. Thy friends nor flowers ; For lo ! their spirits have a radiant birth Through death's dim hours. Ask for the myst'ry hidden in the light, For eyes are blind ; Seek for the veil that screens all mortal sight. And heaven thou'lt find. 'Tis but the olden root the sod conceals, The flowers are new; A re-creative power, the spring reveals Through heat and dew. The simplest blossom of the mountain-pass, A marvel seems; When 'neath the magic of wondrous glass Its beauty beams. And yet within this revelation, hides A marvel still— A life—a presence calmly there abides, That makes us thrill. Only the eye clairvoyant can behold The spirit flower; Gath'ring its robes of purple pearl and gold, In dying hour. And yet, the eye clairvoyant like the lens, A limit finds; The infinite creation, so transcends Our girded minds. The sun that gives to us this fertile ball, Has jealous light, That shuts out with a golden roof and wall, The stars of night. And thus the life external wraps the soul In fervid beams; Conceals the glories that around it roll, Beyond its dreams. Yet still, we wonder that we know in part, And only so ; And mourn to think, the garden of the heart In growth is slow. But death will make the spirit powers complete ; And angels bring Blest words, wherein life's holy meanings meet ; Wake, it is Spring. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
