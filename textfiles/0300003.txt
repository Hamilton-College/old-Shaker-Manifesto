Dearly-Beloved Elder Frederick, In the spirit of humility, feeling our incompetence to do justice to even our own thoughts and wishes, at this time, owing to the preparation necessary to be made by the writer for a journey to the two New Hampshire Societies, in company with three of our sisters, to-morrow A. M. We would very briefly say: That we have great interest in your Social Gatherings. Would dearly love to drop in personally — as we shall certainly strive to in Spirit. Our love and sympathy will surely be there, rejoicing with you in the precious Gospel of salvation from sin ; in the sweet hope that, at no great distance of time, it shall be extended in love and mercy to the needy sons and daughters of this sinstricken world. Consecrating anew (in union with you), our every faculty—our all— to support, build up, and extend the truth of God, as revealed to us ; loving, blessing, and, if need be, forgiving each other; that God may love, bless, and forgive us. May you realize abundant blessing, as we doubt not you will; and may the blessing go out, and be a power in the earth, to uplift, strengthen, and encourage the poor and needy ones outside, as well as inside our Zion, is the earnest prayer of our heart of hearts. With this accept the united love of the Ministry (we have nothing better to send). John Whiteley
