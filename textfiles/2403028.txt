THE WORLD WOULD BE THE BETTER. If men cared less for wealth and fame, And less for battle-fields and glory: If, writ in human hearts; a name Seemed better than in song and story; If men instead of nursing pride, Would learn to hate and to abhor it; If more relied On Love to guide; The world would be the better for it. If men dealt less in stocks and lands, And more in bonds and deeds fraternal; If Love's work had more willing hands To link this world with the supernal; If men stirred up Love's oil and wine, And on bruised human hearts would If 'yours' and 'mine' [pour it; Would once combine, The world would be the better for it. If more would act the play of Life, And fewer spoil it in rehearsal; If Bigotry would sheathe its knife 'Till Good became more universal; If Custom, gray with ages grown, Had fewer blind men to adore it; If Talent shone In Truth alone; The world would be the better for it. If men were wise in little things� Affecting less in all their dealings; If hearts had fewer rusted strings To isolate their kindly feelings; If men, when Wrong beats down the Eight, Would strike together and restore it; If Eight made Might In every fight; The world would be the better for it. �Hie Catholic.
