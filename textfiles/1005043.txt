Let me help you to Brains ! In relation to a new system of curing diseases by suitable variation in foods, which is attracting considerable attention and praise, the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher wittily says: ' For thousands of years men have eaten without a scientific motive, without rational appreciation of the relations of foods to bone, muscle, nerve, and so on. The whole motives lay in the mouth. Men ate because it tasted good, but by-and-by we shall have bone-building, fat-producing, nerve-replenishing and muscle-forming dishes. The host, instead of asking guests to take beef or pudding, will say to a lean or cadaverous visitor, ' Let me fill up your tissue,' or ' my dear sir, your bones are brittle, allow me to pass this compound ; better bones were never made than this produces.' To some exigent a scholar, thin and nervous, the jolly host will say, ' My dear fellow let me help you to brains. What do you affect? This dish runs strongly to poetry ; or, is it philosophy? Why, sir, philosophy is only food etherealized !'' Reverend joking apart, it is not incredible that a great scientific advance may be made in this direction, and the day may come when food will be so nicely adjusted to the human wants that disease will be, in a measure, controlled, and the highest physical satisfaction come to be enjoyed.
