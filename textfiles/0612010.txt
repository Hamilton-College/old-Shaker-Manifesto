AWAKENING JANE A. CORNELL See o'er the hill-tops the sunlight is breaking; Adown in the valley its golden beams fall; Souls from the darkness of sin are awakening, Answering the voice of the Christ-Spirit's call. All through the night, with most gentle entreating, He hath called unto sinners, in mercy and love; All the promises sure, of the Father repeating, Hath pointed to mansions, preparing above. Awake now O Zion! and shake off thy slumber! For lo! there is wafting from every shore, The great witness-clouds, which no man can number; And soon drooping low, it shall rest at thy door. Arouse, then, 0 Zion! fling open thy portal! And put on thy garments of beauty and might, For see now approaching are spirits immortal, Who humbly are seeking for guidance and light. They are weary and famished, for long have they wandered In paths of transgressions and highways of sin; In riotous living their substance have squandered; O stretch forth thy hand now and gather them in. For Oh! they are coming, repentant and chastened, A sense of their loss doth each bosom oppress; And to thee, as unto a mother, they've hastened, To pour out their sorrowsâ€”their sins to confess. Prepare them a greeting, receive them with gladness, O spread them a banquet, kind welcome accord; Speak comforting words, consoling their sadness; They come not unbidden, they are guests of thy Lord.
