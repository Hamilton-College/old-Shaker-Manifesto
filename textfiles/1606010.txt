WHILE WE MAY. The hands are such dear hands, They are so full, they turn at our demands, So often they reach out, With trifles scarcely thought about, So many times; they do So very many things for me, for you� If their fond wills mistake, We well may bend,|.not break. They are such fond, frail lips That speak to us, Pray, if lo^e strips � Them of deception many time%, Or if they speak too slow or quick, such crimes We may pass by; for we may see Days not far off when those small words may be Held not as slow or quick, or out of place, but dear Because the lips are no more here. Thej are such dear familiar feet that go Along the path with ours�feet fast or slow, And trying to keep pace�if they mistake, �Or tread upon some flower that we would take Upon our breast, or bruise some reed, Or crush poor Hope until it bleed, We may be mute, No turning quickly to impute, Grave fault; for they and we Have such a little way to go�Can be Together such a little while along the way, We will be patient while we may. So many little faults we find, We see them; for not blind Is love, but if you and I Perhaps remember them some by-and-by, They will not be Faults then�grave faults�to you and me, But,just odd ways, mistakes, or even less� Remembrances to bless. Days change so many things�yes hours, We see things so differently in suns and showers, Mistaken words to-night May be so cherished by tomorrow's light. We may be patient; for we know There's such a little way to go. Selected
