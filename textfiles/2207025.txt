Sonyea, N. Y. June, 1892. The new June is a terrific scorcher; without its frequent showers the dry old world would soon become a mighty blaze. Western New York has a fine prospect of much fruit. The yearly campaign that tries men's souls and women's soles too has passed. 'House-cleaning' is finished, our house is set in order preparatory for other scenes that await perfection. The sowing and planting of spring crops was not all a success, several acres oL' corn were replanted, as the over-drenched earth damaged the first; of the second we cannot tell, that, too, may meet with a failure as well. During the past few weeks Brother Henry Hollister has built new plank sidewalks around the buildings; more comfort and less fear is now realized by the walking public than has been known for many years. A portion of the large barn at the West Farm has found a renovation through his much toil. The haying season has commenced, and rich will the harvest be, for the grass grows fast where rain and sun cause blighting forms to flee. G. D. G.
