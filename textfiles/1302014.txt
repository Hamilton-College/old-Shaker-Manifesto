DOING GOOD. OLIVE F. CHANDLER. The source of happiness is found in doing good to humanity; in striving to sweeten, with Christian love and charity, the bitter cup of life. Jesus went about doing good wherever opportunity presented. He carried the spirit of forgiving love and healing sympathy, imparting to the diseased soul and body the elements that made whole. For this He was maligned by those who conceived evil, and scorned by the jealous and bigoted Pharisees. In this opposition came growth to the divine nature. Hence, without friction there can be no deep thought or heroism. Life is not wasted unless it ends in sloth, dishonesty, or cowardice. Success is not worthy of the name unless won by honest industry, and bravely breasting the waves of fortune. Through conflict to victory, is the motto for every human soul; and this is acheived in ways as diverse as our several lots. Our foes are manifold, they are within, around and about us ; they are veiled spectres, whose hiss we hear; whose grip we feel: If not in immediate activity, we know they are gathering, and that combat is at hand. Daily life is vital with influence. The most insignificant act may .set in motion a train of eternal consequences. Our unconscious word may decide a destiny. Some odors abide indefinitely ; so grand sayings and silly acts become photographed and are garnered for worth or. ridicule. We can all do some good in this world, without money, which may prove a happy reflection when we have gone into new fields of labor, or when the frosts of years have whitened our locks. Great conquests, startling events, extraordinary inventions, surprise the world ; but little kindnesses, words of truth and love, sweeten existence, and hold us firmly in fraternal bonds. Milton said : 'To understand the common things of life was prime wisdom.' Ayer, Mass.
