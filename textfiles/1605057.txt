WHAT IS IN A NAME? F. W. EVANS. Having,- for many year?, occupied the position of Elder in the Gathering Order of the Society of Shakers, in Mount Lebanon, Columbia County, New York, U. S. A. And, also, that of Public Preacher; my name has been widely circulated. Many times, to my great annoyance, I am spoken of as the ' head or Leader ' of the whole Shaker Order, which is composed of seventeen societies. Probably, one reason for this undesired personal prominence has been the fact, that I have written for over fifty newspapers and mpgazines ; and that many times the articles have been extensively copied by other publications ; also, I am the author of several books and pamphlets and tracts; &amp;c. The result is, as above stated, that I am frequently referred to as being the Leader of the American Shakers ; when in reality, I am only one among many leaders, some of whom are my Official superiors. Hereafter, if public writers will please bear this in mind, and think and speak of me accordingly, it will save me from many an unpleasant sensation and I shall be thereby much obliged. Doctrinal Matters. Again, a book has been published called ' Shaker Theology; ' and, at Canterbury, Shaker Village, N. H. a paper is published entitled ' The Manifesto.' If in any of my communications to the public I have, or may hereafter, express doctrinal views differing from, or at variance with the present theology of the above named publications; I desire the readers to consider them as either heretical, or as expressing the increasing light of the Church; just as they feel impressed. In either case, I wish it distinctly understood that the responsibility rests entirely upon the writer, whom the press have so often favorably noticed, and uniformly so kindly entreated. Mt.
