MISPLACED FEAR All languages have a literature of terror about death. But living is far more terrible in reality than dying. It is life that foments pride, that inflames vanity, that excites the passions, that feeds the appetites, that founds and builds habits, that establishes character, and, binding up the separate straws of action into one sheaf, hands it into the future, saying, 'As ye have sowed so shall ye reap ;' and again, 'As ye reap, so shall ye sow!' Yet life, which is the mischief maker, is not at all feared. Death, that does no harm, and ia only the revealer of life's work, is feared.
