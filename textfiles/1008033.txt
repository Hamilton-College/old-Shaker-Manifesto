RECEIVED. From C. Dibble, $17.40. From N. A. Briggs, $4.00. INTERESTING. It is now thought necessity will demand a new edition of Elder H. L. Eads' ' Shaker Theology.' We hope so. A large edition was struck off at first, and now new demands increase the everlasting permanency of the noble monument. Those who had heard of our Bro. N. A. Briggs losing the entree of his right hand, will learn with pleasure that the penparalysis will hopefully be averted.
