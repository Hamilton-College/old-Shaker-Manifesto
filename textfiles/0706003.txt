Tried as Gold MARIA WITHAM As gold is purged of worthless dross, Under the furnace blast—¦ Grows purer by the seeming loss, And shines undimmed at last;— As brightness, like the morning sky, When winds are soft and fair, Reflecting to the Master's eye, His image mirrored there— So by the fierce and angry fires, Of trial and of care, May we, if so the soul aspires, The Savior's image wear. These come to purge from clinging dross, To purify the soul; To bring us nearer to the cross, And Heaven's complete control. Enfield, Conn.
