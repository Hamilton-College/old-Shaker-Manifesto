Watervliet, N. Y. Cutting fire wood is the work of the day. The Second Family have built a new house for swine, are also building a new ice-house, 20x40ft. They have commenced feeding ensilage from their silo, which, is 12x24 and 22 ft. deep. As this is their first trial they are unable to say much about it at present, only that it already turns out better than expected. Very little snow thus far, but plenty of mud and changeable weather, good for colds.
