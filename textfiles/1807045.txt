A CURE FOR CHURCH GRUMBLING. One hindrance, which not infrequently appears among congregations, is that the great majority of people seem to be too busy in finding fault ever to have any time left to devote to actual work. They are the people who can get into the way of others ; they can hinder every good work; defeat every good effort. They predict failure and then exert themselves to secure the fulfillment of their own prophecies. It has been aptly said that 'every congregation is composed of two classes : workers and grumblers. The workers never grumble, ftnd the grumblers never work.' If this is true, as it doubtless is, then the remedy for the cure of this evil is very apparentï¿½give every person something to do. From 'Methods of Church Work,' by Rev. S. Stall.
