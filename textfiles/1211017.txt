BLESSINGS Elizaette Sutton Count the blessings that surround us, And the mercies that we Â¦ share, Are they few, and numbered to us? Or as boundless as the air? As the dews are scattered to us, And the sunbeams 'round us play, Bounties are unmeasured to us, By our Father day by day. And the stars that stud the heavens, Are they numbered every one? Pearly drops from Crystal fountains, Can we count them as they run? So are blessings showered on us, By our Father's loving hand, Dropt along life's highway to us, Blessings free thro' out the land. Could we always see our blessings, And the least one learn to prize, Consecrate them in our feelings, Tho' they're often in disguise. Pleasures that are sweet and savory, Would along our path be strewn, Brightly, beautifully, lovely, Worth and beauty would attune. What are all our life's endeavors, If we know not wisdom's ways? Utilize Clod's gifts and favors; Dreaming must not fill our days. Greet the morning and it's burdens With a thankful, cheerful heart, Tho' the cloud is dark that saddens, 'Twill divide and from us part. Smile or frown, is at our option, Gloom, or sunshine to impart, We can have a sweet affection, Or, a cold forbidding heart. Which, the cup of life be filling? Which, be anchored in the soul? Let us choose the greater blessing, Let true wisdom have control. For the blessings thus provided, Earthly, moral, spiritual, Gratitude to God be rendered; For he doeth all things well. Wise and merciful His nature, With a weight and balance true ; He will give to every creature, All that justice claims as due. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
