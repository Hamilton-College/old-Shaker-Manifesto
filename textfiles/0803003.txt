Live for a Right Principle RUTH WEBSTER If we would fully accomplish any important aim in life, either of a spiritual or temporal nature, we should give the thing to be done due consideration, in order to ascertain whether the object will pay the cost of time, study and labor, it will necessarily take to make our aim a success, and promote right principles. When once having settled in our minds, that the duty of whatever nature it may be is based on true and honest principles, let us never swerve nor falter, but press forward with a determination to conquer through every discour- agement. This we have been taught by the Father and Mother of the New Creation, through precept and example. They had a mission of which they never lost sight, but pressed on through the greatest sufferings and the most determined opposition. That the kingdom of God might be established on earth, and souls saved from sin, was what they labored for. And as children of such parentage, our mission is the same ; and should we not strive with an ardent zeal to accomplish it ? Not only when the tide runs smoothly but in the midst of difficulties, when our faith is put to the severest test ? Here is a quotation worth repeating with which my sentiments accord : 'Not by mere emotions can we hope to rise to higher spheres ; but by self-subjection, by actual works of charity, and by efforts that prove the sincerity of our aspi- rations.' Would the youth of the present age but stop to consider, and start on life's voyage with a determination to live lives founded on high and holy principles, it would be impossible to estimate the a- mount of good they might do here on earth, or to judge the value of the treasure laid up for them in the Spirit world.
