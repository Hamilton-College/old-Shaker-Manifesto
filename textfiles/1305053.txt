If the City is of such vast proportions, what must the country be? :Vnd, of course, if 'the things unseen are known and understood by the things that are,' the inhabitants will want a change. Be it as it may, it is, no doubt, Just right. Yours for heaven as it is, John Whiteley. Shirley, Mass. Feb. 1883 THE DIMENSIONS OF HEAVEN THE DIMENSIONS OF HEAVEN 'In my Father's house are many mansions.' Jesus. 'And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs. The length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal.' Rev. xxi, 1(3. Twelve thousand furlongs, 7,920,000 feet, which being cubed, 49(i, 793,088,000,000,000, 000 cubic feet. Reserving half of this space for the throne and the court of heaven, and half the balance for streets, we have the remainder of 121,198,272,000,000,000,000 cubic feet. Divide this by 4,096, the cubical feet in a room sixteen feet square, and there will be 30,321,843,750,000,000 rooms. We will now suppose the world always did and always will contain 990,000,000 inhabitants and that a generation lasts 33 and one third years making in all 2,970,000,000, every century, and that the world will stand 100, 000,000 years or 10,000 centuries making in all 2,979,000,000,000 inhabitants. Then suppose there were one hundred worlds equal to this in number of inhabitants and duration of years, making a total of 297,000,000,000,000 persons, and there would be more than a hundred rooms sixteen feet square for each person.
