THE BEARD To shave, or not to shave, that is the question, whether it is nobler on the whole, to suffer the smart and pain of an old, dull razor, or take up arms against that sea of troubles, and, by opposing, end them —let the beard grow; and, so doing, to say we end the sore throat, the frosted cheeks, the stuffed up nose, and all the multifarious ills to which our head is subject, is a consummation devoutly to be wished. So let it grow, perchance to our discomfort — aye, there's the rub. For, if we let it grow, how we shall feel, when we have a large and fullgrown beard, must give us pause. There's the respect that makes us go without a beard so long a time ! For who would bear the searching, piercing wind, the driving sleet, the dashing hail, the pelting rain, the pangs of a dull razor, and all those numerous pains, with a bare face, when he himself might their quietus make, by laying aside the razor ? Who would fardels bear, to apply the brush and razor twice a week, but that the fear of being out of union, and treading in bye (forbidden) paths, subdues the will, and makes us rather bear those ills we have, than fly to others that we know not of. Thus union does make brethren of us all. With this regard, we shave our faces clean. W. S.
