How strange it is... How strange it is that souls can live With those who sacrifice each day, And never feel or think to give A thought for others by the way; I would not live on earth with men But to the desert would repair And with wild beasts procure my den, And there enjoy my couch or lair, Unless my gifts could equal those Who are the Savior's chosen few; No debts accruing by repose, And no false name of good and true. Canterbury, N. H. M. W.
