NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Center Family. April 10, 1891. Beloved Eldeb Henry:�I read your Editorial this morning, in April Manifesto, and it seemed meet for the times, as Manifesto Editorials always seem to me. The average temperature of March for Mount Lebanon and the mean temperature of the same for Canterbury, as given in April, makes a difference of seven degrees, between the two, which makes me think there is a difference between the mean of two extremes and the average for the month, since Canterbury is only about fifty miles further north, according to the maps, and an average of seven degrees colder, than we had, must be severe. The merry singing of birds this morning, the first I have heard this season, seemed homelike, because they tell of genial skies and vernal blooms, and agreeable warmth, arrived to clothe the earth again with her mantle of green, of multiform texture,-� also to renew her friiitfulness with producDSTortli Family. April 15. 'No time to lose, the moments have a voice, Calling to duty as a lasting choice. Swiftly they're fleeing and bear a record clear, Of deeds good or evil in this earthly sphere. Scatter the seeds of virtue day by day; Embody the truth, it will not pass away. And to labor for others is of virtue to thee, Increasing thy treasure in eternity.' Of all the seasons, spring is the most important. If the farmer, or gardener fails in duty now, he will have affliction and trouble all through the summer; at harvest time vexation, and for winter, unpleasant reflections. tions that reward industry, and gladden the hearts of all living creatures. Since April came in, snow has fallen to the depth of twenty inches, so reported, and though it melted fast, and has continued melting, about six inches remains. Our farmers put several acres of grain into the ground before the last snow. It is having a cold bath and perhaps it will make a quick start, after its white shroud departs. Brother Henry and the men are improving the time at trimming apple trees. With the return of mild weather, our people are getting better of their coughs, colds, influenzas and rheumatics, which are being relegated to limbo where they belong. What is home, if it is not where all rational needs are supplied, and all proper wants, physical and moral, intellectual and spiritual, are satisfied. And where, when duties are all performed in their season, we feel peace and rest, in harmony with environment. A wise attention to the little duties, ten thousand times repeated, each in its proper connection with the daily routine, never neglecting the greater ones, fertilizes life's garden and feeds the fountain of content within, while all unnecessary, superficial and transitory wants are denied and banished, by the satisfaction which flows from industry and a justified conscience. Saturday it rained and snow is going fast. ' * The season appears to be opening very satisfactorily. Have just commenced to work the land. On the 3rd we had the greatest snow storm of the season; there fell about eighteen inches. It has now about all disappeared. Elder Frederick, who on the 1st fell upon a very sharp axe, cutting a terrible gash in the calf of the left leg, is doingvery nicely. However it does not at all agree with his active life habits to be so closely confined. The tendency seems to be to develop the nervous system. 'There are no accidents in Christ.' Truth. And our gospel travel is not yet complete. What a glorious sight it will be upon this earth, a body of people living in a section of country where the weeds are all subdued; where there are no destructive animals or insects; where the seasons come in perfect harmony and wh ere all the people not only have complete control of their spirits, but of their bodies too. No accidents, no sickness, no premature deaths and no burdensome old age. The battle against dirt, moth and rust, is now being fought by our valiant Sisterhood, and things look favorably for complete victory. Our Ministry are expected at their mountain home to-day. In kindest love. D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. April 1891. The month of April has arrived and also the time for house cleaning. This is the time when some of us would like to go on a visit, where house cleaning is not known. This wrestling with contrary stove pipes, beating dusty carpets and kalsomining the walls is not very conducive to peace of mind. The only consolation is, that two or three of the good Sisters are generally near, and impart so freely their advice, that one would think they understood the whole business, and of course it will not do to get excited. So we put on an extra amount of pressure on the safety valve of patience and all goes well. We have not done any ploughing as yet. Snow remains on the ground and it freezes every night. We are making fences. Are selling some of our potatoes at three dollars and twenty-five cents a barrel. Our tomato plants look well. We shall have about six thousand plants to set this spring. We have closed the sawing of logs at our mill, this season, and think the business has been profitable for us. J. B. Second Fainily. We have not much to write at this time. The latter part of March was warm, and the wood for the coming season was sawed and stored away. We commenced ploughing, when lo! April stepped in and clothed the earth with a mantle of snow about twelve inches deep. This put a stop to ploughing for the present; but as there is other necessary work to be done we need not be idle. Hancock, Mass. April 10, 1891. Time, which is ever on the wing, again brings the period in which it is expedient to collect 'Home Notes' for the excellent pamphlet that so abounds in wisdom, and gives such universal satisfaction. There is, however, in our section, little of interest to record. Health has been an abiding guest with us through the winter, which is cause for deep thankfulness. In one or two instances La Grippe attempted to put in an appearance, but being rebuffed soon left. The April number of the Manifesto is, from cover to cover, so replete with articles of superior merit, that distinguishing preference seems hardly possible. 'Plome Notes' do indeed have the right ring, are always refreshing, and serve to bring us into closer communion with gospel kindred. The feathered songsters still seem to tarry in their southern homes, not daring to venture to our northern climes, While the chilling winds Blow, And earth remuins enshrouded in snow. One of our aged Sisters, Anna Pool, of the Second Family, on the morning of the 9th ult. had the misfortune to fall on the slippery flag-stones and break a bone of the left arm near the wrist. The doctor who is in attendance thinks it is healing finely and considers it a remarkable case, as she is in her ninety-third year. He claims there is not to be found on record, a case where a broken bone has healed on a person so advanced in years. A large amount of wood is being sawed and split both for market and home use. While we enjoy the delicious maple syrup that we are making in very small quantities, we are reminded of the toiling ones in our sister Societies, (particularly those in New Hampshire,) who are manufacturing such large quantities of both syrup and sugar, and we wonder how so much labor can be accomplished. May God's blessing attend them. J. L. S. April 4. Beloved Elder Henry:�Owing to inquiry from some of the Societies of Believers about our Iron Ore Mine, I thought it best to send you some statements of facts in regard to it, which can be placed in the Manifesto if you think best so to do. Notes about Home seem to be read, and no doubt will be so long as our interests are identical. The pocket of ore found on the land owned by this Society is one of the deposits which belong to the Salisbury vein. This vein is first found near the north line of Berkshire Co., at the head waters of the Housatonic river, and runs in a southwesterly course through the county and along the west line of Connecticut and east line of York State. Its extent is about ninety miles. Ore has been discov ered in sections this whole distance, although some beds are too poor to pay for working, while others are very rich in iron. Four years ago this spring, parties commenced underground mining on our land a little east of the village, near the railroad station. Here they dropped a shaft about one hundred and thirty feet into the earth. This shaft is six by eight and timbered from top to bottom. From this they drift away into the ore. They are now working four levels. The bottom level has been extended between two and three thousand feet, and still forces good ore. The Company have lately sunk another shaft one hundred and fifty feet deep near the lowlands on the line of their underground works. As the top of this last shaft is some forty feet below the top of the old one, they will be able to extend more drifts under these present works. The depth of the ore has not been determined as yet, but the Company are satisfied that they are working on the top of the deposit. They have erected a large building over this last shaft and placed in it their engines, washers, pumps, &amp;c. At the present time they are taking out about eight hundred tons of ore per month. When their new works are completed they intend to work nine or ten levels and mine seventy-five to one hundred tons per day. The Railroad Company have run a track out to their works so as to load their cars where the ore is taken out, without any extra hauling. The ore is taken to Chatham, some eighteen miles, where their furnace converts it into pig iron. The grounds are loaned to the Company for a term of years with an agreement that there shall be a certain amount of ore mined each month and a monthly payment of Royalty made to the Society for every ton taken. We are able to say that thus far the Company have lived up to this agreement. The expense of mining the ore is borne by the parties without any aid whatever from the Society. On the 2nd inst. we observed the Proclamation sent out by Governor Russell for a day of Fasting. Had meeting at ten o'clock A. M. The afternoon was devoted, as is the custom of Believers, to putting things in order. As the snow had nearly all disappeared we thought it a good time to put away our sleds, and did so. The next morning, to our surprise, we found sixteen inches of beautiful white snow had fallen during the night; we had not any use for it except to fertilize our land, therefore we agreed that it could disappear just as soon as it pleased. House cleaning has already commenced and where there is a particle of dust or one fly-speck, the good Sisters think it will not do to let it remain. Therefore, brooms, brushes, and soap-suds are in motion. Good health favors us at this date. In kindest love. Your Brother. Ira R. Lawson. Enfield, Conn. April 1891. The bluebirds were with us as early as the first of March. A short time ago our supply of roots which we had been feeding to our milch cows failed, in consequence a surprising decrease of milk and cream. Note. We must raise more roots, carrots and sugar beets the coming season. We raised last summer and fed this winter about nine hundred bushels. We must make it twelve hundred this season, and raise squashes, soft shell for early feed, and thus have roots till grass comes again. Ensilage is no doubt an indispensable feed where milk production is the only object sought, but in butter production it seems to be inferior to good corn fodder cut fine and fed with roots, grain, and clover hay. We have for some weeks been engaged in spring work. T. Stroud. April 6th. We have spring and winter in alternate layers, as soon as we get ready to work the land, the ground freezes, snow falls and winter holds on. The third of April four inches of snow accompanied with high winds and cold air. We are improving the time cleaning up door-yards and buildings, trimming trees, hauling lumber, mixing fertilizer, preparing seed and machines for work as soon as the season will permit. Our new Aspinwall Potato Planter has come, and we are rejoicing in the prospect of time and labor to be saved thereby. We have fixed over and painted the tin roof on engine house and dairy, and are repairing other out-buildings. We have a gift of cleaning up and hope to feel better for it. M. Witham. 'Praise God from whom all blessings flow.' Our best blessings are free. The bright sunshine, the welcome rain, water, air, health, and above all, the gospel is free. Free salvation by the cross. We are invited to drink of the water of life freely. We have always abundant occasion for praise and thankfulness, and it is befitting that we join in special strains of thanksgiving unitedly as well as individually. We should be thankful for pure companions, for the comforts of a peaceful home and social life, and for religious privileges and spiritual blessings that cannot be measured. Offering thanks is acceptable to God and healthful to the soul. 'Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise; be thankful unto Him and bless his name.' 2898 spaces of cream were sold in March. It is a source of gain to under-drain. A clean seed-bed makes easy culture. Weeds rob the soil of moisture; they also rob small plants of sun and air. To make chickens grow, feed wheat as soon as they can eat it. Mashed potatoes, corn and oats, (ground) can be given them to advantage. Ground meat should be given them once a day. Confined fowls should not be fed much fattening material, but give them a proportion of lean meat or scraps. D. Orcutt. Harvard, Mass. I want to send my heart-felt thanks for the Autobiography of Elder Giles B. A very. ]STo doubt the compilation of it through your limited means has caused you much arduous toil and labor. The good that will be derived from reading it will not only be seen within our household, but it will be a living missionary to many who are looking into a knowledge of these principles. All who have known Elder Giles have seen that he has made the principles of Shakerism a perfect success in his life. And now as he has been called up higher, may his pure mantle rest on his successor, Elder Joseph Holden. For more than thirty years I have been closely associated with him in the duties of life and have always found him a stalwart for the principles of our blessed Mother's gospel and just the one to receive the blessing, strength and success of a dear brother. What have we to fear if God be on our side? Don't let us leave our alabaster boxes to be broken over our dear ones after they are laid in the coffin. Let us break some of them now and let the perfume fill the air, and make glad the hearts of those who are carrying along Zion's burdens. We are often exhorted to make our home attractive, to throw out sunshine and cheer in every department of life. If the kingdom of heaven is within us why not let some of it out and share together as Brothers and Sisters. They who tread life's pathway ever bearing on their faces an expression of cheerfulness, are radiant ministers of good to mankind. They scatter sunshine on all they meet, depression and gloom fade away in their presence. On Thursday the 2nd we had one more heavy fall of snow, so we resorted to our sleighs for traveling. A blizzard visited us in the evening and broke down one of our large fir trees and tore down six telephone poles between our place and Ayer. Health of Society quite good, no one confined to the sick-room, so the time is given to the physicians to play. A. D. B. Canterbury, N. H. The return of spring must date with the return of the little birds and the swelling of the buds on the maples. Winter has held the 'right of way,' over the wood to be burned and the garments to be worn till within a few days, when a change of temperature has been announced. Large numbers of robins and bluebirds have returned after a long absence, and seem very much at home. The sugar harvest is over. Two camps have been in operation and some hundreds of gallons of nice maple syrup has been secured. At the camp in our family one Brother and two young men have taken charge of some 300 trees. They kept one yoke of cattle at the camp and when not engaged in the hauling of sap, they were made useful in hauling a supply of wood for another year. This camp has furnished some 190 bbls. of sap and some 98 gallons of syrup and for this pleasant luxury we shall be made happier during the whole year. The Honey Bees are yet imprisoned in the cellar, and as they eat less honey while held in close confinement, it is a point in economy to hold them till the return of spring is made a certainty. Xo honey can be obtained till the last of May, and not even any bread till the catkins are in flower, so that the thousands of active little bees if away from the cellar, must be fed daily or there is danger of their falling into bad habits. In accordance with the time-honored custom of the early fathers, our Society regarded the proclamation of Governor Tuttle of N. H., and enjoyed a very satisfactory meeting. Such seasons of religious communion are always profitable. Enfield, N. H. April 14. We learn from the sentiment expressed by a brother in Oregon, who evidently is a reader of our little messenger, that not only our Societies, but others also, look with interest to the Home ]S'otes. At first, one might think it odd that a stranger outside the gates should be especially attracted to these simple facts, simply written, on our home affairs, no 'doctrines' included, only as every word spoken or written has its influence. Yet a second considerate thought tells us they really are an indicator, possibly an educator, regarding the home life of the only Community that has, as yet, sustained the relationship of brothers and sisters in Christ. Those who study the 'Signs of the Times' declare that in these latter days there is much thought given to this mode of living, for a class who are satisfied with the experiments others have made in the 'old way' and desire a 'new way.' So it becomes our duty (which Frances Willard says should always be written with a capital D) if not always a pleasure, to delineate as we may, the homely topics which interest us in the New Creation.. Our maple harvest has been immense, almost a continuous flow, or rather 'drop in the bucket' since April 1st; very little rain to adulterate, making it unusually pleasant. The market is flushed with sweet, so the purse will not be made to extend on this score, but if all, big and little, have not had their 'sufficiency full' it will be their own fault this season. Health of our family has been unusually good all winter up to date, no 'grippe' here. We have concluded our home in the valley is fully as healthful as those on the breezy mountain top. House cleaning and painting has seized us early so will probably subside in proportionate good season, in time to attend to our friends should they be kind enough to make us a call. E. B. Sabbathday Lake, Me. April 18. Editok of Manifesto:�The usual routine of our home has been much broken for the past month. On the 14th of March, Sister Lavina Mclntire fell and broke her hip. After suffering severe pain for three weeks and four days she passed over the Eiver, Wednesday morning 8th hist. Gladly doth her soul surrender, 'Not my will, but thiue be done,' Was her last sweet prayer, so tender, Uttered at life's setting sun. One by one our friends are leaving, For their homes on yonder shore. One by one their souls immortal Dwell with angels evermore. The snow has nearly all disappeared. A few patches of white are seen, telling of the cold season that has just left us. At present it is mud, mud and some rain. We are glad that spring has come and:� We welcome the springtime the green on the hills The glad bursts of rapture, in far woedland rills The soft gentle showers, the loud dashing rain; Indeed we are happy to greet them again. Our teams have hauled 121.960 ft. of logs from the woods besides the usual supply of fire wood which the Brethren are at present employed in sawing, using a portable engine. Should you come to our home you would find us with our hands at work, and we trust that our hearts would be to God as taught by our blessed Mother Ann Lee. A. S. C. Groveland, N. Y. April 10. Spring notes are again in demand, therefore our present attention is devoted to making a collection of such notes as will produce harmony in things seen and unseen, in things heard and unheard, remembering that 'The sweetest songs are those That few men ever hear And no men ever sing. The clearest skies are those That furthest off appear To birds of strongest wing.' The severe, steady winter is believed by many to be a forerunner of peace, plenty and prosperity to the farming community through the medium of fruit abundant and generous farm crops. Garden making with other forms of enterprise is the advance march of to-day. Grape vines were pruned in season, some fruit trees have been shorn of dead and dying branches, a few worthless trees have been hewn down, making way for more profitable ones should such be planted in this or future generations. The sunny days revive the vision of the much needed house cleaning, when we shall go armed from morn till evening with brush and broom and water to follow, removing all objectionable objects that accumulate during the season of much dirt and dust; though we have never heard of a season yet that has escaped dirt and dust in some form, and never anticipated conditions so pleasing while we are inhabitants of a country composed of said material. But the world that lies just a trifle beyond, The country no mortal hath seen, Is a world we imagine free from all blight, And ever, forever serene. G. D. G.
