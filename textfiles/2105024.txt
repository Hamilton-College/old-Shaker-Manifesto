Groveland, N. Y. April 10. Spring notes are again in demand, therefore our present attention is devoted to making a collection of such notes as will produce harmony in things seen and unseen, in things heard and unheard, remembering that 'The sweetest songs are those That few men ever hear And no men ever sing. The clearest skies are those That furthest off appear To birds of strongest wing.' The severe, steady winter is believed by many to be a forerunner of peace, plenty and prosperity to the farming community through the medium of fruit abundant and generous farm crops. Garden making with other forms of enterprise is the advance march of to-day. Grape vines were pruned in season, some fruit trees have been shorn of dead and dying branches, a few worthless trees have been hewn down, making way for more profitable ones should such be planted in this or future generations. The sunny days revive the vision of the much needed house cleaning, when we shall go armed from morn till evening with brush and broom and water to follow, removing all objectionable objects that accumulate during the season of much dirt and dust; though we have never heard of a season yet that has escaped dirt and dust in some form, and never anticipated conditions so pleasing while we are inhabitants of a country composed of said material. But the world that lies just a trifle beyond, The country no mortal hath seen, Is a world we imagine free from all blight, And ever, forever serene. G. D. G.
