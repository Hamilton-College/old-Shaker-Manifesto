HOLD YOUR HEAD UP LIKE A MAN. If the storm winds should rustle, While you tread the world's high-way, Still against them bravely tussle, Hope and labor day by day; Falter not, no matter whether There is sunshine, storm or cloud, And in every kind of weather, Hold your head up like a man. If a brother should deceive you, And should act a traitor's part. Never let his treason grieve you, Jog along with lightsome heart; Fortune seldom follows fawning, Boldness is the plan, Hoping for a better dawning Hold your head up like a man. Earth though e'er so rich and mellow, Yields not for the worthless drone, But the bold and honest fellow, He can shift and stand alone; Spurn the knave of every nation, Always do the best you can, And no matter what your station, Hold your head up like a man.
