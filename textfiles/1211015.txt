TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW MARIA WITHAM Don't tell me of tomorrow; Give me the one who'll say, If good can be effected I'll do the deed today. We may command the present, Then act and never wait; llepentance is the phantom That often comes too late. Don't tell me of tomorrow ! There's much to do today, That never'll be accomplished If thrown the hours away. Each moment has its duty, Who can the future tell? Then why defer till next day What this can do as well ?
