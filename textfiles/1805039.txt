DOUBLE SHAKER FUNERAL. At Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., on the 25th inst., the North Family attended the funeral of Margaret Turner, at Canaan, three miles distant. She was aged 52 years, and had been in the order forty years. Whilst in meeting on the ground-floor of the dwellinghouse, Cluuson E. Middleton, aged 8G years., and who has been in the order 67 years, who was lying sick in an upper room, died, and, as some sensitives claimed, came down into the meeting-room, mingling with the worshipers. Clauson has been a very much beloved, honorable, and useful member. Was a burdenbearer. He was a man of few words, and emphatically a doer of good works. Was industrious, economical, and very careful of fire. Blessed are the dead who thus die in the Lord, for they still live and continue in well-doing. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. F. W. Evans.
