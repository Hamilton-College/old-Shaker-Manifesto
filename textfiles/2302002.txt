PRELIMINARY NOTES. When it was learned that our beloved Elder Daniel Boler, had passed on his journey beyond the boundaries of time, and had actually gone, as he had often sung, 'to explore the land of souls,' some kind friends at the Central Society, gave us immediate notice, with an invitation to be present during the funeral service. All the Ministry and Elders of the Eastern Societies, received a corresponding word. As the funeral was to be held on Sunday trie 13th of Nov., and the telegram not having been received till Saturday the 12th, it gave us a very limited time to arrange for so long a journey, and be able to reach a station not many miles distant from the Society of Mt. Lebanon. In a conference held at 6-30 a. m. on the morning of the 12th, it was proposed for Elder Henry C. Blinn, Elder Nicholas A. Briggs, Eldress Joanna J. Kaime and Eldress Eliza A. Stratton, to represent the Society of Canterbury, at the funeral of Elder Daniel. A journey of twelve miles over bad roads consumed several hours, and we were obliged to take the afternoon train from the city of Concord. From delays at Nashua and Worcester, we did not reach the city of Pittsfield, Mass., till 11-45 p. m. As our arrival had been anticipated by Br. Ira Lawson, (although on an earlier train,) a coach was in waiting for us, and we were soon before the doors of the American Hotel, where we received the kindest of attention. At an early hour on Sabbath morning we were notified that Br. Levi Shaw, who was on his way to Mt. Lebanon, had invited us to ride with him to the Village. A nice carriage, a beautiful span of horses and a careful driver were at the door of the Hotel, FEBRUARY, 1893. 26 THE MANIFESTO. which were sent for Br. Levi by the dear friends of the North family, with an invitation for us to accompany him. Quietly we wended our way, in the stillness of the Sabbath morning, till we reached the village of Hancock, where we met two or three kind friends and exchanged heart-felt salutations. Our journey over the mountain was all that one might desire at this season of the year, and the best term to use in speaking of it is, 'awfully grand.' At 9-15 we reached the Trustees' Office, at the Church, and were met with a warm and cordial welcome from hands and hearts of our dear gospel friends. We breakfasted at 0-30 and soon after were introduced to tho^e friends who had arrived at an earlier date. Elder John Whit ley, the of Ministry of Harvard and Shirley, Mass.

Lebanon we spent one half day among the dear friends at the North family, and as usual, the term closed quite too soon. A brief visit was enjoyed with lovingfriends, at the Church, and the same with those of the Center, Second and South families. We highly appreciated our privilege as in the presence of our beautiful, gospel relation we saw the impress of the word of God as it came through the ministration of our blessed Mother, Ann Lee. On Wednesday morning Elder Daniel Offord gave us safe conduct over the mountain, and we then learned that all the other invited friends had left the village one or two days in advance of us. We spent, by invitation, a few hours with our loving, gospel friends in Hancock, and in the p. in. Elder Daniel took us to the station in Pittsfield. His return trip of eight miles, through the rain, and over that mountainous road, enlisted for him our deepest sympathy, and gospel love. Henry C. Blinn.
