THE AT-ONE-MENT. JOSEPH WOODS. In the days of typical Israel the people were required to bring tJie offerings or sacrifices according to their various sins to the Priest and he was to make an atonement or as some express it au at-one-ment for them, lie was to witness their sincerity before God in that they had presented their offerings according to the law, without blemish and they were forgiven. Ex. xxx.. 1(5. verso, rind Lev. iv., 20. 'Gather my saints together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.' Ps. 1., :&gt;. All the sacrifices and offerings for silt under the law were typical of the sacra* lice that Jesus made, Heb. ix., 20. Once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away siu by the sacrifice of himself. The prophet Isaiah said of him, the Lord shall see the travail of His soul and be satisfied. St. Peter, ''Forasmuch then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind, for he that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from siu.' After the baptism of Jesus, his work was so swift that in a short time, comparatively he was able to say to his disciples, 'Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world,' and to his Father, ' I have finished the work Thou gavest me to do. ' The sacrifices which he made and which he requires us to make, to be one with him, even as he is one with the Father. ' All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father bnt is of the world. ' 1 Jno.ii., 10, and according to the words of Jesus Christ unless we inake this sacrifice, deny ourselves daily and take up the cross, forsake all that we have and our own lives also and thus follow him in the regeneration, we cannot be his disciples. This is the only at-one-ment, or offering, or at-one-ment which God will accept. What doth it profit a man to believe that Jesus overcame the world, that he prepared a gospel feast, that he has left us an example that we should follow in his footsteps, if he does not partake of the gospel feast, if he does not practically follow in his footsteps ? Why, his condition would be similar to two hungry men seating themselves at a table with a good dinner. One of them partakes of the food, the other does not. How can beholding the tother eat a good dinner benefit him? Or suppose we see two jx&gt;eii, one of them a temperance man, the other a drunkard. What salvation would it be to the drunkard to believe that his neighbor was a temperance man while he continued his intemperate habits? 'Faith without works is dead.' Without a sacrifice of his intemperate habits he has no at-one-ment with good society. But hold on, some one says.ï¿½'Not of works lest any man should bonst. ' We do think from St. Paul's confession that he had no just cause for boasting, but rather to have bowed in humility before God. If boasting must come, let it come from one who said. ' My Father loves me for I do always those things that please him. ' Jesus seems to think works were of some consequence, for he said, 'The son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels, then shall he reward every man according to his /corks.' The Apostle John says, 'The hour is coming in the which all that are in their graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of condemnation. ' It seems in settling the final account, that good works are of vital importance, and without them the soul is not clothed with the righteousness of Christ, but is poor, wretched, blind and naked.
