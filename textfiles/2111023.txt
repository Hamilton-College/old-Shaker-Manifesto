Beloved Editok;�The bountiful harvest which this year has been ours to enjoy, from the earliest to the latest fruits, teaches us anew the all-important lesson, 'We reap what we sow.' In this case we also gather where has been planted. From spacious orchards we now gather the delicious fruit of trees, most of them planted by those whose tireless labors, have won for them the invitation: 'Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' The planting of trees by those on the shady side of life, seems to me to be the embodiment of an unselfish interest in those who are their successors. In this, our loved ones gone before have set a noble example. Will those now in life's prime, 'go and do likewise.' If every one numbered in our ranks should take for their text the golden words uttered by Elder Giles as reported in Notes from Enfield, N. H., 'We should be producers as well as consumers,' both spiritually and temporally, where would ever come a de. cline. O let not one who shares the blessings of our Home, draft upon its treasures without doing all in their power to return the same to the Lord's storehouse with no stinted measure. The picking of our winter apples was finished on the 10th. inst. and one thousand one hundred and twenty-five bushels have been taken from the trees, and now nearly as many still remain to be gathered for drying and for cider. And such beautiful apples. It has been like viewing a delightful panorama, to watch their growth since the early spring gave us the clustered blossoms in such abundance. Center Family. Oct. 14, 1891. Beloved Eldek Heney;�We have abundant cause to be thankful for both spiritual and temporal blessings; for abundant crops of hay, corn and potatoes, also fruit of all kinds commonly cultivated here. Fruit is generally fairer, and pears sweeter than in most years. Apples are less perforated with the fly maggot than in other years of late. This pest was little known here twenty years ago, but of late, has destroyed the value of a great deal of otherwise fair and excellent fruit. We are well along in our apple picking, and the fruit is fairer and more of it, than we saw reason to expect in the forepart of summer. Our tomatoes also have yielded bountifully, when once they could be persuaded to ripen. But the frost keeping its distance from our hills until the 10th. of October has given us ample time to reap the benefits of the care bestowed on our spacious tomato patch. We hope abler pens with more time than ours, will report the pleasure which we as a village enjoyed from the first to the fifth of October by the 'Harvest-Home Gathering' at the North Family. All were invited and during the days it was open, nearly all of our village attended to see the collection of fruits, flowers, vegetables and industries of that devoted family ; to be met with smiling faces, gentle voices, and to listen to recitations, speeches, songs, etc., suitable to the occasion. 'Coming events cast their shadows before' sometimes. Is this a forerunner of a Society 'Harvest-Home' for our Centennial, 1892, to show what progress our Community, starting from almost nothing, has made in one hundred years. When my thoughts turn to our possibilities as a Community, volumes seem to open before me, and- - - - -but I must write no more at this time, lest even the forbearance of our patient editor, become so exhausted that my humble offering arriving too late, be consigned to the waste basket. A. J. C. Our Society meetings, according to custom must be near their close for the year, but they have been seasons of deep spiritual interest, and movings of the waters of life, promoting union, harmony, and supplying food to those who hunger and thirst for salvation and the bread of eternal life. Yet it does not seem to be the time when we can consistently proclaim 'Ho! Every one that thirsteth come!' Come all ye needy and hungering souls� We've enough and to spare. Because only a selected number can be admitted to our feast at present. It is public only to certain prepared ones. This is not mentioned for complaint, but for reminder. There are times and seasons in the spiritual work of God, as in the natural creation, and there is a suitable time and season for every righteous proceeding under the sun, moon, or stars. But never, nay never a time for unrighteousness. Souls endowed with spiritual talents, are enriched in giving. The liberal soul shall have liberal store. 'O our mortal friends and brothers! Each and all must toil for others, And the soul that gives most freely From its treasures hath the more : For in losing life we find it, And in giving love we bind it, Like an amulet of safety To our hearts forevermoie.' We had a very enjoyable season Oct. 1st, at an industrial exposition and social entertainment given at the North Family, which had the right kind of talent to make it a complete success�Thanks and honor to whom honor is due. Long live and prosper the Manifesto, and its Editor and contributors, and abundance of light, peace and health to its readers. * North. Kamily. Oct. 10, 1891. The summer has past, and the harvest most brought to a close. We are now engaged gathering in our apples of which we have a great abundance, and very nice. The weather the past few weeks has been beautiful; no frost till this A. M. Everything has ripened up, and we had some very large yields. Our patch of tomatoes a little more than half an acre, has yielded at the rate of one thousand bushels to the acre; never saw tomatoes so thick and so nice. Sweet corn was a very heavy crop. Winter squash (white chestnut) on a little over half an acre we had six tons and a half. Beans were likewise very good. Indeed we are most bountifully blest with every good thing pertaining to this life, and if we don't have a grand thanksgiving, it will be because we are too selfish and have not done our duty, loving our neighbors as we do ourselves. In working our gardens the past season, I never before realized the benefit there was, in frequently stirring the soil; the weeds in this respect prove a great blessing to the diligent cultivator; if it were not for the weeds, our gardens in many cases would seldom be cultivated or hoed. The appearance of the weeds constantly remind us, and of necessity we stir the soil. Straight rows, and uniform distance apart are a great advantage, in field, or garden. Irregular crooked rows, mean careless cultivation; careless cultivation gives indifferent crops; poor crops are no incentive to gratitude; unthankfulness leads to impatience and poverty; thus crooked rows have a depressing, downward tendency. While straight rows, and clean culture ever tend upward towards perfection. Our gospel friends at Hancock are an example to all who pass their street; and there is no doubt, that many a one passing tlieir straight-rowed, clean kept gardens, and witnessing their enormous crops, has caught an inspiration inciting him to go and do likewise. External surroundings have a marked influence on the internal growth of young people. A company of boys put to work in a field or garden where the rows are crooked and overrun with weeds, where the fences are covered with briers and bushes and the walks in a slipshod, slovenly condition, and it will be very easy for them to be rude and disorderly. I love straight rows, clean of weeds and neatly kept borders; they make it easier to be good. Well, it looks as though our Society Meetings would soon be closed; for upon the arrival of cold weather we have no means of heating our meeting house that is satisfactory, and no thoroughly scientific way of ventilating it. I think the house where we meet for worship, should be made the most comfortable; where the best knowledge of art and science should be embodied, to warm the house equally all over, and where the ventilation is so perfect, that at the close of the meeting the air is in as pure a condition as when first entered; and it should be out of the reach of anybody to stop the breathing process going on. Every house where humans, or other animals live or meet, should be constructed so that it as really breathes, as does the animal body. Shall not this knowledge be brought into one or more of our meeting houses as a preparatory step for our centennial 1892. In kindest love, D. O. Shakers, N. Y. We have been having delightful weather the past month, for harvesting our various crops, which have all been very good. We are about done canning tomatoes, which have yielded far better than we expected. A warm Sept. ripened the fruit nicely. The amount of tomatoes canned in the Society must be about 4000 doz. The Church family have dried over 100 bbls. of sweet corn and the Second family will have nearly 200 bbls. They will finish cutting about the 16th. of this month. We are digging the potatoes and they are affording a good crop. The apple and pear trees have been breaking down with abundance of fruit. We certainly should give thanks to the Lord for this bountiful harvest of temporal blessings. We have also received spiritual blessings, at the hand of the Lord as we were found worthy. The South family have been building an addition to their family dwelling, which is nearly finished, and is a much needed improvement; for while they always have room in their hearts to welcome those who wish to be Believers, still their house was rather small. They are now well provided with room in the dining hall and in the chambers. J. B. Second Family. The weather during Sept. was unusually warm, ripening fruit, corn and tomatoes so fast, that it required diligence to keep pace with the growth, and not allow it to go to waste. The last week in Sept. this family put up seven hundred dozen cans of tomatoes, the largest yield we ever had in one week. At the same time we were cutting and drying corn, also cutting ensilage. We have obeyed the counsel of Mother Ann in 'hands to work,' and hope we have done as well in giving our hearts to God, who has so bountifully blest us with an abundant harvest. Oct. 4th. was the warmest day of the season. We had a pleasant surprise about three weeks ago by a call from Eldress Martha Johnson and five young Sisters from Hancock. They came to Albany for an outing, but as it was raining hard on their arrival, the Elders of the South family who were there to escort them, concluded it would be better to spend the day at Watervliet. So all came out and made a running visit and returned the next day. We enjoyed it more perhaps for the lack of formality. We hope to hear that Br. [ra Lawson has improved in health and we, with his friends at Hancock, hope that God may grant him a longer lease of life. Our Ministry are still with us except one familiar face, which we miss, but hope to see the next time they arrive at the Valley. Elder Joseph returned to our home in good health and gave us the love of gospel kindred in western Societies at our religious service. Love to all our gospel friends North, South, East and West. Shaker Station, Conn. Paul gives expression to these words in his letter to the Colossians: 'We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, because of the hope laid up for you in heaven.' The reason of his thankfulness is found in the fact that the Colossian Church had remained steadfast and true to the foundation principles of the gospel. Through temptations, trials and persecutions the hope which they cherished had comforted and sustained them. What was true in the experience of those early Christians has been true in the experience of all the disciples of Christ ever since. The hope laid up for them in heaven has been an anchor to their souls, holding them amid trials and conflicts which they have encountered. And as we press onward in the self-denying path, we with Paul thank God for the hope laid up for us in heaven. 'All who have this hope,'�that is, the hope of being like Christ, 'purify themselves even as he is pure.' Glorious hope. How it brightens as the years pass away. Let us so live that our faith and hope may stand, ever guided by God's hand. 4652 spaces of cream were sold in Sept. A large crop of apples, 612 bushels and 42 of pears have been dried, and the work goes biavely on. Hubbard squashes a good crop. The.times of feeding poultry should be regular, certain hours being fixed upon for that purpose, but they are few who systematically feed their fowls. Clean water should be kept in the presence of poultry at all times, and yet this important matter is overlooked by many. Warmth in the winter is very essential to laying, being as important as a supply of food. D. Orcutt. The beautiful October days are lending their aid to inspire our hearts with true thankfulness for the bounties of heaven, both spiritually and temporally. Our garners are well filled, and plenty abounds in every direction. 'Hands to work, and hearts to God' never meets with disappointment. A consecrated life finds its daily reward. At this season of hurry and bustle to have the fruits well secured for winter use, combines toil and patience also perseverence, and our labors are not in vain. At present the apple crop demands our attention, as the abundance of shining fruit bends the heavy laden branches to the ground. Potatoes are nearly all harvested and a bountiful yield of good size and quality. Corn is cut, and ready to be brought to the barn, and is also satisfactory in every way. Nothing is wanting to remind us of that love which governs, and the power that has created all these blessings which we daily receive. We have enjoyed a visit from two Sisters from Philadelphia the past month which has proved beneficial in many ways, the bond of union is strengthened, gospel love has been diffused, and the living testimony of Mother's gospel enjoyed. These elements increase our thankfulness and zeal, to make greater effort for this 'Beautiful gospel, this soul saving gospel.' M. Withain. Ayer, Mass. Oct. 1, 1891. We are just now having glowing accounts of the future of our people by a spiritualistic medium who has been with us a few days. She has looked into the future of Society and tells us what we are to be in three years from this time. All very good, but I fear there is a work to be done before reaching that glorious state. No condition in Society can be attained without work and the more glorious, the more ardent and severe the labor of those who are the pioneers of the work. The strongest test of character is the power to work free of personal spirit. No change has ever been accomplished without a great sacrifice on the part of some of the members of Society, hence the great necessity of help from the powers of wisdom. To have a power to work while out of sympathy with many of the methods and yet in entire sympathy with the true purpose of the work is a great gift of grace, and belongs to the best characters. A unity of purpose can exist where there is diversity of opinion as to how the purpose is to be accomplished. True devotion is not shown by tenacity of opinion, but by a spirit of investigation to discover how far that tenacity of opinion is true and can be justified. Wliere the object of each worker is the good of all and to build up the true principles, there will be but little opposition to meet. Success then will not rest on 'I Think' but on 'these are the facts, how can we meet them.' A misunderstanding may sometimes arise, but it is not due so much to personal feelings, as a lack of frankness of expression of the true feeling. 'Let us reason together,' is good logic, and where there has been a mistake made, let us look upon it as a mistake of the head and not of the heart. Duties of the household stand about the same from month to month, though the Sisters have shaken from their shoulders the work of herb-picking and are now engaged in the preserving of fruit. The farmers have filled the silo with eighty-five tons of the best of corn fodder. Nothing pleases the farmer more than to see the fruits of the harvest coming in bountifully, and he feels assured that 'God helps those who help themselves.' As there is, generally, a strife among gardeners to have the first ripe tomatoes, I would suggest that they try Maul's Tree tomato. If you have not had it, try it next year and let us know of your success. I think it is one of the wonders of the garden. I set 175 plants and I think every plant yielded not less than three pecks of good tomatoes. A. D. B.
