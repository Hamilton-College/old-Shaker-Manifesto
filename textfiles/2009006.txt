BE COURTEOUS. Annie R. Stephens. The aggregate of life is made up of little things ; the words we utter, and our daily thoughts and actions, do much towards forming our characters ; therefore how diligently we should strive to so cultivate our hearts, and curb the impetuosity of our dispositions, that our exterior deportment shall prove the refinement of our spirits. 'Our life is centered in the sphere of common duties,'�how true this is. Then why not adorn our daily lives, with the best things our hearts possess, and make our homes attractive with the sunshine of kindness and gentleness of manner. While we admire integrity, arid that sterling worth of character that makes a true man and woman, and are assiduously engaged in maintaining these admirable qualities in our own lives, yet I think there are some things that truly belong to the Christian faith that we are quite negligent of ; that is, the common courtesies of life. We would not countenance superfluities and meaningless forms of politeness, that are naught but vanity and empty show ; true politeness never springs from these, it has its source in an entire forgetfulness of self, and a tender regard for the feelings of others. Upon meeting a stranger or a dear friend, it appears to require no effort to assume the apparel of politeness, to be affable in our manners and extend our heartfelt affections, but those who are truly dearest to our hearts, those with whom we are called to live and labor, to enjoy the blessings of life, and bear its trials and burdens ; when brought in close contact with one another, how apt we are to grow indifferent to their tender feelings, and frequently speak and act in an uncourteous way. 'Life and death are in the power of the tongue ;'�how careful we should be to guard that member, that we utter nothing that wounds. There is a very common habit I fear many of us possess ; that is, saying unkind words one of another. We would not be guilty of defaming another's character, yet so natural is it to let some careless remark pass our lips, that we would be quite ashamed for the person spoken of to hear; how much better if we cannot find anything good to say, to speak not at all. I have heard of a society called the Speak-no-Evil Society. Its members are required before speaking evil of any one to ask themselves three questions ;�Is it true ? Is it kind? Is it necessary? Before speaking against another, if we should stop and consider these things, how seldom we should find it in our hearts to speak of evil; I think it would be well for us all to form ourselves members of this association. The Scriptures commend those who are of a meek and quiet spirit. Well cultivated persons will be gentle in all their movements, and upon entering a room, will open and close the door quietly, and will never speak in a rude noisy manner; in conversation they will not be obtrusive and usurp all the time in talking as though they were superior and wished to be heard, but will be considerate of others and give them their just privileges. There are many things we might mention, such as manners at the table, a willingness to wait upon others ; a greedy disposition and an over anxiousness to begin before our .superiors is very unbecoming ; but it is to be hoped that none of us have been so neglected that we will commit any gross mistakes. So liable are we to grow indifferent to our deportment, that it requires constant effort and frequently persistent energy to smooth down the angular corners of our characters. None of us admire a blunt manner or tone of utterance ; even if our own decorum is not perfect, our sensibilities are always wounded by such. The courteous address ; the pleasant good morning, that sends a thrill of joy through our hearts, and gives us courage to perform the duties of the dixy ; the sweet good night breathed from loving lips that seems to place us neath the angels' care through the hours of slumber; the tender smile, the gentle manner, the word of kindness and the obliging spirit; can these spring from any other fountain but a good heart ? we think not; therefore let us cultivate these more and more. We see in nature that everything is improved by culture ; and what is the rough block of marble without the sculptor's art upon it ? how he chisels and works until it presents the beauty and symmetry of a perfect form; and what is the diamond taken from its rocky bed, covered with dirt; what is it compared with the polished stone, flashing with brilliancy? we can all draw illustrations from these. Just here I am reminded of an incident related of George Herbert the distinguished poet of England :�in one of his walks to join a musical society, he saw a poor man with a poorer horse, that had fallen beneath his load. Putting off his canonical coat he helped him to unload, and afterward to load his horse ; and so like the good Samaritan was he, that he also gave him money by which to refresh himself. So coming to his musical friends thej^ began to wonder why George Herbert should appear in their company so soiled and discomposed. But he told them the reason ; and one of them said he had disgraced himself by so mean an employment. His answer was ; he thought that what he had done would prove music to him at midnight, and that the omission of it, would have made discords in his conscience whenever he should pass by that place. We all have it in our power to perform little kindnesses, let us seek to help others in the true spirit of Christian courtesy ; let us tune the hearts we come in contact with to the music of love, then will no harsh discords of ill-will sadden our lives. We find ourselves placed in this world with surroundings that not only affect ourselves, but those with whom we are associated; not only our outward actions, but our interior thoughts have sounds that vibrate on the electric currents of feeling, and wing their way from heart to heart; therefore, let us admire all that is good, and fill our souls with the same ; then will refinement of heart glow in our countenances and our deportment will be Christ-like and courteous.
