Much Beloved Elder Henry;--We have quite lately been... [The following beautiful letter from the pen of our beloved gospel father, Elder Daniel, is placed before the readers of the Manifesto, that all may share in a treasure which is made precious to the Believer as we remember the consecrated life work of our aged parent. Ed.] Watervliet, N. Y., May 2, 1889. Much Beloved Elder Henry ;� We have quite lately been favored with the perusal of a very interesting and pleasant communication, from your ready pen, addressed to the traveling ministerial delegation who have, and will pass a limited sojourn at every Society in the west and south. Elder Giles forwarded said notice for the edification and attention of the remaining half, who 'are now at home,' in the midst of surrounding Brethren and Sisters. We are indeed made very happy and comfortable in the full knowledge of charitable considerations extended to us. As the stiff right hand of your aged Brother can only hold or move the pen with much difficulty, we trust that charity may pass over an indefinite multitude of ill-shapen pen-marks. It is only uni- versal, interested gospel love that causes the pen to move at the present time. After imparting the special love, kind thanks, and affectionate remembrance of Kldress Ann, to all the dear souls at Canterbury, the remainder of this small sheet may be more personal. This day, the second of May, is the birthday of your Brother of 85 years ; being born in the year 1804, in Logan County, Ky., you will perceive that the count is correct. In taking a retrospective view of the past, I am led to reflect on what has been well done, with pleasure ; but some good things that have been left undone, cause a little uneasiness. In my declining years I have received numerous tokens of love and respect from various loved Brethren and Sisters. May these pen-marks give evidence that all of them have been fully appreciated, and now, heart-felt thauks are here presented to every ISister and Brother at loved Canterbury. Even a highly prized letter written by request, (and a very good sample by the way,) was duly and thankfully received, but not responded to. Many thanks and kindest love, is hereby extended to the writer thereof. We left Mt. Lebanon on the 24th ult. Left Societv at that place, in common health, and busily engaged in making or earning money, cleaning house and door-yard. Farming and gardening nearly a month more forward than usual. Here at our valley home, we find usual health, but do not realize sickness to be a very 'strange' or uncommon thing. Vegetation at this place more forward than at the Mount; cherry and plum trees in full bloom. Of late we have been favored with a lovely rain, which makes us still more thankful, as the rain was much needed. Now good Elder Henry, we tender to you, and kind Sisters of the printing department, our most hearty thanks, for your kindness aud promptness in forwarding the Manifesto,�for the extra one sent to this place. Eldress Ann sends a thousand and one, thauks. Ever yours in love, Daniel Boler.
