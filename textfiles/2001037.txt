'THEY SAY-' 'They say'—Ah ! well, suppose they do : But can they prove the story true? Suspicion may arise from naught But malice, envy, want of thought; Why count yourself among the 'they' Who whisper what they dare not say? 'They say'—But why the tale rehearse, And help to make the matter worse? No good can possibly accrue From telling what may bo untrue ; And is it not a nobler plan To speak of all the best you can? 'They say'—Well, if it should be so, Why need you tell the tale of woe; Will it the bitter wrong redress, Or make one pang of sorrow less? Will it the erring one restore, Henceforth to go and sin no more? 'They say'—0 ! pause and look within, See how your heart inclines to sin; Watch! lest in dark temptation's hour, You, too, should sink beneath its power : Pity the frail—weep o'er their fall, But speak of good or not at all.
