PROGRESS It is a good sign, to find so many outspoken opponents to war among the ministers of the many denominations professedly Christian. Within fifty years large progress has been made in gaining converts to the truth that war is unchristian in its every phase. We are very glad to be able to count on the increase of so much rationality ; and while not intending to dampen the ardor of every Christian ad- vocate for peace as against war, we use this occasion to express the hope, that Christian light will break upon more multitudes, that they may see that marriage, private property, pride of life and of dress, rich and poor, worldly politics and ambitions, are no more found in Christ than is -warâ€”are no more Christian than is war. A Christian's life is patterned after Christ's.
