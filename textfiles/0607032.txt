APOLOGETIC The copious extracts which we have transferred from the columns of the Atlantic Monthly to this number of The Shaker, will prove very interesting to all having any sympathy with, or curiosity about us as a people. Although so lengthy, and necessarily crowding out several very excellent articles from good Bros. Peebles, Russell, Fraser, Leggett, and some from equally good sisters, yet we belie,ve we shall be thanked for the space used, while we promise the 'excellent articles' in our next. For the same reason we offer apology for the absence of our 'Spirit of the Farm.' and 'Useful Receipts ' departments. Our farm notes, we learn from many letters, are appreciated; and we return many thanks for the congratulations tendered us, in that our ' Shaker is filled with choice variety, and very interesting.' 'I have read every word of June number,' writes a Sonyea friend, 'and consider it the best.' Another from Worcester, Mass., says: 'Although I take a multitude of papers, TnK Shaker is the only one that I read from beginning to end.' We tally one for every such conclusion. Thank you, friends, one and all. G. A. L.
