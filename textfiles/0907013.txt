Daniel Frazer, Dear Sir : I have read with much pleasure and admiration the ' Divine Afflatus ; ' and by addressing Mr. John Whiteley learned your authorship of that remarkable pamphlet. As Shakerism appears to me one of the most successful of all attempts to realize the religion of Jesus Christ, I would be glad to see your plan more actively employed. The history of the Dual element of Shakerism appears to me (if correctly informed) very imperfectly elucidated as yet. I would also like to see it more distinctly set forth (if possible), that Shakers in adopting a life of celibacy as the highest ideal of religion do not condemn as necessarily wicked or impure the life of marriage pursued by sincere Christians. The assertion of necessary and inevitable sin, crime or impurity in marriage, is an attack upon the divine order or divine wisdom which places the parties in a false position. It is my impression that Shakers generally have fallen into that error, for which there seems to be no necessity, and which I am sure is not the sentiment of heaven. Yours cordially, New York City J.
