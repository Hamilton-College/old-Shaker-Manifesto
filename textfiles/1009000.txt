WHO OWNETH AMERICA'S SOIL? A. J. H. DUGANNE BY Who owneth America's soil? Is it he who graspeth the hard red gold; Whose glittering gains are by millions told, Who bindeth his slaves to the woof and the loom ; And chaineth their soul in living tomb— The tomb of hopeless toil ? Not he, not he — by Heaven ! Who shieldeth America's land? Is it he who counteth his ships by scores ; Who plucketh his gain from a thousand shores; Who buyeth and selleth and worketh not, And holdeth in pride what by fraud he got— With hard and griping hand ? Not he, not he — by Heaven ! Who guardeth America's right? Is it he who eateth the orphan's bread, Who crusheth the poor with his grinding tread ; Who flingeth his bank-note lies abroad, And buildeth to worship a golden god, A shrine to Mammon's might? Not he, not he —by Heaven ! Not these not these —¦ by Heaven ! But to those who labor for God and man ; Who work their part in the world's great plan — Who plant good seed in the desert's dearth, And bring forth treasures from brave old Earth ; To these the soil is given — To these, to these — by Heaven ! To these must the soil belong; To the men of all climes whose souls are true — Or Pagan, or Christian, or Turk, or Jew; To the men who will hallow our glorious soil — The million who hope and the millions who toil For the Right against the Wrong ; To these does the soil belong — To Guard, to work, and to own.
