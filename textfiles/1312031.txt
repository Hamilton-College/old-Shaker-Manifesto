SALT AND LEAVEN INJURIOUS A correspondent residing in N. J., writes in regard to her experience in diet. She is a lady physician, judging from her signature, and therefore what she says is entitled to respect. She says; 'I have often thought I would acknowledge my obligation to you for much useful information gathered from your valuable Journal. I have found after nearly forty years experience, that very much ot the early decay of the teeth and a large portion of our nervous diseases, are engendered at home by the use of common salt, and the fermented food which forms part of meals. These cause irritation and inflammation, to cure which, a poultice of stimulating food or drink is put into the stomach, or a narcotic is used to deaden the sensibility. The final outcome of such cures is a worse condition; inflammation extends throughout the alimentary canal and may threaten its beautiful structure with ruin. I was tormented with toothache until I learned that salt was unnecessary. I contrive to live without it, and found that I could relish my food without salt, and found many exquisite flavors in food which I had never tasted before, and to my astonishment my teeth stopped aching, and have never ached since. The teeth which did not exfoliate are firmer and look better than ever. Other members of my family have been benefitted in the same way' Accompanying the above statements are some recipes for the hygienic preparation of some of the cereals, which we shall hand over to the kitchen department for proving.
