'ON EARTH PEACE.' When war's baptismal scourge was o'er, We heard words blest as evening dew, Reverberating from the halls of State, Till far and near the echo Hew — ' Let us have Peace.' We heard, and grateful hoped them true, And that the world tow'rd progress turn'd: Our vision was of Peace and Brotherhood; And full of trust our bosoms burn'd, To greet sweet Peace. We saw the other half of man Upraised, and queenly at his side ; Not less he shone, but all the more, That righteousness was not denied, But brought true Peace. In ev'ry trust she took her part, And guided with a helping hand, In lifting to a better state, Those who pollute themselves and land: And help'd grow Peace. But, while we mused, we heard of ships, And increased armaments of war, And fear that swords must still be swords, And nations keep on learning war, Instead of Peace. And then we wonder'd who could dare, To tamper with the dial-plate of time, And turn the hands of progress back, And stay the bright Millennial clime, Which is true Peace. We wonder'd, but we inly thought Of what a wiser one had said: — ' First pure, then peaceable !' Is it Corruption that stands between Fair earth and Peace ? E. H. Webster, Harvard, Mass.
