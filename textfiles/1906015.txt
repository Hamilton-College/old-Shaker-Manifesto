To the Manifesto;--When I was quite young... Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. April, 1889. To the Manifesto ;ï¿½When I was quite young, my mother was called from earth, to explore the unknown country from whence no traveler returns. After her death, I had no easy time, as my father was poor, yet he strove honestly and faithfully to support a large family of children and of course when our mother was taken it was with us like sheep without a shepherd. We were scattered. I chanced to get with a man who promised to pay me five dollars per. month. He worked me in the field, aud at everything that came along, but ten dollars was all I ever l'eceived for my time. After leaving him, I worked for a man by the name of G. A. Brown. This good man was very kind, and advised me to go to Pleasant Hill, Ky., and join the Shakers. This good man also had a son, who is now Elder Napoleon D. Brown, of Pleasant Hill, Ky. On, or about the fifteenth of February, one day at ten o'clock, I started for Pleasant Hill, a distance of twenty eight miles, but before reaching the place it was late in the night. In the afternoon it began to rain and soon darkness was spread over the earth. I tried long before dark to secure shelter and something to eat, as j had fasted since early in the morning. I was refused at every place, and when asked where I was going, they would say, 'Oh, you can soon get there, it is ouly two or three miles.' Some of them would advise me not to go there, although they refused me a crust of bread. The last house at which I stopped after being refused, I tried to hire the man to let me come in and rest on his floor. I told him I had no money but would give him all my school-books, which consisted of several readers, a geography, slates and such things, but he told me some member of his house was sick and he could not let me stay. He showed me the lights, and said, 'There is where you want to go.' After asking how far it was, he said, 'three miles.' It was then very dark. I started on, for though I had been denied charity from the children of this world, I felt sure that when I reached Pleasant Hill, I should find friends. After climbing over many high cliffs, and deep ravines, I reached, in safety, the street in front of the East House. Although it was late, some of the good Sisters were up sewing and knitting, and just about that time the clouds parted and the full moon shone out brightly over the beautiful city of God's chosen people. Most of them were slumbering in peace. As I stood there viewing the place, I exclaimed aloud, 'Praise God for this beautiful home, the blessings of which I can so freely enjoy.' I intended going to the Central House, but as I knocked at the front door of East House one of the Sisters was coming to bar the door for the night, she asked, 'Who comes there?' I said, we, and she thought I was one of their own boys, but on opening the door she found who I was. I was invited to walk in. Refreshments were given me, and it reminded me of Christian when on his heavenward journey, as he stopped at the house of the Interpreter. Since then, nor before, have I had such kindness shown me. I wish 'o have it known, that although I departed from the place, I hold the people in kindest remembrance. The Shakers have done more good than they will ever know on this earth. The contrast between the Christian, and those who are not interested to do good, I have tried to show in this piece. The Shakers are doing more now towards educating children than when I was a boy. At that time public school was not taught there, and I did not have the chance that many others have now. I have obtained my education as best I could, and that is not much. I now tender my thanks, and pray the blessings of a merciful God to rest and abide with the Shakers wherever they ma;y be. Respectfully yours, Thomas Benge.
