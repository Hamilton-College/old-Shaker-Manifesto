Respected friend, J.W.G. We read your... Respected Friend, J. W. G.�We read your excellent letter with interest and pleasure, believing the sentiments therein expressed were the outcome of sincere and good feeling; for, ' Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. ' and ' From a pure fountain floweth sweet waters. ' The love that you hold for Believers, and your attraction to their faith and principles, will eventually gather you to them ; if not in this world, most certainly in the next. ' For where the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.' 'And where the treasure is, there will the heart be also. ' Only the noblest and purest motives, prompt souls to forsake all for Christ's sake and the gospel, and to form those higher relationships that are angelic and enduring. Jesus gave his disciples the key-note to heavenly harmony when he said, ' Seek first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, and all needful things will be added thereto. ' The things of earth perish with the using, but the treasures of the spirit are eternal; and while mankind bury themselves in the material elements, giving their entire thought and concern to the accumulation of that which only sustains the physical part; they will, sooner or later, find themselves devoid of the substance that perisheth not. When man shall be disrobed of the mortal, and shall enter the world of spiritual realities ; he will not be asked what riches he has laid up on earth ; what fame he has reached ; what honors he has shared ; or, what reputation he has held among men. But, Avhat good deeds has he sent before him ; what of real virtue does his soul possess that will recommend him to the society of the good and just. We should consider our latter end and be wise, living each day in reference to the future. Our young people are indeed favorably situated, both as to their physical, moral and spiritual welfare ; having rare opportunities for the development and unfoldment of all that is good, beautiful and true. Surrounded by influences that fend to mold them in the Christ-like pattern of innocence, truth and love ; the virtues on which jou dwell with so much feeling. Surely, the foundations of the earthly order are out of course, oj there would not exist such conditions of misery and woe as we see in society at large. The great monopolies in business absorb the rights and privileges of all, and reduce the poor to a state of servitude, as abject as that of the Israelites to their Egyptian Cask-masters. There is but little chance for the lower classes to rise in the social scale. The one great cause of want is a lack of the God-given right to ownership in land. If every poor man had a little homestead of his own ; he would have something to fall back upon when manufacture failed to supply him with the meagre necessaries of life. Ignorance and crime are the result of idleness, and listless automatic slavework ; and there is a terrible volcano gathering its forces in the heart of society. There must sooner or later be a convulsion, an upheaval, a mighty struggle between capital ;md labor, that1 shall result in a different order of things. The poet sings �'And ever the right comes uppermost, And ever is justice done. ' O that man would learn to do justice and love mercy ! rising above cupidity and selfishness, on a broader plane of philanthropic action. Love to God and to the neighbor, is the law that should govern mankind in all their transactions with one another. I like your definition of the word duty. When one feels it a privilege to do good, they have opened that deep well of living waters in their souls, that shall flow forth to make the desert smile and the waste places blossom. Such souls are inspired with noble self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of- truth and right. It was just this heavenly enthusiasm that warmed the hearts, and quickened the souls of the great and good founders of our order ; and gave them the power to build on the basis of enduring principles, a church that has stood in its integrity over a century; while many attempts at organization, and communism have failed, because men lacked the higher impulse, the religious element, that has given stability to our institution. I wonder sometimes, why there are not more, who, like Mary of old seek the better part that cannot be taken from them. Then I am reminded of the words of Jesus, ' Strait is the gate and narrow the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.' Human nature does not like restraint; and thousands would rather live in poverty; than to cast away the tattered 'rarments of sin ; and share the fulfillment of the glorious promises, that compensate the faithful cross-bearer in the kingdom of Christ. Beloved Elder Frederic, good Eldress Antoinette, Sister Anna and others of whom you speak ; send kindly greetings to you. You have an interest in our prayers and good feelings, as have all who show any disposition to obey the call ' to come up higher' into a better and purer life. I am glad that you were pleased with the little story; it so impressed itself on my mind, that I wrote it out as simply as you told it. With well wishes for your prosperity, and with an earnest desire that your faith may increase and be unto you as a shining light, growing brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. I close with happy greetings. Martha J. Anderson.
