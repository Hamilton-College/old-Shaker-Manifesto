I WONDER WHY. 'I wonder why this world's good things Should fall in such unequal shares : Why some should taste of all the joys And others only feel the cares? I wonder why the sunshine bright Should fall in paths some people tread, While others shiver in the shade Of clouds that gather overhead? ' I wonder why the trees that hang So full of luscious fruit should grow Only where some may reach and eat, While others faint and thirsty go? Why should sweet flowers bloom for some, For others only thorns be found; And some grow rich on fruitful earth, While others till but barren ground? 'I wonder why the hearts of some O'erflow with joy and happiness, While others go their lonely way Unblessed with aught of tenderness? I wonder why the eyes of some Should ne'er be moistened with a tear, While others weep from morn till night, Their hearts so crushed with sorrow here ? ' Ah, well! we may not know indeed The why, the wherefores of each life! But this we know, there's One who sees And watches us through joy or strife. Each life its mission here fulfills, And only He may know the end. And, loving Him, we may be strong Thro' storm or sunshine He may send. Selected.
