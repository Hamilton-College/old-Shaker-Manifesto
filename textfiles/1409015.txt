EVERY IDLE W0RD. OLIVER PRENTISS. For every idle word I must account to God, Or feel his chastening rod, how watchful I should be; A bridle for my tongue, to curb it while I'm young Is surely one among the needful things for me. I'll labor to refrain from everything that's vain And strive this gift to gain,�To think before 1 speak, My words I'll ponder well and no old stories tell All idle speech repel, for Wisdom is not weak. When I am off my guard old nature pushes hard My progress to retard and bring me into loss, If I redemption find this nature I must bind And leave it far behind by virtue of the cross. 0 could I hear the young resolve to curb the tongue And in the Truth be strong it would delight mine ears, What honor they might gain! What victory obtain Ii they would but refrain from foolish jests and jeers. 1 know it can be done and I'm resolved for one All idle words to shun and quell a forward sense, While I hare breath to spend my tongue shall not offend A single Gospel friend, ' tis sin�To-give offense. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
