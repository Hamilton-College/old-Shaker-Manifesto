DIVINE AFFLATUS James G. Russell Moderate Enfield, N. H. 1. All hail thou glorious light, Shining on Mount Zion's height, 2. Behold, thy kingdom come! Father now thy will be done, Casting out all shades of night, Thy 'divine afflatus' run, That righteousness may reign. Thro' earth and heav'n the same. CHORUS. Zion's inmates one and all, Heed ye now the spirit call. Let thy light so shine abroad, That sin-sick souls may cease to plod THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 95 The way no eye can see. But viewing on Mount Zion's height, The fullness of thy glory bright, May gather home to thee.
