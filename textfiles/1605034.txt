THE BEACON. Canterbury, N. H. 1. Far out upon Life's ocean We see the coming sail! 2. Hold out the beacon clearly,�Salvation's glorious ray; 3. In vain we cry the blessing, Still waiting on the shore; The waves are in commotion Not in Awake the past nor future, to active service, As old traditions fail. We see its light today. And ply the laboring oar. Sail on, brave Ship of Progress, Contend with craft and creed Let present revelation Light up the darksome tide, The nations thirst for knowledge,�Where is the Savior found? Until the suffering millions By light and truth are freed. Until our needy comrades In harbor safely ride. Let virgins sing the advent, With no uncertain sound.
