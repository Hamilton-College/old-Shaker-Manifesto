It is said that corn loses one-fifth... __It is said that corn loses one-fifth by drying, and wheat one-fourteenth. From this the estimate is made that it is more profitable for the farmer to sell imshelled corn in the fall at seventy-five cents, than at one dollar a bushel in the following summer, and that wheat at $1.25 in December, is equal to $1.50 in the succeeding June. In cases of potatoes, taking those that rot and are otherwise lost, together with the shrinkage, there is little doubt that between October and June, the loss to the owner who holds them is not less than thirty-three per cent.â€”New York Bulletin.
