NOTHING LOST MARY WHITCHER Waste not thy time— That moment spent In idleness and play, Might benefit some needy one In this, and future day. With good intent, From heart sincere, Deep answers back to deep, And no good deed is ever lost Though long the silent sleep. Our thoughts have voices— And will tell On many a heart and mind, The feeling, greatest gift of all The senses of mankind. Cty., N. H.
