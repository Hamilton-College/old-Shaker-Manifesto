LIVE-STOCK ITEMS Mistakes in managing horses... Mistakes in managing horses, even when fan apparently trivial nature, are often the ause of much needless suffering and permanent injury. Of these a fewr that are common ust about this time are : bathing the feet of iorses to cool them off when heated by hard work; watering them immediately after meals when about to start on a journey, instead of vaiting a while, or letting them drink before eeding; giving them, through mistaken kindness, an extra feed before driving them at a apid pace, and so forcing them to travel on an overloaded stomach; starting to fair or market at a swinging trot, while the animals are fresh and full of feed, instead of letting ;hem settle slowly down to their work; and cruelly omitting to cover them when heated after a rapid drive, and so exposing them to much suffering while the reckless driver is enjoying himself.â€”Rural, N. Y. The advantage of kindness to cow... The advantage of kindness to cows has Keen frequently insisted on in these pages, and is well illustrated by the following anecdote : A man had a fine cow that, week after week, was milked alternately by a couple of hired men. He observed that the amount of butter he carried weighed about a pound more each alternate week. He watched the men, and tried the cow after they had finished milking; but always found that no milk had been left in the teats. Finally he asked the Scotch girl who took care of the milk, if she could account for the difference. 'Why, yes,' said she. ' When Jim milks, he says to the old cow : ' So ; my pretty muley ; so !' Bu when Sam milks, he hits her on the hip with the edge of the pail, and says : ' H'ist, you old brute !' '
