The advantage of kindness to cow... The advantage of kindness to cows has Keen frequently insisted on in these pages, and is well illustrated by the following anecdote : A man had a fine cow that, week after week, was milked alternately by a couple of hired men. He observed that the amount of butter he carried weighed about a pound more each alternate week. He watched the men, and tried the cow after they had finished milking; but always found that no milk had been left in the teats. Finally he asked the Scotch girl who took care of the milk, if she could account for the difference. 'Why, yes,' said she. ' When Jim milks, he says to the old cow : ' So ; my pretty muley ; so !' Bu when Sam milks, he hits her on the hip with the edge of the pail, and says : ' H'ist, you old brute !' '
