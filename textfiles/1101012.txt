FASHION That fashion, whatever that may be, has no sense of utility is demonstrated amongst all people. But that fashion prides herself upon receiving sacrifices of utility has not been so fully demonstrated. Substitute the word devil for fashion, and remember that health is ever the thing called for, and we have a key to the follies and foibles of mankind. They are sacrifices unto devils; as were all the lives lost in the Salem persecution of witches and witchcraft. Let us make that which is good and true, fashionable. By accepting Divine Revelation in our own time, we shall sweep away the evils that have come thro' the instigation of wicked sensual spirits.
