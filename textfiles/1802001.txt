TRUE THEOLOGY. Harvey L. Eads. Text :�There is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. Job xxxii., 8. The subject I have chosen today, is one that I had no desire either to speak or write upon, but having been invited to the task and coming to see the necessity of it, I feel it to be my duty to comply, trusting I may have spirit guidance in the same. Although there can be but one true theology, yet the term is of more varied application than any word in the English language. It is derived from Theos�God and Logos�Discourse. So that any discourse on man's relation and duty to God is termed Theology. All seem to differ more in what they consider to be their duty to God than they do in their relation to Him. On this there should be no difference as only one relation to Him is possible and that is the spiritual. The subject is of such importance and magnitude that I approach it reluctantly�a subject on which few can agree, the question arises how shall the true be demonstrated? Today I will confine myself mostly to man's relation to God. He can have no material connection to Him because He is Spirit; and matter and spirit are contradictory substances and are therefore not tactual; on this all Philosophers agree. The same is true in regard to intellect. God is not an intellectual Being, but 'Omnipresent Spirit filling im- mensity,' with whom intellectual connection is impossible. I see the danger of getting into water so deep that my line cannot take the sounding, but as far as I go I will strive to be clear. To do this I will say, that intellect pertains only to creatures that are under necessity. God is not under necessity and is therefore not intellectual, hence we have no need of intellectual culture to make connection with Him. If God were an intellectual Being it would then logically follow that the most intellectual persons wculd be the most like Him and the nearest to Him, which we all know is not the case : but God being Spirit, it follows that the most spiritual minded are nearest to Him. l&gt; To be spiritually minded is life and peace.' Rom. viii., 6. It cannot be well disputed that the intellect of the whole world, whiHi is not in subordination to the God-directed spirit in man, leads away from God so that every nation of the earth is elated by its intellectual greatness and seems to forget God. Man was but little more than an intellectual animal, until 'God breathed into him the breath of life and maa became a living soul.' God by his inspiration enlightened the spirit within him which was dead to his relation and duty to his Creator. The difference between man and the animal world is this : The former has a spirit within him which God directs, but is made free to obey or disobey at pleasure, but is held responsible for every act of life. The latter is animointellectual. God operating on the intellect is what we call instinct. Pope says : 'Place reason over instinct as best you can, In this 'tis God directs, in that 'tis man.' If Pope is right, he confirms the position I have taken : man directing his intellect, which is not in his heart, but is in his brain. God being Spirit every relation to Him mint be spiritual. But on this subject it seems that Philosophers and Lexicographers do not harmonize, and when Doctors disagree who shall decide ? Philosophers say matter cannot think. Brain is matter therefore brain cannot think, while nine tenths of the human race thiak differently and say the best formed head and best brain is the ablest thinker. This is pretty strong against Philosophy ; still Philosophers may be right. Lexicographers seem to be still more confused on the subject. They tell us that intellect is a faculty of the soul and is seated in the brain, and again they tell us that intellect is a part of the human soul ; if distinct it is made an entity, instead of faculty, and that the soul is the immaterial spirit inhabiting the human body ; and then again that intellect is a power to perceive material things in their natural relation,�thus they make confusion of the whole matter. There can be little doubt but what the immaterial spirit inhabits the whole body, the head having its portion ; it would then seem, that the safest ground to take would be between the two extremes and say that the soul existing in the head vitalizes the molecules of the brain thus enabling them to think, compare and reason, when, without this vitalization, they would be dormant. This would meet the world's ideal and reconcile all differences. But this I give for what it is worth without affirming or denying as either is too deep for my line and beyond my power to prove. But wherever the truth may lie, it should be in subjection to the spirit, which God directs from his house in the human heart, and which if obeyed no mistakes will follow. Witness the Savior ; He walked the earth as a Being devoid of intellect� was moved in all he said or did by' the spirit of the Father. He testified that he spake not of himself but what was given him of God, and thus '�spake as no man ever spake.' His Sermon on the Mount has never been equaled by all the world's cultured intellect. lie never made a mistake in word or dee 1 ; and where was there ever an intellect of which the same could be said? None�not one, and yet presumptive intellect pretends to find flaws in his teaching ! He went so far as to say : I thank Thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent (the great cultured intellects) mid hast revealed them unto babes ; even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. Matt, xi., 25, 26. To which all his true followers can say amen. I feel safe in saying, all the mistakes and blunders of the world come of the intellect, not of the spirit within man, that God hath enlightened by his inspiration as was Christ. As I have before said�Animals are intellectual: How would it do to agree with Lexicographers and say it was a part of the animal's .soul ? It would be as true for the horse as for the man. Let me repeat ; the difference between the man and horse is this: God operates directly on the intellect of the horse, while He has created in man, by a spirit emanation from Himself, a personified spirit on whom is placed all intellectual responsibility, and who is left free to obey or disobey, having God's blessing in obedience, aud his displeasure in disobedience ; being held to a strict accountability to his Heavenly Father, where punishment follows every violation of God's deman 1 upon him, being free as God is free, separate and distinct from the material intellect which it is his duty to govern. This seems to me to be clear. Still Intellect seems to sit Queen of the world, with its g &gt;ld poured down at her feet. It is so with professor and profane ; but light is increasing which I will show by quoting a few words from a late London preacher who said : 'No alembics or retort can reveal the soul� neither microscope nor telescope can bring to view the mysteries of spiritual existence, and it is equally true that no man can come to the knowledge of the Father [by the intellect,] but by Him who is the way, t!ie truth aud the life, by seeing, hearing aud obeying Him.' Here is the crown and consummation of Christian evolution : 'As He lived, so shall we also live.' This we may say is light out of darkness. Here it may be asked : Have we no need of intellectual culture? most surely we have; while we have material bodies and manipulations,�can't have too much, if kept in its place. Its business is to direct in the manipulation of material things only and is not needed in spiritual things. It is the province of the Spirit to say ivhat shall be done, and the province of the intellect to say how it shall be done ; hence intellect should never interfere with or try to change spiritual gifts. The spirit says Love your enemy. The intellect says hate him The spirit says if a man smite you on one cheek, turn to him the other. The intellect says defend yourself and smite him on the other cheek. The spirit says if a man take your cont, give him your cloak also. Intellect says jail him, put him in the penitentiary, &amp;c. Intellect only wants one more thing than a pig, and that is fame, to be the greatest. It has no conscience. Man cannot feel compunction in his head any more than in his heels ; but, turning back to the heart for God's approval, he finds it not. Hell is the consequeuce, until the soul is relieved by confession ;md repentance. God is in the heart. If we look to the brain we find Him not, but turn and look within the heai't, there we find Him, and feel our nearness and relation to Him just in the proportion we have obeyed the spirit's dictation. Were this heeded by all the human race, there would be no mistakes or blunders ; all would love their neighbor as themselves, and this would be a God-ruled world ; but alas ! the reverse is our condition, for selfish intellect rules all the Nations of the earth and their condition is en: ugh to make all the angels in heaven weep. It is now intellect trying to correct intellect, even by dynamite bomb aud bullet, fire and sword, blood and slaughter, cliques and numbers, but all in vain. It is like Satan trying to correct Satan ; but full reformation will never come until Christ's Spirit rules, and the world is conquered by Love. Thus I think the first part of true theology- �man's relation to God, is made clear. The second part, his duty, will follow in another discourse, in which I hope still more fully to prove the truth of the text, that 'there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.' Amen. South Union, Ky.
