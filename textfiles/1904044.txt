Beloved Editor:--The Manifesto is a real comforter... Shaker Station, Ct., Feb. 1889. Beloved Editor :ï¿½The Manifesto is a real comforter, speaking many a word of cheer to me in the midst of toil and burden, and I want to say a good word in return. Were I deprived of its benefits I should be at a great loss. Please continue it. God bless you in your efforts to extend the truth. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
