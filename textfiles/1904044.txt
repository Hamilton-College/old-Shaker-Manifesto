KIND WORDS. Beloved Elder Henry:--The Manifesto comes to us freighted... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Mar. 1889. Beloved Elder Henrt :�The Manifesto comes to us freighted with much that is calculated to stimulate thought and give us food for mental growth in the Divine Life. We wish you God speed in sowing the seed of truth. The harvest lags for want of laborers and we pray the Lord to send more earnest workers into the field. Your Brother, Timothy Rayson. Beloved Editor:--The Manifesto is a real comforter... Shaker Station, Ct., Feb. 1889. Beloved Editor :�The Manifesto is a real comforter, speaking many a word of cheer to me in the midst of toil and burden, and I want to say a good word in return. Were I deprived of its benefits I should be at a great loss. Please continue it. God bless you in your efforts to extend the truth. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
