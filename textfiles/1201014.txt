It is to be regretted that singers, both in public and private, attend 140 little to that most powerful letter of recommendationâ€” the countenance ; for many who, in conversation, are agreeable and animated, no sooner begin to sing than they resemble figures whose mouths, pulled open at pleasure by a string, emit sounds, which, though ever so mellifluous, lose their effect by issuing from such automaton organs. Others, on the contrary, in their desire to avoid the charge of insipidity, so painfully distort their features that they render themselves objects of ridicule or pity. However charmed we may be by a good voice, the eye, as well as the ear, requires to be pleased; and we insensibly become fatigued and discontented when the countenance and demeanor do not in some degree accord with the subject to which we may be listening.
