Sanitary. HEALTH. A means of preserving health is the having a constant supply of fresh air in your bed chamber. It has been a great mistake to sleep in closed rooms, or in beds surrounded by curtains. No outward air, that may come to you, is so unwholesome as the unchanged air, often breathed of a close chamber. It is recorded of Methuselah who lived to a great age that he always slept in the open air for when he had lived five hundred years, an angel said to him, Arise Methuselah and build thee a house, for thou shalt live yet five hundred years longer. But Methuselah answered and said,ï¿½If I am to live but five hundred years longer, it is not worth while to build me a house. I will sleep in the fresh air as I have been used to do.
