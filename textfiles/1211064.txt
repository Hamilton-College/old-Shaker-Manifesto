SHORT RULES FOR LONG COMFORT AT HOME SHORT RULES FOR LONG COMFORT AT HOME. Put self last. Be prompt at every meal. Take little annoyances out of the way. When any good happens to anyone, rejoice. When others are suffering, drop a word of sympathy. Tell of your own faults rather than those of others. A place for everything and everything in its place. Hide your own troubles, but watch to help others out of theirs. Take hold of the knob and shut every door behind you without slamming it. Never interrupt any conversation, but wait patiently your turn to speak. Look for beauty in everything and take a cheerful view of every event. Carefully clean the mud and snow from your boots before entering the house. If from any cause you feel irritable, try the harder to do little pleasant things. Do not keep your good manners for company, but be equally polite at home and abroad. When inclined to give an angiy answer, press your lips together and say the alphabet. Always speak politely and kindly of your help, if you would have them do the same to you. When pained by an unkind word or act, ask ourselves, 'Have I not done as badly and desired forgiveness?'
