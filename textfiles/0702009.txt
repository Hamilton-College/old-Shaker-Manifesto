Darwinism As to the gradual changes which man is undergoing, they are quite obvious to courageous and clear-sighted philosophers, and plainly indicate what is to be the next stage in his development. It has lately been remai'ked that the superiority of American dentists to all other members of the profession is shown by the extraordinary display of dental instruments at the Philadelphia Exhibition. If we ask what is the cause of this superiority—which, by the way, is generally conceded to be beyond cavil—the obvious answer is that the American dentist fills more cubic feet of cavities and draws more tons of teeth in the course of a month than the English or Continental dentist fills and draws in a year. This fact, in turn, implies that American teeth are exceptionally prone to decay ; and there is a wealth of direct evidence of a conclusive character in support of this assertion. At this point the superficial thinker pauses, and imagines that he has exhausted the subject of dentistry in America. It is just here, however, that the profound Darwinian philosopher finds the clue to the next great physical change which is to distinguish the man of the future from the man oi the present. He sees that in America we are rapidly developing a race o\ men without teeth and that precisely as men have laid aside their useless primeval tails, so they are about to drop their nearly useless teeth. The man of the future is, then, to be a toothless animal. This much can science deduce from the apparently irrelevant fact tha the American display of dental instruments at Philadelphia is wonderfully and exceptionably fine.—Exchange. ~—.-----------*---------------O, for the plain, unsized, unvarnished, unpatented, uncertified, uncopyrighted truth.—Exchange.
