Redemption's song Canterbury, N. H. 1. Redemption's song, for thee I long, Thy bliss my soul would know, 2. I'll learn one measure day by day Thro' study, pains and care; 3. This passage of the victor's song O let my heart repeat; From whose rapt chords and living words Pure inspirations flow; And no false note, no siren lay, Shall plant a discord there. In union with the sainted throng Discourse its music sweet. Whose notes of joy from triumphs. won The victors only sing, I'll set it to the Golden Rule The Savior gave- -said he, This is the song for which I long, The bliss my soul would know; And from whose voices blent in one The grandest peans ring. 'Do unto others as ye would That they should do to thee.' Its thrilling chords and living words From highest sources flow.
