Issachar Bates, Sen., was getting his horse shod at a smith's, in a western State, when he, as usual, opened a sermon at man's fallen fleshly nature, and assured the company present that Christ had come again, and that he was a representative of the new gospel. He then showed the necessity of a man's confessing his sins, and living a new life like Jesus, and lie should then be enabled to do greater works than even Jesus. While preaching to his iriotly hearers, he Was annoyed by one who kept demanding a miracle ! ' What shall I do for you ?' h.e finally asked. ' Turn that cart-wheel into a horse!' replied his annoyer. ' That's just like the evil one,' he remarked, ' to leave the owner of that cart only one wheel to go home with.'
