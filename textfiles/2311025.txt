It injured the roof of our large barn so badly in a freak lasting twentyfour hours at least, that to repair the same will involve quite an expense added to that of a silo with a capacity of one hundred tons, which at present date is being built in north side of same structure. We have recently put a circular saw with other machinery into our saw-mill, instead of the 'Mulay Saw' the work of which has been so unsatisfactory in the past,ï¿½Now anticipate sawing a large quantity of lumber the coming winter for the market. Our potato harvest is abundant this fall. The best yield we have experienced in years; and thus we need not repeat the cry 'O give to the hungry, potatoes,' since five acres with three hundred bushels to the acre, must be ample supply. Apples are scarce and almost worthless as ia other localities, averaging only about one third of a crop. While we enumerate our material successes, our abundant harvests, and our many blessings, let us always keep in view THE MANIFESTO. 265 our dependence upon the Giver of all good, and like Him dispense to the poor and needy.
