DEATH OF ELDER WILLIAM REYNOLDS O. C. Hampton Union Village, May 16,1881. Dear Albert :—I know you are not in the habit of giving room in the columns of the Shaker Manifesto for extended obituaries, but this I send you for your own pleasure — condensed as much as I am able to condense an article, and if any small portion thereof can be editorally appropriated, insert; if not, not. Elder William Reynolds, was born April 4, 1815. His parents were of Irish descent, but he was born on one of the Ionian Islands, and spoke the Greek language for twelve or fourteen years of his younger days. He embraced Shakerism in 1837, being then twenty-one years of age. Ever since he became a believer he has been thoroughly upright, sincere and uncompromising in his obedience to the principles, teachings and doctrines of Christ and Mother, and exceedingly exacting with himself to keep every order and regulation of the Institution. His was a pure, unspotted virgin life — rigidly conformed to personal purity and practical THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 131 righteousness. His zeal for the welfare of Zion never flagged, and his anxiety for her prosperity in matters temporal and eternal knew no rest nor intermission. It has even been supposed that his excessive solicitude broke down his nervous sj^stem finally, and was, to SRy the least, an indirect cause of his so sudden and early death. It was said at his funeral that one could look in no direction on the premises of U. V. without seeing the labors of Elder We, and it is generally conceded that he had very superior taste and talent in architectural design and arrangement. Very many expressions of love, thanks and eulogy were united in at the funeral, which was very solemn ; andwe hope, peculiarly blessed to many if not all present thereat. This I have written you at the request of . Elder Matthew Carter, and perhaps a few of the most important points herein mentioned may be found worthy of insertion. Yours truly,
