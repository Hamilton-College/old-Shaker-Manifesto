Disappointed Elder J. B. Vance, in an address at Troy, stated that many of the requirements of Shaker Communism appeared like the lions in the way of Bunyan's Pilgrim; and which exist more in the imagirtation than in anything else, being dissolved by attack, into thin air. Just so ; much that we dreaded, becomes our delight to engage in. Some fear the Confessionalâ€”yet the relief obtained therefrom compensates the soul so much, that it is never relinquished by the faithful nor its absence desired. Some dread the Dance: One individual said, ' he would like to unite, but he could not agree to dance, particularly on the Sabbath.' This being his only objection, he was excused, with the proviso that we should not be compelled to keep out from the dance. He having no fears of this, 'set out' to be a Shaker. But a short time elapsed, before he broke into the circle, and was the most zealous dancer in the room ! It is difficult for us to get individuals to wear their own apparel; whereas ours presented an appearance too plain, before they united. Just so are individuals disappointed in their fears of what they must need do to become members of Shaker Societies. We say, if you will live the life, we care little what your theology is, what your fears are, desires have been, or hopes may be. The spirit of oneness will prevail, where all are united in the purpose to maintain a pure, virginal relation, as is found only in Christ. Only let an individual con- fess all their sins on the start in the race, and keep a conscience undefiled, and we predict all their fears will be turned into pleasurable disappointments. *
