APOLOGETIC Some of the 'Correspondence' of Elder Evans was crowded out of Dec. No. — correspondence to which we made reference. We have inserted in this number some more of the valuable information ever coming from his pen to honest inquirers. We also promised the ' Contents ' of Elder H. L. Eads' book — ' Shaker Theology ' — but which was carelessly omitted. We hope all interested in the book will give the subjects treated a careful perusal — then send for the great book — ' Shaker Theology.'
