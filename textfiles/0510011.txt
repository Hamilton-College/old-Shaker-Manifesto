POETIC Wine is a mocker of pleasure and health, Money a mocker of treasure and wealth. Parties for gain are easy to make, But all selfish cords, they are easy to break. The vows of its colleagues it often betrays, Like unto the serpent it hath crooked ways, And however proper the aim for its use, It seems as though doomed to a constant abuse. It, like the future, will bring on a day When bartering will be the unfaltering way. Flesh-meat is a mocker of pure nature's plan, The soil of the clamorous woman and man ; The soil for disquiet, for those not above it, And every base passion, and all who do covet; A soil, void of mercy, where cruelty reigns And bindeth its subjects in pernicious chains. Without good, hand labor to baffle its might, All peace, love and quiet will flee out of sight. As demoniac food, it carries its laws, Demoniac labor, effect of its cause — Tobacco, it mocketh at virtue's promotion, It stifles the voice in heart-pure devotion. The subordinate coffee and tea, with the rest, Are mockers of need, and of comfort at best. Other ' parties' of these, below and above, Are mockers in deed of impartial love. The purchase of land for mere love of gain, Is mocking the prudent, the wise and the sane. The monopolizer enjoyeth not worth, The ' meek,' it is said ' shall inherit the earth.' Of what mood or manner of spirit we are, It is good to be mindful in hours of prayer. Our needs they are simple, are cheap and all plain, Requiring no extra of labor or pain. The lusts of the eye make us strive to acquire — The more thatwe gain the more we desire. Let us strive for that food which does satisfy, The food of the Angels that comes from on high. J.
