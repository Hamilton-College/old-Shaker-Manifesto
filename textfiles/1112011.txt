South Union, Ky. H. L. Eads South Union, Ky. November 9, 1881. \ My Dear Brother G. A. L.: I must write a line to tell you how much I am pleased with Excelsior in the present number of our little craft, just receivedâ€” words so true, so clear, so direct and withal so modest. More it seems could not be crowded in less compass. All Shaker theology in about two hundred words ! It has been thought by some that to stick to Christ is not keeping up with the progressive age in which we live. Hence they are seeking to find what they call new ruts or grooves to move in ; but why should we want any thing more than the ' highest and best ? ' Excelsior will be hard to excel by the editor or others. Very lovingly thine,
