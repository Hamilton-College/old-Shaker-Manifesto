Beloved Elder Henry:--Some remarks in our morning service... East Canterbury, N. H. May 3, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry :�Some remarks in our morning service were peculiarly impressive. We ask to insert a few from Br. William Briggs, which we are sure will be appreciated by gospel friends abroad, as much as is the good brother at home by those who know him best. 'We have just been singing the words,� 'O glorious, glorious foundation! Most safely I'm building thereon.' but I question if seven-eighths of the number who have joined in singing these words, really comprehend their true meaning. In laying the foundation of any material structure we dig deep into the earth and lay stone by stone, most carefully placing the cement between each for security and if such foundation be laid sufficiently deep, the frost cannot displace it, the rain harm nor the wind overthrow it, so securely is the work done. It certainly requires no less pains to lay the foundation of a spiritual character. I have found it necessary to dig deep into the soil of a natural heart and to remove therefrom, by an honest confession, all unprofitable elements, the evil motives and false imaginations which are so prone to rule therein. These duties having been well performed we may now lay stone by stone or principle by principle, a foundation upon which a true spiritual character can rest securely. I have learned not to place my trust in an 'arm of flesh.' My confidence is in (Jod, that through obedience to his Order and an honest confession of all sin, in humility of spirit, L shall find the needed strength to mret all trials and be able to possess as m}7 treasure, the graces and gifts of the spirit, and thus is my foundation laid in the principles of the Gospel; in other words, I am, in this way, building safely upon this glorious foundation as referred to in the piece sung. I do not count our success as Believers, by the numbers we are able to present, neither am I discouraged by human failures. Many persons come to our Community for the loaves and fishes ; but I hope it may occur in my day, that there may be men gathered to us, who will be willing to confess their sins and take up their crosses. I am thankful for the experience I have had in this way from early childhood, it is more to me than all else. It places my confidence in a Source which never fails.' We are surrounded on every side by hard and tangible realities. Every day of life brings its own task; each task is an opportunity; and when fulfilled, may be a step towards a higher life. M. P.
