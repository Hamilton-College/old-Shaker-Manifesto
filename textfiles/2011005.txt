REPLY. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Sep. 1890. Mistaken Friend :�Yours of 21st. inst. received. 'Without faith, it is impossible to please God.' Faith' in Jesus, meant, that God had delegated Jesus to act in his stead, in the work of human redemption : all power was given to him. And he said, 'As my Father hath sent me into the world, so send I you.' 'He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and him that sent me.' 'Whose-soever sins ye remit, they are remitted.' 'The Son of Man hath power on earth to remit sin.' In the Second Appearing, the same order obtains. When you say, that 'you have prayed for spiritual guidance,' you ignore the order of Christ's Second Appearing, just as any anti-christian would do: they go to God direct; and you do the same. You have no faith in the Elders as being able to furnish you with 'spiritual guidance.' 'They that are after the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh.' Those in the world, do mind the things of the world ; the natural man sees, feels, and reasons like a natural man. That is just what you are doing, and is just what you did when you were here; and it is just what you will do if you come back ; unless you receive more faith than you now show. One of our Brethren received a letter last night from the West, saying that his brother was likely to die, and wanting him to come there immediately ; the letter was written by his brother's wife. The brother answered that he should not come. That was faith. Your brother wanted nothing of you as a Shaker ; but he wants, as a natural man, of a natural man. And if your natural affection is stronger than your spiritual affection, and you love father, or mother, or brother or sister more than you love Christ in your Elders, then you have no Elders; but are joined to your idols ; and we can 'let you alone.' When Jesus said to his mother, 'Woman, what have I to do with thee?'�was it as a natural man? Your brother is a natural man ; he has brothers who are natural men; let them care for him : what have you, as a Believer, to do with any of them? You are sacrificing your spiritual relation for your natural; and your mother, as a natural woman, inspires you. And when some of your natural, fleshly relations receive faith that lifts them up, by a resurrection power, above the natural order; perhaps you will be ministered unto by them; and they will be your Elders. Another will take your crown�your bishopric. You count yourself unworthy of eternal life, because of the faith and the cross and the sacrifice and the suffering that it necessarily involves. When Agag came in before Samuel, walking delicately like a king, Samuel ordered him to be hewn in pieces. Agag typified the natural man ; Samuel the spiritual man. ''Can you drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?' Your spiritual friend and brother, Frederick W. Evans.
