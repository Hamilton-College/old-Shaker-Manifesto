'A thousand years hence, or less, the people of earth will look upon our shafts of granite, and terrible arsenals, the torn and battered flags and war equipments, battle ships and war histories and tales of Libbey and Andersonville, our traffic in slaves, and Sunday School church brigades, with feelings akin to our own, as we look backward upon the relics of the dark and middle ages.'
