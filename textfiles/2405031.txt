Beloved Elder Henry;--It is with the greatest satisfaction... Shaker Station, Conn. 1894. Beloved Elder Henry;ï¿½It is with the greatest satisfaction that I can recommend The Manifesto to honest inquirers after truth. Recognizing it as a soul educator, I am thankful that The Manifesto is pure, and that those who have charge of it are persistent to maintain its purity. Its steadfast purpose is the same. There is the constant condemnation of sin, and the same encouragement is given to all who desire to live a virtuous life. The salvation it preaches is 'the one tiling needful' the same yesterday, to-day and forever. When 1 think of the great good our periodical has done and will continue to do to lost humanity, my feelings overcome me and I say, God bless The Manifesto. I can not find words to express the gratitude welling up in my heart, so I send you the overflow. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
