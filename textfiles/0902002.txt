We have received a small paper called The Herald or the Messenger of the New Covenant, edited by our friend, and opponent, Cyrus Romulus R. Teed. It appears to be designed to prepare the public mind for a grand step forward of the human race in recognition of the principles of community life and celibacy. Would it not be well for Mr. Teed to join the Shakers? They believe in community of interest, a life of celibacy, and in prophecy. Why should he not become one of them ?
