THE ANGEL CHOIR. Annie R. Stephens. The light of day had vanished, The cares and toils were done; The twilight gray departed And sable curtains hung. A silence brooded over; The night was hushed and still, Save the moaning of the wind-harp Along the pine-clad hill. I sought my couch at even To find from toil release, But ere my weary eyelids Were wrapped in slumber's p,eace,My thoughts flew back and forward Like a shuttle in a loom, The fabric of my vision, Was tinged with shade and gloom. I thought of life's strange meaning, Its suffering, trial, pain; How many hearts to woe were tuned, Instead of hope's refrain. When lo! I heard above me As if in upper air, Sweet angel voices swelling, Divinest music there. With ecstasy I listened, What heavenly harmony, A grand antliemnial chorus, And then sweet melody. I thoughtit is the ransomed Who in God's mansions shine, The psalms of triumph singing, The Lamb's grand song divine. It floated nearer, nearer, Until my inner sight Perceived that choir immortal, Arrayed in vestments white. I reached my hands in trusting To touch their snowy hem, That I might be made holy By coming near to them. When lo! they spread their pinions And vanished from my sight; And then I pondered deeply The vision of the night. Not lofty ones descending From out the great unknown, Who sing and play on golden harps Around the Jasper Throne; But hlessed angel guardians/ Who know our common needs, Whose gentle, God-like presence From sin's dark path-way leads. 0 heaven-sent evangels! Descend the bright stair-way; Come often, cheer and guide us, Direct us day by day. Oh, that sweet song of gladness! Of hope, and joy and love, Hath tuned my heart to noble themes, To live as they above. 1 sing a sweeter cadence, Life seems more bright and fair, Since I heard that angel chorus, The music in the air.
