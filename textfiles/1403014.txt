CHARITY ELMIRA HILLSGROVE '' Love thy neighbor as thyself. ' What a wealth of happiness the fruit of this precept would bring ! Let us reduce it to the simple life of one in the household who is brought into daily association with some half dozen others of different ages and temperaments,�leaving out for a time the intermediate intercourse with nearly an hundred other associates, of ages ranging from seventy years, down even to the little children, all claiming a Christian relationship. With these we profess to have given our life-interests. Our covenant demands full consecration of time, talent, strength, aims, loves and hopes to the building up of the Christ-kingdom on earth, a church free from all self-emulation. Now, to love every one as we love otirself, we apply the cross of Christ to our inherent likes and dislikes ; instead of rejecting those personally unpleasant, and differing from our idea of loveliness, we take them into our heart's sympathy, and work, eat, talk, sing, pray, and share with them whatever good we have, all the while becoming less and less conscious of selfexistence. We have ever with us our pattern, or lesson, the command to ' Love thy neighbor as thyself, ' which conveys the idea, that, if true to our standard, we shall sacrifice for others as we would to attain the best for self. We need only ask the question, How should we feel under similar conditions,�to see this poLt of duty ? We all wish to be forgiven of our errors, though we may tempt the spirit of charity, even beyond ' seventy times seven ; ' yet we ask the favor, and urge that this charity should be unfailing with the saints. If this be right, then why not become saints ourselves ? There is no surer way to develop this character than to exercise the grace which we so frequently request. When we think others not quite so good as we would like to have them, if they exhibit' some offensive quality of character from which we imagine ourselves quite far removed, let us call to memory the truth that ' all sin is related, ' and so long as we are not without sin, we are neighbors. Let us '' Love our neighbor as ourself, ' and '' Confess our faults one to another.' The latter injunction frequently practiced will create love and chaiity, and has, in our experience, been a good agent to cast out the spirit of self-righteousness, and enabled us better to love our neighbor as ourself.
