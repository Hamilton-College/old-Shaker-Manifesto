THE SPIRITUAL AMAZON. Giles B. Avery. As our ship's crew were tossed on the billows of life's restless ocean, suffering tho disappointments of conflicting winds and tides, retarded in progress to our destined haven until our stores for life's sustenance and comfort were reduced to a minimum capacity, and our thirst becoming unendurable, while the waters of the dreary ocean waste on which our bark was drifting were brackish and bitter, seeing, in the distance a hopeful craft, we hoisted signals of distress ; she hailed us and inquired the cause of our troubles. We replied, perishing for want of water. A voice replied, 'Let down the buckets. You are in the mouth of the Amazon River, the largest stream of fresh water known to the inhabitants of earth; let down the buckets and help yourselves to refreshments.' But, though up borne by its waves and resting on its bosom, our ship's crew still inquire 'In what latitude, in what longitude, in which hemisphere is this spiritual queen of rivers to be found ? Through what kingdoms does it flow? Where its source? And where, O where, into what ocean does it pour its living, refreshing tide? Seeking its sources we have traversed earth's domains and found them not They are not harbored there, yet earth's inhabitants intuitively and educationally believe in their existence.' This notable spiritual river is the philosopher's theme ; the author's throne ; the prophet's haven; the poet's song, and the Christian's amulet. It is the river upon whose waters floats the heavenly argosy; yet, its stream, though broad and long, with current irresistible, is not found on earth! Then, O ye bright angels,�missionaries from wisdom's throne,�ye who know the geography of the heavens, Where is this holy river to be found ? Better than all the waters of ' Abana and Pharpar' deeper, clearer and sweeter than the Jordan its waters flow forth to teem with life and sweet perfume the flowers of Paradise, and watering the land oi Promise it develops and matures, under the sunlight of truth, the fruits in the garden of God. A seraph from the haven of bliss now offered to be our pilot. She said, 'This river is the waters of soul life,� the love, power and salvation of God�a baptism that fills the heavens with sympathetic harmony and unselfish interest, and makes the society of the souls of the righteous aglow with love to all mankind so true as to seek to lift them to mansions of rapturous joy. It is a power which reproves the world of sin, and slakes the thirst of the sinner for its bitter waters, while it woos and entrances the soul who will drink of its refreshing stream, and strengthen it to direct its course home to God. The flow of this beautiful river is on the broad plains of the spiritual continent of God's mercy and goodness ; its sources are the bowers of the graces that shine forth in the life deeds, the righteousness of the saints, and the ministering angels of heaven who do the will of God.' Then we inquired of our heavenly pilot, How may mankind find access to this spiritual Amazon, to drink of its soul inspiring waters, and receive spiritual refreshment and vigor from its sparkling, sacred well-springs, bathe in its limpid flowing stream or sail upon its sweetly rolling waves into the haven of sweet peace and celestial joy ? She replied, 'The pathway to its fountain is not a thorny maze of disbelief in the eternal existence of souls ; not through marshes of doubts of the existence of God, nor through tangled vines of queries whether vice shall meet a punishment of sufferings of spirit, or virtue be crowned with soul joy and bliss ; not whether there are shoals of disappointments to our journey's ends ; nor yet through a wilderness of gloom�the erroneous notion that the chaHgei-called death of the physical body is an eternal sleep, during which there is no conscious existence, and eternity is a meaningless blank, a boundless void; not through a wildwood chaparral of hopes of happiness never to be realized even by the good, the true, nor fears of sorrows, the fruits of sin and folly never to have an end, nor through a thicket of hatred, malice and revenge. Ah nay, the pathway leading to this glorious heavenly Amazon is a highway east up by souls, who, turning from sin to righteousness, clear all obstacles to progress from the track and smooth the road by cultivating peace and union. All gates barring the way are lifted or turned from the track by forsaking the sinful pleasures of sense, and weaning the soul from earthly vanities and follies ; giving the senses and aspirations of life to seek spiritual, instead of carnal enjoyments. The scientist pursues his tireless task of observations, experiments and researches into the nature of causes and the history of their effects, for nameless years unabated, undaunted, not discouraged, and is oft rewarded with untold gains of wealth and earthly substance. The philosopher collects and arranges facts, traces the historic record of failure of that system, and success of this, thus learns wisdom and develops vision to see the truth, and strength to heed its instructions. The chemist experiments with untiring investigation to learn the properties of matter, and the relations and correlations of particles and ele-i ments. The mechanic plies his skill with limitless energy, stretches his mind to comprehend the laws of motion and inertia in order to construct some improved plan or machine for aiding human weal. The farmer regards the seasons, and toils on, though sometimes suffering fruitless endeavor and bitter disappointment; and thus life's career advances, and evolves progress, increasing earthly happiness, treasure, and pleasure. In like manner, and with similar persistency let the soul ply its powers of inquiry after the spiritual light, truth, wisdom, power and sxibstance of spiritual life ; let it increasingly travel in a straightforward path of obedience to truth revealed and comprehended, let h tire not in its application of known law s of progress in seeking the Sowings of the river of life, the spiritual Amazon that waters the Paradise of the heavens, and its labors will not be fruitless. With a wand of determined and undaunted resolution let it smite Meribah's rock of promise and a fountain of living waters will gush forth�the sources of the Amazon of heaven,�a river sufficiently deep and broad to float all the Argosies belonging to the merchantmen of Paradise, and so clear, sweet and refreshing that souls may let down into it their buckets and draw therefrom living water sufficient to quench the thirst of all the creation of God.
