PAUL OR CHRIST LILLIE E. BARR 'I suffer not that any woman teach, Or bear the message of the Lord's good will. Let her keep silence ; she hath no call to preach 'Tis hers to learn and modestly sit still.' Thus the Apostle ; Yet the risen Lord, Waiting beside the newly-broken tomb For messenger to send with his first word Unto the church within that upper room, Chose but a woman with a loving heart. (Oh! fair her feet with these glad tidings 'I am arisen, and I now depart [shod :) And go unto our Father and our God.' Did Christ make some mistake, the first by her The truth and light of llesurrection shone? He Mary chose to be his messenger. Would Paul have sent St. Peter or St. John? The Independent.
