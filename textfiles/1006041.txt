The Very Valuable Series Of reprints being issued by I. K. Funk &amp; Co.» 10 and 12 Dey street, New York, we have heretofore alluded to most heartily. We wish all our readers would send and get catalogues, and satisfy themselves of the valuable work being performed by these enterprising publishers; and appreciating the value of their philanthropy, aid the good work by numerous subscriptions to the many good volumes they are issuing. Send ¦30 cents and get a sample volume, one of Knight's History of England, and then join us in complimenting the nobleness of displacing yellow-covered literature by that of value, and just as cheap.
