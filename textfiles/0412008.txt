Shaker, Village, Shirley, Mass., ) October 23, 1874 Beloved Elder Frederick and Brother Daniel : The foregoing is the fruit of some research, and though condensed to a few pages, they but meagrely represent the labor bestowed on the subject. I have thrown the matter into its present form trusting, thereby, that its efficiency may be increased. Herewith accept my love. I bless all the Elders in your lot, for their many labors of love, and pray that you all may be supported to bear against the pressure, within and with- out, brought to bear upon your spirits, I sym- pathize with you. Do us the favor to accept the love of this humble family. We are happy in the assurance that when you are praying for the Household of Faith, we are included. Our love to all the burden bearers and to all the beloved brethren and sisters, and in a special manner to Brother J. Shaw and to the aged sisters. Daniel F.
