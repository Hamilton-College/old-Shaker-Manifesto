SEEDS 0F GOOD AND ILL We are sowing, daily sowing, Countless seeds of good and ill, Scattered on the level low land, Cast upon the windy hill, Seeds that sink in rich, brown furrows, Soft with heaven's gracious rain. Seeds that rest upon the surface Of the dry, unyielding plain. Seeds that fall amid the stillness Of the lonely mountain glen, Seeds cast out in crowded places, Trodden under foot of men. Seeds by idle hearts forgotten, Flung at random in the air, Seeds by faithful souls remembered, Sown in tears and love and prayer. Seeds that lie unchanged, unquickened, Lifeless on the teeming mould Seeds that live and grow and flourish When the sower's hand is cold, By a whisper sow we blessing, By a breath we scatter strife, In our words and looks and actions Like the seeds of death and life. Thou who knowest all our weakness, Leave us not to sow alone, But Thine angels guard the furrows Where the precious grain is sown, Till the fields are crowned with glory, Filled with mellow ripened ears, Filled with fruit of life eternal From the seed we sow in tears. Check the forward thoughts and passion, Stay the hasty heedless hands, Lest the germ of sin and sorrow, Mar our fair and pleasant lands. Father, help each weak endeavor, Make each feeble effort blest, Till Thine harvest shall be garnered, And we enter into rest. The Catholic.
