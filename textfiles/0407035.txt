Charles Nordhoff has been engaged in collecting the materials for a detailed account of the Communistic Societies now existing in the United States. He has been visiting and personally examining all of these societies â€”no slight undertaking, as they are scattered from Maine to Oregon. He proposes to give an account of the religious creeds and practices, the peculiar social customs and regulations, the history and present numbers, condition and industries of each society. The subject is novel and attractive, and the facts collected by him will be so presented as to be not only of interest to the reader for amusement, but of value to the student of social science, for their practical bearing and illustration of the possibilities and difficulties of a community of goods, a subject which is now widely agitated among workingmen here and in Europe. Such a work will be a valuable contribution to the discussion.
