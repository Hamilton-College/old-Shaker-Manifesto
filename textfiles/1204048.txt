True Every Time If an editor omits anything he is lazy. If he speaks of things as they are people get angry. If he glosses over or smooths down the rough points, he is bribed. If he calls things by their proper names he is unfit for the position of an editor. If he does not furnish his readers with jokes he is an idiot. If he does he is a rattle-head, lacking stability. If he condemns the wrong he is a good fellow, but lacks discretion. If he lets wrong and injuries go unmentioned, he is a coward. If he exposes a public man he does it to gratify spite, is the tool of a clique, or belongs to the 'outs.' If he indulges in personalities he is a blackguard. If he does not his paper is dull and insipid. Boston Post
