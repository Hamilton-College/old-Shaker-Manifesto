The Children's Grotto DO THY LITTLE Do thy little — God has made Million leaves for forest shade — Smallest stars that glory bring. God employeth every thing. Then the little thou hast done — Little battles thou hast won, Little masteries achieved, Little wants with care relieved, Little words in love expressed, Little wrongs at once confessed, Little favors kindly done, Little toils thou didst not shun, Little graces meekly worn, Little slights with patience borne — Those shall crown thy pillowed head, Holy light upon thee shed. Those are treasures that shall rise Far beyond the smiling skies. LITTLE THINGS ' Though little I bring,' Said the tiny spring, As it burst from the mighty hill, ' 'Tis pleasant to know, Wherever I flow, The pastures grow greener still.' And the drops of rain, As they fall on the plain, When parched by the summer heat, Refresh the sweet flowers Which drooped in the bowers, And hung their heads at our feet. Though the drops are small, Yet, taking them all, Each one doing all that it can To fulfill the design Of its Maker divine, What lessons they give unto man ! May we strive to fulfill All His righteous will, Who formed the whole earth by His word ? Creator divine, We should f.ver be thine, And serve Thee, our God and our Lord.
