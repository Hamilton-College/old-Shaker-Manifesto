We are in receipt of several letters from individuals who ask, among other questions, concerning our position on the wearing or non-wearing of the beard. We answer, that for uniformity, we shave smoothly twice or thrice a week. This is our present custom. We attach no religious importance to it, other than union of action. That we are physiologically wrong, many of us have no doubt; and that we shall eventually change present habit, we doubt still less ; but until there can be a unanimous voice in the change, we shall abide present usage. It is a nonessential to the salvation of the soul from present sins, only as it affects the body seriously by shaving; and when individuals remove greater difficulties in their path to righteousness, the shaving or not shaving the beard will assume less proportions. Let us be alive to whatever is progress in the right direction only.
