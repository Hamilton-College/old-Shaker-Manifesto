ANCIENT PILGRIMS By Julia Johnson Lord, make our spirits whiter— White as the driven snow ; Like to the ancient pilgrims, Who suffer'd here below. Give us a heart that's humble, Touch'd with the martyr's zeal; Clothe us with truth and wisdom, And make pure love our seal. Fill us with thoughts of heaven, Of worthiness, and prayer; And with thine arm, O save us From ev'ry earthly snare. Lead us unto the fountain Whence flows the living streamSweet waters of repentance, Which will the soul redeem. Where bloom the fairest flowers That flourish here below ; Where walk the brightest beings That earth can ever know. O lead us, Holy Spirit, Down in the lowly vale, Where fear and mortal bondage The soul cannot assail; Where tears of sinful sorrow Flood not the pure in heart; Nor sense of earthly yearning, Life's piercing pangs impart. Lord, make our spirits whiter— White as the driven snow; Like to the holy ancients Who conquer'd death below. Hancock, Mass.
