Haste and Health It is not at all wholesome to be in a hurry. Locomotives are reported to have moved a mile a minute for short distances. But locomotives have often come to grief for such great rapidity. Multitudes in their haste to get rich are ruined every year. The men who go maturely, slowly, deliberately, are the men who oftenest succeed in life; people who are habitually in a hurry generally have to do things twice over. The tortoise beats the hare at last. Slow men seldom knock their brains out against a post. Foot-races are injurious to health, as all forms of competitive exercise ; steady labor in the field is the best gymnasium in the world. Either labor or exercise carried to exhaustion or prostration, or even great tiredness, expressed by ' fagged out,' always does more harm than the previous exercise has done good. All running up-stairs or to catch a vehicle or ferry-boat, is extremely injurious to every age, sex, and condition in life. It ought to be the most pressing necessity which should induce a person over fifty to run over twelve or fifteen yards. Those live longest who are deliberate, whose actions are measured, who never embark in an enterprise without sleeping over it, and who perform all the everyday acts with kindness. Quakers are proverbially calm, quiet people; and they are a thrifty folk the world over. This is a common sense advice, and if followed will always prove beneficial to men, and women, too.
