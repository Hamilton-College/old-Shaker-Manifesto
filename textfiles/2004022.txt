Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. Mar. 3. 1890. Another link in the chain of time has been looped and welded. It is short but mighty. Its experience we never want repeated, although we have learned some very valuable lessons. Sometimes we think we have learned, but amid time's changing scenes we often find we do not remember till afterwards. There seems to be in all of us an innate desire to pry into the future; but wisdom keeps it concealed. 'Who can lift the veil that screens the future from our view, Who can pierce the misty shadows that obscure the good and true; Hath not the Father wisely kept the fount of knowledge sealed, And only for our present need Ms boundless love revealed? Yet we wander not in darkness, nor wear the shrond of gloom. God's light our way illumines, and flowers immortal bloom: Faith triumphs in earth's conflict, is strong amid the strife That fits the soul for pure abodes, in blessed realms of life.' It seems to me that we can, if we will, reason from cause to effect and look a long way ahead, but the exact manifestation of the effects, few can foresee. Our new boiler and steam works are in full operation and I think will prove very satisfactory. It reflects great credit on the firm of Robbins, Gamwell &amp; Co., of Pittsfield, Mass., and the men who did the work were the most respectful and quiet of any men ever employed on our premises. This was fully appreciated by the Sisters who were passing through an ordeal of affliction that cannot be written. We have made out to get our wood home and are nearly ready to work it up. Are laying a new floor in our wood-house, over the old one and putting tarred felt between; this we do to keep out the frost and prevent the mice from getting into the cellar below, which we are going to make into an apple cellar. The weather has been very favorable for our operations most of the time, but we have no ice in yet, which causes some anxiety. We use one hundred tons or more, and how to keep from spoiling without ice, we shall have'to learn in the future. Our beloved Mother, Eldress Ann E. Taylor, we are happy to learn is very much improved. She contracted a severe cold in passing from Lebanon to Watervliet Let all our aged friends learn by her experience, when passing from the warm cars to ride in the open air to put on extra wraps : and we that are young, whose duty it is to convey our gospel friends from place to place, should not forget the extra wraps, and when possible provide a covered carriage with noble, trusty steeds attached. When long journeys are to be taken, a warm soapstone put in will be very acceptable. These should be heated or warmed in the oven, and not on a'hot stove. By so doing they will not get hot enough to burn. Mar. 9. On account of the peculiarity of the season, we have been having quite a new experience. Up to the first week in March, and no ice. We began to feel somewhat alarmed; for ice is not now a mere luxury, but a necessity. Well, on the 5th. and 6th. we had a splendid snow; the first to make sleighing this year, and on the 7th. the mercury fell to 11 degrees below zero and on the 8th. to 4 below. Such a fever at that temperature was never known before. Every man and every team was called out to the ice harvest: but to harvest ice enough in two days to supply our large Society could not be done. So it was suggested that we use the Sabbath and gather the harvest, and we did use it in good earnest. (I write now, only of the North Family.) We secured forty-five loads from our reservoir and packed it away. It was real music to witness the quiet zeal and harmony that pervaded the whole company. The only discordant note, was when one of the little boys slipped into the water. Now the question is, was there anything in this proceeding contrary to our religious faith? Speaking for myself, and of the faith planted in my soul, there was nothing out of harmony In the first place Sabbath, (Sunday, the first day of the week,) is only a man-made institution. Second, the ''Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.' Third, the Sabbath of the God of Israel, of the scriptures, was established to curb the selfishness and over-reaching element in unprogressed humanity, and pointed toward a perpetual Sabbath. Fourth, we have entered that Sabbath, by taking up our crosses against selfishness, and consecrating all our time and talents to the benefit of the household of faith. Thus, our labor is worship; and such labor is far more acceptable worship than going to church to display our outward adornings and cultivate our pride. There is a mighty effort being made to establish a national Sunday law, which u only the thin edge of the wedge to open the door for God to enter the constitution of the United States. Already in many of the states Sunday laws are enacted, and are in active operation. These are the beginnings of the preparation for a mighty religious war; that will as surely come as did the war between slavery and freedom, unless the powers of good, working through the more progressed part of the people, shall keep the ascendency. The Sabbath day is a blessed institution and has done a great deal of good; but when a sectarian fence is erected around it, and a few would-be monopolists undertake to drive everybody into their sectarian pen, the blessing the Sabbath was intended to bring to the people is lost, and turned into a curse. Let us make every day a Sabbath, by resting from our own selfish ways and wills ; have all our time religiously devoted, and on Sunday let our devotion be more interior. Use the time to cultivate our spiritual natures, but not laziness; then can we sing in truth, 'Blessed day of rest, the holy Sabbath.' ( I want to thank you for that page of P. O. addresses in the March Manifesto. It was very much needed. From our home kindest love to all, Daniel Offord. Center Family. Mar. 10. 1890. Since the exit of La Grippe the health of our family has been on the upward scale although we were not much troubled here by his unwelcome visit. We are doing our best to secure enough ice to carry us through the summer. The blocks are about nine inches in thickness, nice and clear. Brethren expect to finish to-morrow�the weather is growing warm and uncertain for such business. Yesterday was one of the most beautiful winter days I ever saw, not a cloud was to l�e seen in the sky and the temperature was mild and balmy. Recently we have had quite a rush in putting up medicine for a New York firm. Yours. Timothy Rayson. Soixtli 3Ta.mily. We are interested in the Bible questions and so send a tVw answers VVe made preparations for getting our ice, but the rains came and the ice melted away. Our potatoes have kept very well.
