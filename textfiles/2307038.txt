World's Columbian Exposition Illustrated EXPOSITION IS OPEN. The Opening of the World's Columbian Exposition was the crowning event in the history of the past month. The 'World's Columbian Exposition Illustrated,' authentic organ of the Exposition was established Feb. 1891. Its object is to make an Official History of the Fair. The June number gives full details of the opening, accompanied by appropriate illustrations. This number is of more than usual interest and rich with choice illustrations, among which are the Duke of Veragua, as frontispiece, the Duchess of Veragua, Marquis of Barboles, Marquis of Villalobar and other members of our honored guests. Other illustrations are 'Liberty Bell,' Mural paintings, 'Education,' 'Music,' 'Statue of Archbishop Feehan,' 'The Chase,' Spanish Pavilions in the Woman's and Horticulturai buildings,' 'Designs for Columbian Stamps,' 'Last Nail in Woman's building,' 'Montana's State building,' and three full page illustrations; 'Opening Ceremonies,' 'Main Entrance to Fisheries building,' and 'View on Lagoon.' Among the more prominent articles are 'The Ethics of the Exposition,' 'The Exposition as an Educator,' 'Opening of the Exposition,' 'Our Spanish Guests,' 'Opening Ceremonies.' In the Woman's department are the 'Dedication of Woman's Building,' 'Kentucky's Rooms,' 'The Last Nail,' 'Spanish Woman's Exhibit,' and other articles. Altogether the Journal is an Exposition in itself. It is indispensable to those visiting the Fairï¿½while those deprived of this privilege by perusing its pages, can visit the Exposition at home. After the Fair, it will be 'Campbell's Columbian Journal.' The publisher wants good agents to represent this valuable work. Single copies 25 cts. Send stamps. Address, J. B. Campbell, 159 &amp; 161 Adams St., Chicago, 111.
