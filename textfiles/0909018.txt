TO-DAY We are living, we are dwelling In a grand and awful time, In an age on ages telling To be living is sublime. Hark ! the waking up of nations, Gog and Magog to the fray. Hark ! what soundeth ? Is creation Groaning for her latter day ? Will ye play, then, will ye dally, With your music and your wine ? Up ! it is Jehovah's rally, God's own arm hath need of thine. Hark ! the onset! will ye fold your Faith-clad arms in lazy lock ? Up, O, up ! thou drowsy soldier, Worlds are charging to the shock. Worlds are charging — heaven beholding, Thou hast but an hour to fight; Now the blazoned cross unfolding, On, right onward, to the right; On ! let all the soul within you For the truth's sake go abroad! Strike ! let every nerve and sinew Tell on ages — tell for God!
