FRIENDLY We have to acknowledge a very handsome notice of the ' Shaker and Shakeress,' by the Religio-Philosophical Journal; which paper I am happy to recommend as belonging, since the division upon the sexual question, to the clean class of Spiritualistic Journals. It is free from Free-Loveism, and can be had for three months for 25 cents, or $2 per annum. Editor, S. S. Jones, corner of Fifth Avenue and Adams street, Chicago, 111. Also, Friend Williams, of the ' Hudson Gazette,' has the following: Tfie Shaher and Shakeress. We have before spoken in complimentary terms of this neat and very readable publication issued by the Shakers at Mt. Lebanon, but the following from the Boston Index expresses as much as it would be possible to crowd into so brief a paragraph : '' The Shaker and Shakeress, published by the United Society of Shakers, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., is a neat, sweet, fresh, and liberal publication.'
