Dear Elder Frederick—I wish to thank you for your excellent letter in to-day's Tribune... Ludlow St. Jail, N. Y., July 2, 1879 D. M. Bennett Dear Elder Frederick—I wish to thank you for your excellent letter in to-day's Tribune. It is most excellent, indeed. I have seen nothing better. It is exactly to the point. Every sentence is replete with wisdom. I am very glad you wrote it, for they will let you into The Tribune when they will not let my friends here in the city have a chance to say a word. I have written to them since I have been here, and my personal friends have called there and tried hard to get a little space to correct their own misrepresentations; but they would not open their columns on any conditions. The Christian bigots had doubtless bulldozed them. The press of this city have acted very cowardly and mean since my sentence. They seem to be afraid to say their souls are their own. The Christian tyrants seem to own them. I feel sure your letter will do much good. I would be so glad if you would write a similar one to the Sun. I think Dana would print one from you. I shall copy your letter in my next paper, and also incorporate it in the book, I am making up of my 'Behind the Bars.' I have enough now for 150 pages already stereotyped, and will have 800 or 400 in all. I have great hopes that Hayes will pardon or release me in a week or so. Nearly 50,000 names have been sent on, and thousands come in daily. Gratefully yours,
