Anna Post, at Church Family, Enfield, N. H., May 22, 1888. Age 78 yrs. 7 months and 22 days. So may we rise from every clog of earth,. And soar away in spirit, bright and free To glories that adorn immortal birth, Where, with our loving sister, we may be Again united by those golden ties Of never ending love, divinely pure, Such as the blest of God do realize, And hold, in endless happiness, secure. J. G. R. The death of Eldress Sophia Niles at the South family of Harvard on the 2 3th oT April 1886, is a great and irreparable loss to the Society. She united with the Society in 1870, and has proved a steadfast and devoted member. Ever true to her highest convictions of right she secH-red the confidence, love, and esteem of all. She is among the few who gave up all. True*fthe shadows of life were lengthening towards the east. Still at the age of sixty one there is a margin for useful experience which it is to be regretted is left unfilled. E. Myrick.
