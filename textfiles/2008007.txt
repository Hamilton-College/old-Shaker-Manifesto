Henry C. Blinn, Dear Brother: Your welcome and kind letter came... Evansville, Ind.. June 9, 1890. Henry C. Blinn, Dear Brother :� Your welcome and kind letter came to hand in due time, for which please accept many thanks. I only wish I was able to furnish every ''Public Reading Room' in the land with the Manifesto so that those who would read may learn more of the true faith for which all Christian men and women should earnestly contend, as was once delivered unto the saints To do this is to manifest a love for all that is go^d, as all good comes from the same and only fountain head, from which comes all our blessings. God is Love and his children who dwell in his kingdom should be of love and light to those in darkness. We cm never gain those who do not see as we do by heaping abuse upon them Because they cannot or do not see as we do. It is evi dent to me that the first true followers that Mother Ann and the Elders gathered with her into this blessed gospel, were such Christian men and women as there are still tens of thousands in the laud seeking for the same blessed gospel. But if we abuse such light as they may have and yet are not giving them any that is better, we will not be able to gain them to the true light, as human nature to-day is as it was then. We must teach them in love that the 'meek only shall inherit the earth,' and 'those who do hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled,' and that 'the merciful shall obtain mercy,' and that 'the pure in heart only shall see God.' We may learn a lesson from what John said to the Master,�'We saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbade him, because he followed not with us.' To which Jesus said ; 'For- bid him not for he that is not against us is for us.' Again we learn that on another occasion Jesus said, 'other sheep I have which are not of this fold ; them also I must bring aud they shall hear my voice, and they shall be one fold and one shepherd.' The sheep of that other fold are in the churches and are the oues to reach after. They should be taught the new and living way, and we should give unto them the Mother,� Christ's gospel in love and meekness. We should not make light of nor abuse what they may have. We must ktiow there is much corruption and depravity of morals in and out of the churches of the land. So there is some good and many noble principles of charity. Let us see more of the good and thank God for it and labor to help them to promote the same. And as good ;-&gt;amaritans having compassion on fallen humanity, stoop down to lift up the blind and weary and weak, sin-sick soul. Let us have compassion on our fellow laborers in other portions of the Master's vineyard. They are of that other fcld. Aud Jesus said;�'I am the good Shepherd and I know my sheep and they follow me. And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.' Respectfully, Dr. Carl Semelroth.
