Dear Editor:--I have thought many times I would contribute... White Water Village, O. Dear Editor :�I have thought many times I would contribute a few lines for the Manifesto, but have hesitated for fear there would not be room. But in looking over the Sept. number [ find therein a great deal of useful knowledge and instruction for which I wish to thank the dear Brethren and Sisters, who are so willing to give us those instructions which I know will be a benefit to each and every one of us who are willing to accept them. It is by accepting these good instructions and trying to live up to them to the best of our ability that we shall inherit that beautiful home which our heavenly Father has prepared for all his children. In looking over the items from the different Societies I find in the one from Harvard where our brother Andrew speaks of the Providence of God in sparing them from any calamity of any kind. We have great reason to be thankful to kind Providence in sparing us these many years from any disaster of any kind. I want to say to my dear Brethren and Sisters that I am thankful that I am classed among those who are trying to live consecrated lives and trying to do the will of their Heavenly Father ; and my prayer is that God will bless every soul that will put an effort forward to do his will and try to maintain the cause which our blessed Mother established on earth. I often repeat the beautiful words which sister Mary Hazard sung here while on a visit: Oh my Brethren, O my Sisters, Don't grow weary though the time seems long,� Pledge yourselves and stand together, And keep the bonds of union strong.
