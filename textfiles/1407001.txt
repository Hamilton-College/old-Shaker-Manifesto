VOYAGE TO CANAAN. A people called Christians, How many things they tell About a land of Canaan, Where saints and angels dwell: But sin, that dreadful Ocean Encloses them around, With its tides, still divides Them from Canaan's happy ground. Thousands have been impatient To find a passage through, And with united wisdom, Have try'd what they could do ; But vessels built by human skill, Have never sailed far, Till we found them aground, On some dreadful sandy bar. The everlasting gospel Has launch'd the deep at last; Behold her sails extended Around the tow'ring mast! Along the deck in order, The joyful sailors stand, Crying, 0 ! Here we go, To Emmanuel's happy land! To those who stand spectators, What anguish must ensue, To have their old companions Bid them a last adieu ! The pleasures of your paradise No longer can invite ; Here we sail, you may rail, But we'll soon be out of sight. We're now on the wide ocean, We've bid the world farewell, And where we shall cast anchor, No human tongue can tell: About our future destiny, There need be no debate, While we ride on the tide, With our captain and his mate. The passengers united In order peace and love ; The wind all in our favor, How sweetly we do move ! Let tempests now assail us, And raging billows roar, We will sweep through the deep, Till we reach the blessed shore.
