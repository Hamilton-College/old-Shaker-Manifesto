ASPIRATION. By Calvin G. Beed. 'How lovely are thy dwellings fair O Lord of Hosts! How dear The pleasant tabernacles are When thou dost dwell so near!' Milton. Ye messengers celestial, dwelling in omniscient light Of God's effulgent glory, peerless, incandescent, bright; While on your heavenly mission of a pure, unfathomed love, To point the denizens of earth to noonday spheres above� O shed upon our vision, beauties of the world unseen, Where living powers, real, beautiful, august, serene, Pervade the amplitude of the etherean boundless space, With glorious, rich, profusion of true happiness and grace. For these, my soul lured upward, welling, gushing with desire, Would revel in the grand, substantial fullness, of these higher, Purer, sublimated, hallowed, love directed spheres of bliss, THE MANIFESTO. 109 Eliminated from the errors and weaknesses of this ; Its crudeness, darkness, dangers, misconceptions of the truth, And cumulative foibles of the era of man's youth; With every machination which would twine around the soul, To dim its keen perception, aud its higher powers control. And turn its aspirations from heavenly truths sublime, To seek its inspiration in venal sense and time. Ye gracious powers eternal, of the glorious life divine, 0 let your light supernal upon our pathway shine. And may your godlike spirits, heavenward ever nobly bear, Each honest toiling pilgrim to your heavenly realm so fair. Dip your empyrean pen in your elysian cloudless light, And on the tablets of our deathless understandings write� Or photograph with brilliant tints of your empyrean sky, And all the blended glories of your matchless realm on high. Upon the spotless canvas�the pure, eternal, sacred roll, The clear, unblemished picture of the bright, perfected soul Just heir of fadeless glory within God's central zone, Where naught but white robed spirits can circle round the throne. 1 long to feel the pulsing of this ceaseless flow of love, Course onward in my veinlets, perpetually to move; Uniting me more surely with the life that's good and pure, With the rich celestial graces which true happiness ensure. I seek a pure relation with the noble and the true Freed from the wild commotion that so often meets the view, Disturbing and corroding the peace and sweet communion Which should be so abiding, a nucleus of our union. I seek elimination from opinionated clamor And all the wrathful frenzy of wild theologic glamour. I seek a pure religion worthy of the realms above, Where brethren dwell together in true harmony and love. Where each with each is striving for the truth, eternal, pure; In kindliness of feeling and love that will endure. I long to see the era by the prophets ken foretold, When man shall work by reason; Not by tyrant fear controlled. When swords and spears are beaten into implements of peace; And war and tumult banished by the perfect reign of peace; When man hails not his brother saying, 'Come, be taught of me!' For then shall the Instructor be the God of Liberty. Mt, Lebanon, N. Y.
