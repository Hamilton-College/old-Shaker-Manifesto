THE BEST YOU CAN. What use to frown when things go wrong? A frown won't set them right, Be brave of heart, and sing a song, To make the burden light! That this is true I quite believe; He is the wisest man Who sings when care and trouble come, And does the best he can. The man who broods o'er trouble finds His burdens heavier grow, As he climbs up the hill of life; The wise man does not so. He gathers flowers beside the way; He says to fellow-men 'Let's make the most of pleasant things, Anddo the best we can.' In thinking of another's need We oft forget our own; So let vis think of others more Not of ourselves alone. Keep up a brave and cheerful heart, 'Tis aye the wisest plan, To sing when care and trouble come, Anddo the best we can. .
