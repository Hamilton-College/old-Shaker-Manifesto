ROCK OF AGES. By William Offord. ONE of the prophets, speaking in the Spirit, said, 'Our God is a Rock.' Now a rock between two persons will certainly prevent them seeing each other. Our Rock is spiritual. Jesus said, 'God is spirit'�the most substantial of all substances. Therefore it is impossible fora natural person to see any one that is shielded by this rock, that is, any one who is living a spiritual life in the inmost of his soul. Christ is a Rock, and Jesus said, 'Upon this rock will I build my Church.' Man has two natures�natural and spiritual. The natural or generative is first, and it develops first. As the person grows to a condition in which natural things will not satisfy the mind, he feels dissatisfied with all around him, relatives, friends, neighbors, with all the earth possesses and produces. When in that condition, there is nothing that can be presented to him that can satisfy the soul's cravings. What then is the matter? Why, the spiritual within him is beginning to develop, and it will not be, it refuses.to be satisfied with anything that is of and from the mere natural and genera-. tive order. The soul now requires spiritual ministrations and sustenance from the Church whose rock, foundation and walls, are Christ. On a certain occasion, when Jesus was preaching to the people, perhaps in a synagogue, some one went to him and said, 'Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren ! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother.' We dare say his mother, the virgin Mary, as she is called and worshipt by millions, thought this was very hard talk. But he meant what he said. For his mother was no more to him than was any other woman, except she had more virtues, and was more in affinity with his spiritual life. And so it is with us of the household of faith. We have entered, or ascended the spiritual sphere, and what have we to do with natural relatives, as such, or with those who live in the natural and generative sphere ? Nothing at all. They also, every one of them, will develop, and will come to a condition in which natural things will not satisfy their soul aspirations. Then we can approach them and do them good. But at present, we are similarly situated to the prophet Nehemiah, when he and others were building the walls of the second temple. He sent messengers to those who pretended to be his friends, but were indeed his enemies, and who would not assist him in the work, saying, ' 'I am doing a great work, so that I can not come down ; Why should the work cease while I leave it, and come down to you?' And like him we say to our natural relation, friends and neighbors ; We are doing a great work ! We can not come down to you! We can not fraternize with you ! We do not hate you, but we do hate the elements and principles in which you live, and by which you are actuated. We love you as we do other persons, that is, with a willingness to do you good, if you could and would receive the good we have to give. But we can not come down to you. You whom the things of this world can not satisfy, may come up to us, and then we will acknowledge you as our brethren and sisters and friends, and you shall realize the truth of the Savior's promise to those who will forsake all for his sake and the gospel. You shall have spiritually, a hundredfold of all your relatives, friends and associates (excepting only the wife and the husband) and of all needed physical blessings. God is our Rock, and all the so-called good things of the natural and generative order, including wife, children, friends, neighbors, riches, pleasures and honors of this world, which we have been called to forsake, are, compared to the spiritual good we are called to inherit, but as loss and dross, knowing and feeling that we possess the unspeakable privilege of beginning upon earth, to live as do angels in heaven, so that when we shall leave this body, we may find ouselves approved and accepted and dwellers in the society of justified and glorified spirits.
