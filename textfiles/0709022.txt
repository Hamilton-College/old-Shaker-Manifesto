Shaker Village, N. H., Aug. 22, 1877 Editor Shakerâ€”Please read the inclosed scrap entitled 'Soul Nurture,' and see if you do not think such a wellwritten truth, worthy to be copied on clean paper. The writer's name is not appended, but as all truth emanates from God, we accept it regardless of the media employed in portraying it. Perchance the writer never dreamed that he was penning facts upon which a Shaker theology has rested for at least a hundred years. Thus : ' The spiritual life thrives only when cared for ! ' What an axiom ! Should not all christians accept it? Faithfully, your sister, A. C. Stickney
