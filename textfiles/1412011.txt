DECORATION. WILLIAM WIRT SIKES. Dkcobation is a duty every one should well discharge, Hut when done upon the surface it should e'er be done at large! Number one is of important consequence in most men's eyes. Some think man's a God like being, Some that he's a show worth seeing. And just there the difference lies. I believe in cultivating God's dernense around us spread, And in decorating human beings at the heart and in the head. There is where your decoration is not vain and false and weak; In the heart that beats with beauty, in the head that's prompt in duty, There for fine things I would seek. Decorate the souls God gave us, clothe our mortal frames with graces, Knowing that true worth and beauty shines in costumes less than faces. Decorate our minds and make them centers where loved virtues meet, Leaving decorated clothing To the fallen creatures roving Homeless, graceless, lives of loathing In the gaslight on the streets.
