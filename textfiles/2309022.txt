Enfield, N. H. North Family. Aug. 1893. 'God is too great to need a religious broker on earth,' as He is too great for finite mind to fully comprehend. The divinity of God is of individual growth. That God's work ever has and ever will be performed and advanced by noble beings whose minds have penetrated beyond the boundary line which encompasses and utilizes the generative life forces, is an indisputable fact. To believe that God's laws need or are developing a new type of a human being through whom his truths are to be revealed, we would consider ourselves like Peter of old, denying Christ and stultifying our spiritually enlightened consciences. God's work needs no new revelator, but more laborers, armored in godly nobility to wisely explain laws of health, of mental and moral purity. . True Christianity is not enshrouded in mystical signs, language, or based upon unscientific facts, any more than it ever has or ever will create materiality out of nothing, a god-man out of a mental emotion. We are blessed with health, which condition is a power. 'Prompting us unto kindest deeds, To love mankind still dearer; For by pure love, not man-made creeds, We draw to God still nearer.' Our hay harvest is over, and of finer quality than last year's yield. We have had our Dry House re-floored with eighty iron rods, thus making a fire-proof building of brick, iron and slate. As we read of the prosperity in our several homes, we fervently breath a prayer for continued blessing throughout Zion. George IF. Baxter.
