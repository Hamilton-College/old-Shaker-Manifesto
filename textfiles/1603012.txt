'WITH THY MIGHT.' ANNIE L. HOLBERTON. Time is uncertain and fleeting, Quickly falls the night; ' Whatsoever thy hand findeth Do it with thy might. ' Thou may'st not linger or loiter There's no time to wait. Do what is needful in season ; Soon 'twill be too late. Life has its work for the millions, Idle hours for none ; He who shall heedlessly waste it One day must atone. With thy hand and soul, work ever Nobly for the right, And God will vouchsafe his blessing To increase thy might. The Sabbath Recorder.
