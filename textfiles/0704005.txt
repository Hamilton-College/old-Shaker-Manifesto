Wisdom, the Principal Thing John Phillips of Pleasant Hill, Ky., sends us the following report of a short, pithy address, by Larz Erickson of that place : ' Let us gather heavenly things. We stand in greatest need of wisdom, to lead us to be happy and satisfied and dutiful. A wise man or woman is of inestimable worth on this earth. Each is like the losing sun, manifesting the glory of God to all men. All who receive wisdom as a guide, flourish in temporal and spiritual blessings. Whoso is governed by wisdom, does not think nor say much of self as being exalted above his fellows. Wisdom never controverts ; it teaches by example the better way. War is not of Wisdom. Peace is one of Wisdom's children, her rule is 'peace on earth, and good will to men!' [To which we add 'Amen!' even at the expense of being so much a Methodist. Preach on, brother ; it is just such thoughts as feed the would-be wise, and many of our readers will bless you for so doing.]
