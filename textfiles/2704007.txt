Dear Editor:�I can not 'blot myself quite out,' so thought I would write some news,� Spring is coming, 'tis almost here, The birds will sing and give us cheer; Trees will blossom, flowers bloom, Filling the air with sweet perfume. Lambs in the meadow, far away, Will leap and bleat and skip and play, While in the kitchen just below, I'm making cake and kneading dough. But my occupation will soon change, in this place, and other business must be lookt after more closely, as we can not yet live without the 'mighty dollar' and must obey the injunction, 'keep out of debt.'

If the gospel work is the object of life, they will do the work it requires. They will gather the fruits of the Spirit,�'love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance.' 'My brain power may be very small, No matter,�it is mine, And from the hand of nature's God, I caught the spark, divine. And be the talents one or ten, Committed to my care;� He only asks that worthily 1 use and prize my share.' Sarah A. Collins.
