THE NEW CREATION. Giles B. Avery. A very popular idea among Christian professors relative to the genesis of the New Creation is, that Jesus, by his birth of Mary, was the beginning of the New Creation�the subject of Isaiah's prophecy, 'I create New Heavens, and a New Earth.' Isa. lxv ; 17. Also the prophecy of Jeremiah, 'The Lord hath created a new thing in the earth ; a woman shall compass a man.' Jer. xxxi; 22. ' And, He who sat upon the throne said,' ' Behold I make all things new.' Rev. xxi., 5. But, this is evidently a mistaken understanding of the subject, for the following reasons. Jesus said 'Except a man be born again, he cannot be my disciple.' Jno. iii., 3. This is equivalent to saying / have been born again. But, that this was not a material, but a spiritual birth, is manifest from the instructions of Jesus to Nicodemus, ' Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.' Nicodemus said to him, 'How can a man be born when lie is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?' Jesus answered, 'Except a man be born of * * the spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. The wind b^oweth where it listeth, and thou hearest tha sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it ccmeth, nor whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of the spirit.' John, iii. It is thus manifest that this birth into the Kingdom of God,�the Christ Kiugdom, of which Christ is its heavenly Lord, is not to be entered except by a spiritual birth, and, it was this birth of the spirit which made Jesus its Lord, and the first born of this Kingdom� this New Creation.�The Jesus unto whom Mary gave birth was flesh and blood. This flesh and blood said the Apostle Paul, 'Cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.' 1 Cor., xv., 50. Jesus Christ is called, 'The first born of every creature.' This could not be true of Jesus, when simply born of Mary ; for millions had been born of woman as was Jesus, before Mary gave birth to him. But, some have argued, ' This had reference to the way he was begotten.' Well, in reference to this, Jesus was called ' The first begotten of the dead.' Rev. i.. 5. This certainly could not justly apply to the begetting of the physical body of Jesus, because, be could not have been physically dead before he began to live physically ! Nor could it apply to the physical body of Jesus at all, since that body of Jesus, which was born of Mary died nearly two thousand years ago. If Jesus, by his birth of Mary was the beginning of the New Creation, then he constituted all there is of the New Creation, not only its 'first born' but its only born ; for, the world has no record of auy similar or annlogous births to that as recorded of Jesus, from the day of his birth unto the present time. It is, therefore, evident, that Jesus had to be born again of the spirit, in order to become the Christ, for, it is Christ that is the Lord of the 'New Creation.' And, ' If aay man be in Christ, he is a new Creature' of the New Creation.�Thus the new birth is a birth of the spirit into a new and heavenly life ; and, this birth Mary did not give to Jesus ; he received this, by his baptism of the heavenly dove. Into this Christ spirit many may be born, and become New Creatures in the Kingdom of God ; but it would not be practicable to be born into Jesus�the Jesus which was simply born of Mary. But, we are told, that, ' If Jesus erred any time after his birth of Mary the Second Man and the New Creation would have fallen also.' This conclusion is simply from the false basis, as before shown, calling Jesus, before he was born again of the spirit, 'The first born of the New Creation.' 'The new Man.' 'The Lord from Heaven.' 'The Quickening Spirit.' But, all these appellations and characters refer to Jesus, the Christ. That is, to Jesus, after he became baptized with the Christ spirit, and was born agaia, of the spirit. Again we are told, by some professed Christians 'There is not the slightest hope of the successful imitation as such a life as Jesus' in the spirit, by such fleshlings as ourselves. We are carnal; he is spiritual.' But, here is the hope, promise, and prospect, of better things, 'If any man be in Christ, he is a New Creature ; behold, old things are done away and all things are become new.' Thus, becoming New Creatures, the members of Christ's Kingdom are no longer ' Carnal fleshlings.' And to the members of Christ's Kingdom Jesus said, ' If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, in my name, and it shall be given you.' And, to such souls Jesus further said, 'It is my Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.' And, yet agaio, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is within, (or among) you.' Thus it is manifest, 1. It is possible to be in Christ, and become New Creatures. 2. It is possible for ' Christ' to be in us, ' the hope of glory.' 3. That a Creature of this New Creation is not a beiug yet in the corrupt nature of the fleshly man, but, a soul born of the spirit, and by this baptism, become a son or daughter of God. And, all such constitute the Children of the New Creation, the subjects and inheritors of the Kingdom of Christ. Of Jesus, the Apostle Paul said, 'Wherefore, in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren.' And, u He took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham.' This constituted Jesus, a man of the world ; and, it was iu this capacity only that Jesus, as such, could be tempted. And, that he was thus constituted, we have the declaration of his own mouth, thus. ' Be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world.' What world? Not the nations of the earth ; nay, in no wise! But the worldly nature of man iu himself. And, He could not overcome in himself that which he did not possess ! Thus we have the encouraging assurance that we, too, can overcome the world, as Jesus overcame, and set us the example, and become what St. John voiced, thus ; 'Behold now are we the sons of God ; and, it doth not appear what we shall (arrive to) be, but, we know, that when he (Christ) shall appear we shall be like him.' 1 John, iii., 2. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
