THE 'NEVERS' IN MANAGING CHILDREN. Never give in to disobedience ; and never threaten what you are not prepared to carry out. Never lose your temper. I do not say, never be angry. Anger is sometimes indispensable, especially where there has been anything mean, dishonest, or cruel. But anger is very different from loss of temper. Never sneer at them; and be careful even how you rally them. Never try to work on their feelings. Feelings are far too delicate things to be used for tools. It is like taking the mainspring out of your watch, and notching it for a saw. It may be a wonderful saw, but how fares your watch? Especially avoid doing so in connection with religion, for so you will assuredly deaden them to all that is finest. Let your feelings, not your efforts on theirs, affect them with a sympathy the more powerful that it is not forced upon them; and in order to do this, avoid hiding your feelings too much. A man's family has a right to share in his good feelings. Never show that you doubt, except that you are able to convict. To doubt an honest child is to do what you can to make a liar of him. Never be too hard on mere quarreling, which, like a storm in nature, often helps to clear the moral atmosphere. Stop it by a judgment between the parties. But be severe as to the hind of quarreling, and the temper shown in it. Especially give no quarter to any unfairness arising from greed or spite. Use your strongest language with regard to that.
