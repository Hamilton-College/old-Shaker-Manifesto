Selfish Property A Visionary Dream by one of the Shaker Sisters It seemed the family were in meeting for worship, when suddenly there came something like a tidal wave of spirit power, which spread over the whole assembly. Some who had never before been baptized, were touched, as with a live coal from God's burning altar of truth. I noticed one particularly, who was shaken powerfully. He seemed something like a whipped child half subdued, wondering whether it would be better to give up his will or retain it. He fell back against the wall and cried bitterly, his secret feelings, unbidden, came to the surface, and he was forced to express them. He said, 'Here I am, I have forsaken father, mother, wife, children, houses and landa, everything, and have worked well;' then holding forth both hands, in which were $2.25, he said, 'See, this is all the reward I have received!' He cried with a loud voice, 'Is this just? Can I bear it?' One of the sisters said, 'You are mistaken; that is not the kind of reward offered. Were you even a happy, contented man while in possession of earthly riches and friends you talk about?' He said, 'Nay, but I have given up so much for so small an equivalent!' The sister replied, 'It was the lusts, inseparably connected with the generative life and order, that made you an unhappy man there. The THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 3X reward offered in this gospel, to those who forsake that order, is not the paltry sum of $2.25,—not even one cent, as private, individual property—but the fire of truth, that will burn up the lusts pertaining to that order, that make you and are still making thousands of others unhappy. Dry up your tears, turn your thoughts away from dollars and cents, and be consistent. Cease mourning for the past and doubting the present, be willing to accept God's terms and the reward He is pleased to give, if you would be happy.' Mt. Lebanon,N. Y.
