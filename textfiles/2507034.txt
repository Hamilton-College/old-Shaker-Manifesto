Why should mankind be so dependent... Why should mankind be so dependent on the lower animals for so much of his food supply? They are not his natural food. Animals do not form food. Animals are liable to disease the same as man. It is a fact that iem of our domestic animals are really in health when slaughtered. So with the aid of knowledge and science the human family will find out as they get the truth, and have more information on the subject of dietetics, that it is a delusion and a great error to think that animal foods of any and of all kinds are essential to his growth, development and health.
