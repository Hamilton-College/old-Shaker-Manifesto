EXTRACTS VOICE OF PEACE Nations impoverish each other by standing armies and armaments which in peace are useless and in war destructive. Ironclads are useless national luxuries. They cannot stand against torpedoes, and are only fit to be sold as old iron. Monster guns are another folly. Fortresses are not safe against dynamite, which can be thrown upon them from balloons. But, say some, if it were not for war, what would we do with all the people ; the world would be overpopulated ? This is another great error. The Valley of the Mississippi can maintain two hundred millions of people, and the Province of Guyana, In Venezuela, which is as large as Prance, has only thirtyfive thousand inhabitants and some of the richest soil on the face of the earth. The United States alone could produce food and shelter for the present human race. Oneseventh part of the globe is still covered with swamps and deserts awaiting the labor of men, whilst nations destroy each other in wars for the benefit of a few politicians and reigning families, and still we hope and believe that peace and good-will among men shall one day reign upon earth. May that day not be far off; and may the labors of free and law-loving men hasten its advent.
