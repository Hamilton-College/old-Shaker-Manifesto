THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION People talk about religion being a restraint upon men. In some senses, it is a restraint. But this is not its chief idea. There are in men certain destructive tendencies,— passions, appetites and inordinate affections which need the curb; and religion operates as a curb upon these and reins them in. But it has other and larger uses than this. Feters and cords and gags do not represent it. It plants more than it uproots. When the work of correction is ended, it has only just Degun its operations in the soul — operations which will continue in force eternally. Negatives do not express religious duty. We ove to think that religious life means the THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 201 growth of all the faculties, and not a slowstrangulation of them. Religion no more cramps a man than wings do a bird, or fins do a fish. Piety is not a ship at anchor on a level sea ; it is a ship in motion, with every sail set and swelling with wind and the waters around it crested with white. Christianity makes a man active, vibrant, intense. Great injury has been done religion by teaching people to regard it as a mild form of slavery, in which people consent to be tied up that they may not hurt themselves nor others. But there is no such religion as this, at least in the New Testament. The gospel Christ taught, is a gospel of liberty. It is a stimulant to man's energies, not a narcotic. It makes him a doer, not a hearer.
