BEGINNING THE DAY. Oub early hours tune all the rest of the day. Broken, discordant, or disfigured days are possible largely because we have not learned to protect their beginnings. We trust to chance to get through the day. Against such dangers a devotional habit is the surest and most natural protection. An appeal to our own experience reveals that only as we have made it a rule to pray have we prayed effectively. To respect this rule rather than our moods is the only guarantee of secure and steady living., We may say as little as we please about our devotional habits, but a Christian life which can rely upon itself is sure to have them. There is a sustained power in the life Avhich carefully observes its devotions, and nowhere do we need them more than at the beginning of each mysterious new day, with all its unknown dangers and blessings.
