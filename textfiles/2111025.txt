Enfield, N. H. '�'�All that is needed to make a person think diminutively of himself, is to get a good square look at himself.' My eyes casually rested on this quotation in looking over a paper that might rightfully have been termed a waste of printers' ink and precious time, had it not been for one redeeming feature:�a short column, called 'Sands of Gold,' and I thought, why not call the attention of some young, would-be Christian, to this homely truth, it may help another to see himself as others see him, which is one of the important achievments. Evidently some soul had been illumined with the light of truth sufficiently, to see ones natural state far removed from God, greatly in need of both justice and mercy to bring out the qualities that ally one to the heavenly kingdom, and cleanse, as with fuller's soap, from all ungodliness. The thought also suggested itself, that as Believers in Christ's first and second appearing it was our duty, privilege also, to square our accounts at the closing of each year; to take a 'good square look at ourselves.' If it is necessary in the business world, as is generally conceded, why not ten-fold more necessary in the things that concern our growth mentally and spiritually. Let us see, not where we have tipped an uneven balance, for very few are exposed to this temptation in our Community homes, but where we have in thought, word or act wronged another, and make restitution, where we have been in any degree disloyal to the banner we professedly march under, where our omissions of duty, either temporal or spiritual have been recorded by the unseen guardians, and what our relations are with the Infinite, which relationship we may form and maintain through the sacred channel of prayer. Our summer has indeed been enjoyable, so far as weather is concerned; more consecutive pleasant days than for many seasons past. Our pear, tomato and apple harvest has been abundant, and we think and speak often of those who have not these blessings in such abundance. No extreme cases of sickness in the Society, though the too common ailments that poor humanity is heir to, afflict and annoy. Our love and good wishes to all, wherever our little Monthly may find readers. E. B.
