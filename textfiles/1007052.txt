Christianity is discussed by a learned Turk... Christianity is discussed by a learned Turk in Blackwood for January in a manner that does not reflect favorably upon believers. The gentleman admits the superiority of the moral teachings of Jesus, but affirms that his professed followers have perverted and degraded those teachings to a degree unparalleled in other religions, so that the nations in semi-barbarous ignorance are corrupted by contact with modern Christendom which he calls anti-Christendom, since its real God is mammon: ' Among Roman Catholics the reign of mammon is tempered by a lust of spiritual and temporal povver. Among Greek Christians it is tempered by a lust of race aggrandizement. Among Protestants mammon is supreme.' But he allows that there are noble exceptions, and that some are struggling to practice the higher virtues of Christianity.
