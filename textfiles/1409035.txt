But the teeth... 'Bur the Teeth?' One of the first objections by which flesh eaters attempt to throw discredit on a Vegetarian diet is the statement that its impossibility is demonstrated by the formation of the teeth and other structural evidence. 'Comparative anatomy,' they say, ' shows distinctly that the human teeth and intestines are constructed with a view to the digestion of flesh, and not of vegetables. ' The answer to this very fallacious argument is simply a denial in toto. Flesh eaters are utterly mistaken in their rash assertion. Thej' have only to examine their authorities carefully to discover that the comparative anatomy to which they appeal establishes beyond doubt the frugivorous, not the carnivorous origin of man. 'The natural food of man, ' says Cuvier, 'judging from Ms structure, appears to consist principally of the fruits, roots, and other succulent parts of vegetables. ' This opinion is corroborated by that of Linnajus, M. Gassendi, Hay, Professor Owen, Professor Lawrence, and a host of other authorities. Even without scientific testimony, the fact that the apes, who are nearest akin to us in the animal world, are frugivorous, is a strong indication that flesh is not the natural food of mankind, r-Dietetic Reformer.
