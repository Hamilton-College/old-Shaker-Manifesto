CHRISTMAS CORNELIUS BUSH How the tinkle, tinkle of the bells carry our minds back to our childhood. The gentle snow so soft and white seems to come for the delight of children both old and young, for, although our hair may turn gray, and our eyes grow dim. yet the fi'rst sight of the snow, which is an emblem of purity and innocence, seems to make us all young, so that the boy of fifty can feel the life and glow of the boy of ten, and almost forgets the intervening space of years. It is truly said that the soul which is the source of the mind, is forever young ; that it is only the body that grows old, and sometimes I think, that when we have laid off this garment, which'we call our body, we shall find ourselves only children, with one Father, and one Mother, God ! and that other children, some older than ourselves, will as of old, help us over the rough paths, and dark places, and although to our eyes the waiting may seem long, yet in good time, we shall all be gathered to our Father's and Mother's home in heaven.
