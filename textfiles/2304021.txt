Shaker Station, Conn. The experience of many persons has shown that it is by united effort that all progress has been made and lasting good accomplished. We should work in harmony with others and do all we can to progress in the right direction physically, morally and spiritually. There is strength in union. We should have a noble aim in view, and try to come as near the mark as possible. * * * When selecting eggs for sitting we should have the 'ideal hens' in mind. They should come from a prolific ancestry. We ought to know their past record and breed with all the care we take to get the choicest stock in animals. We have solved the problem of how to obtain plenty of eggs when they are forty cents a dozen. Warmth and a varied diet are indispensable.

The stormy March with its winds and clouds is now reigning supreme, traveling is impeded with the snow drifts and many roads impassable. To reach the Depot from our place is quite difficult, and the fields are resorted to, and the aid of townsmen is required to keep any roads at all, as the wind fills up the track as fast as it is opened. The cream gatherer could not get through for three days the past week. The cold is not as severe at present as has been the past two months. Water is more plenty, which is a great blessing. Our new heating apparatus is now in working order and will be THE MANIFESTO. fully appreciated. We have ten Radiators with coils in upper and lower halls which warm the house perfectly comfortable with one small furnace which is heated with coal, doing away with stoves and wood which required so much attention to keep warm at all. We are now released from the burden of providing wood which is quite an expense, and it will also be a saving of labor for those who provide it. These improvements are desirable to make home comfortable. We are truly thankful for the many blessings which are ours to enjoy. Health prevails in our midst. Bountiful Father praise to thee for thy unfailing goodness. The past I leave alone with Thee, My guardian and my stay; And with a spirit calm and free, I onward take my way. Maria Witham.
