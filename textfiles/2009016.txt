Sanitary. THE HOT-WATER CURE. Relative to hot water as a remedial agent, HalVs Journal of Health publishes some interesting hints. It says : 'A strip of flannel or a napkin folded lengthwise and dipped into hot water, and wrung out and then applied around the neck of a child that has the croup, will usually bring relief in ten minutes. A towel folded several times and dipped in hot water and quickly wrung and applied over the seat of the pain in toothache and neuralgia, will generally afford prompt relief. This treatment in colic works almost like magic. I have seen cases that have resisted other treatment for hours, yield to this in ten minutes. There is nothing that will so promptly cut short a congestion of the lungs, sore throat, or rheumatism as hot water when applied promptly and thoroughly.

I have seen a sprained ankle cured in an hour by showering it with hot water poured from a height of three feet. Headache almost always yields to the simultaneous application of hoi water to the fret and back of the neck. A goblet of hot water, hot as one can drink it, taken half an hour before bedtime or twenty minutes before breakfast, or both, is the best of cathartics in the case of constipation, while it has the most soothing effect on the stomach and bowels. This treatment continued for a few months, with proper attention to diet, will cure any curable case of dyspepsia, and it will give relief almost from the first glass. Try it and you will never regret having done so.
