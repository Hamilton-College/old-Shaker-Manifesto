RESPECT YOURSELF. EDNAH E. FITTS. In the words spoken or the acts performed, 'Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.' Jesus understood the natural inclination to covet the approval or shun the censure of friends, or even foes, who may witness our conduct. Opinion is not a safe criterion by which to decide the right and wrong in our lives. Is not every person blest with reason, a responsible being and as such will he not alone become answerable for his righteousness or unrighteousness? An eye-witness may sanction, may even applaud our deeds, but the question is ; Can we respect ourselves in the motive which prompts the action ? Respect Yourself. We consider these two words as the key to an honorable, Christian life. Every child or youth who can be impressed or persuaded to adopt them as their guides in all the walks and talks of immature years, will lay a sure foundation for a virtuous life. Canterbury, N. H.
