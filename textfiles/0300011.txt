When enraptured with the sound of poetry... When enraptured with the sound of poetry which breaks like silvery music upon our ear, what beauty, what loftiness of thought and feeling comes to us through the unwritten musical creation of worlds on worlds, pointing us to the Supreme Ruler and Law-Giver, who holds and directs them in their course, and causes them to move in harmony like one great musical instrument; each key sounding its note in its proper time and place !
