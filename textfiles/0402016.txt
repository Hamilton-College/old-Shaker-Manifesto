'ALL THESE THINGS SHALL BE ADDED UNTO YOU.' Some individual writes to the 'People's Column ' of the Boston Herald for Oct. 11th, presenting the following request, with which we think Mr. Beecher himself would find it hard to comply : 'Mr. Beecher, in his last lecture, spoke with great pathos of the sorrows that come from being finally wrecked in business. There is no feeling heart that does not at once ask, 'Is there no remedy for this?' and could the lecturer suggest one, he would do more good than he has as yet done in all his useful life. And I want to ask of him why he has not rescued from the twaddle of comment in which it has been seeking to pass so long the business rule given by his Master; 1 Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righte- ousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.' This promise may have philosophy to it. It may be the very thing we want, but it has never yet had any philosophic exposition. All explanation of it thus far has been dishwater. The man who shall show it to be a reliable working principle will do the world more good than a discoverer of the philosopher's stone. I, for one, could excuse the clergymen of Boston from a defense of the cosmogony' of Moses, the astronomy of Joshua, and the zoology of Jonah, if they would take the time thus saved to do the thing 1 suggest.' Gentlemen of the creedal stripe, whose attention is at present turned to God-in-the-Constitution schemes for the suppression of free speech and thought among your fellow-men, here is an opportunity to be of real, practical good. You have the floor—can you answer the inquiry? — Banner of Light.
