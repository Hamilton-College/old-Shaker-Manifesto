THE SILENT PATH. By Arthur E. Massey. The Silent Path is best For seekers after Peace, It yields the soul sweet rest, From outside thingsrelease! It bears us up to heights That far outvie each star, Revealing glorious sights No earthly pain can mar. It links us with the angels Whose strength becomes our own ; We hear their sweet evangels A celestial loving tone, Now borne upon the vernal breeze Of unseen realmsyet near! We sink in rapture on our knees In praise to God, so dear! We thank Thee, God, with all our heart For restful calm beyond compare, And that the same Thou may'st impart To all our brethren,is our prayer. Narcoossee, Fla.
