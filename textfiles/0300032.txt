THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE How lovely the scene which Nature has wrought, So richly diversed o'er the land, They 're perfect and useful, and with blessings fraught The works of an Almighty hand. The soft, tender grass that grows 'neath our feet, Forms carpets of verdancy bright, Which gives to the earth its aspect, replete With beauty, our eyes to delight. The sweet-scented flowers that grow 'mid the green, And blossom in many rich hues, Are pleasant to view ; but, like all earthly things, Will flourish, then pass like the dews. The tall, stately trees, with wide-spreading boughs, 'Neath whose shade we love to repose, Are shelter for warblers in bright sunny hours, And homes when the days gently close. The beautiful stream that glides gently by, With waters so limpid and clear, Refreshes the earth, that brings forth her supply, In gladness and joy to appear. And the deep azure sky, so lovely and fair, That canopies earth far above, Is emblem of purity, and ever declares, That God, its Creator, is Love. And the glorious sun, that bright orb of day, The source of rich blessings to earth, In the morn's golden hours, by ray after ray, To new happy thoughts it gives birth. And, while I thus think of external things, Of whose beauty I never can tire, I turn to my heart to see if therein Is growth which the angels admire. To see if sweet flowers are blossoming there, Well water'd by streams of pure love ; To see if the trees, with their foliage, are A home for the heavenly Dove ; To see if some verdure's springing up there, Which thrives in the sunlight of truth; To cultivate this, so rich and so rare, Is the labor and toil of my youth.
