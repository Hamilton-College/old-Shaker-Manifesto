THE KENTUCKY REVIVAL. By Richard M'Nemar of Union Village, Ohio. Published in Albany, N. Y.., in 1808. No. 4. Of the first appearances of the extraordinary ivork, in different parts of Kentucky, in 1800 and 1801. The next general meeting was at Caneridge, seven miles from Paris. It began the 6th. of August, and continued day and night about a week. The number of people collected on the ground at any one time was supposed to be about twenty thousand; but it was thought a much greater number were there in the course of the meeting. The encampment consisted of one hundred and thirty-five wheel carriages and tents proportioned to the people. This immense group included almost every character that could be named, but amidst them all, the subjects of this new and strange operation, were distinguished by their flaming zeal for the destruction of sin, and the deliverance of souls from its power. The various operations and exercises on that occasion, were indescribable. The falling exercises were the most noted. James Crawford, one of the oldest ministers in the state, and one of the foremost in the work, informed me that he kept an account of the number that fell on the occasion, and computed it to be about three thousand. The vast � numbers who received light on this occasion, and went forth in every direction to spread it, render it impossible to pursue any further the particular track of its progress. It was but a few weeks after this meeting, that the same work broke out in North Carolina, by the instrumentality of some who went from Caneridge to bear the testimony.* I will now take notice of the opposition which was raised against the work in this first stage of it, and show some of the causes from which it sprung. * One person in particular here alluded to, who went on this important mission, was John Rankin, Minister of the Presbyterian church at Gasper, Logan County, Ky.; the first who received the spirit of the revival in that place, and under whose ministry the extraordinary work began. Since that time he has escaped from the old house of antichrist, divided against itself, and with the major part of his Gasper congregation, embraced the Gospel of Christ's Second Appealing. The people among whom the revival began, were generally Calvinists. Although they had been for a long time praying in words for the outpouring of the spirit, and believed that God had 'fore-ordained whatsoever came to pass ;' yet, when it came to pass and their prayer was answered and the spirit began to flow like many waters, from a cloud of witnesses, and souls were crying for mercy, and found hope and comfort in the news of a Savior; they quarreled with the work, because the subjects of it were not willing to adopt their creed. Those who had labored and travailed to gain some hope of salvation, and had ventured their souls upon the covenant of promise, and felt the living seal of eternal love ; could not, dare not preach that salvation was restricted to a certain definite number; nor insinuate that any being which God had made, was, by the Creator, laid under the dire necessity of being lost forever. The love of a Savior constrained them to testify, that one had died for all. This truth, so essential to the first ray of hope in the human breast, was like a dead fly in the ointment of the apothecary, to the Calvinist; hence all this trembling, weeping and groaning under sin, rejoicing in the hope of deliverance and turning from the former practice of it, sent forth a disagreeable savor. These exercises would no doubt, have passed for a good work of God, had they appeared as seals to their doctrine of election, imperfection and final perseverance. Everything appeared new, and claimed no relation to the old bed of sand upon which they had been building; and rather than quit the old foundation, they chose to reject, oppose and persecute the truth, accompanied with all that evidence which many of them were obliged to acknowledge was divine. Some who were inwardly opposed, at first exercised fo-rbearance, and professed a measure of union with the work, in hopes that it would die away like former revivals, and the people return into their old.order. As they pi received that it increased, they laid aside the mask, and came out with a bold testimony against it, as a dangerous delusion. In some of the churches there were days set apart for fasting and prayer, to deprecate the divine displeasure, through which they supposed it was sent upon the land. These public testimonies against the work, particularly by ministers, were a means of stirring up and encouraging those who were openly wicked, to come forth to mock, oppose and persecute ; but even such, were often unable to withstand the power, and sometimes in the very act of persecuting and afflicting were struck down like men in battle. So alarming was the sight, that others on foot or horseback, would try to make their escape and flee away like those who are closely pursued by an. enemy in time of war, and be overtaken by the invisible power, under which they would be struck down and constrained to cry out in anguish, and confess their wickedness in persecuting the work of God, and warn others not to oppose it. Many who were openly profane, were taken in the very act of persecuting the work, and like Saul of Tarsus, made the happy subjects and zealous promoters of it; while bigotted professors, who had hissed them on, remained like the heath in the desert, that seeth not when good cometh. Of the distinguishing doctrines and manner of worship, among the first subjects of the revival. The first point of doctrine which distinguished the subjects of the revival, was that which respected divine revelation. The established opinion in the churches had been, that the Scriptures, explained according to sound reason and philosophy, and this light was light sufficient to believe what we were thus taught, wTas the highest evidence we could have of the truth of spiritual things. These adopted a very different faith, and taught as an important truth, that the will of God was made manifest to each individual who honestly sought after it, by an inward light which shone into the heart, hence, they received the name of New-Lights. Those who were the subjects of this inward light did not call it new light, but a renewed manifestation of that which at sundry times and in divers manners had opened to those who were willmg and desirous to know the truth for themselves. This inward light they denominated 'the Lord,' because by it they were instructed, influenced and governed. They spake of seeking the Lord, finding the Lord, loving the Lord, following the Lord, and offending the Lord; by all these expressions was meant that inward light and revelation of the truth, by which they could see things in their true colors, and find a measure of peace and consolation and a comfortable hope of eternal life. This new light first broke out in the Presbyterian church, among those who held the doctrines of Calvin, and therefore it is considered as more immediately contrasted with that system. Those who first embraced it had also been reputed Calvinists, and belonged to the Presbyterian church, among whom were several persons of distinction in the ministry; of course, the existence of sentiments so very different in the same church, rendered a division unavoidable. This division was gradual, and had its foundation in the above principle of a direct manifestation of spiritual light from God to the soul, which was superior to all the comments that natural men had ever made upon the Scriptures. This division in sentiment, with its concomitant effects, drew together a vast multitude out of different churches, who formed a general communion, and for a time, acceded to the doctrines and manner of worship, first opened and practiced among the NewLights, a brief sketch of which is as follows ;�All creeds, confessions, forms of worship and rules of government invented by men, ought to be laid aside ; especially the distinguishing doctrines of Calvin. That all who received the true light of the spirit in the inner man, and faithfully followed it, would naturally see eye to eye and understand the things of the spirit alike, without any written tenet or learned expositor. That all who received this true light, would plainly see the purity of God, the depravity of man, the necessity of a new birth and a sinless life and conversation to evidence it. That God was no respecter of persons, willeth the salvation of all souls, has opened a door of salvation through Christ, for all, and will have all invited to enter. Such as refuse to come in, must blame themselves for their own perdition. They allowed each one to worship God agreeably to his own feelings, or whatever impression or consciousness of duty he was under, believing the true wisdom Thich 'lives through all life,' to be a safer guide than human forms which can only affect the outer man: hence, so wide a door was opened, and such a variety of exercises were exhibited at their public meetings. All distinction of names wras laid aside, and it was no matter what any one had been called before, if he stood in the present light, and felt his heart glow with love to the souls of men: he was welcome to sing, pray, or call sinners to repentance. Neither was there any distinction as to age, sex, color or anytking of a temporary nature ; old and young, men and women, black and white, had equal privilege to minister the light which they received in whatever way the spirit directed. It was generally considered that such as professed to stand in the light and wrere not actively engaged in some way, in time of public service were only dead weights upon the cause. No one, except those who have been an eye witness, can possibly paint in their imagination the striking solemnity of those occasions on which the thousands of Kentuckians were convened in one vast assembly under the auspicious influence of the above faith. How striking to see hundreds who never saw each other in the face before, moving uniformly into action without any preconcerted plan, and each, without intruding upon another taking that part assigned him by a conscious feeling, and in this manner dividing into bands over a large extent of ground interspersed with tents and wagons. Some uniting their voices in the most melodious songs ; others in solemn and affecting accents of prayer: some lamenting with tears their lost situation or that of a wicked world ; others lying apparently in the cold embraces of death: some instructing the ignorant, directing the doubtful and urging them in the day of God's visitation to make sure work for eternity. Others, from some eminence, exhorting in the gift of a free salvation and warning sinners to flee from the wrrath to come. The surrounding forest was at the same time vocal with the cries of the distressed, sometimes to the distance of half a mile in circumference. How; persons, so different in their education, manners and natural dispositions, without any visible commander, could enter upon such a scene and contiaue in it for days and nights in perfect harmony, has been one of the greatest wonders that ever the world beheld ; and was no doubt included in the visions of that man, who, falling into a trance with his eyes open, cried out, 'How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob ! and thy tabernacles, O Israel! as the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side; �as the trees of lign-aloes, which the Lord hath planted.' The supernatural and extraordinary gifts of the spirit which were visible among this people are not less worthy of notice than their distinguishing faith and manner of worship; such as left no doubt of the restitution of that sacred panoply, which, together with the apostolic faith, had been trodden under foot for many hundreds of years by the power of antichrist. To evince this, as the faith of that people, at least, I insert a few extracts from their writing's. David Purviance, in a letter dated Caneridge, March 1, 1802, writes, 'Some things have lately taken place among us, which I think more extraordinary than any I have seen or that have been reported since the apostolic age. The case of Rachel Martin, was truly miraculous. This case is illustrated by the following extract. 'Last Saturday exceeded by far anything I ever saw before. Kachel Martin was struck the Thursday night after you left this place : She never ate nor spoke for nine days and nights. I was there when she rose and spoke; her countenance was as it were, refined [i.e. transfigured.] She told me she was free from the world all that time.' ' (to be continued.)
