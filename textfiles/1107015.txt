July No. The Manifesto for July will commend itself. We must call special attention to the article upon ' Brook Farm,' and 'The Beard and Circumcision;' also to the beautiful music of our respected Elder Augustus Blase, of Shakers, N. Y. We have some beautiful music in store for our singers in future. We also ask attention for the articles we quote, as being especially timely for consideration. To our advertising columns we scarcely need to call particular attention. We advertise only what we know to be the best.
