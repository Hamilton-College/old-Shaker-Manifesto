Beloved Elder Henry;ï¿½It is such a busy time I thought you would accept the Home Notes this time from a little girl twelve years old: and besides we have taken note of some things of interest we would like to tell you about, which perhaps older people would overlook. Having so early a spring, we thought we would write the date of the arrival of the birds as they came, that next year we might compare dates and see if the early coming of the birds denotes an early spring and then we shall know what to expect. Bluebirds were first heard the sixth of March, robins the eleventh, song sparrows the fifteenth. A pretty little brown singing bird which I have not yet learned the name of, came the second of April, phaebe birds the fourth, the hair bird or chipping sparrow the tenth, and the martins the nineteenth. The beautiful oriole came yesterday, the sixth, but the swallows, yellow birds, mocking birds and many others are yet to come. We picked the first little yellow coltsfoot flower on the eighth of April, and dandelions peeped out from among the green grass in sunny places the third week of April. Cherry trees were in blossom on the thirtieth of April and now the plum, pear, peach and even apple trees are in bloom and it is but the seventh of May; earlier, people say, than since the year 1878. On the tenth of April we had a pleasant flowery entertainment. Our family dwelling being heated by steam, plants can be kept in any of our windows without freezing, so there are flowers in the sunny windows all winter. This spring some one thought it would be pleasant to gather them together before putting them into the ground for the summer, so that all could enjoy their beauty. The young Sisters arranged them in the form 'of a bank eight feet high, nine feet wide and seven feet through. There were callas, six kinds of roses, fifteen kinds of geraniums, fuchias, oxalis, begonias, Zanzibar balsam, feverfew, ageratum, besides several foliage plants. In the evening the Brethren and Sisters gathered into the well lighted chapel where they were, and many said it seemed like heaven. We had singing, reading, and speaking of sentiments suitable for the occasion. Katie Wells. TERMS. THE MA NIFES TO. 141 North Family. May, 1894. Ix the multiplicity of cares and burdens incident to the season Brethren sometimes fail to appear with their most excellent themes in the department of 'Home Notes' as was the case last month. There is something wholesome and cheery in the intercommunication thus established between our Societies, it serves as a mental visit 'around east' and 'out west;' and in our growing relation and acquaintance, it seems suggestive of a more thoughtful and helpful means of stimulating one another to higher aims and nobler purposes along the lines of mental, moral and spiritual culture. It is so natural for us to settle down in our own cozy homes, content in the performance of our daily duties and the acquisition of creature comforts. What of our efforts in the missionary line? What of our social and ethical improvement and the giving of our minds to study the principles and doctrines of the Church to which we profess membership? Are we reaching out in prayerful aspiration, to help souls who are seeking to know and practice the truth? and are we prepared to minister to such, the power of salvation, and give them sure guidance in paths of purity and virtue? Coming in contact with the world we should let our light so shine that they may see our good works, and be convinced that we are closely following the Master, instead of being influenced by the elements that savor of the generative life. Souls are awaking to a knowledge of the benefits of association on the plane of altruistic love and purity. It is interesting to learn of the movements on the Pacific coast, in Australia and in other places which tend toward the gathering of the saints together, those who are willing to make a covenant with God and with each other, by the sacrifice of all selfish desires and worldly gains for mutual benefit and growth in the divine life. It is the religious element in human nature combined with enlightened reason, that builds up and sustains the communistic home, where equality, justice and peace are maintained. It is according to Elder Frederic's prophecy, that the next movement and awakening of the spirit would not result so much in the accession of members to the older Societies, as it would lead to the forming of new associations, with the same basic principles as a sure foundation on which to build, but with the increase and progress belonging to our own day and time. Yet when there is 'a call or cry from Macedonia, come and help us,' shall we send two or more disciples to prepare the way and make straight paths for their feet to walk in? It hardly seems probable at present, that the labors of a hundred years will be sacrificed for any great exodus of the faithful to foreign lands, or even to far off coasts of our own beloved continent, as is frequently suggested. We have only the fruits of our hard earned labors, as no funds are poured in our coffers with which to build 'The New Jerusalem,' or any other impossible venture, and above all let us not run in debt, for aught we have, or aught we attempt to do. We are interested in all that tends to ameliorate wrong conditions among mankind. In the Peace Movement we recognize a quiet but potent influence surely working for the abolition of war. In Hygienic Reform, a testimony against disease and animalism, which is sure to benefit and uplift the race. In the Land Agitation, the solution of human rights and a just settlement in the future of the claims of humanity. In the Temperance Cause, the abolition of one of earth's direst curses. In the Social Purity and White Cross associations, one of the most important leadings toward a better moral state. The 'Self-Improvement Society' in our home, has prepared papers on most of these subjects, which have given them food for mental exercise; some of them have appeared in different periodicals. 142 THE MANIFES TO. As it is an age of reading, and we want the highest toned and best literature, we can recommend as a monthly magazine, 'The Arena,' B. 0. Flower, Ed. As a spiritual paper, none can excel Lucy Mallory's 'Advance Thought.' 'Food Home and Garden,' Henry Clubb Ed. an earnest advocate of food reform. Many excellent papers come to our home, more than we have time to read, considering our busy life. Mount Lebanon is in its height of beauty and lov eliness; no drawbacks as yet, to the unusually early spring. The new pear and plum orchard has been set out and seems to be doing well; currant and raspberry slips also. The apple orchards are in fine condition, the trees having all been trimmed; they promise a fine show of bloom. Sweet cherry trees in bloom the last of April; dwarf sour cherry trees look like drifts of new fallen snow. It is marvelous what a change has been wrought, iu field, garden and door-yard in the space of three weeks; surely God's blessing attends the labor of consecrated hands. The Sisters have plenty of shirt work at present; sewing is interspersed with housecleaning. It is announced that Public meeting will be opened next Sabbath; we continue the exercises that have been a peculiar feature of Believers' religious services in times past. With renewed zeal and interest for our Zion cause, we extend loving greetings to gospel friends. Martha J. Anderson.
