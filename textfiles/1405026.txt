The readers of the Manifesto will be glad to hear through... Feb. 21, 1884 Hancock, Mass. The readers of the Manifesto will be glad to hear through its columns, the good report we are enabled to give of the Public School under the patronage of the Shakers in this town. The enrollment for the year just completed was seventeen, and although whooping cough did whatever it could to reduce the average, it was as good or better than any other school in our charge ; and what we said last year in reference to discipline and exactness of teaching, is true also of this. The readiness with which new systems of teaching have been adopted and carried into effect, is indicative of the conscientious diligence of the teacher, and has been productive of much improvement in the school during the past year. Especially we would give the pupils much credit for the proficiency they have attained in the systvm of letter-writing and punctuation. The exemplary behavior we have invariably noticed, seems to be the outgrowth of self-respect inculcated by the every day teachings at home as well as in the school-room. One of the sisterhood remarked, and to us it told volumes, 'We never whip our children, if we cannot get along without that, we return them to their parents.' Susan M. White. Feb. 21, 1884. Ch. Sc.
