DO SOMETHING. If the world seems cold to you, Kindle fires to warm it! Let their comfort hide from you Winters that deform it. Hearts as frozen as your own To that radiance gather; You will soon forget to moan, 'Ah ! the cheerless weather !' If the world's a 'vale of tears,' Smile till rainbows span it; Breathe the love that life endearsâ€” Clear from clouds to fan it. Of your gladness lend a gleam Unto souls that shiver ; Show them how dark sorrow's stream Blends with hope's bright river!
