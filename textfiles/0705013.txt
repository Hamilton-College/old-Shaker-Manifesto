Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., March 20, 1877 Bro. Geo. Albert: I was much surprised while reading The Shaker this forenoon to learn how unexpectedly rich I had suddenly become by your little article in The Shaker for March! Only a few days since, and we heard the Covenant read, by which we were informed that we were not the owners, individually, of a single dollar! Now, dear editor, what reply can we make to a revenue or other government officer should he come to collect income tax, where, by an article of agreement, signed and sealed, we represent we are not worth one cent? [Send him to Harvard, Alfred, Canterbury; or let him read our apology ! Ed.] And then, by our paper, we proclaim to the world we are worth millions of money! Is there not a probability of a misunderstanding between officers and ourselves? If not, please inform us bow we can get a few thousands to help us out of our present difficulty. To some, both statements may appear correct; but how can we harmonize them? To some outside of our societies, we appear very rich; but, to me, this is not the case. When one devotes all he has and is to the 'cause,'—consecrates himself to a Shaker's life,—instead of being a millionaire, he finds himself without one cent he can call his own ! Yours truly, [Our ' Notice to assessors' will partly explain how we blundered, what we did it for, and how generously we are paid for so doing. Ed.] Geo. M. Wickersham
