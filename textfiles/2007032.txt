Groveland, N. Y. June 5, 1890. The passing away of the past month n -tifies us that it is time to peifect our Home Notes for the edification of the July readers For readers will read in the month of July, With the same zeal they read in months gone by. But what shall the combination be? As we commence our note-making, We wait and wonder and oft repeat, What will they prove when all eomplet e ? Yet we must work for only too soon Will come the hour marked, high noon. While these notes are formulating we are mindful of our Editor and his Honorable Staff who are laboring in the interest of a noble cause. So we'll pause in the days occupation Hoping to give a pleasing donation Of notes that will pleasure impart. The reader may read, the singer may sing, And unto each one we trust they will bring Such notes as delighteth the heart. The music of which shall waft to the audience a fulness of that wonderful song, 'Peace on earth, good will to man,' prophetically sung by an angel choir in the wonderful long ago. Very reluctantly we said good-bye to merry-making May, as the night winds floated back its final farewell. The many profitable lessons we learned during our sojourn with sunny May will not be forgotten. The sowing and planting season has been unusually extended, owing to the incessant rainstorms which have prevailed here and everywhere ; storms of the most diverse quality and tone. Storms consisting of long rain, short rain, windy rain, mild rain, sunny rain, rainbow rain, dashing rain, dripping rain, and hail, all hail, rain ! Eacli day farmers are busy beyond measure; forenoons they are hurrying and worrying their crops out at interest, and afternoons they may be seen doing the same. All crops planted and sown during the Spring have grown rapidly, and are springing admirably night and day, much to the satisfaction of the ambitious farmers, whose anticipations of the would-be high and lofty type are occasionally lowered at half-mast only to rise with the rising of prosperous results, which we are daily witnessing as the season advances. Summer came this way in all the beauty of loveliness. A clear sky with balmy and healthful air, birds of brightest hue and reviving tunes are rendezvousing throughout our grove-like yards, And announcing life in all their songs, Melodiously rich and rare; Reminding us of that fadeless land With music they're making in air. Our home is daily delightful, Surrounded with flowers and trees; While ever our ears they are greeted By the hum of the honey-bees. The robins build nests in the tree-tops, And chirp on the broad branches tall; While mosquitoes they sing overhead And grasshoppers dance on the wall. Romantic indeed is our home-life, With a mingling just now and then Of inmates from all ages ranging,ï¿½ From eighty away below ten. Our gardens and yards are resounding, Resounding with laughter and glee; For many have learned the grand adage That laughter is healthful, you see, That laughter restores life and vigor, Brings fortune and happiness near: That laughter is good for the body And the mind it fills with real cheer. Then smile for all nature is smiling, Through clouds and through sunshine and rain, Repeating the same lesson daily, In laughter there's surely much gain. Our mutual friend and brother Michael A Shutz, A. B. native of Odessa, Russia, a present of the Dansville Sanitorium was our honored guest during one of the sunny Sun days of May last. He attended our morning service and delivered an interesting speech on 'Community Life' and the 'Brotherhood of man.' He is contemplating writing his history, which will contain his experience in Russia and America. His is an experience filled with thrilling and adventurous scenes. The work when completed will read like a charming romance All interested in the cause of humanity, should procure a copy of this most wonderful work, written hy one whose life is devoted wholly, 'For the cause that needs assistance, For the wrongs that need resistance, For the future in the distance, And the good he aims to do.'
