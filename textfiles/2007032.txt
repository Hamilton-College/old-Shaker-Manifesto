NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Sontli Family. June 4. 1890. Dear Editor :�Almost an unheard-ofthing happened last Sabbath afternoon. It was a beautiful day, and four lovely people from the North Family came to the Sunny South to have a visit. Elder Frederick Evans our dear father whom we love, and Br. Daniel Offord whom we respect, Eldress Anna White whom we all admire, and no less our precious Sister Martha Anderson. Do you not think we were highly honored? We wanted Elder Frederick's autograph. He wrote this original verse, Like a candle almost out, Or a person in a doubt, Flickering, burning very low, Studying, shall I stay or go. Eight here we must say that the oldest Sister of Mt. Lebanon who has been quire bright all winter, has during the past week been sick, and at the age of ninety-two has passed over the river. She came to Mt. Lebanon while young, of her own free-will, and has from infancy lived a divinely pure life. We have a good Samaritan here by name Sister Louisa Rice, and who during forty years has patiently cared for the infirm, the sick and the dying; 'Glory to the righteous, who can know their worth?' S. A. C. , TsTortli ITa,mily. June 12, 1890. On the 8th. our Society Meetings were opened. I did not number the people, but there was a large assembly. Farm and garden operations have been put rather behind, on account of the weather. Eain, weeds and worms, with winged insects are far too prolific. I never saw the tent caterpillars so numerous on the fruit and forest trees as they have been this spring. Many trees have been entirely stripped of all foliage. We need the God of Israel to come among us, and teach us how and what to do, to be saved from the curse of worms, flies and bugs. Israel of old was, according to the Scriptural record entirely saved from this curse, when obedient. Where is the wise man, spirit or God, that will tell us just what to do to be saved. On the 9th, Elder Frederick completed his eighty-second year, sixty of which have been spent among Believers. A company of five, one Brother and four Sisters are busily preparing for a visit to all the Eastern Societies Glorious are the anticipations, but as nothing to the realization. They start in the forepart of July. Peace and joy to all. Daniel Offord. Center Famliy. June 14, 1890. Dear Elder Henry :�Last Wednesday night we had a terrific wind-storm doing considerable damage in the gardens breaking down beans, tomatoes and corn and stripping off cherries so the ground was quite covered with them, they were rather scarce before the storm, but much more so now. Our prospect for pears and plums is very slim indeed this season, yet we are buoyed up with the hope of having enough of other fruits to make us comfortable. The Sisters have just about finished spring's cleaning, there are so many buildings to be cared for it comes quite hard on them. Brethren have done a little painting inside the dwelling on the bath room and Vestibule on east side of house. I have had considerable difficulty this season with Hubbard Squash seed, in getting it to grow , something destroys it in the ground and that little pest the mole has made me much work in the hot-bed by rooting under the plants. But with all these drawbacks, we have enough to be thankful for; a good degree of health and a fair share of prosperity in temporal things. Your Brother, T. R. Enfield, Conn. We must not try to live without labor. If necessity does not quicken the energies, we must work as a matter of principle, for mental, physical and spiritual activity is essential to the perfect development of human character. If any one were asked what is the great curse of the farm, he would be apt to say, weeds. They give us an endless fight. No half way work. Weeds can be raised cheaper than most crops, because they will bear more neglect. But they don't pay in-the end. They are the little vices that beset plant life, and are to be got rid of the best way we know how. It is cheaper to nip them in the bud than to pull them up root and branch. Here is where brain work comes in. Our experiment with Japanese buckwheat last year was a success. The kernels are more than twice the size of our common variety, and black. The stalks grow large and vigorous. It is well worth cultivating. Try it. Hens that are spare and leggy, are said to be the best for layers. We should study to obtain large eggs, not forgetting quantity, and well grown fowls. The best quality pays best and costs no more to produce. D. Orcutt. Enfield, N. H. 'Time hangeth not heavy with the industrious, while to the slothful and.indolent, it proves a weight.' These truthful lines were brought to memory, as we discovered that the proper time for June Notes (which by the way should have been demi semi quavers to accord with the tuneful notes of the birds during that month) had passed into oblivion, all too soon ; so we resolved to be on the alert, in the future, deeming the few simple words we contribute, to be one of the many ways in which we may give others satisfaction, judging from our own pleasure in reading the interesting Notes from the several localities. The lovely month of June, with us, has been almost constantly in tears, grass and foliage is luxuriant, but gardens, we fear, are having an excess of moisture. The sun, whose glorious rays dispense health and happiness, has grown of late, too modest, only showing himself at intervals, so brief are these manifestations, that vegetation and humans also, need a protracted sun bath. Our South Family, which has for the past year, been awaiting sale, under the auspices of a Boston Syndicate, is now released from these bonds. We are glad to have this property, so near the Center Family, under the direct control of the Society, glad also, that the elderly members of the family, who have consecrated their time and energies to its maintainence, may yet longer make it their earthly, therefore temporary home, for to some of them we know,�' 'The Pearly Gates' must be opening, on yonder shore. There a permanent abode awaits them, where parting is no more. We send greetings of welcome to the different companies, whom we are expecting to entertain as guests, during the coming summer if the Lord is willing. We have naught to boast of, concerning the things of this world but will promise you a season of real satisfaction and profit, if willing hands and loving hearts can accomplish this end. We shall remember those also who remain at home, and wish for them health and happiness. E. B. Groveland, N. Y. June 5, 1890. The passing away of the past month n -tifies us that it is time to peifect our Home Notes for the edification of the July readers For readers will read in the month of July, With the same zeal they read in months gone by. But what shall the combination be? As we commence our note-making, We wait and wonder and oft repeat, What will they prove when all eomplet e ? Yet we must work for only too soon Will come the hour marked, high noon. While these notes are formulating we are mindful of our Editor and his Honorable Staff who are laboring in the interest of a noble cause. So we'll pause in the days occupation Hoping to give a pleasing donation Of notes that will pleasure impart. The reader may read, the singer may sing, And unto each one we trust they will bring Such notes as delighteth the heart. The music of which shall waft to the audience a fulness of that wonderful song, 'Peace on earth, good will to man,' prophetically sung by an angel choir in the wonderful long ago. Very reluctantly we said good-bye to merry-making May, as the night winds floated back its final farewell. The many profitable lessons we learned during our sojourn with sunny May will not be forgotten. The sowing and planting season has been unusually extended, owing to the incessant rainstorms which have prevailed here and everywhere ; storms of the most diverse quality and tone. Storms consisting of long rain, short rain, windy rain, mild rain, sunny rain, rainbow rain, dashing rain, dripping rain, and hail, all hail, rain ! Eacli day farmers are busy beyond measure; forenoons they are hurrying and worrying their crops out at interest, and afternoons they may be seen doing the same. All crops planted and sown during the Spring have grown rapidly, and are springing admirably night and day, much to the satisfaction of the ambitious farmers, whose anticipations of the would-be high and lofty type are occasionally lowered at half-mast only to rise with the rising of prosperous results, which we are daily witnessing as the season advances. Summer came this way in all the beauty of loveliness. A clear sky with balmy and healthful air, birds of brightest hue and reviving tunes are rendezvousing throughout our grove-like yards, And announcing life in all their songs, Melodiously rich and rare; Reminding us of that fadeless land With music they're making in air. Our home is daily delightful, Surrounded with flowers and trees; While ever our ears they are greeted By the hum of the honey-bees. The robins build nests in the tree-tops, And chirp on the broad branches tall; While mosquitoes they sing overhead And grasshoppers dance on the wall. Romantic indeed is our home-life, With a mingling just now and then Of inmates from all ages ranging,� From eighty away below ten. Our gardens and yards are resounding, Resounding with laughter and glee; For many have learned the grand adage That laughter is healthful, you see, That laughter restores life and vigor, Brings fortune and happiness near: That laughter is good for the body And the mind it fills with real cheer. Then smile for all nature is smiling, Through clouds and through sunshine and rain, Repeating the same lesson daily, In laughter there's surely much gain. Our mutual friend and brother Michael A Shutz, A. B. native of Odessa, Russia, a present of the Dansville Sanitorium was our honored guest during one of the sunny Sun days of May last. He attended our morning service and delivered an interesting speech on 'Community Life' and the 'Brotherhood of man.' He is contemplating writing his history, which will contain his experience in Russia and America. His is an experience filled with thrilling and adventurous scenes. The work when completed will read like a charming romance All interested in the cause of humanity, should procure a copy of this most wonderful work, written hy one whose life is devoted wholly, 'For the cause that needs assistance, For the wrongs that need resistance, For the future in the distance, And the good he aims to do.'
