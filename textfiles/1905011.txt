To the Editor of 'The Shaker Manifesto'... To the Editor of 'The Shaker Manifesto, from the Church of Philadelphia. Greeting; ï¿½ The little band of Believers residing here haye recently been deprived of the visible presence of Sister Amanda Miller, whose exit was noticed in the April number of Manifesto. Just one week from her demise, ascended Mary Green, February 23rd. 1889, in the 77th. year of her age. These were two of the oldest mem- bers belonging to the family, established here in the year 1866, under the supervision of mother Rebecca Jackson, who passed away in the year 1871 in the 77th. year of her age. The numbers have varied from that time to the present; never exceeding twenty, now a few less, some having recently moved into other organized societies. But the integrity, the zeal and coarage to abide in the faith, is as unflinching as ever, and agrees with the testimony of Jesus: 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in the midst to bless.'
