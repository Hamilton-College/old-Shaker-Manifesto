Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Dec. 8, 1894 Beloved Elder Henry:—'And still another!' you will say, so soon after receiving the other package of a few days since. We never know what the Spirit has in store for us. The enclosed is fresh from the mint and knowing your mind upon certain things, I thought, 'this plea for the turkeys will just please Elder Henry, and as it is the time of year when the poor creatures are particularly noticed, he may be only too glad to put it in the Jan. number of The Manifesto, so I will catch the train and send it be- fore it is too late.' 'Shakerism is a new phase of human existence. In the first cycle (just closing,) 'Thou shalt not generate,' was the great command. In the second cycle (just opening,)'Thou shalt not kill,' will be the next great command.' So prophesied our good father, Elder Frederic; he who put in the first THE MANIFESTO. 7 wedge and gave the first blow that opened a new and startling revelation to the pork-eating—beef-lovers of the Shaker Community. All honor to the great prophet! Through his ministrations others have been, and are inspired to utter the same truths and they bring forth the same practical results. In the days to come, I hope it will be as sinful to raise and sell for slaughter as it is now sinful (to some) to slaughter, simply for the purpose of appeasing a depiaved appetite. 'How can we reason but from what we know,' and we know that Believers in general are in the rear guard when they in the face of reason aud common sense, saying nothing of conscience, will, in this age of evolution, dip their hands in blood and deck their tables with dead carcasses. Think you the eagle souls who soar aloft for light in the outer firmament would accept the truths of the first cycle, if they were forced to depart from the truths of the second in order to obtain the first? He that is faithful in that which is least will be faithful in greater things. Our Ministry are at their central home, and we think of keeping them here until the cold season is over. Dear Eldress Harriet we are happy to state is steadily gaining ground from her recent indisposition, and we all mean to be with her on the ascending scale. A joyful Christmas to all our dear friends at Canterbury and Enfield, may old and young be made happy recipients of all the blessings of the church militant below and receive a continuation of divine light and truth from the Church above—in the Spirit world. Elder Henry, we are thankful for your excellent words and mean to hold oui selves in that manner to accept the increasing truth, though it come like a trumpet's blast with no 'uncertain sound.' Your Sister, Anna White
