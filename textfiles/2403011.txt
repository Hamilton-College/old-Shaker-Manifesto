To the dear Shaker Friends who loved Eldress Rachel Russell. The following lines were written by a lady living in Cleveland, Ohio, who has known the Believers many years and was well acquainted with our Beloved Sister Rachel. Cornelius Bush. The beautiful life so pure and still Has not gone out to-day, It has just begun on the other side, Where the heavenly gate has opened wide To bid our loved one stay. No human word, the story sweet Of those earth-years can tell, But our hearts have felt its influence blest And we know our Father has called to rest The one who has toiled so well. We can never lose the gentle life The daily message from above, Lived out before us here, Telling of faith and child-like love, Will still to us be near. And when we hear from the other side The word which calls us o'er Beyond the taint of earth and sin, We shall surely find as we enter in Our loved at the open door. Cleveland, Ohio. Sarah L. Andrews.
