If it is the truth that is to make the soul free... If it is the truth that is to make the soul free, then the truth should be presented in the most acceptable manner and an effort made to secure the greatest amount of good. The Apostle has left sufficient on record to establish him as a minister of God's free word, in his testimony of right over wrong. See what he says to his brethren in Christ. 'If a man say, I love God and hateth his brother, he is a liar ; for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?' It is an easy thing for a selfish man to deceive himself and through this to be disappointed. The false position which he takes, makes him unreliable, and his assumed love for God is of no value to himself nor to any other person. The position for the Christian to occupy, is to love to do good, to walk humbly, to deal justly and to be active in making the world better while living in it. A fearless testimony against the sins of the world, is a redeeming Christian attainment. It brings forward the blessings of new light, new life and impresses upon the mind new truths, which are to aid in building up a Kingdom of God upon the earth.
