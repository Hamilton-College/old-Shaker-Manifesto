The State deals only with temporal affairs, and does not... The State deals only with temporal affairs, and does not attempt to usurp spiritual functions. Therefore the objects and methods of public education are wholly secular, but by no means necessarily, or at all immoral or irreligious. On the contrary, they are decidedly favorable to piety and morality. But, composed denominationally as the American people is, the State ought not to impart religious education. The moment such an attempt should be made the community would be in conflict as to what form it should take. It may be conceded, without danger perhaps, that the State should not teach ethics, except so far as the great fundamental principle of morals and politics as to which all Americans are agreed are concerned. The religious educationshood may and should be remitted to the family, the Sabbath-school, and the Church â€” the natural and divinely-appointed guardians of religion and ethics. Zion's Herald.
