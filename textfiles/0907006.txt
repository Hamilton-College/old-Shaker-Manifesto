BLESSINGS CATHARINE ALLEN God scatters blessings with a liberal hand, And those who seek his gifts thro' sacrifice Of selfish loves, and all their worthless gain, Will find that angels bring them in disguise. Then forms which through the mists of morning grey Appeared like crosses, heavy to be borne Up duty's rugged path, will melt away, And change their guise beneath the rising' sun Of cheerfulness, and self-forsaking love. And then, like stars whose glory brighter glows, As shades of evening deepen in the sky, They'll gather lustre as the day declines, Till gems of peace and purity are formed, To place within the temple memory rears. And these with time, will not grow old and dim ; The gifts that God bestows increase their worth. 'Tis thus that he awardeth recompense To souls who offer, while in seed or bud, Those pleasures false whose blossoms fade so soon, Then quickly yield the fruit of bitterness. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
