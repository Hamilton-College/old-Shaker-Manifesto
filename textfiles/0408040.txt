NEVER DESPAIR These are the hopeful words of the Christian. Yet there are times, when even hopeful, trust- ing Christians have felt sinkings, akin to despair. Jesus, on the cross, cried ' My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' Yet God is ever nigh to aid suffering, humble spirits, though he permits their trials to prove them and show them their dependence on Him. It is often, when the cloud, is darkest, that the sun suddenly shines forth. Aid does not always come as we look for it, in our own natural wisdom ; but in ways that convince us of the watchfulness of our good Heavenly Parents over us. It is through severe trials and tribulations that the saints are tried as gold. Anna Ervin, Enfield, Ct.
