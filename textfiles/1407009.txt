Ward-- Esteemed Friend: Your letter, of March 24, has just reached me, with ten stumps upon it. It was not properly directed�I hasten to reply� Of course, I am interested in you. Hope you will come and see what God hath wrought. Your Temperance views and Vegetarianism are so far a preparation for our Order. I am under the impression that there are many people in England who, if they knew of our existence, would come like doves to the windows. Yet, it is only fair and right that you should know that we are not yet, as an Order, Vegetarian. When I joined the Society, fifty three years ago, the Order, was neither Vegetarian nor Temperance. Twenty five years ago, our eighteen Societies, became Temperance orders, and also took one step towards Vegetarianism, discontinued the use of Pork. True, many individuals became Vegetarian. In the North Family, where I reside, we have for many years, set two tables, one pure Vegetarian, the other use meat, moder-ately, once a day, except Sabbath day. When founded, the Society adopted Community of goods, Celibacy and Peace, or non-resistance. In other respects, the members brought in, with them, the common habits of the country. The whole American nation were dyspeptic. They ate superfine white bread to produce constipation, and took Brandreth Pills, by the ton, to overcome and remove constipation. By this process, Doctors and Druggists were largely benefited, and Pill makers became millionaires. Your Vegetarianism would ruin all the classes who live by making and vending medicine. Is that right? Please consider the error of your ways, seek peace and ensue it. An aged brother informed me that he heard Ann Lee say, the time would come that her people would not eat meat. All her teaching was prophetic�She expected her successors to be better Christians than she was. Jesus did the same�'� The works that I do, ye shall do also, and greater works than these shall ye do.' How could that be if he had been God the Creator? As an Order, we are in a travel�We have passed through one Cycle of seven. The testimony of the first Cycle was, as I have stated, Community, Celibacy, Peace. The testimony of the second Cycle will be, in addition to these, Temperance in drink and Vegetarianism in food, and a scientific dress. Come and help us and open the way for others who are like minded, and we will help you and do you good. You have advocated temperance among a people who drink to drown care. First remove the care. Take no thought what ye shall eat or drink, but seek first the Kingdom of Heaven and its righteousness, wherein all these things�food, clothing, labor, houses, lands, shall be an hundred fold, so abundant that the danger is, with these, uuthankfulness, nnappreciation. The windows of Heaven are opened until there be no room to receive. This is not poetry, fiction, but simple fact. Why then are there not more Shakers ? For the same reason there are not more Total abstainers, more Vegetarians. They speak evil of you because ye run not with them to the same excess of riot in sensual indulgences. Can a person who drinks tea, coffee, wine, liquors of various kinds, relish water? Can a high liver relish simple food? There must be, first, conviction of the right, then a daily cross, until appetite is changed. ' I see the right, and I approve it too; I see the wrong,-and still the wrong pursue. ' Until a change of heart takes place, there is no form nor comeliness in Christ that a man or woman should desire him. After that, Christ is altogether lovely. Is it not so ? Christ means the highest form of Spiritual Truth. Please write me about yourself, your Family, Religious views, etc. Have you ever worked on the land ? Any information about the move of things in the inner life of the people, will be interesting. Have you any thought of coming? I remain in kindness, F. W. Evans.
