Hark ! â€” A new religion has appeared in India. It is called the ' Arya Somaj,' and of its tenets The Pall Mall Gazette says, they ' comprise a revival of most of the fair humanities of old religion which are associated with some of the mysterious rites of which the trustees of the British Museum prudently keep the memorials in a cellar.' An English member of the sect declares that it is ' the purest religious movement of modern times, and a reformatory agitation which inculcates a morality of almost unattainable severity,' adding that so far from being a secret society, as has been said, it is '' the most active and public propaganda now existing in India, or perhaps in the world, not excepting the Christian missionary enterprises, to which, no doubt, it is bitterly opposed.'
