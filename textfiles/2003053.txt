SPEND WISELY. [Contributed by Geneveve De Graw.] Look most to your spending No mattrr what comes in, if more goes out you will always be poor. The art is not in making money, but in holding it; little expenses, like mice in a barn, when they are many, make great waste. Hair by hair, heads get bald. Straw by straw, the thatch goes off the cottage, and drop by drop, the rain penetrates your roof. A barrel is soon empty, if the tap leaks but a drop a minute. When j^ou mean to save, begin with your mouth ; there are many thieves craving admittance therein, but do not allow them to enter. The ale and beer jugs are great wastes. So is the tobacco box. Keep away from them, and you will never find occasion for their use. In all other things strive to keep within compass. In clothing choose suitable and lasting matereal, not tawdry fineries; also avoid very prominent colors. To be warm is the main thing; never mind the looks, but always clothe yourself, honorably, healthfully, and comfortably. Never stretch your limbs further than your blanket will reach, or you will soon be cold. A fool may make money, but it needs a wise head to spend it. Eemember it is easier to build two chimneys than to keep one going. If you give all to back and board, there is nothing left for the savings-bank. Fare hard, and work hard while you are young, and you have a chance of rest when you are old. And your rest will be honestly earned.
