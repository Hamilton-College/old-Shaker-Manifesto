LIFE WITHIN How hard it is to feel that the power of life is to be found inside, not outside; in the heart and thoughts, not in the visible actions and show; in the living seed, not in the plant which has no root ! How often do men cultivate the garden of their soul just the other way ! How often do we try and persevere in trying to make a sort of neat show of outer good qualities, without any thing within to correspond ; just like child ren who plant blossoms without any roots in the ground, to make a pretty show for the hour ! We find fault in our lives, and we cut off the weed, but we do not root it up ; we find something wanting in ourselves, and we supply it not by sowing the divine seed of Heavenly principle, but by copying the deeds that the principle ought to produce.
