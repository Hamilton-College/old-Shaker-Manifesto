Enfield, N. H. Oct. 1894. 'The harvest now is over, the summer days are gone.' Our silos are filled and corn all gathered We have had an average crop of apples, which we finished picking on the 9th. The potato crop is below the average, which is never very large with us, at best. This summer the old seed-house near the Ministry's Dwelling has been taken down, and since the ground has been leveled, it adds quite a little to the children's playground. Some of our buildings are being shingled and repaired in various ways, which means work for 'busy hands.' Our roots are nearly all dried and cut. We are fast getting short of water for power for our mills. Our large reservoir on the mountain is lower than for many years. We are still blest with enough for domestic use. Everyone is wishing for rain. We heartily sympathize with our gospel kindred who have been visited by the fire fiend so recently. We hope the end of it has come, as three fires in about a month, is quite enough to hear about. G. H. Kirkley.
