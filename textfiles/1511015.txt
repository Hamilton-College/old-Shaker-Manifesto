LETTER BOX TEEES. Some trees are very tall and large and others are not so large. I will name all I know of. The Oak, the Maple, the Fir tree, the Chestnut, the Horse chestnut and the Willow. I will name the fruit trees, the Cherry, the Peach, Pear, Plum, Apple and the Quince. The fir tree keeps green all the year round. Gertrude Lackey. Canterbury, N. H. STRAWBERRIES. I think that strawberries are among some of the best kinds of fruit. In picking strawberries they should be picked on the stems because if they are hulled they jam together and it is very hard to pick them over; and I have been told that in canning strawberries that the field strawberries are the best. I think that this is because in cultivating the strawberry to make it larger it takes away its real strawberry taste and makes it sour. Rebecca Hathaway. Canterbury, N. H. Dear Teacher Jessie: When I go to... Shaker Village, Mer. Co., N. H. June, 1885. Dear Teacher, Jessie :ï¿½When I go to School in the morning, I am thinking about my lessons, I thought I would try to get nice lessons so that I may hare perfect lessons every day. I will try to be a good girl so as to set a good example to the little girls, and we will have a nice School to go to. I like to go to school while I am young so that when I am older I can teach school. It is nice to go to school in the Summer time. It is cool out here and we can study better. I think that the best thing that the children can do while they are small, is to help the sisters and go to school. This is all I have to say now. Your child, Pernella E. Uston.
