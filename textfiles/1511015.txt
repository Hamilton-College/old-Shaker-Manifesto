Dear Teacher Jessie: When I go to... Shaker Village, Mer. Co., N. H. June, 1885. Dear Teacher, Jessie :ï¿½When I go to School in the morning, I am thinking about my lessons, I thought I would try to get nice lessons so that I may hare perfect lessons every day. I will try to be a good girl so as to set a good example to the little girls, and we will have a nice School to go to. I like to go to school while I am young so that when I am older I can teach school. It is nice to go to school in the Summer time. It is cool out here and we can study better. I think that the best thing that the children can do while they are small, is to help the sisters and go to school. This is all I have to say now. Your child, Pernella E. Uston.
