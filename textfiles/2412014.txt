West Pittsfield, Mass. Nov. 1894. We have not had a picnic or play-time of any kind to speak of this month, nor are they necessary to our happiness. If contentment reigns in the home, pleasure may be found in small things. 'Our common joys, O what are they? The brightest and the best; They glad us in our busy walks, Are with us when we rest. ******** The consciousness of doing good With every passing day.' We have long anticipated the possession of a new ice-house, with modern improvements. Within the last two months it has been erected. The building is 22x34 ft. with brick walls 18 ft. high, laid in redcolored mortar. One half of the lower story is finished inside with Southern pine, to be used for cold storage. The ice-hall and chamber will hold nbout two hundred tons of ice. The outside wood-work is painted a light gray color, and presents quite a nice appearance. There are rooms for vegetables, fruits, ments, and many things that we may wish to keep for a long or short time. Kight here in our Shaker Village they are building a new road, or ritlier changing the i\&gt;ad, that runs east and west io a State highway. There has been some thirty men with nearly as many teams at work here since tie mMdle of October. They change the grade where they can, and cover the road with top rock stone; then roll it down with a roller weighing 17 tons. The one mile of road to be done this season is to cost several thousand dollars. We understand there has, or will be built, one mile in a number of places in the State, this year. If they give satisfaction more will be built another season. We may expect some good roads across the State some time in the future. We hope it will not be long before they continue this new highway over the mountain to Mt. Lebanon. We have had some fine rain-storms of late. The last one caught us unprepared. We had been opening some ditches for new water-pipes, and rain is not apt to enhance the pleasure of such work. Sunshine and wind have dried up the mud now so that the enterprise can be continued. 286 THE MANIFESTO. Thanksgiving day will soon be at hand. As we review the year and consider the countless blessings with which it has abounded, we feel that our gratitude is inadequate. While we wish our friends in the several Societies a happy and prosperous season on the 29th inst. we will reord a determination to keep each day a Thanksgiving day to the Lord in recognition of the kind and loving way he has led us 'all the days of our life.'
