Salt is a crude acrid mineral poison... Salt is a crude acrid mineral poison, a chemical combination of substances not far removed from a stable compound: therefore poisonous to a high degree. Its whole influence in relation to animal life is to kill. When it is introduced into man's body or any other animal organism it is acted upon as other poisons. The vital instincts attempt to throw it out through the excretory outlets or to eject it from the stomach by spasmodic action. T. V. Gifford, M. D.
