GRATITUDE We thank Thee, Holy Father, Thou Source of love divine, For all Thy Gospel givings, Which worldly joys outshine ;— Our Fathers and our Mothers, * Who kindly for us care ; Good Sisters and good Brothers, Whose sympathy we share ; Pure bonds of Christian friendship, Which ne'er can broken be, Deep wells of pure affection, And sweets of liberty ; A blessed home of beauty, Where peace and plenty reign — A hundred fold of substance — Industry's honest gain; A golden cross to carry, In mercy handed down From Christ, through Ann and Jesus, By which to win the crown ; The fires celestial kindled, To burn within our breast, Till, through Thine own appointment, We find supernal rest; TJntil we reach the fountain Of Thy redeeming love, Which floweth down the mountain, From out Thy throne above. For all Thy gracious givings, While here in time we live, In fullest consecration Our hearts to Thee we give. Julia Johnson, Hancock, Mass.
