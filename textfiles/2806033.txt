The Outlook The May Magazine Number of The Outlook has on its cover a fine portrait of Commodore Dewey, and nearly twenty pages are devoted to a historical account of the war and to editorial comment thereon. The article on 'The Parks and the People,' by Samuel Parsons, Jr. ex-Superintendent of the New York Parks, is accompanied by numerous charming pictures now first printed, of scenes in Central Park, Prospect Park, and Morningside Park. The fiction for the number is also distinctively of a seasonable character; the author is Maria Louise Pool, and the title is 'In Sappin' Time.' It may also be specially noted that the month's installment of Dr. Edward Everett Hale's 'James Russell Lowell and His Friends' contains some beautiful photographs made for The Outlook, of Elmwood in the early spring. Other features of this Magazine Number are; An article on 'Mr. Stedman as a poet,' with a full-page portrait; an article by Clifton Johnson on 'English Inns,' illustrated by photographs taken by the author; an article on 'The New Polychrome Bible,' by Professor Francis Brown, of Union Seminary; an article on 'Municipal Water-Works,' by Mr. M. N. Baker, of 'The Engineering News;' a readable paper by Mr. Charles M. Skinner on 'Animal Life;' and several other light sketches, poems and articles, besides the usual reviews, news departments, and editorials. ($3 a year.
