AID YOURSELF AND GOD WILL AID YOU J. F. WALTER. 'Aid yourself, and God will aid you,' Is a saying that I hold Should be written not in letters Wrought of silver or of gold, But upon our hearts be graven, A command from God in heaven, 'Tis the law of Him who made you- - Aid yourself and God will aid you. Aid yourself- -who will not labor All his wants of life to gain, But relies upon his neighbor, Finds that he relies in vain. Till you've done your utmost, never Ask a helping hand, nor ever Let the toilful man upbraid you- - Aid yourself and God will aid you. A d yourself- -you know the fable Of the wheel sunk in the road; How the carter was not able By his prayers to move the load, Till, urged by some more wise beholder, He move1 th- - wheel with lusty shuulder. Do your ovv work- -your Maker bade you- - Aid yourself *..u God will aid you. It is well to help a brother Of a sister when in need, But, believe me, there's another Not-to-be-forgotten creed. Better lore did never science Teach to man than self-reliance, 'Tis the law of Him who made you- - Aid yourself and God will aid you. Aid yourself, be not like ivy Clinging still to wall or tree, That can only rise by striving For support unceasingly. Rather be the oak, maintaining, Heart and branches self-sustaining; For this the ' Great Task-master ' made you. Aid yourself and God will aid you. The Moderator
