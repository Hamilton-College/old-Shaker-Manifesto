In Memoriam. In a message of encouragement to the young, given many years since in the name of Holy Mother Wisdom, describing the reception in heaven, of those who keep the gospel to the end of earth-life. She says, 'I will clothe you with garments brighter than the noonday sun ; then will I say to you, be joyful, your glory has but just begun.' Such is the distinction Wisdom confers on her children, through the life-long exercise and development of their wisdom. Elder Daniel's gospel was well expressed in a little melody learned when on a visit to Canterbury, and which always reminds me of him, perhaps because I first heard him sing it with that energy peculiar to his power of ministration. 'Lift up the standard, And let forgiveness flow, For the power of our gospel is love. Love for the erring, And love for the strong, Love that bears the burden All the way along.' I once heard him say concerning his youthful period of temptation and trial, that love held him to Believers till faith was formed. Combined with his lion-like courage and fortitude, was the gentleness of the lamb, and the kindness and mercy that forgave, without waiting to be solicited. He was firm as iron to uphold the standard of virgin purity, and strong to bear the burden of dutiful service, all the way along. And all this through his love for the cause, and for the people. His love and meekness were such that he could speak the truth in plainness, and leave only wounds that would heal, for the wounded could see the wisdom and necessity of the truth spoken, and feel that love held the rod. The race of life is great, and the ideal fair, but the many are whiffling and unsure. The hero is immovably centered to his highest ideal. A main difference between people, seems to be that one can come under obligation on which you can rely�is obligable� another is not. If he has not a law of rectitude within himself, there is nothing to hold him. This law within, is conscience, which imparts a sense of duty, of obligation to pursue a given course, because it is believed to be right, heeding not the selfish appeals of appetite, passion, changing moods, ambition, love or hate. It moves ever on its straight course to the Ideal it sees beyond. The primary idea of righteousness, includes rectitude, and a direct course upward. Such persons are the beams and pillars of society. Of such we say 'They bear acquaintance, we can always depend on them, and always find them at the post of duty.' Such a man was our beloved father Daniel. A person without conscience, has not arriven to human self-hood�has not risen above the animal plane, but is subject to the passions and appetites of the body. Conscientiousness lies on each side of the organ of firmness, forming as it were, the roots, that give to firmness a moral quality. Without conscience or reason for support, firmness becomes obstinacy and stubbornness. Firmness, guided by reason and sustained by conscience, often rises to the heroic and sublime, THE MANIFESTO. 43 which was a conspicuous trait in our departed Brother, claiming our love and admiration. Surrendering worldly ambition, he attained to the greatness of overcoming the world, and exhibited the highest qualities of heroism in the humble life of a virgin follower of Christ and Mother, rejoicing ever in the well-earned meed of a justified conscience, and the love and trust of God's people. 'No human mind, fertile in imagination as it is, can picture to its wildest fancy the overpowering and transcendant beauty of the progressed and elevated soul.' This is true of our departed Leader. There is no elevation he may not ascend even to the throne of God. There is no heaven he ma}T not cleave in his goings forth on those errands of mercy for which he has fitted himself, by a life of discipline in the service of God. The natural spirit control of the free circle, at the Boston Banner of Light, in replying to a question asked by one of our Brethren, said in substance, that they who have lived the pure, self-denying life of a Shaker, when they enter the spirit world, become messengers from the higher to lower spheres. If this be so, they must inhabit the higher, as we shall soon see by other testimony. According to numerous uncontradicted testimonies, spirits that inhabit the higher and purer heavens, are invisible to those below them, even as all spirits are invisible to mortal eyes. But those above can view those below them, and appear in their midst, by clothing themselves temporarily, with the elements of the inferior plane. But those inhabiting a lower sphere cannot ascend to the higher without a permit, as here, by trance or vision, till they travel to it, nor could they wish to remain there, till they have earned it. This harmonizes with w'hat the Apostle teaches of Christ, as having descended to the interior of earth, and then of having ascended above all heavens of natural spirits, capturing captivity and giving gifts to men. Jesus, the first born of many brethren, through his servant John, promises those who overcome and keep his works to the end, that they shall rule over nations, that they shall sit with him in his throne, which is a seaf of authority and judgment, or of kingship,�for he is king of kings, even as ne overcame and is set down with his Father in his throne, above all created heavens Then are their names called with him, 'The Word of God.' Our departed Elder has borne that word from early manhood till his exit from time. He has ever borne a testimony for God, and aginst the carnal life of the world. He is henceforth, a dispenser of the most precious things of God, of the priceless riches of Christ's kingdom, of the gifts, the graces and power of the Divine Spirit, to whomsoever will prepare himself to receive it.
