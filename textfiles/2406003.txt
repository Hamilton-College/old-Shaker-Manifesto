WELCOME TO JUNE. By Lucy S. Bowers. Beautiful and happy June time! Wondrous days of cheer ! With your brightness and your sweetness, With your fullness and completeness You are welcome here ! Welcome ! every opening blossom, Silver, gold and blue, Matchless pearl and rosy dresses, And the fragrance each possesses, Glad we are for you. From beyond the sapphire arches Come the sun's warm rays, And cold winter's crystal masses Metamorphosed into grasses Make these lovely days. And the merry birds of summer On their fluttering wings, From the early morning blushes Till the gentle evening hushes, Each a glad song sings. And the soft caressing zephyrsï¿½ Whence and whither they ? Laden without weight or measure 130 THE MANIFESTO. With the best of floral treasure Gathered on their way. Oh, I hear the distant ripple Of the meadow rill, Where the lamb its mother follows Over hills and into hollows Where the world is still. See the clouds of silver whiteness ; Watch the sun go down, View the silent midnight glories, Theme of new and olden stories, Earth's unfading crown. All these things fair June has brought us, Scattering far and near ; Then farewell hyemal brightness, Diamond glitter, snowy whiteness And your merry cheer. Every living, passing beauty Speaks so well to me, Tells me of our God in heaven By whose hand all gifts are given So abundantly. He who guides the passing seasons Loveth human souls, And his mercy He is sending, Light and peace and joy unending, And each life controls. Then let every grateful spirit Render ceaseless praise, For the bliss of life that fills them, For the power of good that thrills them Through these gladsome days. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
