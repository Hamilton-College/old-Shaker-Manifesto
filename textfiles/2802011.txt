Another month and a year will have expired since the first Canaanites migrated to the beautiful land of Connecticut. How strange, and yet how real! Once more the holidays have bid us adieu. Christmas was spent in a very pleasant manner. In the a. m. all Enfield attended Service at the Church. In the p. m. an entertainment was given at the North family in which the three families participated We have many blessings for which we need be thankful; one we should prize above all others, is the pure relationship we are called to sustain as Brethren and Sisters in Christ, in whose hearts dwell no envy, anger, nor strife, for this must be consumed by the love of God.
