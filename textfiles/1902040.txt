CHRIST AND WAR, [Contributed by D. C. Brainard.] Man unchristianized is more savage than wild beasts. Civilization without the gospel refines his methods of cruelty, but scarcely abates the passion itself. War is its phenomenal expression, its culmination. All forms of selfishness, robbery, oppression, injustice and savagery, lie back of and beneath and are contained in the spirit of war. In unorganized society, each man is a terror to his neighbor: next above this condition, tribe lurks to destroy tribe; then nations rush upon each other to rob and ruin. 'Whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence out of your lusts that war in your members? ' The seat of wars is in human depravity, in cruelty of heart, which can be changed only by our agency. Christ lives in all reforms within the heart and works out, and as hearts become benevolent and just, laws and customs change. The United States leads all other nations in opposition to war and all nature helps us in our endeavor. The Nation favors arbitration rather than force to adjust difficulties, because so many of our people accept in their hearts the spirit of Christ, which opposed and condemned violence. This spirit has already mitigated the evils of war and rendered them less frequent, but as yet, they are by no means cured. The greatest nations in Christendom are armed to the teeth and keep up a perpetual growl and menace toward one another and often rush at one another with the fury of demons. Two forces especially assist our nation to rescue the Old World from the terrors of war. The spirit of invention lias so increased the cost of armaments that war means bankruptcy. This force is constantly increasing and bids fair soon to be so vast that no people will be able to endure it. Since the year 1855, just upon the close of the Crimean war, up to 1887ï¿½a period of thirty-two years the army and navy of Great Britain cost nine hundred and twenty-five million. Eight hundred and fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty-five pounds sterling! Can. the mind of man grasp such a gigantic sum and contemplate it satisfactorily in all its bearings? Nearly $5,000,000,000! The other force comes from our rich soil and the ingenuity of our people in producing labor-sa\ing machinery. We are undermining the aristocracy of Europe by cheapening the rental values of their estates. Our bread and meat lift up the toiling millions and pull down the ruling lords and as the former come up and the latter come down, the ability, incentives and 'assions for war decrease. Feudalism and all forms of aristocracy are favorable to barbarous contests, but democracy logically desires peace. Tru^ democracy springs from the sentiment of human brotherhood and that is born of the Gospel, and of that only. Selected.
