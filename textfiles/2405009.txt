LOVE ONE ANOTHER. THE embodiment of Love is the royal road to success. It is the 'King's highway' to the holy City. It is the life principle that develops the true manhood and raises the man above the common elements that rest upon the earth. 'God is Love,'' and this certainly, should afford a legitimate stimulus for every person to obtain that which will in the ultimate make him godlike or like God. Without the gathering of this element of love, into the soul, there can be but little effort made for the advancement of others. The very life of self-denial must be drawn from that active principle of Love which stimulates us as we work for our own best interests, to work also for the happiness and prosperity of those who are around us. If God is Love how can it be possible for true sons and daughters to exist without a manifestation of the same spiritual elements ? Jesus was so fully absorbed in this theme that he made it a special lesson to those who accepted him as a Teacher. 'By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.' And he even went still farther than this as he gave his lessons of admonition to his disciples. Not only love those who love you, but said he, 'Love your enemies.' A test of this qualitv was an active work for God. In the life of estrangement which had been taken by man, there must have been a sad departure from that which was godlike. While nature stood first for a life on the earth and largely for the earth that was with man in common with everv other creature, it was the one ahsorbinotheme. The love for self began to be more anxiously caressed than was the love for God. Men loved the creature more than the Creator. Paul in his exhortation says that 'love endureth all things.' But as singular as it may seem it required a term of some 4000 years before an apostle was called who could speak this simple fact before the people. New lessons are not generally projected till the. mind is prepared to receive them. In that age when Might was held to be Right, and when brute force was the ruling passion, or even at a later date when humanity had advanced so far as to say, We will only demand an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, it would have been like striking against the air, to have asked the people to love their enemies as they loved themselves. They knew quite well what it was to hate their enemies and to inflict injuries upon them, and even to destroy their lives. But we are now living in a better age. A deeper love for humanity THE MANIFESTO. 113 is being manifested, and instead of having the story of one good Samaritan, they are now multiplied by the hundreds. The light that came into the world at an earlier date and the light that is spreading in the world to-day, is destined to accomplish most wonderful results. The disciples are in no doubt upon this subject. God can not be other than love, and God's love must rule the world. All outbursts of cruelty or of sensuality are from abnormal conditions, and although leading to the destruction jf persons and property, can never be the dominant power of the human race. The Christian life, so fully and beautifully manifested in the evangel of Jesus, was a light for the humanity of the whole world, and its influence to a greater or less degree has become universal. Through this light the brotherhood of man is being much better understood than in earlier times. To embrace this brotherhood and concede to all humanity the same rights and privileges that we enjoy so pleasantly for ourselves, is the only highway upon which the several nations can advance-with hopeful success, and even this is only preliminary to the life of Christ where the test is put directly at the front. 'By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one for another.' The lesson was so simple that it could be easily understood, and all could enter at once, into the formation of a new life. In this love for God, the life becomes illuminated and the Christian's duty is brought forward in all the clearness of the noonday All forms and protestations of goodness fade away like the mist before the sun, under this test of true discipleship. The same light that shone on the apostle must also shine upon us and enable us to testify with him : ï¿½'If we love not our brother whom we have seen, how can we love God whom we have not seen?'
