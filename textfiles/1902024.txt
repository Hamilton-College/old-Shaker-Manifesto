HEAVEN AND HELL. B. F. Bailey. [written for the Manifesto.] Said the Chrysanthemum to the Lotus bell,* 'Do yo:: believe in eternal hell?' Said the Lotus bell to the Chrysanthemum flower, 'Hell is in the present hour.' Said the Chrysanthemum with perennial pride, 'Is not heaven then by our side?' 'Oh! yes, indeed,'�the answer came� 'Heaven is with us just the same.' 'But, like the northern polar star� With its antipodal friendsf afar� * The Egyptian Lotus is bell shaped, Vide Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. t The four stars of the southern cross. Points with unerring solid worth, Their axis meets within the earth.' 'Why, then they surely are both right here !' Said the Chrysanthemum with pallid fear. 'As near to us'�the Lotus said� 'As selfishness, and passion red.' 'As self-denying holy lives, As self control; Heaven always strives With cruel wrong in its haughty might, And ready, aids to conquer, the peaceful right.' North Cambridge, Mass.
