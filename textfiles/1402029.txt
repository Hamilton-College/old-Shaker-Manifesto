Extra cloth, 50 cents; half Russia, red^dges, 65 cents. No other name has received such universal homage as that of Washington. Edward Everett spoke but the verdict of the world when he pronounced Washington, 'of all the men that ever lived, the greatest of good men, and the best of great men.' Frederick the Great, whose own name ranks with those of Alexander, Csesar, and Napoleon, declared his deeds to be ' the most brilliant of any in the annals of military achievement.' Whether as schoolboy, surveyor-boy, Indian fighter, member of Congress, Commander-in-Chief, or President, his life was full of striking incident, and ever an example to thrill and inspire any youth whose heart pulsates with the free and vigorous blood of the Anglo-Saxon race. Mr. Thayer, the author of the present work, just published, has proved by his world-famous lives of Lincoln, ' From Pioneer Home to the White House.' and of Garfield, ' From Log Cabin to the White House,' a writer whose pen is wondoi'fully suited to its theme. II' writes with an enthusiasm worthy of his subject; with vividl}1 drawn pictures of the times and scenes through which Washington passed, quoting the language of his friends and contemporaries, and crowding the pages with appropriate illustrative anecdotes, he makes the times and the characters seem present realities to the reader. His book will at once be aecepted as one of the best of the lives of Washington, not for young people only, but for older folks as well. It is not sold by dealers, but only direct by the publisher, who will send a 100-page descriptive catalogue of his attractive and famously cheap publicatious free on request. John B.
