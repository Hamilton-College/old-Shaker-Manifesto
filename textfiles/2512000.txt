PASSING AWAY. By Catherine Allen. A NOTHER year is wrapping itself in burial garments and soon will have JT\_ gone to slumber in 'Time's ancient sepulchre;'that unknown and measureless period called the Past. Another chapter in the history of the universe has been written, and, on the memory chambers of each individual soul are indellibly impressed the griefs and joys, the struggles and conquests, and those deep interior feelings, which like the subteranean stream, bear no outward tokens of their coursings. But there is an Eye that pierceth unto the deepest caverns of the heart; an Ear that hearest the faintest whispering of the soul; and there is a judgment seat whereunto the inmost thoughts and motives shall be brought. But God's justice is tempered with his mercy an d souls who know his love can feel no fear. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
