A Connecticut farmer mixes a teaspoon of cayenne... A Connecticut farmer mixes a teaspoonf ul of cayenne or red pepper with the food of his hens, which causes them to lay more eggs. In six months a flock of twenty-six hens laid 2,025 eggs, or an average of 111-6 per day. On two occasions when by the omission of pepper the daily product was 9, the use of that spice brought up the number to 13 or more a day. The fowls were fed on corn-meal in the morning and oats at night.
