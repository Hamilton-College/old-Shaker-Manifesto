Watervliet, Ohio. Feb. 1893. It has been some time since our Society has appeared in 'Home Notes.' We will try and be more prompt in the future. Have had an extremely cold winter thus far; 14 degrees below Zero. Had good sleighing for nearly two weeks but the snow is all gone and rain has taken its place, which we need very much to fill the cisterns. The weather was so severe that we could not do more than the needful chores. We had a very nice Christmas. Santa Claus came in grand style. We received some presents, and withal a couple of nice fat turkeys for dinner. The dining room was decorated with evergreens, and light, ed candles were placed around the room. Some of the Brethren arose early on Christmas morning and greeted the family with a beautiful song entitled, 'Christmas Greeting.' We are now hauling our wheat to market for which we are receiving 70 cts., per bushel. This Community owns a flock of 83 sheep, and 15 lambs. //. W. Fredrick.
