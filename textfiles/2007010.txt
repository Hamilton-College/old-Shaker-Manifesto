TESTIMONIES. Patience Crouch of Harvard, Mass., says, 'I was fifteen years of age when I received faith in the testimony of Mother Ann and the Elders. The first time that I attended divine service with them at the Square House, I heard Father James say, You must love God with all your heart, might, mind and strength. At another time Mother Ann informed me that when she lived in the wilderness at Watervliet, she aided the Brethren all she could while they cleared the land. I gained a deep love for Mother, and yet I feared her, for she was filled with indignation against all evil, and I knew she could see me through and through.' Father James remarked ;� 'No one will find fault with the way of God who is in it, while some will find fault and complain, who have never taken one step toward God.' In a discourse before the people he said, '-Never attempt to build up that which we have pulled down. You may build up the NewT Creation, but not the old creation.' To those who were called to be laborers, he said, 'Be careful and keep humble when you meet with that which is unpleasant. Labor to be governed by the spirit of Christ. Remember that unless you have the spirit of Christ, you cannot do them any good. Be what you seem to be, and seem to be what you really are ;�do not carry two faces.'
