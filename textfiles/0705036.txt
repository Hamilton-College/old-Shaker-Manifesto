Shaker doctrine Shaker Doctrine. Any one who desires to know precisely what the Shaker doctrine is, should procure and read a copy of a neat little pamphlet written by Elder George Albert Lomas, and printed at the office of The Shaker, Shakers, N. Y. The title of this pamphlet is, ' What Shall I do to be a Shaker? or Plain Talks upon, Practical Religion, being Answers to Earnest Inquirers.' It is a curious production, and gives a better idea of the teachings of those peculiar people, than can be elsewhere obtained in the same compass. Albany Evening Times.
