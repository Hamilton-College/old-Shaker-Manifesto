NOT BY OBSERVATION MARCIA HASTINGS 'The kingdom of God cometh not by observation.' By observation, we lave found this to be true. Persons do lot receive the baptism of the holy spirit immediately and exclusively through the intellect It reaches first n its validity the soul, and there begins ts operation. The intellect may and should be a power to weigh the consistency of all tenets of religion which the spirit accepts; but seldom, if ever, does it supersede the soul's feeling ; the nonreasoning, absorbent, faculty of intuition. Reason may sit as judge to determine the efficacy of bias in conscience ; regulate the enthusiasm that commonly attends newly received truths, and help to sift the manifestation thereof. But whoever depends on intellect alone for conviction and conversion, will wait long before the illumination manifests itself to effect the new birth. When the testimony of cleansing truth shall reach a sincere seeker after righteousness—a soul sick of sin and weary of the dominance of animal appetites—groping in human blindness, and intently desiring emancipation, then that soul will hardly stop for logic or nice points in argument; yet may profitablv obey the injunction to 'try the spirit,' and the witness will appear ; will be unmistakably felt, that the kingdom of God is within reach. 'If ye do the works, then shall ye know of the doctrine ; ' and if ye will accept the testimony of those who confidently report from experience, this rich knowledge, and confirmation, happy will ye be in finding yourselves in a way to possess the pearl of great price, the inheritance of righteousness, 'the kingdom of God which cometh not by observation.'

Bashfulness is more frequently connected with good sense, than we find assurance; and impudence, on the other hand, is often themere effect of downright stupidity.
