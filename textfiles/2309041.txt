TO-DAY. 'Exhort one another daily, while it is called To-day.'ï¿½Heb. iii., 13. Canterbury, N. H. 1890. No time like today for thine own, Today for thy cross and thy crown; Today may the victories won Establish thy feet in God's way. Today tho' the vintage may fail, And answer to pray'r seem to wait, Still let thy faith cheer thee today, God's blessings can never be late.
