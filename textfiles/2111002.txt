The union, love and kindred friendship was enhanced many fold. In support of the allusion made to the necessity of keeping the World's Fair open on Sunday, we would add that, although invitations had been freely extended to all the families of the Society since Thursday, and we had entertained successive companies from that time up to 4 P. M. on Saturday, still on Sunday P. M. we had in every sense the fullest and richest gathering, in the presence of the Elders of the Church Family, our venerated Trustees, and other faithful burden bearers, whose pressing duties on previous davs had prevented their attendance. And this is a Christian Community, where love is the only incentive to labor and a ''United Inheritance' in all the blessings of life, the recompense. No wage-slavery,�no task-masters, no monopolists ; yet even under this beautiful, free, industrial system, not until the Sunday could they participate in that which, as they feelingly expressed, '�would have caused life-long regrets to have missed.' Br. Daniel Offord, who is ever alive to the interests of the laborer, asked for the tenants on our farms to have an opportunity. They came through his invitation, much to our gratification and their happiness.' Sincerely, Your gospel Sister, Anna White.
