'CHARITY THINKETH NO EVIL.' AMELIA J. CALVER. Blest Charity is e'er inclined, To view with loving eye; Nor seeks to move Time's drapery, A blemish to descry. For life with all its battle grounds Its fearful odds of fate, Gives each its measurement of grief, Its cares of burd'ning weight. O we are blind to spirit strife! Its conflicts cannot know, Nor trace the winding labyrinths Where some sore feet must go, To meet upon the road of life, Companions of the way, Who found an easier pathway up; Nor met so much delay. Too apt are we of finite gaze, To measure by one span; And credit due oft lies beneath The weight of Censure's ban. But when we drop this mortal coil And rise to higher spheres, The stature we've attained by toil In bold relief appears. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
