NOTHING TO DO. Nothing to do ! O folded hands ! Why will ye lie so white and fair? When the busy world on every side Calls for thy labor, thy earnest care. Nothing to do ! there are tired feet Walking with thee life's weary road; Show them the way in path so sweet That leads to Heaven, that leads to God. Nothing to do, but live in ease When thousands fall on every side, You might have helped to bear the pain, And breast the swift and rushing tide. Nothing to do ! thy days are light, With golden eves and sunny morns You gather flowers, fresh and bright, Some are tortured with cruel thorns. Nothing to do ! what will you say When the Lord of the harvest asks of you 'What gleanest thou in my field to-day?' 'Lord, there was nothing for me to do!' Ella D. Chapman
