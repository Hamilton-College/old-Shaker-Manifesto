The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann. Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 6. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Rewritten by Henry C. Blinn. *' Ax one time I was severely bruised by being dragged from the house by wicked men, and forced into a rude cart. They then drove through several o the streets, and across the lots, and allowed me to be shamefully abused by the people who threw mud and filth at me till we arrived at the court house. The court was in session and I was taken before the judges who gave me the liberty to speak my faith unmolested. The case was then dismissed. ' ' Sometimes the mobs would throw stones in at the windows, and disturb the worship, and often put the family to much cost and trouble.' At one time an attempt was made to seize Mother Ann and the principal members of the Society while they were engaged in the worship of God, that they might have a lawful pretence to punish ihem for breaking the Sabbath. For this purpose several church officers and spies had been placed in the streets as watchmen, under the plea of more carefully guarding the Sabbath. Mother Ann being forewarned of God, had sent Father William out of the town, early m the morning. The Believers assembled and began their worship, which was attended with a manifestation of the power of God. The report was heard, the rumor spread and anti-christ was roused. It was at the time of the morning service, and several of the church officers came with a strong party to seize the offenders. Mother Ann and her little family were worshiping God in the upper part of the house. The mob surrounded the place, burst open the doors, ascended the stairs and seized all the company, but were greatly disappointed iu not finding William Lee. A search was made but it did not prove successful. Mary Hocknell was closely interrogated and threatened by the mob, to make her tell where William Lee could be found, but she refused to answer. After being shamefully abused she was taken before the officers of the church. Here she was again examined, threatened, coaxed, nattered, and money offered to her, but all in vain. Escaping from her persecutors, Mary returned to the family. Mother Ann and those who were with her, were convened to the prison, where they continued to sing and shout and glorify God, so as to be heard at a great distance. The next morning they were all released, except Mother Ann and John Lee. These were taken to another prison and kept in confinement for several weeks. Mary Hocknell frequently carried food and articles of clothing to them. In this prison Mother Ann received the revelations of God. Deep and important mysteries were revealed to her, and by the power and authority of the Holy Spirit, she was commissioned to lead the Society. When she was released from this imprisonment, she took Mary Hocknell with her, collected the Society together and opened her revelations with the most astonishing power of God. All admitted that the candle of the Lord was in her hand, and that she was able, by the light thereof, to search every heart and try every soul. From this time Mother Ann took charge of the Society and was received and acknowledged as the first pillar of the church of God on earth. Manifestations of the Spirit of God through Mother Ann. Those who heard the testimony of Ann Lee and learned of the heart searching power of her spirit, admitted that she was an eminent witness of the work of God. 'Her words were like flames of fire, and her voice like peals of thunder !' Well said the prophet, 'Who shall abide the day of his (Christ's) coming? For it is like a refiner's fire and like fuller's soap. ' ' The Lord who brought me over the great waters, ' said Mother Ann, 'has redeemed my soul. I hear the angels sing ; I see the glory of God, as the sun in its brightness; I see souls coming into the first resurrection. ' 'The work of God will grow more and more into a work of spiritual discipline, and so exact and so straight, that if you willfully depart in the least from the way, you will be lost.' Mother Ann and the Elders abounded in visions, prophecies, and revelations. These were administered to those that embraced the testimony. They were given to strengthen, confirm, and establish the faith which the people had received, and were preparatory to the substance which was to follow. These gifts were numerous and at that time very important, yet being for the most part, mere outward signs and operations, they were considered of secondary importance, because they could not, oi themselves, accomplish the real work oi redemption. In proportion as the people entered into the more enduring substance of the gospel, these outward gifts became less and less necessary for them. On the return of Mother Ann from her imprisonment in Poughkeepsie, she spoke to the Believers as follows,� ' You are called in relation to the rest of mankind, and through your faith and obedience, they must receive the gospel. Sorrow and suffering will never cease in the church, till all souls have heard the gospel of salvation. This will be offered freely to every one, and will be a savor of life unto life or of death unto death.' ' This testimony of Christ will overcome all nations. It will increase and mankind will see the decayed foundation of anti-christ's kingdom. God will draw the line between the righteous and the unrighteous. Fear not, neither be afraid, for God will deliver his people.' 'Some among you may think that you will yet subdue and overcome the nations of the earth, but you are mistaken. They have that work to do for themselves. They will contend with each other, until they become so humble that they will be willing to receive the gospel of Jesus Christ. They may build up, but God will pull down. They may build upon a false foundation, but God will pull down, until they can build no more ; but yeu can have nothing to do with it.' '' After I have closed my work in this world, there will be a great increase of the gospel. It will be as with &amp; man who begins with the world and accumulates an interest. At his death he leaves his interest with those who will improve upon it and gather more.' �' The time will come when the church will be gathered into order, but not till after my decease. The wisdom and knowledge and light of God will increase in the church till Zion travels to her full glory. Joseph Meacham will be a father to all the Believers in America, for God has called and anointed him for that place. When the ministration of those who came from England, closes, then you will see peaceable times. Then you can worship God under your own vines and fig trees, and none of the wicked shall make you afraid. Then you will not need to teach one another to know the Lord, for all the faithful will know Him.' At the expiration of eight years the testimony closed, and then the persecution ceased. The Believers were able to worship God, unmolested, in their several places appointed for that purpose. Coming to America. In referring to the passage to America, Mother Ann remarked, 'It was revealed to me that I must come over to New England. A meeting was appointed for the occasion. Many gifts were presented in confirmation of our coming, as prophecies, revelations, visions and dreams. In the zeal of the meeting, a great deal of patience had to be exercised, in waiting for each other to manifest their gifts. It was a joyful meeting and continued for several hours.

He found one that was said to be con- �f [For a more extended account of this voyage, see the little pamphlet, 'Life of Mother Ann.' Price ten cents. ] ''
