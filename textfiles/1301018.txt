PRAYER ANDREW BARRET [sic.] AH prayer must be the voicings of the soul's unquenchable desires, the motives of our lives being summed up in our Teachings and longing toward a higher power and intelligence than our own. Whatever effect other things may have on the individual, true prayer elevates those who pray. I pray for divine aid and divine thingsâ€”for the help of the Divine Spirit to develop within me that understanding and wisdom which will direct me aright. My prayer is sincere if it represents my true wishes. If I open the windows of my soul and allow the pure light of heaven to rush in, it will drive out the darkness. While in the attitude of prayer I breathe in God's eternal love. The old idea of prayer was, that God could be dissuaded from doing evil unto his creatures, if they curried his favor. The new idea of prayer is that God helps those who help .themselves, and that we must co-operate with the Divine Spirit, otherwise we may not receive the Divine blessing. Prayer should embody the will to act as occasions otfer; our prayer must be in our lives. If a brother, sister or neighbor needs a helping hand, extend it, do what lies in our power; in that way a tide of sympathy goes forth that is felt by the individual to be lasting. It is not what we give, but how we give it; not the words we use, but the spirit of our words. Is there not a beautiful thought con- nected with prayer for the dead ? Were it not sad to feel that when our loved ones pass away, they are wholly separated from us ? Through prayer we may still hold communion with them ; by the spirit of prayer we may gather the inspiration and clothe ourselves with the mantle they were clothed with. In blessing them we receive their blessing. Let us pay a tribute to our ascended Christian friends, by identifying our lives more and more with the heavenly principles that they held dealer than life. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
