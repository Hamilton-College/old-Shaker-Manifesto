Not as Protestants alone, but as American citizens... Not as Protestants alone, but as American citizens, sincerely desiring the preservation of our institutions under the protection of an advancing intelligence, and with no regard to any sectarian ends, we are to day called upon to settle the vital question of the perpetuity of our free school system, and to ' denounce as a crime against liberty and Republican institutions, any project for a sectarian division or perversion of the school fund of the State.' Let it be done. Baptist Weekly.
