THE GOSPEL. HENRY B. BEAR. What is the gospel ? It is written ; 'The gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.' Horn, i., 16. I would add, believeth the gospel correctly, and obeyeth it conscientiously. We might also inquire,ï¿½What is salvation ? To be saved from sin and condemnation. In other words, to be raised to a state of happiness. If we are brought down to a state of unhappiness by whomsoever, or by whatever means, then the gospel has not saved us. Full salvation must guarantee constant happiness. It must not depend upon the actions of other persons, or on circumstances not of our own creating. If the actions of others changes our happiness to a state of unhappiness, then, certainly, we are under the power of those that can change our condition. We are not yet made free by the power of the gospel. We cannot, by the power of the gospel, change the disposition of another to harass and afflict us. If not, where is our remedy to become free from that power which we cannot control, and which robs us of our crown of happiness? It must, nevertheless, be in the gospel. The only way to become free, is to get a correct knowledge of the gospel, and render a strict obedience to its requirements and teachings, and so learn to take no offence from any one, nor unhappiness from any circumstance whatever. Be reconciled to all conditions ; believing that all things will work together for good to them that love God. This seems to be a gospel saving and a happy foundation on which there can be no disappointment, and which secures*1 our uninterrupted happiness. I cannot see how we can retain an independent gospel power upon any other foundation, to save us from unhappy conditions. Are we asked to do a favor? What is our duty in that case? We would agree that the gospel demands it as a duty, to do the favor. When done, what then ? Jesus gives the answer, ''When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants ; we -have done that which was our duty to do.' Luke xvii., 10. Nothing more. We have not made the recipient indebted to us by doing the favor, because the gospel demands that it should be done. Whenever we expect a favor returned, we put ourselves outside of gospel power to save us from disappointment and consequent unhappiness. We lay the foundation by which we may be disappointed. All are free-agents, and may return a favor or not, as they may choose. We know from experience, that some do not choose to make a return for favors received. Therefore, let us do the kindness expecting nothing, we are then on the safe side. The prayer of Jesus while on the cross, teaches in all meekness that he took no offence under any circumstance whatever when he prayed that God would forgive his persecutors, 'for they know not what they do.' Let us do likewise, believing that those who give cause for offence, know not to a fullness what they do. 'The promise of Jesus is that he will send his angels and they shall gath- er out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.' Let us consider whether taking offence, does not also offend. Many expect to get into a place of happiness hereafter, although they may have tribulation, care, sorrow and trouble enough to keep them in a state of misery all through their life. They think this state will be changed at once, upon entering the spirit world, and that they will be received into a place where happiness reigns. Such will, no doubt, be sadly disappointed. Happiness is only obtainable by labor and perseverance in obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The gift of God for our redemption, was, in sending his Son to live a redeeming life, and leave it upon record, that we may learn how to repeat his life, and to follow his example. If his life brought redemption to his soul, the same life will have the same effect to redeem us from unhappiness, in the present, as well as in the future. If we wish to enjoy true happiness, we must learn how to gain and how to keep it; otherwise, we may forever be without it. White Water, Ohio.
