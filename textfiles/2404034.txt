SELF. By Alonzo G. Hollister. I HAD a revelation this morning. It is, that the mark of the Beast in the forehead and in the right hand, is self. This is a concentrated definition, and is not so stiff nor uncertain in its application, especially when applied by the individual solely to his ego, and not to some foreign, and in nowise related object, past or present. I have suffered during the year past, from that slavery to selfish interests into which I voluntarily entered and now earnestly desire to cast off. Hence the sight is given and conviction is complete. It has one more merit,ï¿½this definition provokes no argument, nor offense. According to St. John, Christ is a substance with quality that can be heard, seen, and handled. Therefore, as he came to manifest obedience as the fulfilling of the law, and as obedience is perfect only where love prompts it, Jesus Christ was the esse of obedience. Therefore Obedience is the end in view, the Pearl of great price, for which he gave all himself to establish in place of disobedience, which was the first sin, and sin every time. Adam was disobedience ; Christ was obedience. This may be old and not very ingenious, but it is healthy to see it that way, if one is strongly attracted by the character of Jesus or of Ann Lee. It does not lead the mind off into speculation and intellectual madness. When a man begins to bear his cross against his animal propensities, he has an increased flow of blood to his head, and consequently greater intellectual activity. What is there to prevent madness, or a return to animal propensity, unless he can make the blood course powerfully through his heart and near the seat of life, until his heart becomes enlarged, and actively compassionate ? Again, how can the mind apprehend, or the hand convey light, or truth, or the fruits of suffering that it has not seen nor experienced? Who shall set himself up as a leader, who never learned to serve, or as a Messiah, who is not at peace with his own conscience ? I am writing with a certain periodical under my note paper, which may account in part for this current of thought. At one time I was inclined to subscribe, but the spirit of contention was palpable all over and through it, as against every thing beneath God Himself. The energy was spread over so vast a field, it would almost make a man forget that he had a vine or figtree of his own to cultivate. Neither have I been able to discover the little child that was to lead or subdue all those ugly beasts. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
