GRATITUDE. Martha J. Anderson Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.. 1. O Lord! my heart cannot forget, Thy tender love and watchful care, 2. How sweetly through my bing thrills, A pwer that lifts from doubt and gloom, 3. I tread the hallowed walks of life, With faith immortal glowing clear, Wheree'er I turn, my eyes are met With fruits of answered trustful prayer; A Christ-like element distills, And resurrects from nature's tomb; It lifts the vail through all the strife, And brings a glorious future near; As mounts the lark at early morn, To tune its joyous matin lays, As living germs of plant and flower, Upspringing from the darksome sod, Like sunset gleams across the sky, Redemption's laws lume grand and bright So shall my spirit upward borne, Pour forth a song of grateful praise. Respond to gentle dew and shower, So breathes my soul in love to God. Their work perfective draweth nigh, When souls shall dwell within their light.
