Golden thoughts Golden Thoughts. â€” Buddha said: 'A man who foolishly does me wrong (or regards me as being or doing wrong), I will return to him the protection of my ungrudging love. The more evil goes from him, the more good shall go from me; the fragrance of these good actions always redounding to me, the harm of the slanderous words returning to him.'
