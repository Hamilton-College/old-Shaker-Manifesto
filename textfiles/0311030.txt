SACRIFICE O Zion, thou beautiful city of God ! What off'ring will win in thy courts an abode ? A heart that is chasten'd and sick of its sin,â€” Will that at thine altar the precious boon win ? Ah, yea! if thy vineyards and orchards so fair, And gold-waving harvests, the needy may share; If they will but sacrifice all that is vain, To them shall the hundred-fold blessing remain. Thy order and beauty the angels have wrought; To thee shall earth's treasures in fullness be brought; Of gifts and of sacrifice, choicest shall be Prom souls consecrated to true purity. Then, come to the waters, so cleansing and clear; The angels are troubling them, come without fear; For God's power is able the heart to sustain That lays down its life, Life Eternal to gain. Maria Witham, Enfield, Conn.
