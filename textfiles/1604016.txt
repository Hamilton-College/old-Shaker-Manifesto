FATHER AND MOTHER. CHAUNCY DIBBLE. How lovely and consistent is the order of Father and Mother in Deity in contrast with the ideal Gods who dispense justice regardless of mercy or merit. Who engage in strife to favor party or sect, and suffer a great portion of the human race to perish. Those characteristics popularly held forth from the pulpits is a relic of ignorance and is anything but lovely. The thought that the spirit world is mostly one great chaos with only one heaven at one end and an enormous h-11 at the other extreme where sinners are hurried instantly on their exit thither. All this is inconsistent with the character of parental love manifested by our Savior. It was not in his heart, and as to creed, he had none. His Father was love and peace, who abhorred haughtiness and tyranny. His was the principle of equality to all, constituting all one great family linked by the eternal ties of affection. God manifested in the mother as well as father. How necessary to complete the order of things in heaven and earth. Christ in the male order as father and in the female as mother. In union forming a heaven of happiness. This does not rob Christ but adds to the majesty and beauty of the plan. The female mission is to usher in and inaugurate the family of Christ in the true spirit of parental love. Jesus had no home or where to lay his head because the kingdom of heaven had not yet come upon earth. He prophesied that a Comforter should come to reveal the order of God's house. Who is this nysterious Comforter but the Mother spirit. The revelation of truth through he female has brought to light a plan )j which man and woman may be restored to primitive innocence, may live as pure as the angels. Woman is to be the redeemer of her ^ace in that degree that she was instrumental in its fall; to stand upon an qual footing with man, possessing the inherent right to keep her body and spirit free from contamination. This is the power by which Society is to be renovated. She must needs have a voice in all the parts and wheels of human progress ; in the counsels of the nation ; in moral truth and in the character of literature. Her influence must have weight for she is a part and segment of the great wheel which must be kept moviug until all war, impurity and selfishness are ruled out and all error shall flee. Here then is the kingdom of heaven and the fires of hï¿½II are put out. O ! the heights and depths of a Father's and Mother's love, forgiving to the uttermost, unwilling that one soul formed in their image should perish. Watervliet, N. Y.
