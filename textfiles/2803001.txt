MARCH. By Martha J. Anderson. The March winds are soughing and sighing Like the roar of the murmuring sea, And the icy-armed kings of the forest Engage in a harmless melee. While flashing and dashing, and clashing Like steeds that are heard from afar; Loud the trump of the wind god is blowing The blast of the last wintry war. Like billows the dark clouds are rising Far south of the mist-shrouded sun, Whose halo crowned disk is apprising That Vulcan's storm reign has begun. The chains of the frost king are breaking, And icy gorged river tides swell, While mighty floods compass the lowlands Where many in peaceful homes dwell. As we list to the surging of waters That rush through the rocky ravine, And gaze with delight on the frost work That forms a most beautiful sheen, THE MANIFESTO. Wl 'Where the spray molds in stalactite crystals The stone hedged and turreted glen, We think not that sorrow is shading The flood destroyed dwellings of men. The tempest so fitful and wrathful That sweeps like a besom of war O'er woodless expanse of the prairies 'That stretch to the westward afar ; Is broken by bulwark of mountains That circle our hill-side retreat, And so the strong force of the wind god Is subject to hopeless defeat. The weather wise prophets well argued And true their predictions have proved, For winter all stern and relentless Along a strange pathway has moved. There are snows piled where skies are the warmest, And blizzards on Britain's fair strand, While earthquake and tide-wave upheaving Have past o'er the sea and the laud. There are sleet storms and rain storms with thunder And lightning's electric display Then mercury far below zero, Such changes are markt day by day. But March, bitter March is now dying, His requiem gladly we'll sing, When drops the dark pall o'er his presence And bright April heralds the spring. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
