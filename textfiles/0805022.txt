EDITORIAL NOTES A SHAKER SERMON Henry Ward Beecher, in our hearing, preached a full-toned Shaker sermon in one complete sentence: 'As followers of Christ, we have no right to do that 117 118 THIG SHAKEE MIAJNTEFESTO. which the Master never did.' This is as well as we could preach ourselves, and we therefore say liAmen!' to it; asking all professors of Christianity to examine themselves, and see, if they are engaging in any practice in life, that finds no sanction in the life practices oi Jesus—the master. CHURCH AND STATE We object to the apparent junction oi Church and State, illustrated on the new silver dollar in the words : 'In God we trust.' The name of no one's religious God should be so desecrated. We propose an amendment that would answer more truthfully, and aid in keeping the Church superior to State control ; Let that word '' God' be made to read 'Gold;' and then let 'Silver' be added. We think the gods of gold and silver have immense congregations of devotees—idolaters.
