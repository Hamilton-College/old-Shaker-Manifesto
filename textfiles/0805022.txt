CHURCH AND STATE We object to the apparent junction oi Church and State, illustrated on the new silver dollar in the words : 'In God we trust.' The name of no one's religious God should be so desecrated. We propose an amendment that would answer more truthfully, and aid in keeping the Church superior to State control ; Let that word '' God' be made to read 'Gold;' and then let 'Silver' be added. We think the gods of gold and silver have immense congregations of devoteesâ€”idolaters.
