Frederick W. Evans, Dear Sir:--I learned from the report... Zolliken, Zurich, Switzerland. Aug. 7, 1891. Frederick W. Evans, Dear Sir :ï¿½ I learn from the report of the second International Congress, London, 1890, that your little Community is based upon the principles of vegetarianism, adopted by you for its conformity with your religious and scientific persuasion. Now, it is the intention of myself and some friends of mine, all adherents to the doctrines of Jesus Christ and the natural diet of fruit and vegetables, to reform both our spiritual and bodily lives, as much as we can. We are young men about twenty-five years old, and occupied, hitherto, in commercial and official affairs: but, bred in the country and acquainted with country life and rural occupation, we have studied besides, theoretically, the best methods of growing fruit and vegetables at a profit. So, we mean to retire from town, where it is so very difficult to make any progress in the sanctification of the soul, and the improvement of our health, and to take our residences in the country, growing all we want by cultivating the soil and establishing our lives on the basis of brotherhood, after the model given by the first Christians and being described in the second and fourth chapters of the Acts of the Apostles. We know that there are many doubts as to our aptitude for such an enterprise; we are even fully aware that our character is by no means developed enough to equal the glorious example of the first Christians. But our aims are pure and we will earnestly endeavor to proceed in sanctification and education, as well of ourselves as of our families ; and Jesus Christ being ever before our eyes, his holy example inciting us, day by day, to shape our lives after his own, could it be too bold to hope that our endeavors would succeed, at least more than in our present circumstances? So we wish soon to be able to let you know of the starting of our settlement ; and as your principles seem to be the same as ours, we should be very happy indeed if there could be established more intimate connections between you and us, in order to help each other in all aspirations tending to improve mankind, and to secure a flourishing and blessed state of our communities. We are not likely to begin our reform before the lapse of some years : nevertheless, I should be very thankful to already enter into relations with you and the families of your village, and to profit as much as possible by your experience and knowledge. You will oblige me very much by letting me know the statutes, principles and administrative views upon which you arrange your external affairs. As to our respective religious persuasions, I do not know whether they are the same or not; but I can scarcely imagine that the difference, if there be any at all, is very great. Perhaps you will let me know the title of some book wherein I may find all the details in this respect. Hoping to be favored with a kind reply, I remain, dear sir, Yours fraternally, Friedr. Fellenberg.
