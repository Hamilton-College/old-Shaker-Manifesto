We take an unchanging interest in The Manifesto... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Feb. 1889. We take an unchanging interest in The Manifesto, and always read it. Hope it will continue to sparkle with gems of truth and be the white-winged messenger of purity, peace and salvation, to those who are seeking for the higher life and light. With kindly greetings, M. J. Anderson.
