Sabbathday Lake, Me. May, 1899. On this beautiful Sabbath morning everything is smiling, for Nature is fully awake having taken a long sleep and now she is busy renewing her robes of verdure and in like manner the inmates of our home are making ready for the coming seasons; preparing gardens, etc. Brother Washington Jones is at work among us in the fruit business, setting out trees and raspberry bushes, also assisting the Sisters in setting out a new strawberry bed of over 1500 plants. We find in him a faithful, interested worker, and although his tarry with us be long or 92 THE JvANIFES TO. short he has reared monuments of good- j will in the trees and vines which he has planted for our future benefit. The flowers, too, form an important industry. The Sisters have a large piece already planted to sweet peas, which, with favorable weather, we hope will yield an abundance of bloom. Later the seedlings asters, pansies, verbenas etc. which wrere planted in March in the greenhouse will be placed in the ground. The tomato business is pushing, and orders for the plants come in thick and fast. Luckily Brother Delmer Wilson has enough to supply the demand, that is, if the orders do not exceed over eleven hundred dozen. Brothers Chellis Wing and John Dorrington are busy planting early vegetables for market and home use. Brother Pliny Worcester is filling Brother Thomas Noyes' place in providing wood etc. for the cooks, and last but not least our good faithful Elder William Dumont has been assisting the Bicker Bros, in running the lines between the farms. The summer term of school is in progress with twelve pupils. Ada S. Gummings.
