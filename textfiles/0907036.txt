For the Boys A certain man, who is very rich now, was very poor when he was a boy. When asked how he got his riches, he said: ' My father taught me never to play till my work was finished, and never to spend my money until I had earned it. If I had but an hour's work in the day, I must do that the first thing, and in an hour. And after this I was allowed to play; and then I could play with much more pleasure than if I had the thought of an unfinished task before my mind. I early formed the habit of doing every thing in time, and it soon became easy to do so. It is to this I owe my prosperity.'
