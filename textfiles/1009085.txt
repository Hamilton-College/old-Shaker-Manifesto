Rich Men .'—The following is from a recent sermon delivered by Dr. Beecher : ' A man that has become so rich that he don't want to associate any more with those he has been intimate with is in a bad way. He thinks himself too cultured, but the proper way to spell that kind of culture is c-o-n-c-e-i-t. Some men get too good to associate with their fellows. They are so good, so confoundedly good—(laughter)—that they don't want to meet men that are not so ood. For them, nobody prays as they ought, nobody preaches as they ought. They thank God that they are not as other men are, and all the other men thank God that it is so too. (Laughter.) There is a tendency in riches to pamper a man's pride, for with prosperity comes power and a tendency of self will; of this the Scripture says: Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope (they didn't pay compliments in ^hose days)— more hope of a fool than of him.'
