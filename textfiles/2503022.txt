Alfred., Me. Feb. 1895. Time well improved does not move with 'leaden wings.' We were so busy at the time that Home Notes should have been written that the day passed by before we were aware of it. It is true there was not much to write about. We have completed the ice-harvest and the wood-pile in the door yard is steadily growing larger. The weather is very mild. Candlemas day was overcast, with no sun to make a shadow for the badger or woodchuck to scare him back into his hole and according to the good old sign the worst of the winter had passed. But we have to learn that all signs fail sometimes as this one did. Tuesday the 4th was a stormy day and Wednesday was stormy, more stormy, most stormy, with the ther. at 16 below zero in the morning, 7 deg. at noon and 8 deg. at evening, with a wind that could well be called a blizzard. Fires in some of the cellars became necessary to save vegetables1. After reading the accounts in the papers we still think Maine a good place to live. We can hardly say as they do at the North family, Mt. Lebanon, that we have been free from colds because we are not strictly vegetarians, although we yet hope to be. No one has been confined to the house long. Our term of school, 14 weeks, will soon close. The change from the district to the town system adds somewhat to our school term. Our Ministry go to New Gloucester the 15th inst., having tarried with us eight weeks. May health and prosperity attend them. Let not the standard be lowered, but preach the gospel proclaimed by the Christ and Mother Ann Lee, which will save to the uttermost all who obey. Fannie Casey.,
