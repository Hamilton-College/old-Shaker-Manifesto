TRIBUTE OF RESPECT: A. C, Stickney Deceased at Shaker Village, Met. Co., N. H. Sept. 28, 1881, Michal Blake aged 82 yrs. gone! Gone home at length, to that mighty Unseen Where so many cherished ones dwell. Gone ;-----from our vision, and yet just between Our home and thine, hangs but a vail! Gone do we say? while on memory's page Doth thy record of faithfulness live As a sacred memento for youth, and for age As a legacy worthy to give ? A long life of usefulness reaching four score Has come to an honorable end, For habits of prudence and temperance rare, Prolonged the blest life of our friend. And what though no marble be destined to mark The place of the casket's repose, A statelier column we see, of good works, Built up from life's dawn, to its close. Dear mother, be comforted, many rejoice To greet you in your spirit home, For we almost hear in one gladsome voice,â€” ' You are welcome! ' ' Most welcome dear one!' Pray take this, our tribute of filial regard To spirit friends where e'er you go: With our promise renewed to earn the reward, Of their blessing and love, here below.
