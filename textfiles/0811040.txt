CAN YOU READ? A student at the theological seminary at Andover, who had an excellent opinion of his own talent, on one occasion asked the professor who taught elocution; 'What do I specially need to learn in this department?' 'You ought just to learn to read,' said the professor. 'Oh, I can read now,' replied the student. The professor handed the young man a testament, and pointing to Luke 24:24, he asked him to read that. The student read : 'Then he said unto them, 0 fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.' 'Ah,' said the professor, 'they were fools for believing the prophets, were they?' Of course that was not right, and so the young man tried again. '0 fools, and slow of heart to believe all ;hat the prophets have spoken.' 'The prophets, then, were sometimes iars?' asked the professor. 'No. 0 fools, and slow of heart to beieve all that the prophets have spoken.' 'According to this reading,' the professor iuggested, 'the prophets were notorious iars.' This was not a, satisfactory conclusion, and : another trial was made. '0 fools, and MANIFESTO. THE SHAKER slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.' 'I see, now,' said the professor, 'the prophets wrote the truth, but they spoke falsehoods.' This last criticism discouraged the student, and he acknowledged that he did not know how to read.'
