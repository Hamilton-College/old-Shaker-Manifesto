EXPLAINING A TEXT A little girl saw hanging in her Sundayschool room this text on an illuminated card : ' Let us not be weary in well-doing ; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.' She caught the idea of its teaching, and in attempting to repeat it at her home she gave a somewhat free rendering in this form: ' Don't you get tired in doing good ; for if you don't faint away, by and by you'll get your pay.' The truth as she put it is worth bearing in mind.
