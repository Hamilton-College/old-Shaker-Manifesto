The Children's Grotto BOYS WANTED Boys of spirit, boys of will, Boys of muscle, brain and power, Fit to cope with any thing — These are wanted every hour. Not the weak and whining drones That all troubles magnify — Not the watchword of ' I can't,' But the noble one ' I'll try.' Do what'er you have to do With a true and earnest zeal ; Bend your sinews to the task ; ' Put your shoulder to the wheel.' Though your duty may be hard, Look not on it as on ill; If it be an honest task, Do it with an honest will. EXPLAINING A TEXT A little girl saw hanging in her Sundayschool room this text on an illuminated card : ' Let us not be weary in well-doing ; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.' She caught the idea of its teaching, and in attempting to repeat it at her home she gave a somewhat free rendering in this form: ' Don't you get tired in doing good ; for if you don't faint away, by and by you'll get your pay.' The truth as she put it is worth bearing in mind.
