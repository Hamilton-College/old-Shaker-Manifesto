CORRESPONDENCE To Joseph Chamberlain respected friend; I have been... To Joseph Chamberlain, Respected Friend ;�I have been measuring the moral altitude of Gladstone, Parnell, and yourself, as British Statesmen. Gladstone represents the British Government and of course its morality. Its actions in Egypt were but to secure to Egyptian landholders their dividends, (which, as you are well aware, must be paid by the laborers of Egypt) and to keep open a water-way to India through which the wealth annually created by labor may flow into the Thames. The morality of said actions, have no altitude whatever. Parnell represents the worst cared for people within the limits of modern civilization. His position has a certain potential altitude. What does he profess to do with it? To increase the number of land-holders, and to give them the power to control their own affairs. Under this altitude, millions of the Irish people will be as in oth^r parts of the British Empire, denied access to the land; and of course be servants�slaves�commodities, to those who have land. To be denied access to land, is perpetual eviction. And a recognition of the right of the Duke of Argylle to demand that a Gun-boat be sent to Skye to subdue the poor Crofters. Hence the moral altitude of Parnell, is as that of Gladstone, nowhere! Your position is best denned by those who traduce you. ' That you would confiscate, and inaugurate communism. ' Your traducers are blind to the fact, that an evicted man, denied access to the elements of subsistence, is also evicted from under all moral responsibilities. Your position is neither more nor less, than to bring every person within the pale of moral responsibility. Hold that position. 'The gates of Hell shall not prevail against you. Moses the great Law-giver and Emancipator�the type of Jesus Christ; gave to every family a portion of land. He founded his Moral Code, upon a just apportionment of the land of Judea. Hence every Jew was held under moral responsibilities. Point your traducers to Moses the servant of God. Did he not institute the ' Acceptable year of the Lord '�the Jubilee�' A Land Restoration Law? ' � Did he not inaugurate communism? Declaring that every seventh year, the whole land of Judea should be one common table. That the fruit of the olive-yards, vineyards, and fields, should be common property. That the rich, the poor, and the shiftless should all fare alike ! What a glorious year for Tramps, the whole land of Judea is alive with them. Sound an alarm in 'Scotland yard!' Call out the 'Horse guards. ' Let the Duke's Gun-boat take a position ! For ' The reign of Law '�divine law, is inaugurated. The castle of Imeraray shall lose its isolation, and a tidal wave from the Garelough shall wash away the sinecures of the House of the Lome. If Moses was but a shadow of Christ, what will ultimate communism be? Through you, allow me to say a few words to Socialists, Internationalists, and to Dynamiters. You complain, that 'Society ' is organized against you. That you produce, and that others consume the products of your industry. That you sustain Governments instituted to oppress you, and forms of religion for which you have no reverence. Pay interest on enormous debts, which you did not contract. And to support Military establishments designed to oppress you. And to support swarms of idlers, whose chief employment is to devour your substance, and to corrupt public morals. That you are the wealth producers ; yet you have no possessions. You also state, that the enormously productive energies of mechanical and chemical appliances of our times are not the products of a class, and that they belong of right to all. And being destitute of land, your necessities compel you to set and keep these mighty forces in motion till you glut the markets of the world. And that you suffer destitution from the very abundance you have created. Again you complain, that you are denied access to social elevating enjoyments. And that you are degraded personally by enduring unhygienic conditions, alike destructive of morals and of life. On the presentation of these awful verities ; why should not ' Society' be seized with remorse, and rush to embrace you; relieve youTHE MANIFESTO. 275 from such terrible pressure, assuage your anguish, and soothe your broken hearts. Invite you to their mansions, to the luxuries of their conservatories, and to the sweet air of their ample parks. And that all who call themselves 'Society' would unite to bless you for your long endurance of such stupendous wrongs. And wonder, that ir your desperation you had not torn 'Society' into pieces, and strewed your pathways with destruction. And in profound gratitude for all they had enjoyed of the products of labor, crown you as the industrial moral heroes of the ages. ' Society' also has its complaints. Complains that you are ready to do violence. Well we know what Christ said 'Whatever measure ye mete unto men, will be measured unto you again. ' Suppose Mosaic justice is applied in this case. 'A blow for a blow '' would clearly justify applying forms of force, ,,to remove burdens unjustly^imposed. ' Society' has no cause of complaint. If she is dealt with, as she has dealt with you. But stop here, make a halt; consider a few points. Are not the Great Land-holders who rule in their own favor, the fruit of long established usages? would you have done any better, had you been trained as they were? Take you as a whole, where is the man among you who would object to accepting a Dukedom? And where is the average woman who would not like to be a Duchess? Is it not an all pervading, an ever present fact, that man's lower self-hood, with its animal loves and impulses, has created modern civilization just as it is. Suppose you had been so unfortunate as to be a Duke, would you like to have a little bit of dynamite applied to you? There is a better way. Suppose you try force, would not that invite repression, and cause the inevitable coming change to be an explosion? In such a case, the millions whom you represent would most largely be the sufferers. To deplete the population of Europe by ten or twenty millions would be to the 'Law and order men,' a godsend. For war, famine, pestilence, are factors in the creed of their economy. Do not give these men any such an opportunity. Those among yourselves who are the most violent, were they of the favored few, would be the most reckless in applying force to you. ' There is a better way. ' Is it wisdom to meet an army in front, when you can take it in rear? ' The better way ' to subdue armies is, never come into contract with them 'The iron Duke ' fresh from Waterloo, and flushed with victory, tried to rule with an iron hand. Public sentiment spoke six words, ('stop the Duke, go for gold ') and brought the Duke to his knees. Public sentiment can make, or dismiss armies. ' The better way ' is, speak peace to all and maintain it among yourselves ; for the day of your deliverance is nigh. The Law has gone, and is going forth from the Throne of the Eternal, that all men are equally his children, and equally entitled to have access to all the elements of subsistence. Declare that the acceptable year of the Lord is now, the Jubilee, the Land Restoration year. Declare through all nations, that Land being the source of human subsistence, of social and judicial equality; and a regulator of the exchange and values of commercial equivalents ; that every person should have access to land at all times. Declare, that the possession of land operates as a brake upon the fly wheel of destructive competition. And as a nullifier of the causes of Panics, Strikes, Want, and Crime. Declare also, that Gold was not made to grow, nor Mortgages to yield a crop. To have them do so, is to destroy the conditions of human equality. Kossuth remarked 'the Christian nation is not yet' under Christian ideas and sentiments, land can neither be bought nor sold. To do so, is to make those who cannot buy, a commodity, a servant, a slave. The veriest opposite ' of loving the neighbor as we do self.' The Ballot and the Vote, are to the ' landless ' but ' glittering generalities. ' Get land and work it, and the comforts of life will soon be yours. The really useful goods of all nations, are reproduced every few years. And ever remember that destructive modes of acquiring property are demoralizing. The Better way has been shown. Shall I show you the Best�the Higher way. When you get to the land, and have enjoyed a fullness of the good things treasured up in the rich grains, and refreshing fruits, you may be better prepared to listen. However, I will venture now to'do so. It has been stated, that modern civilization is the product of man's lower self-hood. The organic Law of that civilization is, ' Me and Mine. ' Its mode of operation is to get all you can at the expense of others�make servants�slaves� commodities of men, women and children. If they resist, coerce them with the resources of civilization 'the musket, the bludgeon, the crowbar, and said Gun-boat. There is not a single nation on earth's wide circumference, which represents the 'Higher Life' in man. 'The Christian nation is not yet.' There is indeed a phenomenal people ' called Shakers, ' whose mode of procedure is love to the neighbor. They hold to the Mother, and Fatherhood of God. They say, that goodness is religion, And that to be beneficent is to be divine. And that any other kind of divinity is a spurious article. They also state, that their homes are open to all humanity, with this proviso� Restrain the lower�the animal emotions bear a daily cross against them. And come out of the bottomless pit of self-greed. Put your hands to work, and your hearts to the All Central Beneficence�God. And lovingly give of the products of your labor to sustain upon earth the economy of Heaven, 'Unto this last, even as unto thee, will I give a penny. ' With them, there is neither want nor crime. Nor say they, the land is mine. I have the happiness to be your friend, D. Fraser. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. U. S. A.
