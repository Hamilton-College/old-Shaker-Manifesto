Sanitary. WATER. A pitcher of cold water placed on a table or a bureau will absorb all the gases with which a room is fiJled from the respiration of those eating or sleeping in the apartment. Very few realize how important such purification is for the health of the family, or, indeed, understand or realize, that there can be any impurity in the rooms, yet in a few hours a pitcher of cold water-�the colder the better an^ more effective�will make the air of the room pure, but the water will be entirely unfit for use. In bed-rooms a buc- et or pitcher of water should always be kept and changed often if any one stays in the room during the day, and certainly be put in fresh when the inmates retire. One should never drink such water; if it is needed for drink, use a closely covered vessel. Impure water causes more sickness than even impure air, and for that reason, before using water from a pump or reservoir for drinking or cooking, one should pump or draw out enough to clear the pipes before using it, particularly in the morning, after the water has been standing in the pipes all night.�Ex. For a long time the above has been recognized as a scientific fact, yet sensible people speak of malaria arising from rivers and lakes. Why! Bless everybody, were it not for the absorbing powers of water, man would not long survive. He would soon die of the accumulated waste and defilement of his own body. Water is a reservoir for the impure emanations of man and animals. Large cities are never built only near large bodies of water; either a large running river, where the water is being constantly renewed, or near a large lake, sea or gulf, where the waves are dashing and the water is kept constantly in commotion. By the motion of the water, the impurities it gathers are precipitated to the earth beneath ; there they are decomposed, returned to earth conditions. The water receives the impurities, carries them to the earth and by its soluble influence, aids in their decomposition. The evaporation of water by artificial means, or by the sun's rays, carries no impurities with it; and when condensed the water thus produced is always pure. O, Water! thou blest of all material, prepared by the Giver of all for his children. 'Water, precious essence of life! Eippling in the glade and grassy dell where the red deer wanders and the child loves to play, there God prepares it. Down, away down in the deepest valleys, where the fountain murmurs and the rills ring, high on the mountain tops, where the naked granite glitters like gold in the sun, where storm-clouds brood and thunderstorms crash; and out, out on the wide, wide sea, where the hurricane howls music, and the big waves roar their chorus, sweeping the march of God, there He prepares it. Beverage of life�health-giving water.' The Journal of Hygeio-Therapy.
