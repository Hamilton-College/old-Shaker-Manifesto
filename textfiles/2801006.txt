Shakers, N. Y. Dec. 1897. Ix seeking for riches, honor and fame we many times have to suffer disappoint- ment; but in attaining the gifts of the spirit there are no false calculations. In that realm, the instruction, 'seek and ye shall rind,' is without variableness or shadow of turning. We spent a week in the month of November with our gospel kindred of Mt. Lebanon and West Pittstield, and we found a goodly band of those who have given all they have to the cause; who were of that number who do not worship Baal nor do homage to his image. We enjoyed a beautiful visit with our beloved Mot'.ier Eldress Ann Taylor, and tho feeble in body her spirit is full of zeal. She said, 'give my love to all of the Brethren and Sisters,' and in receiving that beautiful benediction we thought, 'these are they who have come up through tribulation and have made their garments white.' May we keep in union, with those blessed saints so that from out the destruction of our rudimental life may be evolved a glorious destiny. Our national Thanksgiving was observed and what imprest us in the Elder's address was the reminder of what we owe to the labors of those old pioneers, the Pilgrim Fathers whose efforts on the line of political and religious freedom made it possible for coming generations to worship God according to the dictates of their consciences unmolested. For every advance made either by nations or individuals towards that goal, the universal brotherhood of man, there has had to be the wormwood and the gall. Some souls have had to suffer, be a for- tress behind which the coming time could prepare more advanced conditions of life. Those to-day who are the human representatives of that mighty power which is shaping human destiny for its weal whose thoughts even are as ministering angels pointing to a better way, come from the humbler walks of life.
