BEAUTIFUL. Beautiful hands are those that do Work that is earnest, brave and true, Moment by moment the long day through. Beautiful feet are those that go On kindliest ministries to and fro, Down lowliest way, if God wills it so. Beautiful shoulders are those that bear Ceaseless burdens of homely care, With patient grace and daily care. Beautiful lives are those that blessï¿½ Silent rivers of happiness, Whose hidden fountain but few may guess. Selected.
