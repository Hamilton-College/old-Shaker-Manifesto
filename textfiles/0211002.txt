Keep thy Integrity BT A. G. HOLLISTER The Apostle exhorts his readers to ' prove all things, and hold fast that which is good.' If the inquisition of intellect is a test, then it is rife in these days ; but to hold fast the good, which is necessary to make the former of any value, completes the process by bringing on the test of experience. If all, who have been blessed with a talent of spiritual light, had been mindful, always to hold fast the good, there would not be so much instability of purpose and contradiction in character—so much trying to mingle flesh and spirit—light and darkness—bartering a real and eternal good for the momentary pleasures of sense, which ever lead from bad to worse, neglecting practical works of righteousness, which alone give true elevation, to achieve a fancied elevation by chimerical speculations that have no substance nor foundation in truth. To hold fast the good, is to maintain integrity by fidelity to the light of rational understanding; ever heeding to do right because it is right. This requires watchfulness, unwavering determination, faith and fortitude; for it brings the soul into the test-crucible and takes away its dross. If fidelity to principle brings the soul into trial, it will also carry it triumphantly through trial, and endow it with regal power, which creates circumstances, or compels those existing to serve. Being wholly devoted to obey the highest and purest law of Deity manifest, Deity directs and works through it. The soul that never willingly swerves from moral rectitude, moving with or against circumstances until adversity has tested it to the utmost, will at last feel blessed of God forever. Such were the characters wrought by Jesus, and Ann Lee, after they received the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
