Dear Teacher; I am glad to... Shaker Village, Mer. Co., N. H. Dkak Teacher ;ï¿½I am glad to have the pleasure of writing you a few lines. I like to study, I have had two cards for good behavior and I should like to get another one to-day. It is very pleasant I think. I like to go and pick berries very much. I hope I shall not fail in spelling the rest of the term as long as I study hard. I should like to try and get to the head of my class in all my studies and that would be nice. I shall try next week to get my lessons perfectly and do as I am taught. I try and do in school as the Teacher wishes me. Your pupil, D. E. C.
