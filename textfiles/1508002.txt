LOVING-KINDNESS. R. A. SHEPARD. With Godlike lore be all my actions crowned ; With loving-kindness may my heart o'er-flow; And while I seek God's grace, which doth abound; My soul to cleanse, and all my faults to show. I'll take new courage and be moving on, A conquest o'er my inbred foes to gain : And though perfection is not easy won, I'll persevere, till victory I obtain. Canterbury, N. H.
