PROGRESSION MARIA WITHAM What is it? The power to grasp that knowledge which has no bounds but illimitable space, and no end but eternityâ€”And the object of our material existence is to lay the foundation for that progressive development in the future which is here chained down by the material shackles in the form. No matter what the cause, the effect is the same. The soul having its progress arrested, must feel the loss which it can never recover, whether from want of light or the abuse of it. The law which governs our existence in all its various conditions has its effect on our destiny. How must we obtain the knowledge which will enable us to attain that high desti- ny, to perform the sublime and mighty duties belonging to it, and be able to execute the will of the great Creator, by giving scope to that germ which is speeding its way back to the source from which it emanated? By progression, which is generally of slow growth, and much patience will be required. But we must indeed 'put on the whole armor of God,' girding with immortal strength those feelings which for the accomplishment of a great and true object, will sacrifice, if needs be every thing of our own individuality. Is it not a beautiful thought that we can ever be progressing upward? The contemplation awakens emotions which cannot be uttered. What is education, what power, or wealth or position? All weighed in the balance are found wanting. Enfield, Conn.
