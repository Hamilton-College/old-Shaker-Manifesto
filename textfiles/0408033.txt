PURE LOVE Pure Love is a celestial gem; nothing earthborn can compare with it. Love contains within itself the germs of all other gifts and graces. Purity of heart, Charity which suffers long, mercy and forgiveness are all found in love's embraces, and are the legitimate fruits which flow therefrom. May I be clothed with the beautiful spirit of love ; may it constitute my chief adorning while I dwell in an earthly form, and fit me for the companionship of pure spirits in the land of light and love! Then with the wise virgins of our own time, I shall be prepared to go forth bearing the lamp of truth in my hand that will shed light upon the pathway of the pilgrim traveler, and shall be ready to make efforts to raise the fallen, and point them to the path of virtue — the straight and narrow way that leads to happiness — to the Fountain of all good. Mary A. Whitely, Shirley, Mass.
