CELIBACY AND LONGEVITY By Elder Richard Bushnell Now in his 82d year. A brother whom I esteem as one of the best men now living upon the earth. — Ed. It has often been stated, by physicians and others, that a married life is more conducive to longevity than an unmarried life. Now, if the term unmarried, is meant to include all such as are not joined in lawful wedlock, no doubt the statement may be true. For, of both sexes there are vast numbers whose lives are incompatible with decent modesty, and much more so with a life of chastity and virgin purity. But, as it regards a life of entire abstinence from sexual commerce, or carnal indulgence of any name or nature, I think the following will disprove the above statement: In the society at Mount Lebanon, within about ten years, there have deceased, of male and female members, 36, whose united ages average over 86 years. The great majority of them came into the society in their youth, and lived a virgin life, agreeable to the faith and principles of Believers. And there are now living in the Society four members, who came in their youth (under twenty years of age) one of whom is now in the 102d year of her age; another over 98; and two in their 92d year; also, about ten or twelve more, whose ages are between 80 and 90 years. Most of them united with the society at an early period of their lives. See also our report (on page 45 of the June No. for 1871) of a family of ten —eight males and two females — all of whom but one, who is now living and in his 95th year, died among Believers. Their respective names and ages, (which average near 63 years) are given as above.—Exchanges, please copy.
