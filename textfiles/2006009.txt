Mrs. M. A. Winkler, Esteemed Friend:--Your letter of Sept. 9th... East Canterbury, Mer. Co., N. H. Mrs. M. A. Winkler, Esteemed Friend :�Your letter of Sept. 9th. wTas duly received ; the valuable papers �'Signs of the Times,' also came promptly, more so than my acknowledgement, for which please accept many thanks. I have enjoyed the reading much, and am deeply interested in some of the subjects treated upon. The reason in part of my delay in writing was, I wished to give you some knowledge of my and our religious views, but hardly felt competent for the task, as they are so unlike those of many Christian sects. I would inform you that I am a member of a Christian Community of 'Believers in Christ's Second Appearing,'�that it has already taken place ; having evidence of the divine revelation by actual experience. 'If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God,' &amp;c. John vii., 17. We look upon this very important event in a different light from many who express their views on the subject, or from the religious world in general. We do not look for Jesus, the Christ, to come literally; but Christ, (Savior, spirit,) of whom Jesus Christ said,�'I am the resurrection and the life ; he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Jno. xi., 25, 26. 'They which are accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.' Luke, xx., 35. And 'In the resurrection,' (in Christ) 'they neither many nor are given in marriage ; but are as the Angels in heaven.' Matt, xxii., 30. Beautiful thought! worthy aspiration to become like the angels of God in heaven ! in the present life; they 'are as the angels.' This is the resurrection that we aim at and are working for;�a resurrection from dead works, from the sinful condition of the world, actual or inherited ; with faith and confidence of obtaining it. We have no formulated creed to confine us to a belief of thus and so, rendering a member liable to penalty of being excommunicated if not fully endorsed verbally. We may be free to believe what in our judgment seems reasonable and consistent with enlightened Christian development;-�not as libertines in the bad sense of the word ; while the life and deportment should be above reproach ;�evidencing an exceeding righteousness : Yet we have our by-laws and rules to chasten our conduct and social relations as Broth- ers and Sisters in a Community. And all are expected to conform to these rules, for protection and harmony. The foundation principles of our Order,�principles of the Christ-life,� are, A Virgin life, Separation from the world, (not as ascetics,) Confession and repentance of sin, and Community of Interests, i. e. United Inheritance, to be enjoyed by all the members ;�conformity to said principles being required of all claiming full churoh membership. For nearly a hundred years some seventeen Societies formed on the above principles, having 'all things common,' after the pattern of the Apostolic Church, have existed in the United States. These Societies containing from one hundred to six hundred each are divided into Communities or families of a dozen to two hundred persons of all ages from eight or ten to one hundred years. These families are of different grades ; novitiate for such as are not prepared to enter into covenantal surrender and consecration of self, property and services ; others for members more fully developed in knowledge and experience of the tenets and manner of life enjoined. We are led to believe in a duality of the divine Parentage,�Father and Mother, God ; we might say, also, Christ Father, Christ Mother. God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,'�So God made man in his own image ; in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. Gen. i., 26, 27. Further: 'For the invisible things from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.' Rom. i., 20. The term Bridegroom,� a title conferred on Jesus, suggests the necessity of a Bride to complete the figure. If children cannot be born into the earth world without both father and mother, how can they find birth into the New creation of God without a spiritual parentage, father and mother ? The second appearing of Christ in a female, which we happily indorse, gives us a spiritual Mother to complete the Heavenly Parentage. Just here let me quote from the 'Signs of the Times' of Sept. 9th., J. H. Waggoner writes: 'The second appearing of Ch rist is figurative or spiritual and has already taken place.' This statement coincides with the doctrine that we the Shakers, or Believers advocate. Jesus being the first anointed son of God on whom the spirit descended and abode, ushered in the first Advent; so we hold that Ann Lee was the divinely anointed pioneer in the second Advent. Not casually, but through a baptism of fire and the holy spirit, became the fit instrument in the hands of God to receive and transmit the revelation. The subjeet is a great one. As a Church we have several works upon the same. I will mail one to your address with several copies of the Manifesto published by our Society. A^ith kind regards I am, Respectfully, Sarah F. Wilson.
