Good Fruit from a Bad Tree If such a thing were possible, it would seem to be the teaching of the following extract from a letter recently received by one of the ¦ Brethren, from a popular Western Minister: ' I do not believe a bit, you know, in your peculiar notions of the separation of the husband and wife, or of the isolation of the sexes to the destruction of the marriage tie, and so at last of the whole world for lack of a new generation. I am quite sure the canon must be all wrong that would leave this good, green earth as bare of human beings as the moon. ' But you have solved one problem. I take you to be the most honest artizans ; the most upright dealers; the most harmless livers (if that is a merit); the most comfortable, and, as I hope to find when I see you, the most generous people in your ideas and habits I have ever heard of.' The above is quite characteristic of the man, and at the same time shows how very little believers are understood, by those even who, of all men, should have a correct knowl- edge of a Faith which, according to his own testimony, incites such excellent Practice. 'By their fruits ye shall know them,'—if as true to-day as when uttered by the Saviour It is strange, after so much has been spoken and written to inform the world that we do 1101 condemn marriage in its own order and place, br the children of this world do and will con- ;inue to many, and if they would not abuse hemselves and the laws of nature under the cloak of 'sacred' matrimony, the Shakers will not find much fault, and some of them would feel much more respect for themselves, and be better fitted and prepared to receive ;he pure testimony of Christ's second appearng, and its Resurrection power, which elevates ;he mind above sensuous passions and desires. It may be a question whether we ought to :&gt;e required to stretch our 'generosity' so much as to be patient under so much misconception and misrepresentation. Evidently, this is no time to slacken our land, but, by ' The Shaker,' and every means in our power, ' Let the tide of Truth roll on.' Amen. John Whitely
