Politics for Young Americans: By Charles Nordhoff. The title of this book will mislead many, unless they consider how wide a field the word politics covers. In it we have letters, from a father to his son, teaching him the necessity of government; its various phases; the rights, duties and honors of citizenship; of the various official characters connected with governments; of taxes, property; usury laws, banks, banking and credit; in short, a valuable multum in parvo of cosmology, in a governmental line. It should be in the hands of every boy and girl in the land — the future voters, and legislators of our states and country. It concludes with the ' Constitution of the United States' — 'Declaration of Independence,' and 'Washington's Farewell Address.' Published by Harpers, New York. The Poems of Oliver Goldsmith. The same publishers send us a beautiful copy of selections by the talented Goldsmith, edited by W. J. Rolfe. Copious notes on the poems, find a good ventilation in their proper place. Among others, the poems 'Traveler,' 'Deserted Village,' 'Retaliation,' are made very prominent. To many, Goldsmith is a favorite author; and to such, we only need call attention that this beautiful book is issued, to insure it a large sale
