ANALOGIES. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. If life be compared to a voyage over the trackless main, every wise mariner, having chart and compass, and a settled design in view, will determine the port for which he wishes to steer, before he leaves the harbor. Or if perchance he lose his chart and compass, and should be in danger of perishing amid the sands and breakers of an unknown coast, he would doubtless accept the first aid that offered a hope of rescue�and be glad to receive any clear and certain knowledge of a safe course to a port of peace and security, where the fruits and blessings of industry abound. In either case, after forming a purpose, founded upon knowledge and conviction, reaching forward to the goal of desire, and drawing inspiration from thence to prompt straight forward action, then no change in the scene, no illusive aspect of sea, earth or sky, no coaxing, threats, enticement nor wearisomeness, nor danger, nor hardship can turn him from his course, Avhile cleaving to his purpose. 'The race is great and the ideal fair, but the multitude are whiffling and unsure, while the hero is immovably centered there.' As the science of numbers is worked out by the application of a few simple figures that a child may learn,�whose fixed values must be adhered to in all calculations, from the least sum in addition to the solution of the most abstruse mathematical problems, else the results will be null and void : so in the conduct of life, the same virtues that adorn a child, truthfulness, steadfastness, fidelity to trust, simplicity, kindness, purity of heart, teachableness, carefulness, obedience to convictions and a suitable reverence or respect for superiors, are equally necessary to beautify and perfect the character in all grades of intelligence, and spheres of action, from the lowest to the highest walks in life. The simplest rules of moral discipline, and the strictest principles of virtue and integrity are ubiquitous in their power and obligations, and are unchangeable in their nature and effects, and without them, no human life can be a genuine success�but with them incorporated in the character and conduct, man is sure to achieve the high destiny for which he was created.
