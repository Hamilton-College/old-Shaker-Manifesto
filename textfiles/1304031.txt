GRATITUDE TO GOD. MARY WHITCHER. Grateful to God for what is given; 'Tis not enough for home and heaven. How shall we meet the debt we owe And for thy mercy when bestow? Thou needest not my humble gift; And naught is mine thy joy to lift; Or to enhance thy peace serene Or fullness of thy glory seen.â€” But by the light Thou givest me Thy will, my God, I'm blest to see; And in the language of thy Son, Unto the least true kindness done Shall reach thy throne, O God above, By whom we're known and blessed through love. Canterbury, N. H.
