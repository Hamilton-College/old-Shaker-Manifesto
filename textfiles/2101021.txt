Harvard, Mass. Dec. 1890. Dear Editor:â€”Winter has come in earnest. The thermometer indicates four degrees below zero. We have two inches of snow, and quite good sleigrhing. Those who have been tormented with aches and pains and were included on the sick list, are much better. What a blessing it would be if we only understood the laws that influence the soul and body and be able to keep out of the hands of the Physicians. Our sympathy goes out for our dear friends at Mt. Lebanon who have just passed through another fiery ordeal. What a hard master this fiery element is, when not under control. It is ever a reminder to us to be careful and leave every place properly protected. The Notes in the last Manifesto were beautifully written. They were read with deep interest by all. We await anxiously the coming of the paper but the Nov. number entered the Village and took us by surprise. On entering the family Dwelling we found Eldress Ellen Greene, surrounded by a company of Sisters, reading the 'Notes' in the Nov. Manifesto, and we entered, at once, into the same inspiration. Love to all gospel friends, and a 'Happy New Year.' A. B.
