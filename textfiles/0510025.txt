NORMAL CONDITIONS When the marriage institution, under orderly normal conditions, is used to produce a healthy race of beings, who will honor their parents and live according to the laws of their being on the natural plane of existence until they progress beyond that state, and find a growth into the more divine life, the present condition of inharmonies will be changed, and peace, to a great extent, will be established in thg earthly order. If the marriage relation, as claimed, be founded upon love, why is it not more peacefully sustained? Why do the public journals teem with detailed accounts of jealousies, jarring contentions, moroseness of habit and temper, often ending in bloodshed ? It is often said, ' There is no effect without a cause.' There must be a terrible defect somewhere; a great perversion of physical laws; for what are now sometimes pictured in poetic strains as ' Matrimonial heavens,' to my mind appear more like a pandemonium! and ' Hymen's silken bands' might more appropriately be called hempen cords, which in a wily manner coil around its subjects, then fasten and bind with fetters strong as the chains of chattel slavery, which cost much suffering and many lives to break ! The high and low, rich and poor, priests and laymen fall into the same snare! Ye thinking men and women, prophets and prophetesses of the nineteenth century, will ye point out the cause of all this trouble, and show the remedy ? Let it be written in language so plain, that they who run may read and understand. Julia Johnson, West Pittsfield, Mass.
