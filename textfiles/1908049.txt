Deaths. Amos Babbitt Amos Babbitt at Union Village, O., June 23, 1889. Age 83 yrs. 4 mo. and 6 days. Br. Amos has been a worthy member of our Society from early childhood. C. C. Mary Robbing Mary Robbing, at Harvard, July 7, 1889. Age 88 yrs. 10 mo. and 10 days. Seventyfive years of active service in the Society, and fifty-three as family nurse. To those who knew her whole consecrated, unselfish and devoted life, she needs no other eulogy. She is among the 'many Daughters who have done virtuously' and excelled. Physical disability�infirmity of age�� seemed to heighten, rather than impair her desire for doing good. Her kindness and benevolence, like the rain and dew fell everywhere without discrimination. A life so well filled with dilligence in business, and generous hospitality will have its merited reward�''treasures in heaven,' in the hearts of those she loved; and whose love was reciprocal. E. M.
