HISTORY OF SOUTH UNION, KY. No. 6. South Union, Ky., May 26, 1855. * Friends :� J. P., T. B. S., and G. A. M.� In answer to your letter of to-day we respectfully refer you to our publication in the Russellville Herald of the 16th inst. Respectfully, John N. Rankin. U. E. Johns. In 1861 there was great excitement in the southern states, on account of the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidential Office, and as a matter of course the Believers of South Union became very anxious about their home, in case there should be any extended trouble between the North and South. This subject has for many years, been discussed by the South, and has arisen because of the institution of slavery. [The slave states anticipated the possibility of forming an independent government, and counted on the large number of northerners who were indirectly interested in slavery, and accumulating riches through slave labor. Ed.] In January, 1861, the dwelling of the West Family was burned to the ground. The Brethren had been burning out the chimneys and had all left the place for other occupations, so that it was never known, correctly, how the fire originated. A part of the property that was in the house was fortunately saved. This calamity deprived the family of their dwelling, and the Brethren and Sisters were received in other homes of their gospel friends. APRIL, 1894. 78 THE MANIFESTO. In 1860, Elder Harvey L. Eads wrote the following prophetic words:� 'I have long believed that the present state of things would come to pass. It has come a little sooner than I anticipated, yet, I think that if the Cotton or Gulf states do not fire the first gun, a civil war may be averted, hut if they do burn povsder against the government, then twenty millions at the North will be arranged against ten millions from the South, and such havoc and slaughter as there will be, can scarce find a parallel in the annuls of the world! One shudders at the thought! ! The result of a war will be, it seems to me, the freedom of every slave that may be left alive in the United States.' [But the South fired the first gun; the war came; the havoc and carnage followed for both North, and South, and then came the emancipation of slavery. Ed.] The Believers at South Union suffered a great deal of annoyance during the time of the civil war. The Southern soldiers on their march from Russellville to Bowling Green, as well as in going the other way, made it convenient to pitch their tents near the Shakers, and demand of them food for the men and forage for the horses. Sometimes these companies amounted to six or eight hundred. They came at all hours of the day and night and their orders must be regarded. For some things the Shakers received compensation, but hundreds of meals were given away. Their fences were burned, their hay and oats carried off and their horses and wagons 'pressed' into the service of the army. Tramps were also prowling around the buildings, and acting in the capacity of sneak thieves. These were a constant annoyance. Near the close of the war the Federal soldiers made it convenient to stop at South Union to obtain food and shelter, yet one instance only is recorded when any form of a fight occurred on the consecrated soil of the Believers, of which we shall speak later. At this time, 1861, the Believers at South Union, Ky., seem to be in the 'midst of war and rumors of wars.' Our once United States are divided and the North and South are fiercely engaged in the act of destroying each other. The savagery of warfare fills the air and men made fierce with prejudice and hate and infuriated with rum, are running wildly from place to place, determined to rule or ruin. The doctrine of state rights and the maintenance of slavery in the southern states is the bone of contention. As singular as it may seem, nearly all the ministers of the several denominations in the southern states, were for the continuance of that horrible system of human slavery, and were preaching to their congregations, that it was sanctioned by the word of God, in the Bible. Large numbers of cotton manufacturers, as well as hundreds of political aspirants who had an eye to the southern vote, were in sympathy with the South, and were willing to work for slavery in order to increase tiieir own chances for the schemes of political selfishness. THE MANIFESTO. 79 This influential encouragement, no doubt, was an effective stimulus to the slave oligarchy to threaten what would be done, unless they could peaceably be let alone. But slavery was destined to go, and the prayers of the hireling priests were spent on the air, and although it demanded a great sacrifice of both the North and the South, in the destruction of property and in the loss of life, victory was on the side of humanity. The Believers living in the state of Kentucky were subjected to much unpleasant treatment, and to a great loss of property, although occupying a neutral position, and prevented from taking an active part with either the North or South, as this would be a violation of their religious principles. They were obliged to use the utmost care in conversation, and in their actions, lest they should give offence to their military visitors, who were alternately with them from the northern and southern armies. [That they were made able to meet the many and absolute demands of an excited army, and still be so wonderfully protected, is a miracle of God's love and care. Ed.] In April, 1861, we hear that Fort Sumter has been fired upon by the South. The war is now raging. The ball is set in motion and who can predict the end? The first speck of war that was made visible to us was on the 15th of August when a company of cavalry, numbering about eighty-six persons, under the command of the rebel Colonel Forest, reached our village from the north. Little flags from the Confederacy were fastened near the ears of the horses for ornamentation. They moved on very civilly till they reached the mill pond, a short distance beyond our dwellings, where they encamped for the night. We provided them with food for supper and also for breakfast' and the Brethren gave them, without charge, a supply of apples and peaches. They obtained some corn of Bluitt, who is the station agent, and some oats of Yost, who lived about one mile west of our Village. Colonel Forest formerly resided in Memphis, Tenn., and had come into Kentucky to muster in this company, which he intended to take to Camp Boone in Tennessee for drill, and then to return them to Kentucky, for use in the southern army. In the morning the Col. addressed his men, and informed them that if any present wished to return to their homes they would please walk to the left of the company, as this was their last and only chance for dismissal. At the close of his remarks, six of the volunteers stepped aside from the body of men, and for the acceptance of this offer, the Col. traduced them, in the worst of the King's English; and the Shaker Brethren who heard the language, were surprised at the good conduct of those who received it. These poor fellows, however, had by their short and sad experience, become sufficiently enlightened to see the pit into which they had fallen, and held with tenacity to their good resolution and returned to their homes. 80 THE MANIFESTO. As the Col. had furnished no blankets, the soldiers were obliged to lie on the bare ground at night, and but few would be able to endure that hardship. This company made a raid upon our cabbage bed and carried off a few heads, and then upon the garden of melons, with the same results. In this they showed an independence of character, even without fighting. In all other respects the soldiers behaved as well as one could expect, under these circumstances. Sept. 17. The Confederate General, Simon B. Buckner, with his soldiers entered and took military possession of Bowling Green, and then seized all the stock belonging to the railroad that passed between Bowling Green, Ky., and C larks ville, Tenn., which closed all correspondence between South Union and any place in the northern or loyal States. Sept. 23. Brother Urban Johns, who was the senior trustee at South Union, had received some Confederate bank bills and wished to make a journey to Pleasant Hill and then to the banks in Louisville to exchange them for specie. These bills were worth about fifty or seventy-five cents on a dollar. He returned about the first of October. We were now having a new experience, and learning what it was to be shut up and in bondage. Not one word can we send to any of our friends out of the State, until it passes the examination of those who assume the military control of those now in authority, who were neither friends to us nor to our profession. What an awl'ul condition we are placed in at this time; not a newspaper could be obtained from the northern states and only occasionally one from any of the Confederate States. Oct. 29. Generals Johnson and Buckner sent agents to take our horses and wagons by force, which force they delicately term 'pressing.' Some of our unkind neighbors came with the soldiers to point out the property to be pressed, and as 'might is right' in this case we are forced to abide the result. Fifty yards of blanket cloth were taken from the factory, valued at sixty dollars. The horses and wagons were valued at $1250.00 for which we received $680.00 One of our neighbors, accompanied by his wife, made himself very officious in pointing out to these armed men the places where our horses and wagons could be found. A Dr. Rhea also did what he could to assist the soldiers in taking our property. After they had selected a wagon, Rhea induced them to exchange for a new one belonging to Br. George Rankin. Of course the exchange was soon made. They selected six wagons and as many harnesses, and then ordered the Brethren to bring forward eleven horses, and having an extra horse which they had taken by force, they were harnessed and attached to the wagons. The Brethren did not think it wise to disregard the orders, but made the teams ready and started that evening for Bowling Green. The Brethren re- THE MANIFESTO. 81 turned on the 30th and had with them, three of the poorest horses that were taken. An unpleasant neighbor was in Bowling Green and accosted Br. Urban with a sarcastic smile,�'Well, Urban, if you had been as good a southern rents' man as I am, you could have kept all your horses.' Br. Urban's only reply was,�'I did not know that they worked by that rule.' {To be continued.)
