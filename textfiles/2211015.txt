To perceive where one is wrong is the only sure way... 'To perceive where one is wrong is the only sure way of reaching the right. Every time an error is corrected, a delusion banished, a deficiency supplied, a fault overcome, progress is made, and he who makes it occupies a higher plane than before. But for this result it is needful that he freely admit and acknowledge his error, otherwise he cannot abandon it. Instead of being ashamed to do this, he should be ashamed to hide it and to pretend he has not erred. And those to whom such candid confession is made will, if they are wise and kind, offer help and encouragement instead of scorn or censure, thus aiding instead of crushing the good work.'
