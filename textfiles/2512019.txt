Harvard, Mass. Nov. 1895. The constant rotation of the seasons tell us that progress is the key-note to all things, not only in the material but in the intellectual, scientific and spiritual world. Who can compare the present times with those of half a century ago and not exclaim with wonder upon the changes time has produced? What will the next fifty years do for us? Lately the town of Ayer has been visited by burglars and they did not forget to give us a call. They have broken into our barn three times and made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the Office but the tooting of an old campaign horn informed them they would not be welcome. This is Thanksgiving month and we have indeed cause to be thankful. Our dear gospel friends of Enfield, Conn., whose works sustain their reputation for generosity, sent to us some very fine apples. Never in the history of this Society has it been so completely destitute of this desirable fruit as this year. With hearts full of gratitude we obey the injunction of the apostle,In love remember one another. Marda M. Bullard.
