Enemies Have you enemies? Go straight on, and mind them not. If they block up your path, walk arounc them, and do your duty regardless o: their spite. A man who has no enemies is seldom good for anything; h is made of that kind of material whici is so easily worked that everyone has a hand in it. A sterling character—on who thinks for himself, and speak what he thinks—is always sure to hav enemies. They are as necessary to him as fresh air; they keep him alive anc active. A celebrated character, who was surrounded with enemies, used to remark: 'They are sparks which, i: you do not blow, will go out of them selves.' Let this be your feeling whil endeavoring to live down the scanda of those who are bitter against you. I: you stop to dispute, you do but as they desire, and open the way for more abuse. Let the poor fellows talk ; there will be a reaction if you perform but your duty, and hundreds who were once alienated from you will flock to you and acknowledge their error. Alexander's Messenger.
