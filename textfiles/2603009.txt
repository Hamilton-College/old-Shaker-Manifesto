MEDITATIONS. By Oliver C. Hampton. There's peace in the knowledge 'Thy will is best' When sorrow or danger are near, It causes our bark on the billows to rest, And calms the dark waves of despair. There's peace in forgiveness, though oft we offend; 'Tis the elixir of life, And silence is better by far than descending To angry contention and strife. THE MANIFESTO. 47 There's Heavenly peace in the union of souls, Far more than in folly and mirth, And the church where this halcyon union controls, Is the happiest region on earth. Beloved Mother Lucy once said to the Church, 'Your union will yet be your all,' And is it not best to look well to our ways And see that we live to this call ? There's peace in confession of every known sin, For sweet consolation ensues ; Yea! here the fruitions of heaven begin And holy at-one-ment accrues. There's peace in forbearance and patience, withal, And charity has its reward, When we the sore trials and sorrows forestall Of dear waiting saints of the Lord. Then let us all seek the rich treasures of peace And walk in obedience and love, And build up the Church in a holy increase And look for the light from above. What are we here for but to work for the cause Of righteousness, purity, peace, To cleave to the Lord and obey his just laws And from sinful negations to cease. To leave all our toil and our labor severe For those who succeed us to share, Surrender our talents, and all that we are, For still higher realms to prepare. Union Village, O.
