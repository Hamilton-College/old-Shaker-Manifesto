East Canterbury N. H. Aug. 1898. Not for ten years, at least, has such a heavy crop of hay presented itself for storage. We shall not pull down our barns 'and build greater,' however, tho ingenuity has been taxt to its utmost to take advantage of all available space of shelter for the same. The upland haying closed on the 15th inst. Early apples furnish abundant dessert, and late varieties are to be not a whit behind except in time. We have occasion to be very grateful that this New England staple is so prolific. The Baldwin, Virgin and Porter varieties are especially full and fine. A large strawberry bed is gradually establishing itself in the midst of the vegetable garden, and next year we may write more particular statistics. Ensilage corn has far outstript the human race, being twelve feet tall at present writing, and some one ventures the perti nent fact that it is co(r)nstantly growing.

A heavy crop of peaches is weighing down the branches of the trees, but quite lifting us up at the prospect. Peach year comes here only once in seven, so say old residents, hence is a special favorite. Sisters visit neighboring beaches at this season to solicit patronage for our manufactures. Eeports from them strike a chord not inharmonious with Home Notes and we are glad to remember that in seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness to us are ensured 'all these things' necessary to maintain the representation of that kingdom on the earth.
