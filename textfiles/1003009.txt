Virtue of Home Love No man can safely go abroad that does not love to stay at home ; no man can safely speak that does not willingly hold his tongue ; no man can safely govern, that would not cheerfully become subject; no man can safely command, that has not truly learned to obey ; and no man can safely rejoice, but he that has the testimony of a good conscience. Thomas a Kempis
