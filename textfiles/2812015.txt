DAY BY DAY. By Susan Coolidge. If I were told that I must die tomorrow, That the next sun Which sinks should bear me past all fear and sorrow For any one, All the fight fought, and all the short journey through, What should I do? I do not think that I should shrink or falter, But just go on Doing my work, nor change nor seek to alter Aught that i s done; But rise, and move, and love, and smile, and pray For one more day. And lying down at night for a last sleeping Say in the Ear Which hearkens ever: 'Lord, within Thy keeping How should I fear? And when to-morrow brings Thee nearer still, Do Thou Thy will.' I might not sleep for awe; but peaceful tender, My soul would lie All the night long; and when the morningsplendor Flashed o'er the sky I think that I could smile, and calmly say 'It is His day!' Let me keep on, abiding and unfearing Thy will alway:Selected. Through a long century's ripening fruition Or a short day's; Thou canst not come too soon, and I can wait If Thou come late. Selected.
