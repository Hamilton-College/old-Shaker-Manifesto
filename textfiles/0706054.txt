True religion True religion. We have made religion the performance of certain duties to the church ; but it is doing the duties of life. A true religion sees the hearth as pure as the altar, and man as holy as God. I would not see a single true or holy thing made less true or holy. I would only place the crown of holiness on what nature makes sacred. I would not have life void of that tender feeling that rises into a hymn or melts into a prayer; but I would not see it counterfeited and made a mockeiy. We have been set the lesson of righteousness so long that worship is hardly more than throwing over the face the mask of pious expressions. Paul said, 'Abstain from all appearance of evil.' A higher counsel would say, 'Abstain from all evil.' We must obey the decalogue of conscience, not of expedience. Life should not be lowered to the convenience of our desires. It should be held to the mark of divine commandment. New Age L. W. K. in New Age
