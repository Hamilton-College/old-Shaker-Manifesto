Molded Crushed Wheat While the boiled or steam crushed wheat is still warm, pour it into molds slightly wet, and let it stand several hours, or until quite cold and loose at the edges ; then turn it out on a dish of corresponding shape, an oval mold on a platter, a round mold on a plate or saucer; if to be dished on the table, use a large mold ; if to be brought on already dished, tea-cup molds, served in saucers with trimmings, look nicely. After cooked wheat is once cold, it cannot be warmed and mashed up with hot water and then molded; long steaming only can restore any of its fluidity, but even then it will not be so good nor mold so readily as when first cooked.
