Other World Order Other Wo eld Ordeh; Suggestions and Conclusions thereon, by William White, London 1876. The author claims to be the sun of Quaker parents, but has on his religious pilgrimage through life passed through several of the theological isms, andnow confidently asks,â€”'Who knows anything of the order of the other world?' He then contends 'that there is place and use in the divine economy for all varieties of men and women; and that there is not any one, however perverse or insignificant, who is not created for some function in universal humanity.' The whole work breathes a liberality and trust in God that is very acceptable, and must commend itself to the liberal intelligence of the di.y. London; E. W. Allen, 11 Ava Maria Lane, E. C.
