CHRISTMAS MUSINGS. ELIJAH MYRICK 'The Son of God,' ''Our Savior3' I etc., are appellations leading the mind to the man Jesus, as iu some special or peculiar sense the Savior, instead of the way, the truth, and the life, as taught, and lived by him. In recognition of the revelation to Peter, of the fatherhood of God, and the Sonship of man, he replies, I say also unto thee, that thou art, Peter, the Christ the Son of God etc. ' True Saviors they may well be called�All those who teach us how To save ourselves the quickest way, Stop sinning1, stop it now. ' From the consequences of sin�of violated law, there is do savior, mediator, no vicarious cancellation. We are related to universal laws which cannot be broken, though we may injure ourselves in the attempt; loss and suffering is the penalty. Knowledge and obedience are the true saviors. Admonition, counsel, chastening of experience, and the torch of an enlightened conscience are helps ; 'but salvation obtains only on ones own fidelity to duty, to light and reason. Those who have ascended nearest the apex of human possibilities, are saviors, inasmuch as they draw such as make all needful sacrifices, and bear a daily cross against those passions and appetites which lead downward until they become fledged, and the cross becomes wings on which to rise into superior pleasures. Happiness, joy, heaven. Salvation rests not on the merits or authority of any one, it is patent to all. What one has done another can do. We have a splendid example in the drviuely inspired, and heroic Hebrew youth, of the angelic life, and true man ; the then, highest mortal standard of the divine. But in no sense a celestial aborigine�an exotic transplanted to earth. Whatever might have been his advantages of birth, he was a human mortal, like his brethren, and in the same school of experience. 'Was he a man like us? Ah.! let us try, if we, then, too, may be such men as he.' Dependence on pattern saints and saviors, has ever been an incubus on human advancement. Orphan children clinging to the garments of their ancestors long ago departed, hoping to extract life from what once covered the living, accepting embalmed virtue for living bread, can never progress to manly stature, aggressive against the citadel of error, pnd sin. They are yet eating manna with their fathers in the wilderness. They do not carry the torch of truth in their own hands, and overcome the world, and reject its substitutions by walking in the way the truth and the life. We cannot serve God, and Jesus, in the way we can serve our fellow-beings. Our praises confer no benefit on them. But we can stimulate and encourage our fellow-beings, and so by our influence and support help to save those who will help themselves. We may practice sanctimonious foolishness in remembrance that our worthy ancestors drove the wild beasts away, felled the forests, and went into partnei*ship with the willing earth forthem^ans of subsistence. But this will not bring corn to us, unless we fulfill our part of the contract. There are many saviors to-day, those who have been raised up, and are drawing others up, bidding them take courage, and work for the growth of their souls�the Christ within�yea, and do the greater works, for God is not exhausted, nor the fount of inspiration dried up. Christ is on earth to-day calling through many a medium ; ' Come unto me, all ye who are heavy laden.' Humanity requires something more than the dry bones of historic theology, Christ is the medium to-day, through which God pours light into the world, developing mediums�saviors for time's use ; leading into brotherly and sisterly unity, and that pathway will be strewn with the bright blossoming efforts to save every sinner, by giving to him or her a drink from the fountain of love, and sweetly expressed hope. It has been the effort of professed Christianity to convert its heroes, its pattern saints, into fetich idols. Instead of lighting by their torch, and passing it from hand to hand, they have interposed their dead bodies to shut put the light. Like many another savior Jesus manifested Christ. 'But do not call him God, while all can scan Page after page that prove him but a man; Yea rather call him by his chosen name, The Son of man. Yet let us strive in all that's good and great, His noble life of love to imitate; And tho' he was a man of favored birth, A mortal light-house on this darkened earth. Yet he like other men was once a boy, A helpless babe, his parents hope and joy; Which is the path which angels all have trod, While we, thro' Christ, with him are Sons of God.' Harvard, 3Iass.
