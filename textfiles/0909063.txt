Mixture for Cleaning Paint Dissolve two ounces of soda in a quart of hot water, which will make a ready and useful solution for cleaning old painted work preparatory to repainting. The mixture, in the above proportions, should be used when warm, and the woodwork afterward washed with water to remove the remains of the soda. A hint for the laundry : Linen may be glazed by adding a teaspoonful of salt and one of finely-scraped soap to a pint of starch.
