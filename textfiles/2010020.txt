Watervliet, N. Y. Sept. 2. The Manifesto for September is at hand with much to encourage and interest us. In looking over the Notes about Home, I find nolhing from the Valley to inform our Brethren and Sisters in other parts of the vineyard that we are laboring for a full share in the gospel harvest, although as of old the harvest is great and consecrated laborers are few; yet these few are earnest, zealous souls working out their own salvation from sin, and as earnest for the elevation of others who may seek help. The South Family have harvested a fair crop of hay, rye and oats, and now the farmers are preparing the ground for winter grain We have commeuti-d canninu: tomatoes which bid fair to \ ield a g&gt;od crop if these cold nights do not hring on the t arly frosts. We have been moving our canning department to make it more convenient for the Sisters and to economize our time in handling the goods. A small company went last week on an excursion to our Mohawk valley farm and found the B.oom corn and Indian corn looking quite well. The rain came just in time for earing. We had harvested a fine crop of oats and threshed them by steam power while on the field. We obtained 578 bushels. We are now making some more ch:mgi s, and have taken down our old dwelling and are building a new d liry near the family dwelling. O. B.
