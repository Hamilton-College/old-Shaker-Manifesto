SUBJECTS FOR THOUGHT. I tell you to bo honest in your dealing*', take no advantage even of a child. Be conscientious in your bargains. Have a single eye and a single heart. Seek not to be shrewd. Be not ashamed to be called simple. A cunning man is never a firm man, but an honest man is. A double minded man is always unstable; a man of faith is always as firm as a rock. I tell you there is a sacred connection between honesty and faith; honesty is faith applied to worldly things, and faith is honesty quickened by the Spirit to the use of heavenly things. Vanity Fair.
