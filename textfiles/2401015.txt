When this number of our Manifesto reaches us, we shall stand at the portal of a New Year, recognizing the fact that this New Year will be to us what the Old Year has made it. If it has been our earnest labor all along the past months to carry out the honest intentions of last New Year, when we could say, 'Build thee more stately mansions O my soul, As the swift seasons roll' we are now more fully expanded into a noble Christian character. How beautiful is ideal life as it pictures itself before us, when we are on some 'Mount of Transfiguration.' But the possession of that ideal comes not through observation. 'When the humblest duties of life are performed with a cheerful patience; when the left hand hardly knows what the right does; when we can sacrifice ourselves in little acts in which we feel no glory at all' then the perfect character is growing within us though we may know nothing of it, save the restful assurance that we, by aiming to be faithful in little things, are reaching our highest possibilities. We read with pleasure the Centennial observances, of Enfield and Shirley, and wonder why we could not have done as well, when it was so often agitated in our Society previous to the closing of our Century. Many thanks to the contributor of 'A Paraphrase on Taking Offence' in Dec. No. When we have learned this lesson much of the vinegar of life will be transformed to the oil of peace; for the effort to guard and care for 'I, mine, and me,' is the foundation of most of life's inharmonies. Amelia J. Calver Center Family Dec. 1893. Winter has begun. We are not as fully prepared for it as desirable, still can not complain seeing much has been accomplished. Our farmer deacon has made quite an alteration in the corn barn which we think will prove to be a substantial improvement. The change consists in having stanchions that swing around giving the animals greater liberty of movement of the heads. They are also supplied with pure, fresh water while in the stall. This being Sabbath day we of the Center family attended meeting at the Church and had an interesting season. Several speakers gave voice to sentiments that were profitable and instructive and many if not all present felt it good to be there. 18 THE MANIFESTO. Our religious gatherings should always be of an uplifting nature to those assembled. 'Gather my saints together they that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.' We make sacrifices with the idea of leaving the inferior and ignoble for the superior and noble, the lower for the higher; hence, we leave the world with its selfishness and wrong-doing for a right manner of life, and to all who wish for a better condition of things than obtains in t!;e world we say, 'Come, and let him that heareth say come, and whosoever will let him partake of the waters of life freely.' Timothy D. Rayson North Family Dec. 1893. Oue ever welcome Manifesto comes to us again full of noble thought and deeds of service. How rich we feel in having the treasures opened to us of so many pure, beautiful and aspiring souls, devoted to the same cause and interest as our own. You all, we presume and trust, had a good, earnest, Thanksgiving meeting, and partook of a good Thanksgiving dinner. We enjoyed the day very much, as we were very kindly invited by our Canaan friends to spend the day with them, which we did, arriving there about 9 a. m. Held a good, free meeting, and partook of a beautiful vegetarian dinner. You will say it must have been a vegetarian dinner if it was beautiful, for who would think of describing a table set out with pieces of dead animals and birds, as beautiful? Our table truly was beautiful and replete with good vegetables, breads, sauces, jellies, fruits, nuts, etc., and yet some will say they can not give up the use of flesh as food as they have nothing to take its place. This excuse indicates, we think, a lack of faith and resolution. However, the treat of the day was the afternoon meeting. We were entertained by the members of the 'Ethical Floral Circle' who meet once a week under the guidance and training of Sister Emily Offord. Their motto is 'Cultivate the intel- lect. Improve the mind. Refine the manners.' And we can truly say they give evidence of progress towards their motto. The young Brethren and Sisters, boys and girls, did themselves great credit. It was a surprise and a treat, We reached home about dusk, having spent a memorable Thanksgiving Day. When we think of the blessings and comforts we enjoy, and look beyond into the towns and cities of the children of this world, our hearts ai-e subdued in sadness, and we would that we could do something to help to rectify the wrongs and relieve the oppressions under which the unfortunate, the weak, the ignorant, suffer. Some of us feel concerned about these matters, and think Believers should give time and attention to the study of the methods by which the landlord and usurer filches the produce of the toiler. It certainly is not well for Believers to be ignorant of, and to shut their eyes and ears to the distressful conditions existing in the outer world. The root of industrial distress undoubtedly lies in bad land laws. A system that permits a man to own land upon which his fellow men must earn their living and to tax them on the added value accruing by their labor and the increase of population, is unjust. This and the use of metals as money and the consequent usury laws are the seed bed of millionares and paupers. The law was to go forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, and Believers certainly should have a testi- mony on such matters. , We would at the opening of the New Year renew with our gospel kindred, our vows of consecration to our high and holy calling, and resolve to do all we can the coming year to bring ourselves and the conditions around us a little nearer to where our faith would have us. Walter S. Shepherd West Pittsfield, Mass. Dec. 1893. / Only a few days and the grand Columbian year will have closed its existence. THE MANIFESTO. 19 It seems hardly possible that its race can have been run so quickly. What joys and sorrows, what hopes and disappointments, what successes and failures, what achievements and deprivations, are chronicled on the pages of its history. The rapidly passing moments silently, yet forcibily seem to say, we are hastily bearing each soul over life's fitful height, to the bounds of eternity. The past few days have produced beautiful weather; and Br. Ira Lawson's verdict is, that sleighing in this early part of the season, has not been surpassed in the past twenty-five years. Present appearances betoken a thaw. The supply of wood for another winter is mostly drawn to the mill, and much of it sawed. Seventy acres of land have been plowed and prepared for the sowing of oats. Eight hundred loads of manure have been drawn and spread on thirty more acres to bring it in condition for the production of other crops. Dairy roof has been newly shingled; and an addition of 90x18 ft., to the building used for storage and wood-house, is just completed. May the dawn of the New Year bring the smile of gladness to all the kind readers of The Manifesto, and be fraught with increased blessings for all who are striving to live a life of true holiness.
