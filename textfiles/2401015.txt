West Pittsfield, Mass. Dec. 1893. / Only a few days and the grand Columbian year will have closed its existence. THE MANIFESTO. 19 It seems hardly possible that its race can have been run so quickly. What joys and sorrows, what hopes and disappointments, what successes and failures, what achievements and deprivations, are chronicled on the pages of its history. The rapidly passing moments silently, yet forcibily seem to say, we are hastily bearing each soul over life's fitful height, to the bounds of eternity. The past few days have produced beautiful weather; and Br. Ira Lawson's verdict is, that sleighing in this early part of the season, has not been surpassed in the past twenty-five years. Present appearances betoken a thaw. The supply of wood for another winter is mostly drawn to the mill, and much of it sawed. Seventy acres of land have been plowed and prepared for the sowing of oats. Eight hundred loads of manure have been drawn and spread on thirty more acres to bring it in condition for the production of other crops. Dairy roof has been newly shingled; and an addition of 90x18 ft., to the building used for storage and wood-house, is just completed. May the dawn of the New Year bring the smile of gladness to all the kind readers of The Manifesto, and be fraught with increased blessings for all who are striving to live a life of true holiness.
