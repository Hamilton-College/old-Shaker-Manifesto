GOD KNOWS. ELIZABETH MARTIN. Yea it is a consolation That that Potentate divine, With an eye of justice, seeth All the workings of the mind. Man may judge by false appearance, And our purposes condemn ; But we know when God approreth And for justice look to Him. Every wrong shall yet be righted; Every scale be balanced true; Have we fruitful lives or blighted, God will yet dispense our due. Let us trust with Him the issue, While we act the noble part; Not with vengeful feelings pressing, But with honest, Christian heart. Canterbury, N. H.
