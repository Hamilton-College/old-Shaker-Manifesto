Devilled eggs Devilled Eggs.â€”Boil six eggs ten minutes, then lay in cold water till cold ; then cut in halves, slicing a little off the bottom of each, so they will stand upright. Remove the yolks, and rub a smooth paste with a little melted butter, a bit each of cayenne and mustard, and a teaspoonful of vinegar. Fill the hollow whites with this, and send to the table upon a bed of chopped white cabbage. Lettuce may be used instead of cabbage, if in season, and a spoonful should be used with half an egg.
