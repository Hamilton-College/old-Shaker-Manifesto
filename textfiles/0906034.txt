The contributed articles are from noble pens, guided by those living noble lives. The ' Correspondence ' department will give an insight into what some have been pleased to term ' monastic lives' among the Shakers.

The music will do good to the heart of every one thirsting to do and live betterâ€”all can learn and sing it. The ' Kind toords to us' though small, mean a great deal and are so appreciated. Wishing love and good will to all, we send the Manifesto to the four winds to light often times, we hope, on some hearts whom it can cheer to live better and for Grod, instead of for the pleasures of the flesh in selfishness.
