TOIL AND WIN. 'It God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.'Phil, ii, 13. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Would'st thou stand in triumph with the brave, And wear the laurel wreath of praise? 2. Would'st thou wear in lionor vestal robes, And dwell in light of perfect day ? 3. Would'st thou live in harmony and love, Apart from strife of sin and woe? Would'st thou share the treasures of the true, The recompense of righteous ways? Then Joining in sweet melodies of song,'Mid beauties that will not decay ? Then Give thro'faith the sacrifice required, The heaven of heavens to know. Control toil for the gaining of the prize, The blessing of the earnest heart; take not for wearing garments old, The spotted folds of sin and shame, ev'ry passion of the mind, Thy restless tho't subdue in pray'r, Effort alone will for thee obtain, The substance of the better part. Wash, and be cleansed by the living truth, Thus merit what thy soul would' stgain. Bright is the goal that thy winning waits When endless peace thy soul may share.
