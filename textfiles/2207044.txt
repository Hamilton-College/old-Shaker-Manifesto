New England Magazine All interested in educational and Christian work will turn to the article on 'General Armstrong and the Hampton Institute,' by Edwin H. Start in the New England Magazine for June. It deals with the aims and methods of the institution, and describes minutely the internal machinery of this great sociological experiment. An account is given of the progress of the work since the founding of the institution, and a biographical sketch of General Samuel Chapman Armstrong adds interest to the whole. The article is finely illustrated from photographs and sketches made on the spot, the management of the New England Magazine having sent the author and artist to Hampton, Va., to prepare the article leisurely to get saturated with the ideas of the school and the work.
