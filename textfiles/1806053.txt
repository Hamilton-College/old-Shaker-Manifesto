Minister to Great Britain; the fourth of a series of scholarly articles on Post-Talmudic Hebrew Literature, by Dr. Bernhard Pick; the article on Hans Sachs, the cobbler-poet of Nuremberg, from the Westminster lieview, is very curious; Snowed-up in Arcady, by Rev. Dr. Jessopp is one of the most enjoyable pa-pers found in last month's English magazines; Cardinal Manning's Plea for the Worthless, is very timely, and worth universal reading; the critique upon Mr. Froude's West Indies is sound and appreciative ; the Earl of Meath gives a genial account of 'A model Factory' in England; Miss Frances Power Cobbe discusses the 'Education of the Emotions,' and opens up a suggestive train of thought, as also does the paper on 'Domestic Service and Democracy.' The Editorial miscellany, entitled, ' Current Thought,' is unusually full and interesting. The issue contains 196 pages, in large type; an extraordinary amount of high class literature for the price of $1.00 a year, or 10 cents a copy. John B.
