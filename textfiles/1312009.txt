AFTER MANY TRIALS. MARY WHITCHER. We would a providence discern In all the seeming ills of life ; But if foreseen we might not learn To trust the Father in the strife. Some things transpire for want of care. A power that's given for our use; The ills arising we should bear, And own the penance of abuse Our God is light, and gives us day Wherein to labor and be wise; His paths are strait, but in his way The only course of safety lies. Let us arise and walk with God, And shun the heedless paths of ill; He cannot alter, but our good Lies in accordance with his will. Canterbury, N. H.
