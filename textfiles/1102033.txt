HOW OUR SETH TALKS A boy I know who, if telling The truth, daily dies some new death: No martyr — religion compelling — Has suffered so much as our Seth ! He ' roasts ' all the summer, and ' freezes ' As soon as autumnal winds blow ; He has his ' death-cold,' if he sneezes ; Is 'buried ' in one foot of snow. He's ' starving ' before he has dinner, He's '' stuffed ' like a turkey when through; He's ' tickled to death ' when he's winner, And 'ready to die' when 'tis you. He's 'just tired to death ' when he only Has run a short race with his mates ; If kept in by the rain, he grows lonely,— He ' can't live till night,'— so he states. He's ' dying to know ' what comes after, In tales that he reads with delight; Or ' thought he would die' of much laughter, Or ' nearly expired ' with affright. Thus over and over we hear it,— This dismal death-song that he sings; Yet body and soul is still joined to spirit, And Seth has developed no wings!
