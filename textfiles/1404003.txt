'NO OTHER GODS.' Marion Johnson. ' No other gods ! ' From Sinai's top In trumpet tones it came; Revealed in words of living fire In darkness, smoke and flame. A gift to Israel's chosen band, This law divine and pure ; Engraven by Jehovah's hand, On stony tablets sure. Far down the dim deep ages past. Its echoes reach our ears ; We catch it mid the tempest tossed Of doubts and hopes and fears. No other gods ! Have we ne'er bowed In homage, or adored? Have we built shrines or altars reared Save only to the Lord? Alas ! Shall we not guilty stand Before this stern decree ; That to the god of worldliness We oft have bent the knee? We would return to Thee, O God, With loyal heart and hand; And render that allegiance Which thy pure laws demand. Canterbury, N. H.
