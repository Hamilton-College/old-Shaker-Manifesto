KIND WORDS. Polly Rupe. What the dew is to the flower, Gentle words are to the soul; And a blessing to the giver, And so dear to the receiver, We should never withhold. Gentle words kindly spoken, Often soothes the troubled mind, While links of love are broken, By words that are unkind. Then 0, the gentle spirit, My constant guardian be, Do to others be ray motto, As I'd have them do to me. Pleasant Sill, Ky.
