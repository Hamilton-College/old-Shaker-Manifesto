'West Pittsfield, Mass. Nov. 5, 1892. Foe three days it has drizzled, with a smart'shower at long intervals to vary the monotony. Once the sun really peeped out, but was evidently disheartened by the general dreariness of the aspect, as it soon disappeared, swallowed up in a big, black cloud. We made some philosophical reflections on the fleeting nature of all earthly things. As we picked our way along the muddy street, swaying umbrella in hand, we were grateful that the sunshine of our lives was not wholly dependent upon atmospheric conditions. Nay, we have within ourselves every element necessary for a firstclass 'Sunshine Factory,' and we may keep a supply in reserve, to use when the elements without are not propitious. The rain may be very much needed to replenish the springs, as water, in most streams and lakes in our vicinity is quite low. It is said that the water in Pontoosuc Lake was never so low. This lake is about two miles north of Pittsfield. Its banks are shaded by pine trees, and throughout the summer a steamer and many row-boats are in constant requisition, as it is the pleasure seekers favorite resort. We had excellent weather in which to gather the crops. Apples prove to be more abundant than was expected at first; potatoes also are very good in quantity and quality. We were somewhat alarmed about ten days ago at seeing flames rising in the woods north of us. All who were able hastened to assist in putting out the fire, but in spite of vigorous efforts, it continued to burn for several days until quenched by the rain. Br. Ira says it burned a section of nearly fifty acres, but thinks no great damage was done, as it did not burn so deeply as to injure the growth of the trees. A fresh coat of paint on some of the buildings at Second Family makes them brighter and more home-like. The discovery of this great and beautiful land was honored by our scholars with appropriate exercises. Our neighboring city, Pittsfield, carried to a successful close quite an interesting programme. About thirty business men had floats in the Grand Parade of the day to exhibit their varied kinds of goods. At the solicitation of the Committee of Arrangements Br. Ira permitted his millers to turn out our mill team and take part with the others. By placing boards across the top of the carriage, a platform was made on which to set a huge mill-stone, the 'sign of the honest miller.' Barrels of flour and bags of corn were open to show their contents, while polished scales and shovels, added to the beauty of the float. Bunting and flags were profusely used in the decorations. The carriage was drawn by six large horses, and presented a very fine appearance. Others evidently agreed with us, as it was assigned a place at the head of the long line of floats. E. B.
