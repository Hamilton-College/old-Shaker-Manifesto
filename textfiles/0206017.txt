Our Happiness BT DANIEL ORCUTT The happiness derived from the performance of good deeds is of the highest, of the purest kind; it is, indeed, the only lasting enjoyment. The vilest sinner on the earth, if he has done one good action, has a perception of this truth. Then how strange that millions should risk their health, their life, and their eternal happiness upon the pursuit of those pleasures which end in pain, and should entirely neglect this source of enjoyment, which is accessible to all, and Avhich not only brightens life, but removes the sting of death. Since this life is a preparatory state, to be succeeded by one in which every spiritual power will be greatly expanded, and every capacity for happiness or misery will be greatly enlarged; and since the state of our future being will be determined by the manner in Avhich this brief opening of our existence is spent, is it not surprising that any intelligent being should over-estimate and depend upon the fleeting things of Time ? Should not the thought, ' I must live forever,' shut every eye, and turn every heart from these trifles, and arouse every power of the soul to the work of preparation for eternity.
