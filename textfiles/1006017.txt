North Union, O., May 2, 1880 Editor Shaker Manifesto: You made the motion, and it is ably seconded, that the April number of The Manifesto was full of grand articles. While agreeing entirely with you as to the matter in that number generally, and with W. H. Bussell most cordially in his appreciation of Brother 0. C. Hampton's article, specially, still I must say, as 1 have often said, every new issue of our Monthly, since the first number, has been an advance on the last. And especially is this the case with the last two — April, showing the goal of the Shaker race, in Bro. Oliver's beautifully simple style; and May, marking decidedly advanced steps on the road to that goal, by half a'dozen authors. Sure enough, what will purity do for us'? The snow is pure —if it be the result of cold, calculating selfishness. The Christian's heavenly home is the Temple of God. ' Ye are the Temple of God.' In the confidence, esteem and love of our fellow beings of like faith and practice, we must find our heavenly home, if heavenly home we ever find. ' What boots it then to fiy from pole to pole, Hang o'er the sun, and with the comets roll ? What boots it then in foreign lands to roam, If thou, poor man, a stranger art at home ? ' Those prophetic and allegorical warninghints, in the May number ! What a pity that those who most need such hints should be the last to heed and profit by them ! 1 am scarcely able to pen these few lines, owing to failing health; but feel that I cannot rest on my bed without making an effort to express my heartfelt gratitude to all concerned, for their efforts in spreading the light of life, both at home and abroad. In much love, your brother, Watson Andrews.
