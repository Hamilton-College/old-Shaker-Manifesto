Our Community in Canterbury is elevated some nine hundred feet above the city of Boston, and full one hundred feet above the streams and ponds in our vicinity, so that it is quite impracticable, at present, to use water as a motive power for machinery unless we go some distance from home. At the first family we use a twenty-five horse power engine for laundry purposes and the running of several knitting machines. For the sawing of cord-wood we use an engine of six horse-power; one in the printing office of three horse-power and one in the dairy of one horse-power. This last mentioned is a 'Davey Safety Engine,' and it is beyond dispute, a safety engine, in the charge of the inexperienced or even of a child. At the North family they have a six horse-power engine for their laundry, their dairy and for the sawing of wood. Our ice harvest in January was of the best quality, and not less than one hundred and fifty tons were secured for the use of our family. The ice, when cut, was sixteen inches in thickness. From our herdsman we have this item:� that a Jersey cow gave ninety-nine quarts of milk in seven days, and from this was obtained six pounds of butter. This we call doing pretty well on the hill-sides of New Hampshire. * Feb. 1891. Beloved Editoi::�The absence of 'Home Notes' from Canterbury, in the Manifestos of 1891 is no sign that we are away from home, or that its interests are not still guarded by as valiant soldiers as held the fort throughout the good old year, 1890. It is so natural to depend upon ready pens and willing hands that have served us in the past, that only the absence of a good thing brings us to a realization of the truth, that we should give as willingly as we have received. We are sternly aware that we have entered the second month of our spiritual New Year, which we pledged to make bright and glorious by renewed efforts of willing consecration. Some one says it would be well for us to pause between each month, long enough to settle our debit and credit accounts, spiritually, repent of all sin committed by seeking an honest confession and newness of life; thus enjoy twelve New Year's days where we have formerly had but one. A timely suggestion, the conscientious regard of which will insure us a place in that kingdom, forever increasing. At date of writing, our predicted storm has not commenced, and we meet for our Society service wherein we are blest to hold communion with the worlds above. The wires of spirit telegraphy of which our beloved Elder Giles spoke when at Canterbury last, are neither laid low by winter's fiercest blasts nor the wily attacks of any enemy. Our faith and trust in God's work is unshaken as are the granite rocks of New Hampshire to-day. Yea, we mean to be granite rock Christians. Thus, humbly remembering God's goodness, we fearlessly enter upon blustering March, as we sing� 'I'll brave the storm and breast the wave, The way of God to keep; For in the harvest of my life,� Its power, I would reap.'
