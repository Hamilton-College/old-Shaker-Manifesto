AN ACROSTIC Alpha Suggested by a recent visit to the Canterbury, N. H. Society. True-hearted, zealous in the right, Honestly seeking for the light. Each act a kindly deed: Seeking a crown of glory rare, Holding no cross too hard to bear, Asking no easy path through life— Knowing the world's a field of strife— Earning, when all of self has died, Right to come near the Father's side: Such is the Shaker's creed. 'Alpha,' Pascoag, R. I
