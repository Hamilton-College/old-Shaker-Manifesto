AN ERROR CRITICISED. Alonzo G. Hollister. 'One voice has many echoes.1' E. H. Britten, in Nineteenth Century Miracles, an instructive and meritorious work in the main, says 'Shakerism proves the imbecility of attempting to inaugurate in the earthly present. a system of asceticism which only belongs to our condition as pure spirits in the future.' This fling comes with ill- grace from one who claims to be a messenger of spiritual light, to lead people to higher plains of action and true knowledge, and when she comes to see its real bearing, 1 doubt not but she will wish it canceled. In the first place, it is not true unless to those who stand aloof like the eontemners of spiritualism, and treat with disdaiu that which they refuse to understand, or to take the trouble to investigate. In the second place, it has the character of a stumbling block in the path of all travelers seeking iinal attainments in the highest excellence. And by whom was this '' system of asceticism ' inaugurated but by that Divine Wisdom and Almighty Power, of which E. tl. B. claims to be in some degree the medial instrument, and says on page 226, kt Our- part is to keep our lamps trimmed and burning, and wait for the coming of the Heavenly Bridegroom whose name is�Divine Order.' It is true that mortals co-operated with the Almighty Power and Wisdom, and so they did in the introduction to mankind of modern spiritualism, ^lse neither could have b&gt;&gt;en established among men to stay. And the Wisdom which inaugurates, also proclaims that it is ''the comiug of the Ueaveuly Bridegroom' iu union with the Heavenly Bride, both of which are required to complete the Divine Order, and lay the fouudation on earth for its never ending increase, as really as it requires two, a male and -a female, to complete the earthly order, which in its original uucorrupted state, was typical of the heavenly and Divine. That it should be inaugurated and continue sustained for more than a century unrecognized and opposed in the midst of people who profess to wait for it with lodging desire, is rather a 'miracle' of power and wisdom quite the reverse of imbecility. The imbecility of inaugurating here a system of asceticism which u belongs to our condition as pure spirits in the future,' is certainly far from proved to those who by conforming to it, are enabled to overcome a carnal life within, which is ever at war with the spiritual, and to purify the heart from those desires and practices which would otherwise unfit them to dwell in the society of the wise, purified, ascended and harmonious intelligences inhabiting exalted spirit spheres. Spiritualism in its propagative, proselyting character, with its mediums and teachers going out from a free state and carrying with them the seeds of natural liberty, is a pulverizer of human creeds and superstition, and destroyer of systems which bind the conscience and limit man's spiritual development�is a levelor of conditions and promoter of human brotherhood, and prepares the way for the Divine Order to expand. It may be likened to Jacob's ladder, let down from the Divine Order in the heavens, and extending through ail grades of reasoning intelligence to the lowest intellectual capacity. The seed and substance of spiritualism is truth, which we welcome, while rejecting tbs chaff. Mt. Lebanon., N- Y.
