The Nutshell Cyclopedia A Unique Reference Work. A work that is really new, and unlike any other, is The Nutshell Cyclopedia. It is not intended to take the place of any other general cyclopedia, but to supplement every other, and whatever you have you will probably want the Nutshell, and if you have no other you will surely want it. It treats only live subjects, the facts concerning which are constantly changing, and the latest information concerning which is important. Probably threefourths of its contents will be found in no other cyclopedia, because the occurrences, and the facts, described are of later date than the publication of any other cyclopedia. Though the entire work will comprise probably 2,500 pages, it is sold at a price so low that any one can afford it, ranging from $1.75 for the complete work in Monthly Parts, to $3.20 for the same in four volumes, half morocco binding. The issue before us covers such important subjects as Coinage, Colorado, Columbian Celebration and Expositions, Commerce and Crops, bringing statistics down to 1894 (mostly a year later than to be found in any of the annuals) Congress, with list of the members, Connecticut, and so on. For sample Monthly Part send 4 cents postage to John B. Alden, Publisher, 57 Rose St., New York. THE MANIFESTO. tongue. And so this 'residue of the tenth' receives a tacit promise of literary life for a future generation. Thus rises slowly, our dear mother tongue from her original sin of slang to a sort of 'ticket of leave' existence until, perhaps by some imperceptible evolution, such elements are borne upward to comparative popularity. Such is the record of usage, and thus a dictionary becomes the language builder of the world. We do not regard the work so much as the sum total of four years labor, with its consequent speculative outlay of a million dollars, as that it is really the epitome of the world's scholarship, an encyclopedic microcosm, and as the practical development of the science of analysis, illustration and investigation, focussed and brought into line by the skill, experience and wonderful intuition of that modern personality, the Managing Editor. We believe every man of letters will give the work a hearty approval and 'honorable mention,' for The Standard Dictionary of Funk &amp; Wagnall may be regarded as the literary Pyramid of the world.
