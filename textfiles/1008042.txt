RULINGS OF 'THE GOLDEN RULE' For one to have the spirit and life of Christ is to be like Christ, and for one to be like Christ is to secure all that heaven has for any man. We shall be free from temptation only when we are free from sin. WTe shall be free from evil desires only when we are pure in heart. The moment that any one rightly apprehends Christ in his life and death, in his saving, teaching and grace5 he will gladly accept him as Saviour and Lord. ' Christian union is well,' says Phillips Brooks, ' but no courtesies between two regiments ever yet defeated the other army.' Have bickering, or jealousies, or exclusiveness ever done it, either? When the apostle said ' for me to live is Christ, to die is gain,' he gave utterance to a sentiment which has made the Christian world earnest in practical righteousness, and happy in the thought of its reward. If we daily seek those things which are true, lovely and of good report, the life beyond will be the fulfillment of our grandest plans, the realization of our highest ambitions, the completion of all we desired and lived for here. Some people talk about heaven as though it were located on some high bluff, so many feet wide and long, walled in with a high, strong fence, and its mansions built with brown stone fronts. But it is rather a blessed state of being; its security is its holiness, and its location is with Christ, wherever that is, and no one will be kept out who is like Christ in spirit and life.
