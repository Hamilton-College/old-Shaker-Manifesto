God help the Indian We feel an assurgiice, that in so flagrant a proposition, as that to transfer ' Poor Lo ' and Indian Bureau, to the untender mercies of the War Department, there will be a godly interposition and interference. Bad as the Indians are used by dishonest subordinates of the Interior, they would fare worse under Gen. Sherman's rule. In lieu of such a change, we offer an amendment to the Constitution, to abolish the War Department, and substitute a Bureau of Arbitration, to be presided over by an unwarlike individual as Secretary. And it will come to this yet. We hope, at least, the Cheyenne massacre will prove a blessing in disguise for the Indian.
