THE BEYOND [Contributed by Mary.] It seemeth such a little way to me, Across to that strange country- -the beyond: And yet not strange, for it has grown to be The home of those of whom I am so fond. What makes it seem familiar and most dear, As journeying friends bring distant regions near. So close it lies that when my sight is clear, I think I almost see the gleaming strand; I know I feel those who have gone from here Come near enough sometimes to touch my hand. I often think but for our veiled eyes, We should find heaven round about us lies. I cannot make it seem a day to dread When from this dear earth I shall journey out To that still dearer country of the dead, And join the loved ones I have dreamed about. I love this world, but I shall love to go And meet the friends who wait for me, I know. I never stand alone awhile and see The seal of death set on some well loved face, But that I think one more to welcome me When I shall cross the intervening space Between this land and that one over there- - One more to make the strange beyond more fair. And as for me there is no sting to death, And so the grave has lost its victory; It is but crossing, with a bated breath, And white set face, a little strip of sea, To fin 1 the loved ones waiting on the shore More beautiful, more precious than before.
