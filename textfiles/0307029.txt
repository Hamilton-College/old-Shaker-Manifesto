If we would not blush when reading the record of our lives... If we would not blush when reading the record of our lives, let them be in harmony with divinity ; have our deeds wrought in purity. Then they will be daguerreotyped in beautiful colors that, beneath the golden rays of the sun, will not fade, but blend with those of the spheres above, and upon our hearts will be reflected their glorious shades, causing us to glow with angelic beauty, and show forth the image of the heavenly. â€” Charlotte B.
