Rise above them RISE ABOVE THEMWhen friends (?) assail, and try to put thee down, Or foes deride, and ridicule or frown, Unless they boast a Caesar's bloody crown, Or other awe-inspiring renown, Rise above them. Make sure thine aims and purposes are right, Then girt thyself with courage for the fight, Clad in the well-proved mail of honor bright, The victory shall be thine—in manhood's might, Rise above them. Seek not to put them down—but be thine aim, With mild forbearance, to awaken shame, Show that you will not cringe to wealth or fame, Won at the cost of honor or good name, Rise above them. Be not disheartened by their envious jest, Measure thyself with them by inward test, With noble emulation, do your best— By making thyself greater—not them less. Rise above them. Hold up thine head and show thy kingly face, Worth, intellect, and energy I trace; These coins, well used, will purchase name and place Worth all the phantom honors many chase, Rise above them. Above them—not in petty influence, bought With filthy lucre—by the vain mass sought; But in the glory of great, god-like thought, By high integrity and culture taught, Rise above them.
