ADMONITIONS. Sophia Wayne. How oft when better thoughts persuade To choose an angel guide, We learn to feel contending force Is ever by our side. And so we often choose the ill, And leave the well undone, And then regret in silent tears The victory is not won. Oh, blessed spirit influence By which we should be led; Yet we are prone to disobey, Choose our own way instead. Then in the silent hours of night Will realize our loss, And chide ourselves as being Faithless followers of the cross. How hard it seems to overcome The subtle power of sin, Still, we can never reach the goal Unless we try to win. We must uproot all selfish pride, Or else we'll strive in vain To keep our guardians by our side, Or call them back again. Oh glorious truth our Mother taught, That by a true confession We conquer self, that we may gain The power of intercession. Kind spirit friends admonish us To seek the good and true, And if we take the path marked out They'll bear us safely through. Ballston, Spa. N. Y.
