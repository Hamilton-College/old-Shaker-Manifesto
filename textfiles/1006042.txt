Book Table The Very Valuable Series Of reprints being issued by I. K. Funk &amp; Co.» 10 and 12 Dey street, New York, we have heretofore alluded to most heartily. We wish all our readers would send and get catalogues, and satisfy themselves of the valuable work being performed by these enterprising publishers; and appreciating the value of their philanthropy, aid the good work by numerous subscriptions to the many good volumes they are issuing. Send ¦30 cents and get a sample volume, one of Knight's History of England, and then join us in complimenting the nobleness of displacing yellow-covered literature by that of value, and just as cheap. Lost truths of Christianity We have had laid on our table 'The Lost Truths op Chkisttanity ' — a book of exceeding interest, and one worthy of careful perusal and diligent study. The age we live in is a progressive one, truthward ; and in the seven chapters of this beautiful volume, many advances are made to correct many of the misapprehensions of our too commonly forced, erroneously religious educations. We do not agree with all the conclusions it arrives at; but there are so many grand assertions made therein, and so jointly with modern reason and purer religion that we withhold any criticism of its errors. The work is anonymously introduced to us, but it speaks for its author the extensive praise which few works of its class can do ; and so sincerely is it put forward as the honest convictions of its author, that it ' persuades men ' to a righteous way of thinking, which will inevitably lead to a more righteous way of living. The truths it aims to bring to light seem to have been lost to a very large number of people, who are, perhaps, too bigoted or self-sufficient to be taught, but to very many it will be hailed as a marvelous providence just in season.
