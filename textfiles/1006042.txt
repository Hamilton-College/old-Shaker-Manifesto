Lost truths of Christianity We have had laid on our table 'The Lost Truths op Chkisttanity ' â€” a book of exceeding interest, and one worthy of careful perusal and diligent study. The age we live in is a progressive one, truthward ; and in the seven chapters of this beautiful volume, many advances are made to correct many of the misapprehensions of our too commonly forced, erroneously religious educations. We do not agree with all the conclusions it arrives at; but there are so many grand assertions made therein, and so jointly with modern reason and purer religion that we withhold any criticism of its errors. The work is anonymously introduced to us, but it speaks for its author the extensive praise which few works of its class can do ; and so sincerely is it put forward as the honest convictions of its author, that it ' persuades men ' to a righteous way of thinking, which will inevitably lead to a more righteous way of living. The truths it aims to bring to light seem to have been lost to a very large number of people, who are, perhaps, too bigoted or self-sufficient to be taught, but to very many it will be hailed as a marvelous providence just in season.
