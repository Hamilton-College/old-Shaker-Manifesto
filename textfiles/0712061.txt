DUTY The path of duty is the way to glory; He that walks it, only thirsting For the right, learns to deaden Love of self, before his journey closes He shall find the stubborn thistle bursting Into glossy purples, which outredden All voluptuous garden roses, The path of Duty is the way to glory; He that ever following her commands, On with toil of heart and knees and hands, Thro' the long gorge to the far light has wo His path upward, and prevailed, Shall find the toppling crags of Duty scalec Are close upon the shining table lands, To which our God Himself is moon and sun Tennyson
