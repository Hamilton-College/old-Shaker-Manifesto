IS IT WORTH WHILE? BY ELLA C. G. PAGE. A Little yellow sunshine, and then the day is done; A little patient labot, and then comes set oJ sun ; A summer brief, an autumn, and then the winter's here; A few brief months swift passing, and then another year. Since life is rolling onward as swiftly as it can, Is it wortli while to envy and vex our fellowman? To cherish anger toward him whose span of life is brief, And vanishes as quickly as doth a falling leaf? Is it worth while to murmur because the way is rough? In the fast-falling even will sure'be rest enough. Is it worth while to love or hate intensely as we may? The night-fall waxeth nearer, and then is past the day. Just to journey on serenely and happy, if one can, Is best. If not contented, helpful to our fellow-man, Knowing around life's corner in a little time we go� To see? Ah, who can tell us? No mortal man doth know. Within that land Faith whispers the antidote is found To soothe fore'er from aching the keenest sorrow's wound. So although of that rare country no seer the bliss can show, � Let us press on in courage�we shall go home, and know.�Methuen. Mass.
