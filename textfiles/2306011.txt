GOD'S WORK GOES ON. [Contributed by N. Danforth.] God's work goes on in spite of war and famine, The dreaded pestilence, or baneful blight, Iu spite of all the selfish greed of mammon That toils amid the shadows of the night; In spite of evil hearts and hands essaying To crush the temple that we build upon, The law and order so divine obeying, [on. Unmoved by man's device, God's work goes Not always in a radiance of splendor, The brilliant dazzling of the noonday sun, But in the atmosphere serene and tender His mightiest miracles are daily done; [tals And though short-sighted and dull-witted morThemselves against his majesty array, Nor give him entrance through the heart's closed portals, God's work goes on, and will not make delay. No human power can interrupt its mission : As well attempt the planets to remove, Or change a single star from the position It holds amid the galaxy above; And so when all our plans seem unavailing, When busy hands and throbbing hearts are stilled, [ing, Doubt not, but rest assured, with faith unfailThat, if our plans are his, they'll be fulfilled. ï¿½Selected.
