Every girl should have the power to earn her own livelihood... Every girl should have the power to earn her own livelihood. Tt is a false position taken by many mothers to train up their daughters to be merely ornamental. Labor is honorable, and every person should do his or her share. Frugal husbandry and household prudence are the foundations of peace in the land. I advise all to be born of healthy mothers if they can. Health is essential to peace, and healthy mothers are essential to healthy children, and healthy children are essential to the training up of the world to peace and righteousness. Bring this influence into the Sabbath schools and churches. We want something better than dogmas and creeds. A few years ago it was thought a woman could not manage a winter school in this country because it was supposed necessary to thrash the boys. Now women are preferred, even in country schools, in winter, because that the mild power rules most effectually. This principle is growing in the community, and it will be carried out all through the management of our public prisons. Peace Advocate
