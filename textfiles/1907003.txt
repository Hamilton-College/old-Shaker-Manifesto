PRESS ON! Annie R. Stephens. Press on true soul! with patient firm endeavor, Tho' life's to thee a heavy load of care; Keeping thy heart in trust and hope forever, God helpeth those who bravely do and bear. What tho' there dawns for thee no glad tomorrow, And life's made cold by harsh, embittering scorns; What tho' thou wear'st the robe of grief and sorrow, And on thy brow a crown of many thorns. Press on true soul! e'en tho' the seed thou'st scattered, On barren and unwatered ground was sown ; Think not in vain was all thy toil expended, Because no blessedness of fruit is shown. There is no deed nor aspiration holy. But meets its recompense in realms above; And loving ones descend to bless the lowly, Who daily make their life, a work of love. Press on true soul! nor let thy footsteps falter, Tho' storms and shadows often intervene; They win the prize, whose purpose will not alter, They reach, tho goal who brave each adverse scene. All feet must pass the thorny road of trial, All hearts must suffer for the truthï¿½the right; And they who tread the way of self-denial, Are precious in our heavenly Father's sight. Press on true soul 1 no night but hath its morning, And God's all radiant love shall shine at last; Tho' ebon clouds eclipse the golden dawning, Faint not; the gloom of night will soon have passed. Therefore, press on through weary scenes of sadness, Through summer's heat, and winter's stormy strife; Thou soon shalt reach the vernal heights of gladness. Where blooms the summer of eternal life.
