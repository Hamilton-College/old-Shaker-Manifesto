Harvard, Mass. Feb. 1895. The first of this month is the coldest weather we have experienced this season. To-day the Oth the most blustering, mercury 14 below 0. According to prognosticators this is to be the coldest and most stormy month. So far the mercury has hovered around 0 most of the time. But if all without is secure, and our hearts are warm with Christian love and charity, what matters the storm? only that the poor and destitute must suffer. This touches the heart of every sympathetic Christian. Then there are those who 'go down to sea in ships.' What must their sufferings be in such storms? But would there be as much suffering, if fathers would cease robbing their homes to obtain that key which unlocks the doors to destitution and misery? HowT much better that our abodes should be opened by that key that unlocks the gates of paradise. Sleighing excellent, which the farmers delight to improve in logging. Our aged people endure the inclemency of our rough New England winter very well. No illness in Society at present, and hope we may live so wisely and be so protected that all may be well with us. We remember all our sister Societies and pray God to bless and prosper them. Mar da M. Bullard.
