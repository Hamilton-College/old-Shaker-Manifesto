The Ladies' Home Journal MODERN CHANGES IN LITERATURE. The working author, he whose ink is bread, recognizes more than ever before the commercial side of literature as a most potent factor in his work, says a writer in The Ladies' Home Journal. There was a time, and not so long ago, when authors could write for pleasure, when competition was not so keen, and their productions were certain of acceptance in certain channels. Everything they wrote was acceptable because they wrote it, upon the argument that they had cut out for themselves a certain constituency which hailed anything from their pen, good, bad and indifferent. Two or three authors often constituted the resources of a magazine. All this has changed. No writer, however strong or popular, can carry the subscription list of a magazine in his or her pocket. Variety is the order of the day. The magazine which gives the greatest variety in a, single issue is the one most bought and enjoyed. 'I do not care for amagazine,' saidaliterary woman recently, 'in which I know before j open its pages, exactly what writers I shall find in it,' and in that remark lies the key to the modern literary taste. One beneficial effect which this tendency is undoubtedly having, is the doing away with cliqueism in periodical literature. In fact, it cannot be truthfully said of one prominent magazine to-day, as it could as late as a year ago, that it is 'cliquey.' Editors fully recognize the necessity of continually presenting a different array of writers, and thereby securing a variety of style and thought. To the old writers who have been accustomed for years to write for a single periodical this new order of things is disastrous in one respect, but for the whole school of modern writers it is a decided advantage.
