God's Acres Not grave-yards; not burping-'places, but raising acres for God and the cause of God in the world. Let not the dead alone rest in our ' God's Acre;' let there be reared for God, and the extension of God's cause, acres of consecrated corn or wheat, or potatoes, or flowers, or other merchandise. If we had a very superior friend, to whom we would present an acre of crops, we would present the best acre we had. Grave-yards are called ' God's Acres ;' but there is little they produce for God. Let us have a living acre, and growing acre, that we may present unto the Lord's cause. It was no uncommon thing of old, to present an ox, or oxen and sheep, by way of sacrifice to the Lord. In behalf of The Shaker Manifesto, we will accept and devote to the cause of God, the income of the best living, growing ' God's Acre; ' or the fatted ox, or even the value of a good horseâ€”all for the Cause, credited to God's Acres.
