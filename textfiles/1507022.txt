NOTES Whatever may serve to stimulate a life in righteousness, certainly, that should be liberally encouraged. It may not be so much in the belief or in the unbelief regarding any form of Church government or in that of any one particular book, as it is in that which is more essential ; in 'living soberly, righteously and godly in this present world. ' It is the varied influences for right that meet us on every hand, which aid us so effectually in building on the foundation of God's word. We hear, we learn and finally accept the testimony. On this we build our heavenly home. By a careful and thoughtful study of the righteousness of the Scriptures, we may through them receive an understanding which shall have a potent efFect in this direction and largely assist us in the development of a religious instruction. A well regulated discipline of the body, and a corresponding discipline of the mind, agreeably to the best light of the present day, is a path toward that acceptable righteousness which Jesus so highly recommended to his disciples. It is the life of the Christian order, and a church devoted to the worship of God, in the beauty of holiness, must be a live church. The dull routine of forms and ceremonies may be more or less necessary for an organized body of worshipers, to hold in check the earthly relations, but they have no vitalizing power which shall make of an assembly, worshipers in spirit and in truth. It is not, however, in a special demand | that shall rest upon any one person or i on any one church, that they shall do so I much iti a given time, but rather that they shall do faithfully and conscientiously the work to which God has called them. An example that stamps its impression upon other minds for peacefulness and honesty would be quickly recognized as being in direct sympathy with the evangel of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Men are not so dull of comprehension, that they require a lengthy investigation into the workings of a religious body, iu order to determine its position. The light which is ?hed abroad in the world comprehends all corresponding light wherever it may be found. Truthfulness, faithfulness and temperance are within the reach of the whole race of man. To accept them is to accept a gift of God, a light from heaven. But if the sons of Belial fail to live to the righteousness which they fully understand, and the sons of God, in like manner, drop below their standard of right, with what prospect of hope can a church look forward iu anticipation of harvesting the world into the Kingdom of God. Why may we not in the fullness of our souls, sing in the rapturous strains of the poet:ï¿½ ' Zion, arise, break forth in songs Of everlasting joy. To God eternal ^r.iise belongs Who doth thy foes destroy. Thou Church of God, awake ! awake ! For light beams from on high, From earth and dust thy garments shake Thy glory's drawing nigh. ' Men do not light a lamp and put it under the bushel, but on the stand and it shineth unto all that are in the house. This, like manv of the lessons which JULY, 1885. Jesus gave to the disciples, was to stimulate them to work more effectually for God. A light, even of the best quality if hid away in a box, was of no benefit to those who were passing in or out of the dwelling. 'Ye are the light of the world.' As much as to say, put yourselves in a position where your light from God may do some good. To help others is the Christian's divine gift of happiness, as in this way he most effectually accomplishes his own salvation. Let the pathway to the Kingdom of God be lighted with all the gospel graces, and then we can with confidence, and with a loving assurance, extend the hand of fellowship to every one that starts on a pilgrimage from the darkness of Kgypt to the City of our God.
