GOOD MORNING Good Morning! though a simple gift, Has still a magic power ; 'Tis as a cup of water passed One, in a needy hour. Good Morning! these two little words, When clothed with Christian grace, Bring such a wreath of happy smiles Upon a friendly face. The sweetness lasts through all the dayr When cheerful we begin; The light and shade along life's way, Are nicely woven in. Perchance a cloud may rise at noon, And dim the morning light; Good Afternoon ! will break the gloom And bring a sweet Good Night! Canterbury, N. H.
