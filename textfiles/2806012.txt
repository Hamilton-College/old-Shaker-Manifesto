Sabbathday Lake, Me. May, 1898. This is a beautiful morning but the bleak, cold wind seems unwilling to go and is roaring wildly among the branches of the trees. April has been very cold and rainy and we farmers and gardeners are much disappointed in the tarry occasioned by the cold weather, after such a warm and delightful March, but we now hope for better days. In the meantime, we have been busy, Sisters on the fancy work for sale and both Brethren and Sisters in the greenhouse, days at a time, transplanting celery, cabbage and flower seedlings and over eight hundred dozen tomato plants have been transplanted twice. This is pleasant work when blest with plenty of sunshine but the dull days that we have been having the past month have almost given us 'the blues.' During the past week the Sisters have set out a thousand strawberry plants and sown part of the sweet peas. The Brethren have set a row of maple trees on the west side of the road through our village which adds much to the beauty of the place. Our good aged father Samuel Kendrick has left us for his home in 'Mansions of Light' and while we miss him very much no doubt his influence for good will still remain. Ada S. Cummin gs.
