BY On the sixth of May, 1881, the little girls, ten in number, with their caretaker came to pay Mother Dolly a visit. They gathered around her and desired a blessing from her. She gave them the following advice: ' Children, I am glad that you have come to see me; I hope you will all be good and make useful sisters in Mother's gospel; and if you want to be happy when you be. come advanced in life, as I am, you must do as I have done. You must be respectful to your teachers and instructors, loving and kind to each other, not quarrelsome nor cross. Be condescending one to another. I want you to remember what I now say: Little children, love one another and be happyI love you all.' They* all then kneeled down and she took each one by the hand and bestowed on them a parent's love and blessing. She told them she had been a Shaker one hundred years and had been saved from sin, and she felt thankful and happy, and they could all be very happy if they would be good. She had previously received a present of some raisins ; these were divided into ten packages, and she then gave them to the children with her own hands. They returned their kind thanks for her good counsel and pretty present; then each greeted her with a kiss of love and affection, promising always to be good and bade her adieu.
