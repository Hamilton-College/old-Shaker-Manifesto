OUR NUMBER FOR MARCH We feel warranted in saying that the present number of The Manifesto will be found an interesting and valuable one. We think this, because several of the papers contained herein, treat upon subjects which many are very desirous of knowing concerning us. The articles of ' Party,' and ' Principles,' treat very lucidly of our ideas upon those subjects. ' What shall I do to be a Shaker ? ' gives interesting features of a certain class of correspondence very frequently met with. Daniel Fraser's article is a(revolutionary one ; but is nevertheless a peaceful solution of many knotty, socialistic problems. ' Children among the Shakers ' 62 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. ought to have been known of long ago ; so, also, with the important subject of 'Beds.' ' Omnipresence ' gives a grand hope of God in this world ; while ' Interior Life ' gives assurance, in most excellent language, that there is no death. 'Lex Talionis,' while characteristic of the writer, is practically true of human progress from brute force to angel dealings. Our long quotation upon ' War or Arbitration ? ' will be gratifying, and meet an urgent demand of our honored publisher, who has feared we were not doing our whole duty on this subject. The children will find in their ' Grotto ' a kindly feeding of lambs by their dear friend, Amelia J. Calver; while every one will rejoice in ' The New Song.' We hope with this goodly array of food, contributors will bear with us, in our crowded condition. Articles will appear from other pens as soon as con- sistent.
