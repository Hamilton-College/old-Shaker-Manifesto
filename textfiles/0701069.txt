'Oil Up.' THEODORE GORHAM Man, like a machine, is a combination of a system of forces. A community is a combination of combinations, an instrument by which the direction and intensity of individual force-faculty-is changed or concentrated to perform a work which could not be performed without said combination. In m a cirincs we find always a loss of force through friction. In a comrnu n ity we find a friction caused ;by the different parts of the combination-the different faculties and natural tendencies of the constituent members-being brought in contact; frlct ion is unavoidable, hut the true spirit of christianity is the oil, the oil which calms the troubled waters and modifies the friction natural to the machine. The more perfect the machine I the less friction. Mt. Lebanon. N. Y.
