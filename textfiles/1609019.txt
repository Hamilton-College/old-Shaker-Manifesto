LIME WATER. The housekeeper should never be without a bottle of lime water in the house. To have it always ready and in good order, with little expense, place in a tall quart bottle of any kind a gill or so of good lime just slacked with water. Then fill the bottle with rain or other pure water, and allow it to stand quietly, well corked. The lime will settle, leaving clear lime water at the top. Pour this off gently, as wanted, adding more water as needed. Lime water, even when closely corked, often deteriorates; the carbonic acid in the air unites with the lime and settles as an insoluble carbonate on the sides of the bottle, which is nearly impossible to remove. This will spoil the bottle for any other use. Therefore select one from the store room which is not valued, but which has a good, tight cover. A wide mouthed bottle is preferable. The lime should be removed and fresh put in once a year or so, unless kept very tightly corked. A pint of cold water dissolves less than ten grains of lime, and warm water still less. The uses to which lime water may be put, are innumerable. If good milk disagrees with a child or a grown person, three or four tablespoonfuls of lime water added to a pint of it will usually help digestion and prevent flatulence; it also counteracts pain from wind in the stomach caused by eating acid fruits. Over-eating of candies and other sweets will sometimes cause acidity, for which this is a sovereign remedy. A tablespoonful for a child two years old to a gill or more for an adult is an ordinary dose, while considerable will have no bad results ; in fact, it is a simple anti-acid and slightly tonic. A small quantity put into a mug with the water for cleaning the teeth wilL harden the gums and prevent soft decay, which is a serious evil which many desire to avert. For burns and scalds, to two parts of linseed oil add one part of lime water, and apply with soft linen. American Cultivator.
