JOY IN THE CROSS. WATSON ANDREWS. Let me sing of the joy in the cross, Of the joy in the gaia of my soul, Of the fire that consumeth the dross And the love that is gaining control; O ! the pure gospel love That is gained in this beautiful way. O the sweet gospel love, That in seeking we find day by day. Let me tell of this beautiful way, Of this plan of redemption from wrong, That the thousands who still are astray May return and unite in my song; All ye wand'ring of earth Who are hung'ring and thirsting to-day All ye wand'ring of earth Ye may share in this beautiful way. Do you thirst for the waters of life? Do you hunger for bread from above? Would you dwell where the billows of strife Sink to rest in the calm of pure love? O ! then come to the fount, To the fountain that's open and free, Come and drink at the fount, That is flowing for you as for me; Come, and yield to the sway of the cross, Come, to pour out your spirits in prayer, Come, to show up the depths of your loss And resign all to heav'ns high care; There the blessing of God From this Fountain will flow to your souls, And to manifest God, You will joyfully yield the control.
