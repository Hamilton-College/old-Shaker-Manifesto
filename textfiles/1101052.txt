Diseased teeth Diseased Teeth.—A distinguished anatomist made the assertion that a particle of matter taken from a decayed tooth, if inoculated into a person's veins, would produce almost instant death. Dr. Ewer tried the experiment on a dog, and it died in twenty minutes. The amount of disease produced by retaining decayed teeth in the mouth is immense. The dentist is one of our best friends.—Dr. Dio Lewis.
