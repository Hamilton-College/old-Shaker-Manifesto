THE VOICE OF THE GUARDIAN SPIRIT. By Cecelia DeVere. Look to the end, when the Tempter allures thee, O beware of his fell, subtle schemes! 'Tis by degrees and by craft he secures thee, Filling thy spirit with unfounded dreams. He would not boldly invite thee to error, He would not openly bid thee do wrong, Lest thou should'st flee from his presence in terror, Or, like young David with pebbles be strong. Well, well he knows that truth's weapons will slay him, Tho they are simple and ever at hand; Seeks he for victims, he first will betray them Into the trap he has secretly planned. He may approach Ihee with calm, pleasant greeting, Wishing thy road were less rugged and straight, Ah well! he knows at the very first meeting Whether his triumph be speedy or late. Thy sword with its two glittering edges he praises, Its steel, hilt and point, he examines them all, Then carelessly o'er thee his keen blade he raises, And keeps thee in dread lest it on thee should fall. Here is a stone that tby faith would have lifted, Had not the Tempter been clearing thy path, By his adroitness it onward is shifted, Yet thou shalt meet it a mountain of wrath. There is a vine that thy faith would have mangled, Torn from thy way and cast into the fire, Now in its poisonous branches entangled Thou to be rid of it hath no desire. Here is a fountain of zeal that is frozen, Chilled by the breath of the Tempter's coid scorn, Death and not life for its tide thou hast chosen, Better for thee thou hadst never been born. There is a cloud that tby faith could have broken, And shown the bright rainbow concealed in its fold, Now it remains as a burial token, Over the spirit that Death grimly holds. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
