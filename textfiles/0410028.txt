CANDY MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS Com. Jourdan offered the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted : Whereas, Frequent complaints have been made by the press and people that terra alba (which is nothing but plaster of Paris or gypsum), glocure, lamp black, sulphuric acid, aniline, verdigris, Brunswick green, gamboge, smalts, ultramarine, oil of turpentine, prussic acid, rotten cheese, fusil oil, chrome yellow, and other drugs and compounds are largely used in the manufacture of cheap candies; and, Whereas, The indiscriminate use of such poisonous drugs and compounds is considered deleterious to health. Resolved, That the sanitary committee, or such officers of this board as they may direct, do thoroughly investigate and report to this board as soon as possible the mode and material used in the manufacture of all descriptions of wares and merchandise made or sold by confectioners, in order that children at least may be protected from the evil effects of the dangerous compounds which are sold under the description of candy. In this connection Commissioner Jourdan stated that he had heard on good authority that terra alba is used in place of white sugar; glocure in place of gum arabic consists of mucilage of starch ; lampblack, glue in place of gum arabic and liquorice ; tonquin bean in place of vanilla; tartaric and sulphuric acids in place of lemon; analine, a poisonous product of coal tar, in place of cochineal to color red candies; gamboge and chrome yellow in place of saffron to color yellow candies ; smalt, verdigris, and Brunswick green to color blue and green candies; oil of turpentine for flavoring; rotten cheese and sulphuric acid to flavor pineapple drops.
