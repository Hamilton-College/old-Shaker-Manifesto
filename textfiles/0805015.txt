CORRESPONDENCE Dear Bro. Albert, Be assured of my grateful appreciation of your efforts to... Ayer, Mass. Mar. 24, 1878 Dear Bro. Albert, Be assured of my grateful appreciation of your efforts to make the Shaker Manifesto an honorable representative in both contents and execution. And (if you are in need) I have a little sympathy for you. Doubtless, Paul and Stanley were both honest men. One embraced Christ and modified it to suit such as would not take it unmixed; the other received Christ and denied itâ€”went back to his 'mire.' In your analysis, preserve all the good metal; whatever cannot bear examination through the lens of truth must go the way of all chaff. The incubus of all false doctrines must be shaken off. Can we do better than to observe Jefferson's motto : 'Equal and exact justice to all men?' When books and men accredited with infallibility speak to us with discordant tongues, are we to pay royalty on reason, and revelation, or accept the mixture? Physicians do not prescribe the mixture of a whole apothecary inventory for their patients. They are wiser than the spiritual physicians, who repeat Paul: 114 M-AJSTimiESTO. THE SHAKER 115 'Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled.' Is this the teaching of Jesus ? Whose disciples are we ? Jesus the recognized pattern of the Christian ministry, was both healer, and preacher. Do Doctors and Ministers inhabit one skin now-a-days in healing disease and in giving warning against the fatal relapse of repeating the sin ? Or does one live by preaching Paul, while the other lives on the effects of such preaching? Go on my brother, the verdict will be in order at the close of the trial. As ever affectionately, Elijah Myrick
