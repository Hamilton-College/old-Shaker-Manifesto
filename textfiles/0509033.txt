THE POINT FACT, OR FRAUD — WHICH? When from five to twenty-five forms, of men, women and children, appear in an evening seance, on the platform of the Eddy Hall, in Chittenden, in presence of from twenty-five to fifty spectators, gathered from all parts of the Union, and some from foreign countries, one of two things occurs — either those forms are the product of downright fraud and lying trickery, and all these spectators — leading minds, from Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, London, Texas, Rhode Island and Mt. Lebanon— are imposed upon, deceived, deluded, bewitched, and made to think and know that they see, and hear uttered, high and noble sentiments touching the welfare of society, by the materialized spirits of men and women from the Spirit-World, when in reality it is only the Medium and his co-conspirators — r, a Neio Epoch has opened to mankind, that shall ultimate in the Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth, uniting God to Humanity, through the Law of Materialization and (?-materializa tion. Through its agency Angels will descend upon the sons and daughters of men, eliminating, from Humanity, evils, physical and spiritual—substituting in their place the virtues and graces of the Angelic hosts — the consummation of the ages, so long looked for — the Millennial Era.
