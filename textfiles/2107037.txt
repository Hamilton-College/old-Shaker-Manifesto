ALPHABETICAL ACROSTIC. Margarette Davis. Around, are daily falling Blest tokens of God's care; Countless as the sea-sands, Descending rich and rare. Every child He knowet&gt;., Faithful, false or true; God in his loving-kindness, Hath never tired of you. Immortal life He offers; Just 'seek, and ye shall find.' 'Knock,' heaven's portal opens, Light out of darkness shines. Mount ye on faith's fair pinions; Ne'er pause nor make delay: On,ï¿½see, the light before thee Points up and on, alway. Quell ev'ry doubt that rises; Rule passion, to the last, Since God will e'er be with thee Till dangers all are past. Unto the overcomer, Verily is the crown: While in that 'White Stone' written, Your name, Zion traveler, is found. Canterbury, N. H.
