THE SOLDIERS OF CHRIST. [The following hymn will find a ready response in many hearts. It was evidently written at the time of the organization of the Community, by one of the old heroes of the American Revolution. Ed.] The King of kings, and Lord of hosts, Has blown his trumpet in our coasts, And round his standard now appears A valiant band of volunteers. Their loins are girt, their feet are shod With the unerring truth of God, And by the truth they now begin To overthrow the man of sin. Against the foe they now advance, Each with his bow and glittering lance, And though they're friends to all mankind, They crucify a carnal mind. They spare no idol, great nor small, But pass one sentence on them all. THE MANIFESTO. 163 And cut and slash on every hand, To purge all evil from the land. They're well equipt with gospel arms, And make no peace on any terms, Nor with the flesh will stand to treat, But strike at every lust they meet. They will admit no vain excuse, To let one vile affection loose, But bind the captive fast in chains, While one flesh-pleasing tie remains. Now every soul that would do right, Is welcome to enlist and fight; These weapons of victorious truth, Are for the aged and the youth. No soul of man does God exclude From hating sin and doing good; And in such souls, we do maintain, The God of truth will ever reign. While living truth, like burning coals, Is purging evil from our souls, We know we are in Him that's true, And what He says we freely do ; The empire of eternal bliss, Has its foundation laid in this, And all who gain this noty ground, With everlasting life are crowned.
