In a little account of India, Herodotus says that... In a little account of India, Herodotus says that it is the finest of all the countries of the East. He says that, with the exception of the horses, the beasts and birds in India are the largest in the world. He says that the people get their gold by washing it out, while other people have to dig for theirs. And then, as the acme of their lazy prosperity, he says their wool grows on trees. 'The trees there, in a state of nature, bear woolly fruit, which in beauty and in strength surpasses the wool from sheep, and the people of India wear clothes made from it.' This is the first allusion to cotton made in western literature. It is a little curious, indeed, that no distinct reference to it is to be found in the Bible, which runs back to much further than Herodotus. The Jews must have seen cotton awnings and probably cotton clothing in Babylon; and there could hardly have been an army from the East on the soil of Palestine but embodied many cotton-clothed soldiers. Herodotus, it will be seen, cites it by way of gratifying that curious natural wish of the human heart, that things may grow on trees. In all travellers' stories, their accounts of such marvels are the most attractive. Roast chickens, growing on trees, are a part of the bill of fare in Peter Wilkins. In the same category, Herodotus, wishing to commend India to his readers, tells them in brief that there is no need to feed or wash sheep,�none to clip their wool: an end to shepherds and to wolves; no nightly watches; no daily tramp for the recovery of ram or of lamb. All this disappears when he tells his readers that the wool grows on trees. � And, alas, the readers believed him as much and as little as the readers of Peter W'ilkins believed him! �From '' Cotton from First to Last' by Edward E Hale, D.
