A LETTER TO JESUS GRACE EDDY BY A postman stood with puzzled brow, And in his hand turned o'er and o'er A letter with address so strange As he had never seen before, The writing cramped, the letters small, And by a boy's rough hand engraven, The words ran thus, ''To Jesus Christ,' And underneath inscribed, ' In Heaven.' The postman paused; full well lie knew No mail on earth this note could take, And yet 'twas writ in childish faith, And posted for the dear Lord's sake. With careful hand he broke the seal, And rev'rently the letter read; 'Twas short, and very simple, too, For this is all the writing said : ' My Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, I've lately lost my father dear, Mother is very, very poor, And life to her is sad and drear; Yet thou hast promised in Thy Word That none can ever ask in vain For what they need of earthly store, If only asked in Jesus' name. ' So I am writing in his name, To ask that Thou wilt kindly send Some money down; what Thou canst spare, And what is right for us to spend. I want so much to go to school. While father lived I always went, But he had little, Lord, to leave, And what he left is almost spent. ' I do not know how long 'twill be Ere this can reach the golden gate; But I will try and patient be, And for the answer gladly wait.' The tidings reached that far-off land, Although the letter did not go ; And straight the King an angel sent To help the little boy below. 88 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 89 Oft to his mother he would say, ' I knew the Lord would answer make When he had read my letter through Which I had sent for Jesus' sake.' Ah ! happy boy, could you but teach My heart to trust my Father's love, And to believe where aught's denied, 'Tis only done my faith to prove.
