The Boston Post The Boston Post has just issued a new type book containing specimens of 332 different styles of type, which it has assembled for the convenience of its advertisers. The type book is a very artistic publication in colored covers and contains sixty-seven large pages of specimen types, many of them very novel, artistic and effective. In fact, it would seem as if the Post had at its disposal an entire foundry of display types. They vary from the Diamond type, which almost requires a magnifying glass to read, to a type over eight inches deep. In addition to the types, there is a bewildering collection of eighty-one different kinds of borders, and a large variety of circles, ovals and other typographical material. This type book is unquestionably the most elaborate and artistic publication of its kind in the country. The Post's advertising de partment in its composing room is said to be the best equipped in New England. The latest type books of the Globe contain 225 types, the Herald 221 types and the Post 332 types. Such a publication marks not only the persistent enterprise of the Boston Post, but also indicates the great advance now being made in the way of artistic and effective advertising.
