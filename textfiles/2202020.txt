Enfield, N. H. Jan. 1892. We see the busy finger of time pointing to present date, which reminds us if we are to be duly represented with Home Notes in Manifesto, must hasten to send in our report. The first month of the glad New Year now numbered with the past, was one of uncommon mildness. The first snow that mantled hill or dale with a purpose to stay, came on the fifth of present month. We have been favored with a good degree of health this season thus far; a few are afflicted with colds, slightly bordering on influenza, so wide-spi-ead throughout the country. On the eve of Dec. 30th. we had a little scare of fire; the alarm was sounded that a fire had broken out at our North Family, but it proved to be only the burning of a chimney which was soon under control, giving us reason to be thankful for our great preservation. Old Mascoma closed in silence her proud majestic waves for a winter's rest, on the 5th. inst., many days later than has ever been known before by 'the oldest inhabitant.' At this writing we are having a touch of winter weather, with prospect that ere long we shall hear the merry chimes of the sleigh bells. Brethren are at work on corn planters; have a contract for five hundred present winter. Sisters who have made linen bosomed shirts for a Boston firm so many years, have orders very infrequently, betokening a failure for us. Heavy knit goods (better known as sweaters) are at present date in great demand. So while toiling for the daily bread that sustains life, may we not forget that the growth of the Spirit, which is more than food or raiment, should be the first consideration. J. E.
