Christ is the light of man, and enlightens every soul... Christ is the light of man, and enlightens every soul that comes into the light. We must be alive before we can travel. If we have no life, we have no light. If we walk in darkness, we are liable to fall, and our fall may be great. If the light that is in us, is lost, how great will be our darkness. Larz Erickson.
