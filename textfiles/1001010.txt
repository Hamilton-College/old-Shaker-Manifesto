The Christian Life â€” If I believe in the name of Jesus Christ I must acknowl-' edge His precepts as my rule of life ; I must be pure in spirit; I must be pure in heart; I must be meek and forgiving; I must be temperate and self-denying. A different society must be lived in ; new habits formed; old habits abandoned. There is one proof that must be evident in every man who has a Christian hope in him, namely, that the flesh is subdued to the spirit. It is a sure mark of a Christian that he walks not after the flesh.
