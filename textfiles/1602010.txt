POLYGAMY. CHAUNCY DIBBLE. Great efforts are being made just now to reform Mormonism. Is there any abomination in Mormon life that exceeds the degradation, depravity and dissipation that prevails in our large cities where schools of vice are tolerated yea licensed by law and that under the shadow of the churches? -Men called Christians who would cry 'Down with Mormonism,' will deign to patronize by example these haunts of wickedness. How is it that law has no right to prevent evils which are sinking young and old into misery and shame. Is it not terrible for Christianity to struggle under the intolerable disgrace from beings in human form educated in brothels. Is it not time for Christians to awake, and all philanthropists who desire the elevation of humanity, to an evil far worse than southern slavery ? Shakers, N. Y.
