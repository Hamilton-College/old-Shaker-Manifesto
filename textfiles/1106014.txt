WHAT ANSWER? We ask, with positive composure, ' What do the churches think of Christ?' The Shaker church is in a great minority, numerically speaking, and the reasons therefor are apparent. The obligations it imposes on its members, without exception, are such that only a few are able and willing to receive them. Yet these obligations are none other than preached and practiced by the Christ. The popular churches look with disdain and derision upon the sparse membership of the Shaker church, as though there was the first reason for one such look. If the question of what is right depended upon popularity and numbers the followers of Confucius and Ma- THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 133 hornet could claim the precedence in righteousness. If paucity of numbers positively indicated a want of the truth as found in Christ, then indeed would the Shaker church be poor indeed, unworthy of notice, if not worthy of derision. Still this church has quite a goodly number of ardent advocates, and who would rise to the dignity of their profession to question their contemporaries. When you deride the virgin celibacy taught by the Shaker church, do you deride the virgin celibacy of Jesus, the Christ ? What answer ? As followers of Christ, how nearly do those called Christians pattern the master in this respect? Having made a sacrament of matrimony, who gave the authority to do so under the Christian dispensation ? If any say the life and example and testimony of Jesus in this respect was an error, why not discard Christianity itself ? Is celibacy unnatural ? Jesus declared it to be heavenly, and to compose the heavens. 'Thy will be done on earth, as in heaven.' We might ask what answer, to several as prominent questions. In regard to the non-resistance, the unretaliation of the Christ— the radical peace advocate. Do the churches generally discountenance war under any and all circumstances ? What say the army chaplains ? In regard to the principle of the non-possession of selfish, personal property, how stand the churches upon this question—'and none possessed aught he called his own.' We ask what answers the churches have to make as reasonable excuses for professing a following after Christ, yet walking after their own inclinations, and in nothing resembling the pattern ? We assert Christ's life as most right—as only right for Christians to practice ; as a heavenly practice on the earth ; and whoever makes the profession of Christianity should live like Christ's life. If any are unwilling or unable to live like the self-denying pattern, let him renounce the profession and the title, yielding these to those who are able and willing. We ask the churches wherein the Church, called Shaker, merits any more derision for its peculiar teachings than does the life of Christ. What answer?
