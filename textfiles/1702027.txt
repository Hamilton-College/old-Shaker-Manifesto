Winter is here again with... Wintek is liere again with its snow and ice, I would like it if I did not get so cold. I like spring best. I love to see the trees budding and the flowers blooming and the pretty green grass. In the spring 1 love to go down on the cliffs and see the wild flowers and watch the waterfalls. In the fall the leaves on the cliffs are very pretty so many colors together. When I stand upon the cliffs I can see the river, it looks like it was standing still, yet I know it is running as fast as it can into another river which runs to the ocean. The dear Manifestos come every month and we girls like to read them, we find some pretty verses which we memorize. We all want it to come another year. Alice Montgomery, age 8yrs.
