OUR GOD. Mary Whitcher. We make the God we serve As do the Heathen race, Whether of wood or stone Of tumult or of peace. We make the Heaven we share And gather, as akin, The lowly and the pure Or such as prone to sin. Why should we not arise? The standard of the truth Is for the true and wise Who live above the earth.
