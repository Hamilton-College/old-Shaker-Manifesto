CONSCIENCE. When, and how far, it is authority for human conduct. GILES B. AVERY. u Conscience follows, and does not precede the experience of human authority. ' 'Authority, sanctioned by punishment' as the consequence of infraction of its laws, ' is the type, and the starting point, even when the conscience takes an independent flight, and adopts rules for itself, different from those that entered into its education.' 'Keep the eyes of the soul open' so that the character of a true and pure conscience may be kept in view ! However, in order to know how far the conscience a person possesses is authority for conduct of life it is necessary to know, first, what conscience is.� 1st. Conscience is a monitor, which, when heeded, is a guide to the conduct of human life. 2nd. If enlightened, by the lamp of divine truth, in the revealed light of God, it may be a safe and true guide. 3rd. If unenlightened, or, having been enlightened, and faithfully instructed in the truth, it is disobeyed, until its light is obliterated, it becomes an unsafe and false guide to life. 4th. But, conscience is also a pupil, a student, and may be rightly or wrong- ly taught, or left in ignorance, without instruction. St. Paul speaks of different characters of conscience thus, 'a weak and weakened conscience, a good conscience, a pure conscience, an evil conscience, a defiled conscience, and a seared conscience, ' and he admonishes his hearers to '' purge their consciences from dead works.' And these characteristics of conscience correspond to the general understanding of the enlightened mind. It is thus manifest that conscience may, or may not, be a true guide to the conduct of life, according as it may have been rightly or wrongly taught, or otherwise, may have been left untaught, consequently ignorant of right and wrong. Human experience illustrates this ; thus, some of the inhabitants of the West India Islands, and of New Zealand, and even the Scots of Britain, once thought it right to kill and eat human beings ; and these were not of the lowest class of barbarians neither, but, some of them, having considerable progress in science and art. In 'Angas's New Zealand Illustrated ' there is a picture of the country mansion of the accomplished chief Rangihaeta, one of the finest specimens' says the author, 'of elaborately ornamented dwellings yet extant; its name is Kai Tangata, which means, eat man, and it has been so called in memorial of the feasts within its walls.' * John Calvin appeared to have had a conscience that caused him to feel it right, and not only right, but duty, to burn Servetus. The Empress Theodora, possibly may have thought she was conscientiously doing duty when she ordered her subjects, in one campaign into * Library of useful knowledge. Armenia, to put to death over one hundred thousand Paulicians, in a most barbarous manner, because they held different religious views from herself and her court, and by them, were called Heretics! The conscience of Pope Innocent, and the soldiers of his Papal armies, may have been so educated as to believe they were in G-od's service, when they put to death over two hundred thousand of the Waldenses and Albigenses, a people whose doctrine, as reported by themselves, was, 'to renounce the world, to bridle the lusts of the flesh, to maintain ourselves by the labor of our own hands, to do violence to no man, to love the brethren' and sisters. In view of these persecutions, the Church historian, Robinson, says, 'Dominion over conscience, is anti-christ, anywhere,' and 'Conscience, everywhere, is a throne of G-od.' Of an enlightened and godly taught conscience this is true, but of consciences that are barbarous, unenlightened, or, having been enlightened, have ,been disobeyed until they have become seared as with a hot iron, as St. Paul says, they become the throne of Satan. Possibly Martin Luther may have claimed to be conscientious, as a protestant to the Catholic faith, in his persecutions of the ana-baptists, and his presumptuous damnation of all who differed from him in faith, though he, and his followers exercised the same cruel spirit, that had been manifest by the Catholic church of Rome. 'But, how inconsistent it must appear, to every feeling heart and Christian mind, to hear the title of '' glorious reformation,' applied to that abominable work which was wrought by Martin Luther, and his followers, when, by gibbet, fire, and sword, they could and did exterminate their fellow beings from the earth, as they would mad dogs ! Could such conscientious works be the fruit of a conscience, which, as Robinson says '' is everywhere the throne of God?' Forbid it, kind heaven ; forbid it all ye honest and enlightened sons and daughters of men ! It is farther possible that John Calvin may have claimed to have been conscientious in instituting his doctrine of absolute decrees, and punishing, by imprisonment and death those who opposed his authority ; but it was the same Satanic spirit that inspired Luther, and the dominant powers of the Catholic Church ; and consciences that could originate and execute such horrid cruelties could not be considered by any good, enlightened person as a 'throne of God in the soul.' Alas, much more appropriately would such consciences be known as the throne of Satan ! Multitudinous examples might be given to illustrate characteristic consciences, that, instead of being monitors and guides to righteousness, goodness, mercy and truth, have been leaders to wickedness, cruelty, and desolation to the human race. On the other hand some Brahmins have a conscience that does not allow its possessors to destroy the smallest insect, and they will punish themselves for having knowingly killed a flea. The poet (Cowper) says :� ' I would not enter on my list of friends, Though graced withjpolished manners and fine sense The man who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.' It is not uncommon for persons who have consciences very ignorant of the principles of righteousness, or such as have been seared and malformed, by sinning against light and truth to such a degree as to be unable to see what is right, to claim they are doing right, because they are not condemned by their consciences. It is thus clearly manifest, that, although conscience is a mentor and monitor, it is also, necessarily a pupil, and needs instruction in the school-of Christ at the feet of wisdom, presented by souls who have learned, by obedience to Christ's gospel, the paths of righteousness and peace. The conscience of some persons would be as unfit to trust for safe human progress, as a balky horse ; as unsafe a lamp for a guide in the dark labyrinth of human experiences as a jack o' lantern in a rice swamp. To be a sure and safe guide, conscience must be educated in the school of Christ, and have learned obedience to revealed truth ; and only such a conscience is 'the throne of God' in the soul of man.
