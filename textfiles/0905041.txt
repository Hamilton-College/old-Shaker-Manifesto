Mealy potatoes Mealy Potatoes. â€” Select the potatoes so that they will be nearly of a size ; do not put them into the pot until the water boils. When done, pour off the water and remove the cover until the steam is gone. Then scatter in half a teaspoonful of salt, and cover the pot with a towel. Watery potatoes will thus come out mealy.
