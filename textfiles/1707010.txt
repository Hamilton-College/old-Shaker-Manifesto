BEWARE OF TRIFLES Beware of trifles, for you can never tell to what they may grow. Even a drop of honey has before brought about the death of many men, as may be seen from the following Arabian tale, which represents a common state of matters in the East. 'Petty wars,' says Mr. Lane, 'occasioned by events as trifling as that here related, have been frequent among the Arabs to the present day. ' There was a huntsman who hunted the wild beasts in the desert, and one day he entered a cave in a mountain, and found in it a hollow which was filled with honey. So he placed some of that honey in a water-skin which he had with him, then he carried it upon his shoulder and conveyed it to the city, having with him a hound that was dear to him. And the huntsman stopped at the shop of an oilman to whom he offered the honey for sale; and the oilman, agreeing to buy it opened the water-skin and emptied from it the honey, in order to see it. But there dropped from the skin a drop of honey, and a bird pounced down upon it, and the oilman had a cat, and it sprang upon the bird; and the huntsman's dog saw it, and sprang upon the cat and killed it; and the oilman sprang upon the dog and killed it; and the huntsman sprang upon the oilman and killed him; and the oilman was of one village and the huntsman of another, and the people of these villages heard of this event, so they took up their weapons and ro.-e against each other in anger: the two ranks met, and the swords ceased not to lie brandished about among them until there died a great multitude, the number of whom none knoweth but God, whose name be exalted.
