WOMEN'S PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY The movement of the ladies to organize and sustain a Physiological Society in this city is certainly deserving of praise. That such a society should be talked about here is a good sign, and that it is progressing and gives promise of long life is a matter of congratulation. How to dress healthfully, to eat hygienically, and to live in all things temperately is what the society proposes to teach, and that the ladies are determined to accomplish their purpose is evidenced by their zeal and enthusiasm in the undertaking. How much wiser such an effort is than the at present useless plans of the women is to be found in this fact, that these ladies have started out to reform themselves. They propose to begin at their own tables, at their own firesides, and with their own toilettes. They will simplify their costumes, and being strong as a society they will grow strong as individuals. This they tell us, in the reports of their meetings, they intend to do, and seeing how much is to be done in the line they have chosen we prefer to believe that they are in earnest. They have made a great move forward when they acknowledge that the dress of women requires social legislation, and with this acknowledgment volunteered, and the as voluntary promise of a change for the bettejr, there is certainly reason for public gratification.â€” Ex.
