SYMPATHETIC Passing through one of our workshops lately, we came across the little piece of poetry copied below. We wish we knew its authorship. We found it lying on the worktable of one, who had lately parted with an erring brother ; and its bespotted surface told of falling drops, that gave relief to pent-up grief, and of a love that would win him back again. We here confess that we ' borrowed ' it, and thus make restitution.—Ed. S. M. ' If widely he has gone astray, And dark excess has marked his way, 'Tie pitiful — but yet beware, Reform must come from kindly care. Forbid thy parting lips, to move But in the gentle tones of love. Though sadly his young heart hath erred, Speak not to him a bitter word. ' The lowering frown he will not bear, Thy venomed eludings will not hear, The ardent spirit will not brook The stinging tooth of sharp rebuke. Thou would st not goad the restless steed To calm his fire or check his speed — Then let no angry words be heard — Speak not to him a bitter word. ' Go kindly to him — make him feel Your heart yearns deeply for his weal. Tell him the dangers thick, that lay Around his widely devious way,— So shalt thou win him, call him back, Prom pleasure's smooth, seductive track, And warnings, thou hast mildly given, May guide the wanderer up to heaven.'
