PLEASURE FLORA WILLIAMS 'Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.' 1 Ghron. xvi-10. The heart has very little if any share in the common enjoyments of life ; the varied scenes called pleasures merely satisfy the senses, and captivate the imagination. 'Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.' While in religion the heart finds rest, sweet satisfaction and abiding joy. It is written, 'Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive the good things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.' Inexperienced persons are inclined to place too much value on present surroundings and associations that tend to present happiness ; while all should realize that felicity depends alone upon the state of the mind, and not upon external condition. 'Paul* was happy in prison, while Nero was miserable in a Palace.' The powerful Monarch that exclaimed 'O that I had the wincrs *of a dove, for then I would fly away and be at rest,'—portrays very clearly the restless condition of the multitude who having been surfeited with the riches and pleasures of this life, are yet dissatisfied and long for a haven of peace and rest; the promised reward of those who take up the cross and follow Christ in the New Life—the life of regeneration. One may possess every blessing that wealth and friends can bestow ; but without the balm of true religion, life will have been deprived of its crowning glory, and bereft of that peculiar charm found only in the grace and beauty of a religious character. This is a soul beauty all can possess by careful cultivation of the spiritual sentiments. Canterbury, N. H.
