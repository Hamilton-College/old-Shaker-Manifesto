GENTLE DEEDS Words Mt. Lebanon,N. Y. Music Selected. 1. Gentle deeds are ever forming 2. It is ours to be progressing, 3. O, it is a blessed haven, Verdant spots within each heart; And to toil with ardent thought, Where no blighted powers remain; -#- ¦#-¦$*¦• Whence shall spring the plants of virtue, Flow'rs that incense sweet impart; That our lives may merit blessing, And with holiness be fraught. Where unholy strife is banished, And pure love our souls enchain. Such shall waken thot's most holy; Morn shall hope with new desires; Here in union we are leaving Bring to life some germ of love; Evening shall their strength increase; All the glit'ring dust of earth; Cause aspirings true and lasting, While the angels find our spirits Seeking only the imniortal, For the powers that lift above. Resting in the realms of peace. Which will give us angel birth.
