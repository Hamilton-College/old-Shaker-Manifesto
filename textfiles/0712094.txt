THE 'BATTLE OF LIFE.' AGNES E. NEWTON The battle of life is not encountered upon a field, where human beings controlled by thirst for power and fame meet, and fall in deadly conflict. It takes place within the human soul ; no one can escape itâ€”all to a greater or less extent, must participate therein. Our Savior ably illustrated this when he said : 'A man's foes shall be they of his own household.' Truly these are) sufficient in might and strength to constitute a battle, requiring the utmost courage to engage. Strong as are the enemies which beset the Christian's path, if clad in truth's bright armor, the battle of life, to him, will be a success ; the laurels of victory not imaginary attainments, but present realities. How insignificantly slight will seem the battle, when the glorious end is achieved, and the Savior's words are the Christian's to repeat: 'I have overcome the world.' O, that all could be wise, old and young, especially we who are just entering life's battle field, and choose for our armor the one thing needful, the active principle of truth. Canterbury, N. H.
