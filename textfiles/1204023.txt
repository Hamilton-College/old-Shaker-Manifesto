John Whiteley And thus our aged friends are passing away.—But they leave the blessed gospel to comfort us, and the same way of God, they have so faithfully traveled, and for which they have given up all to support—Let us not be discouraged! But in the same spirit of thankfulness they have manifested, let us toil on, that we may not be unprofitable servants of our God, but by patient endurance inherit the^promises, and, finally partake with them in the joys of the redeemed, beyond the reach of earth sorrows. In kindest love to all our dear relation Yours very truly,
