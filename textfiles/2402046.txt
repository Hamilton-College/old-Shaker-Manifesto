The Journal of Hygeio-Therapy The Journal of Hygeio-Therapy. Jan. Contents. Foundation Principles; Bronchocele; A New Era Dawning; Protest Against Vaccination; Annual Editorial Greeting, etc., etc. Dr. T. V. Gifford &amp; Co., Kokomo, Ind. The Springfield Republican has had a unique history among New England newspapers. In the whole country pei'haps there is no other journal published outside of the great cities which is so widely copied or wields so strong an influence. The story of its early days, when Samuel Bowles was at its head, Dr. Holland its literary editor, and 'Warrington' and Frank Sanborn were writing letters from Boston, is told in an interesting way by Mr. Clarence E. Blake, in his article on Springfield, in the January number of the New England Magazine. The New England has published few articles on New England towns more valuable or more beautifully illustrated than this on Springfield.ï¿½Warren F. Kellogg, 5 Park Square, Boston. The Columbia Desk Calendar, which is issued annually by the Pope Manufacturing Company, of Columbia Bicycle fame, is out for 1894, much improved in appearance. It is a pad calendar of the same size and shape as those of previous years, having a leaf for each day, but its attractiveness has been heightened by the work of a clever artist, who has scattered a series of bright pen-drawings through its pages. It also contains, as usual, many appropriate and interesting contributions from people both bright and wise.
