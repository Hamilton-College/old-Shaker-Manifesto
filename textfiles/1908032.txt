From the Bible Class. '' The Lord shall rule over us.'� Judges viii, 23. After Gideon had delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Midianites, they were inspired with great confidence in his ability as a Leader, and very naturally desired to do him some honor, and therefore said unto him,�'Eule thou over us, both thou and thy son and thy son's son.' Gideon who had won the victory by his strict obedience to the commands of God, refused to accept approbation or honor from men and replied,�'The Lord shall rule over thee;' giving in this brief sentence the honor and glory to God who had given the victory. Do we remember why Moses failed to enter the Promised Land? Was it not because he took to himself the power and authority belonging only to God? It may be that Gideon had learned dependence upon God through the sad experience of those before him. How much respect arises in our minds toward those who manifest a humble dependence upon a superior power. Jesus said at one time to those who doubted that he was the Messiah, 'Though ye believe not me, believe the works.' Another example of recognizing the power of God, is found in Mother Ann's dealings. To those who wuuld kneel to her she would say, 'Do not kneel to me, kneel to God, I am but your fellow servant.' We are all privileged as Christian Disciples, to achieve victories in the formation of a spiritual character. Let us remember in the battle, as in the victory, the words of the apostle, 'God forbid that I glory save in the cross of Christ.' Canterbury, N. H. Sarah F. Wilson.
