CONDITION OF MAN While pondering upon man's degenerate state, His great responsibility—the ultimate— My spirit groans within me, crying out, alasl Who, or how many, will be saved at last? How many willing to pursue the road That leads to Life, to Heaven, and to God? Who the mighty warfare wage and win, The prize obtain, redemption sing? Almighty Being just, why is it so ? Why so many yield to death, to sin, and woe ? Why turn from Thee away, flinch when trials come, And thus deny the Powers that Be —the Eternal One? Why falter, wane, or stumble at the truth? Why hate the cross of Christ—His life—forsooth? And shun the only path that leads to bliss, And covet woe, or mere transient happiness? Why pleasure seek in pain, and hold the sting of death ? Why fear remorse, yet hug it at each breath ? Why pass along through time, regardless of the past, Of present moment, or, what their doom at last ? Oh ! doleful, doleful sound of Infidelity, Of nothingness, and want of firm reality! Beware of this, the poisoned arrow of despair— The sting of Death—beware of it, O, do beware ! The Tree of Life unfolds its leaves, and teems with love; This seek, 'tis everlasting and from realms above ; 'Tis happiness abiding—bliss without alloy, Heaven ever present, which nothing can destroy. It dieth never, fadeth not, nor waxeth old, But renovates our being, redeems the soul; It forms anew, makes angels pure of men, Till Earth and Heaven can together shout, Amen! D. A.
