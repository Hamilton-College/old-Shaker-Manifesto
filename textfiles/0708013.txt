Equality of Sex If any person should ask me for the best evidence I have that the religion of Jesus is superior to that of Zoroaster, Buddha, or Mohammed, or that his social philosophy is vastly superior to that of Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, or any other ancient Greek or Roman philosopher, or anj^ philosopher or scientist of modern times, I should say it is furnished in the fact that it makes no distinc tion between man and women in respect to their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit o happiness. When the great apostle said tha in Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female, he gave birth to a thought that covers entirely the governmental, political, social and family status of mankind under Christian ity. He laid the foundation for a system o practical relationships that makes it as im portant that a husband should think well o his wife as that he should think well of him self; that a father should think as well of his daughter as of his son ; that a brother shoulc think as much of his sister as of any man friend; that society should respect woman and treat her on the same basis that it does man ; that the state should recognize woman to have the same rights, and under both or ganic and statute law be entitled to the same immunities, privileges, and franchises tha man has. That the church should make no distinction between men and women, in it respect, regard, or affection : nor in the con ferment of its powers, nor in the working ou of its grand functions. In fine, that all the conditions of living, which are to be regard ed as forcible and authoritative, which socie ty, the church, or the state may take unto itself, are to be, under law. as directlj' ac corded to woman as to man. In other words that men and women shall, before the law be equal in the family, in society, in th state, and in the church; and that whateve differences are seen to exist between the two shall be only those which grow up in the na ture of things. â€” Dr. J.
