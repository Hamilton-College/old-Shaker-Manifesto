The secret of protecting furs... The secret of protecting furs and woolen garments from the depredations of the moth is very simple. In the first place, see that the article you are putting away is thoroughly clean. Remove all spots of grease and dirt, and brush all dust from the gathers and folds. Take your furs out-doors and beat them thoroughly with a small rod, going over a small part of the surface at a time, till the whole have been beaten. Then seal each article up in double folds of newspaper, pasting so closely that neither air nor insect can get in. This is a better way than any we know of, not excepting camphor, tobacco, pepper, and other pungent preventives which are commonly used.
