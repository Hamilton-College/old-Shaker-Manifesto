Watervliet, O. Nov. 1889. Brother Henry : ï¿½I received your letter of the Gth ult and let me kindly thank you for your word of encouragement, and then for those two beautiful songs that came with the letter. Watervliet is about two hundred miles S. W. from the old home, at North Union. On the journey I took under my charge, four horses and two Holstein cattle. The journey occupied two nights and one day during which time I had no opportunity of rest. A good night's rest, however, followed this hard labor and the wearied body was quite refreshed. This new home is all that one could desire. It pleases me in every respect. From my window in the large, brick dwelling, called the south Family, I have a beautiful view extending for many miles. The land is very productive and well watered by living springs, and this I consider one of the richest blessings. Large crops of corn and all kinds of grain are readily produced, from this fertile soil. Indeed, this is a land of corn, and after taking a little time to look over the farm, the rich bottom land, or the flats as the people here would say, I must say that it pleases me in every respect. In kindest love, from your brother, S. S. Miner.
