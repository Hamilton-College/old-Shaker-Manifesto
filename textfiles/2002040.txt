Because he was the last of the judges and first... Samuel has 4. Because he was the last of the judges and first of the prophets when Israel asked for a King, he surrendered his government and helped them to a King which was Saul. He was Saul's assistant and counselor. It is said that his life was spotless. Albenia Grimes.
