Groveland, N. Y. And March returned with a piercing breeze, With snow-showers oft, and a deeper freeze, Making slippery paths for old imil \ oung, For good and bad and everyone. March, is the oldest wind-instrument known; Whistling and screeching and trilling its tone. For thirty-one days through every year The music of March unceasing we hear. Fruit-buds generally Lave passed a satisfactory examination which at this time indicates the reverse of last year's fruit failure, yet we have lived and thrived dur ing the famine season, as a valued friend of Brighton, Mr. S. S. Boardman a dealer in farm and garden produce kindly remembered us with some choice apples which has added liberally to the family board. Such generous gifts, from generous hands will not be forgotten. For 'it is more blessed to give than to receive.' A few days previous we received a pleasing call from our former neighbor Philo Johnson now of Herkimer Co., N. Y. He tells us that in said County they have had one hundred days of uninterrupted skigliing, which amounts to a few score in ore than we in Livingston Co., can number. Robins and blue birds returned early, defying the blow and snow of stormy March and continue their sweet songs of happy bird life, resting in the assurance that summer days are not far away for the darkness of winter is passing them by.
