Enfield, N. H. 'Time hangeth not heavy with the industrious, while to the slothful and.indolent, it proves a weight.' These truthful lines were brought to memory, as we discovered that the proper time for June Notes (which by the way should have been demi semi quavers to accord with the tuneful notes of the birds during that month) had passed into oblivion, all too soon ; so we resolved to be on the alert, in the future, deeming the few simple words we contribute, to be one of the many ways in which we may give others satisfaction, judging from our own pleasure in reading the interesting Notes from the several localities. The lovely month of June, with us, has been almost constantly in tears, grass and foliage is luxuriant, but gardens, we fear, are having an excess of moisture. The sun, whose glorious rays dispense health and happiness, has grown of late, too modest, only showing himself at intervals, so brief are these manifestations, that vegetation and humans also, need a protracted sun bath. Our South Family, which has for the past year, been awaiting sale, under the auspices of a Boston Syndicate, is now released from these bonds. We are glad to have this property, so near the Center Family, under the direct control of the Society, glad also, that the elderly members of the family, who have consecrated their time and energies to its maintainence, may yet longer make it their earthly, therefore temporary home, for to some of them we know,ï¿½' 'The Pearly Gates' must be opening, on yonder shore. There a permanent abode awaits them, where parting is no more. We send greetings of welcome to the different companies, whom we are expecting to entertain as guests, during the coming summer if the Lord is willing. We have naught to boast of, concerning the things of this world but will promise you a season of real satisfaction and profit, if willing hands and loving hearts can accomplish this end. We shall remember those also who remain at home, and wish for them health and happiness. E. B.
