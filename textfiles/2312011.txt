HOME NOTES. Watervliet, Ohio. Nov. 1893. Heke we are again in Home Notes trying to do all we can to help the good cause along. We are just getting the corn crop gathered. Corn yields about forty bushels to the acre. It is hardly a full crop, but we must be satisfied with small things, for we know that God will take care of his chosen people. Sister Susan Chase was with Us on the 28th ult, a sister from Economy, and we appreciated her company very much. I unite with Br. John Tyler's last writing in the Manifesto. If Believers would visit more among each other the bond of union would grow stronger. A visit from our Canterbury friends would be very much appreciated. We are having a piece of ground cleared up ready for the plow. A few years ago a cyclone passed through this section and demolished all of the timber, so we are making preparations to use the land that we may receive some benefit from it. We propose to keep the good work moving on. We do not intend to give up the ship. We should preach the everlasting gospel, the gospel of Christ; be wide awake and not get discouraged because we hear others talking of discouragement; it belongs to the devil. Let us go on and progress in the good work, keep up our Zion home and do our duty in all things. H. W. Fredrick.
