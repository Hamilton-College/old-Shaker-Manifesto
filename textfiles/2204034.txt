Books and Papers. Phrenological JOURNAL AND SCIENCE OF HEALTH The March number of the Phrenological JOURNAL AND SCIENCE OF HEALTH Is more than usually supplied with interesting personal or biographical sketches. The editor speaks feelingly and judiciously regarding the late Duke of Clarence and Avondale, and is rather pointed in his condemnation of those who show a fire-eating spirit as concerns the Chilian affair. We have a striking portrait of the Chilian president and views of Valparaiso. The eminent observer and writer, Dr. J. R. Buchanan, is well depicted by Charlotte F. Wells, and a lively summary of the Del Sartes and their works, with two admirable portraits, is given by Carrica Le Favre. Practical Phrenology is well filled. A new series of 'Hits' is introduced, that show the success of such publications. Florence Hull contributes a very valuable paper on Governing Children. Lady Somerset, the temperance advocate, receives appropriate notice. In Science of Health we find some Deductions from Anthropometry, Massage Treatment, Typhoid, The Scotchman's 'Parritch,' etc. The new department of Notes in Anthropology contains a list of items that is very valuable for their solid information. The fact of the increase of insanity among Southern negroes since the civil war is very significant. Price $1.50 a year, with Premium Phrenological Head, $1.65.
