CHIPS Can it be that a little ' wedge of gold,' silver, copper or greenbacks is the splitting point between the circulation and non-circulation of the genuine gospel ? Be it known, that we have, and long have had, a noble, self-sacrificing friend in Melbourne, Australia, by name, W. H. Terry, publisher of The Harbinger of Light, 84 Russell street. We hope all who read this will feel like sending him books, pam- phlets and subscriptions for his paper. We have sent him some ' Plain Talks,' and we wish some of our friends would send him fifty more.
