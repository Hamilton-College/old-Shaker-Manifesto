Dear Children;—Pure thoughts, virtuous deeds, and a clean conscience... Enfield, Conn. Dear Children;—Pure thoughts, virtuous deeds, and a clean conscience, are of priceless worth. Sinful thoughts are germs of sinful habits, and if allowed to take root in your minds, to spring up and grow, they will produce bitter fruits of grief and condemnation. Sinful thoughts, if not erased, will tell on your future destiny. The adversary will fill your minds with bad thoughts and suggestions, if you do not resist them. It is often easier to receive bad guests than to expel them. Evil deeds are produced by evil thoughts. Shun poisonous thoughts, as you would shun poisonous reptiles. If you entertain impure thoughts, you will illustrate them in your lives. Keep evil thoughts at bay. 'God is not in the thoughts of the wicked.' Uproot all sinful inclinations. 'One thought upon another, shapes every life at will; one deed upon another, tells a story, good or ill.' 'Good thoughts are excellent company.' If your thoughts are pure, your lives will be spotless. Purity brings sweet refreshing thoughts—jewels and gems of wisdom. You can possess the power to cherish good thoughts, and to dismiss bad ones ; to encourage those that raise you up, and discard those that draw you down. It is as necessary to turn from evil thoughts, as from evil books, and evil companions. Let your thoughts be such as will blossom and bear good fruit. Let your thoughts be refining and soul-elevating; thoughts that will find their highest use, in being wrought into lives of unselfishness, truth and purity. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
