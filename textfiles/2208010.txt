OUR SISTER. Written in remembrance of EVELYN C. STROWBRIDGE. By Henrietta Morgan. Our loved ones are taken from us one by one to dwell in that 'house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,' where they will receive their reward, and become arrayed in the garments of purity and bask in the sunlight of God's pure love. Although it is sad to part with our loving Sister, we would not call her back to a life of suffering and pain, for we know that her freed spirit rejoices in its happy transition. We shall miss her in the home circle, where she has so long and faithfully labored. To me she has been a true friend and Sister, many times administering loving counsel, which will, I trust, be of lasting benefit. Her work here is done, and I think she was prepared to meet the change. May I so live that when called to leave the shores of time, I may not have to regret a misspent life. Shaker Station, Ct.
