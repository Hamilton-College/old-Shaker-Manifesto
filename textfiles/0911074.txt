BUSINESS MORALITY Religion bids men be honest, not because honesty is the best policy merely ; be truthful, not because lying is unmanly only ; be temperate, not because intemperate habits weaken the intellect and impair the vital energy, and, in short, put you outside the pale of society; but be all these from one supreme, absorbing motive, the fear you have of offending a loving God. It will be the thought of God and of Christ which will alone make us true to man. Our religion will not be of that kind which displays deep emotion in the words of our lips, and then goes out to drive very hard bargains, if not to steal. And what do some men mean by this business morality ? Surely not that God allows and winks at some recognized code of signals by which, if one man can overreach another, it is all fair play. Are the strict commandments of God to be admitted in the church, and an expurgated and revised edition hung up in the counting louse ? Of many business transactions it may be said, ' Everybody does it;' but ,he Christian man will say, ' So do not I, because of the fear of God.'
