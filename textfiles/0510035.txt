A NEW STIMULANT A new juggernaut, it is said, has been set moving in society, and thousands annually fall beneath its wheels. It is a new stimulant, known as hydrate of chloralâ€”a salt of a burning, pungent taste, having as its basis chloroform, into which it is supposed to be changed in the blood. In small doses it is stimulant and anti-spasmodic ; in larger, narcotic; and in excess it produces death as instantaneously as a flash of lightning. Physicians have been variously divided in the opinion of its ultimate results, some recognizing the fearful consequences of its use, others enthusiastically recommending it for ocean travelers as an antidote for seasickness. In England it has taken the place of opium, and chloral-eating is now as decided a vice as opium-eating, hasheesh-eating and absinthe-drinking. The difference between opium and chloral is that, under the same circumstances, opium is more imaginative, and paints things as they do not really exist; chloral merely increases the power of enjoying the real. A strange, dreamy sense of perfect ease, comfort and happiness takes the place of sorrows and cares; all affection and love are likewise banished, and the eater becomes practically a living, breathing vegetable. An opium-eater has been known to live to a goodly old age. No chloralist can survive three years. The stimulant is imported mostly from Germany, and a high authority asserts, in the London Lancet, that there is positively no antidote for the poison.
