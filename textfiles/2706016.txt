In Memory of our Beloved Elder, CLINTON BRAINARD. By Alma J. Shattuck. Again the veil is lifted, Another gone from view; A kind and loving Father,� A brother, good and true. The chain of love is broken, A soul refined and tried By fires of the gospel, Has past from our side. We bow our heads in silence And say, 'Thy will be done.' Go rest in peace, dear Brother, Thou good and faithful one, A crown of peace rests o'er thee, That thy honest works have won For thee a crown of beauty And welcome sound 'well done.' We miss thee, yea, our Brother, For thee we look in vain; Our hearts are filled with sorrow, Thy absence gives us pain. We loved thee and we prized thee Thy form we do not see; With aching hearts we ponder O'er life's great mystery. Tho wearied with earth's troubles And toil-worn were thy feet, From thee no murmur uttered, No doubt and no retreat. Thy true and good example, Thy virtue�self-control, � A monument of goodness Erected in each soul. And when the veil is lifted For us, to enter there, We hope to meet thee brother, Mount Lebanonhe ransomed share. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
