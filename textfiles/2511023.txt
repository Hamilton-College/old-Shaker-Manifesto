Sanitary. Cows that are fed upon hot slops... Cows that are fed upon hot slops, in our cities, lose their teeth, as do human beings who use much hot food. Joel Shrew, M. D. It is proved by bills of mortality... It is proved by bills of mortality, that half who are born die under ten years of age. Half of mankind are said to die of fevers of one kind or another. Are fevers natural? Dr. Alcott. Do you know what causes round shoulders... Do you know what causes round shoulders, particularly in the young? Much depends, no doubt, on sitting a long time, from day to day, in a bad position. God 264 THE MANIFESTO. has kindly given to each of us a pair of shoulder braces, 1 mean of course, the collar bones. Naturally we need no artificials of this sort, though many use them. Nature's own are about six inches long in an adult. In children and youth both ends of each of these bones are soft. It is not till we come to maturity that these are completely ossified or changed to bone. If while we are young, we sit a great portion of our time with the shoulders thrown forward too far, we compress the soft cartilaginous ends of these bones and the cartilages gradually yield and are absorbed, as it is called, so that the braces become too short, and the shoulders remain too far forward. Thus we are made round shouldered. Dr. Alcott.
