Canaan, N. Y. Nov. 6, 1892. The first snow-storm for the season occurred on the 5th., accompanied by high winds; one would think that the winter king had come to stay; but one bright day dissipated the spotless robe that was cast over hill and dale. We have been blest with a bountiful harvest and realized fully the fruition of the promise that they who toil unselfishly in the vineyard, shall be blest in their basket and store. Of garden vegetables we have had a liberal supply. The early Euby tomato is a fine assortment for ripening early; we had five other sorts all of which yielded sufficiently to sell, a great many being in constant demand; small fruits rather scarce; more apples than we anticipated, our crop of potatoes fell somewhat below the mark of our expectation, but will have enough for home consumption. Our Society meetings have closed for the season and we shall realize more the quiet of undisturbed seclusion for a few months, with but an occasional call to and from our dear friends at the North Family. We are three miles from our gospel relation, and this necessitates a little extra exertion on our part to keep in harmony with the leading ministration; we desire to accomplish the race and keep pace with the progress of the glorious work of redemption, believing that where two or three are met in the name of Christ there, he will be in the midst. That the avenues of our spiritual perceptions may be opened and the baptisms of divine power and glory may infill our being and lead us to the knowledge of wisdom and truth to which there is no end, is our earnest prayer.
