HARD TIMES. 'Hard times' is the universal cry and the unemployed are being numbered by the hundreds of thousands. For this multitude there is but little work, and for the work that may be done, the laborer gets only a small compensation. To say that it was always so, does not better the condition and to say that the starvation of the poor brings about the 'survival of the better class,' is quite questionable. The humanity of man should, so far as it is able, ameliorate all these unfortunate conditions and work in the interest of good-will toward men. There is something about this state of affairs that bears a strong resemblance to the lives of the laboring classes in Egypt many thousands of years in the past. Crime is thought by some to be on the increase, and certainly deeds of foulness that cover the catalogue of wicked ways are of daily occurrence. The why and the wherefore is the great wonder of the age. No one seems able to solve the problem or to define the cause, even though the would be worldly-wise are anxiously waiting to be heard. The religionists would have it a political visitation but are not fully decided which party organization is the most culpable. Bad thoughts are generated and bad words are hurled from one to another with little discrimination and with less care for strict justice. The religious wTorld suffers as does the political and the lines of morality have fallen very low, as animal natures'are more keenly aroused. A few incline to see in the dim distance the hand of God, as of old, writing on the wall, and this they say will solve the great mystery. It will tell the whole story, but it will, in all probability, have reference to the shortcomings of our neighbors who are always at fault, and have no special reference to ourselves, as we are generally right. The revolving seasons have brought us quite to the place or condition of that wonderful personage who asked of God,ï¿½'Give me neither poverty nor riches, lest I be full and deny thee, or lest I be poor and steal and take the name of God in vain.' So there seems to be danger in being either ver,y rich or very poor. A great deal has been said, even by Believers about the wage slaves, as though the rich were grinding the faces of the poor and forcing them to suffer unwarrantable distress. This to a large extent may be quite true, and yet there may be poor, hard masters as well as rich ones. The poor are not slow to take advantage of the poor if occasion offers, so that the selfishness of the human mind is quite fully represented through every class. THE MANIFESTO. 65 The only sure remedy, in all probability, that will ever be found for the rich and the poor will be in the words of Jesus, 'Do unto others as ye would that men should do unto you.' This comes directly to the point at issue. The strongest inclination is generally, to do by others as best we can in our own interest. Those who are rich and selfish will force all below them, if possible, to be their slaves, while the ignorant poor will often squander all they may obtain, honestly or dishonestly in a very questionable manner. And yet it is surprising how very dependent the rich and poor are upon the efforts of each other, and then how rapidly the two classes sometimes are found changing places, with each other. The wealthy of one generation may find themselves among the poor in the next, and the poor may by industry and perseverance rise to affluence and wealth.
