HOW NOT TO PREACH Some oi the styles of modern preachers were recently portrayed by Rev. Dr. Hurst, of Madison Seminary, in this wise : ' It takes ten minutes on some Sabbath morning to annihilate Huxley, ten minutes more to knock Farrar's ' eternal hope' to pieces, ten more to do away with Ingefsoll, and about five to close up on the Second Coming. What is going to become of the poor burdened soul who has drifted into the service with his bereavements, and broken future and penitent feelings?' Sound sense is this. It is time that preachers realized that they are neglecting the Gospel when firing away at enemies unknown and invisible to most of their congregations. Such discourses are but a waste of time and ammunition. The simple Gospel of sin, righteousness, judgment and mercy, when faithfully and earnestly delivered, converts more skeptics and other kinds of sinners than all the arguments and denunciations in the world.
