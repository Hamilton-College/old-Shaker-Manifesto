SOMEWHERE Somewhere await the treasure we have strewn Which idle hands and feet have rudely shattered; And tenderest love shall gather as its own The pearls thus scattered. Somewhere, the doubtful seed that we have sown, Shall we disprove a cold uncertain rootage, And vindicate the hope we now disown By fairest fruitage. Somewhere, our human effort of to-day, The faltering outcome of a pure intention, Eternity shall hold as brave assay And true ascension. 0, Universal Soul! The finite range Of earth and time may dwarf our high endeavor, Yet life is victory, through the evolving change Of thy forever. Augusta Cooper Bristol.
