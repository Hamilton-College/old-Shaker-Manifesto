These fanes erected to the 'living God'' will be gradually transformed... [Contributed by E. Myrick.] 'These fanes erected to the 'living God'' will be gradually transformed into temples where science will take the place of superstition ; the priests who minister before the altars of the 'Unknown God.' will become Sages and Teachers of the knowable in art, science, literature and religion. Sunday the brightest of all the week, instead of being devoted to unmeaning formality and tedious hypocrisy, will become the universal day of rest, leisure and Spiritual culture. And the chimes from many an ivyclad church tower instead of tolling funeral knells, and peal ing forth notes of eternal doom, will proclaim liberty, peace and joy throughout the land.'
