AN OPEN LETTER. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Oct. 18-92. Alonzo T. Jones, Editor 'American Sentinel,' Respected Friend :Enclosed please find an article on the 'Sabbaths.' If you can make use of it, it is at your disposal; if not no harm done. I should like to know more about you. You are no ordinary man. Your history would be instructive. Have you not sometime been in connection with the Shaker Order? I can not understand, otherwise, how it is you are so logically clear in your theological ideas. You are also a prophet. What will be the end and limit of Church and State union? And how long will it last? have you ever seen 'Christ's Second Appearing?' Or any Shaker publications ? You are on the right track. You stand 'Stiffly' for principle, regardless of men and women. When you state that, after appealing in vain to the courts and the Constitution, you now appeal to God, as the last resort, you hit the nail right on the head.That appeal will not be in vain. This nation is destined to be the New Earth,and Shakerism will be the New Heavens. That will be the Millennium! In the New Earth, the truths pertaining to the propagative order, advocated by Moses, and by the reformers of all ages and nations, will be reduced to practice-be the law. And the truths seen by the prophet of all ages pertaining to the Resurrection-(Spiritual Order of Shakerism) will be in practical operation. Great Babylonmixture-will be divided into 'three parts ;' the generative order,married men and women ; the Resurrection Order, who are celibates, neither marrying or being given in marriage ; and Intellectual Celibates, men and women who will fill all the offices in the New Earth. These three orders will constitute the long expected millennium. In it, the knowledge of the Lord-Truth-will cover the New Earth and fill the New Heavens, as the waters cover the sea. Truly yours, F. W. Evans.
