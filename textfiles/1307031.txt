SAVE THE BONES While purchasing bone-dust, and fertilizersinto which bone-dust largely enters, do not forget to be sure and utilize all the bones that can be gathered about home. Bone-dust bought in the market costs about two cents a pound. Coarse fragments of bone dissolve very slowly, and for that reason are not so valuable as fine ground bone. Still, if buried near grape-vines or fruit trees, the numberless mouths at the ends of the roots will, in a. few years, eat up and appropriate every particle of plant food they contain. In setting some apple trees, a few years ago, we buried a bushel of bones under each tree. The thrift of the trees and the beauty and size of the. fruit we attribute in a great degree to the bones. A few years ago, we buried some bones near a Flemish Beauty pear tree. The tree bore for the first time during the past season. For size, color and quality of fruit we have seen nothing equaling it in this vicinity. This we attribute mainly to the effect of the bones, though there may be other causes. If one does not care to save and use the bones in this way, they may be burned in the stove and left in the ashes, which will thus be greatly increased in value. Save and utilize the bones.
