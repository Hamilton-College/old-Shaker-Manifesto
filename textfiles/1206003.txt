THE COMING CYCLES ANNIE WICKS 0, the gifts of God are dropping Like the flakes of snow that fall! Down from heaven, filled with glory, They are resting over all. They are floating like bright seraphs, From the beautious golden strand; Fill'd with love, with truth and wisdom, Wafted by an unseen hand. Let us grasp these blessed treasures, While the angels bend to earth ; Let us learn the loving lessons, Of their sweet immortal birth. They have come with gifts of shaking, Tongues of love, and tongues of fire; Gifts of healing for the people, That will lift to life that's higher. See ye not the light that's beaming O'er the hills of truth and peace? 'Tis the grand prophetic cycle, When all war and strife shall cease! When the nations—blended truly— Stand as brothers, hand in hand; Woman in her sphere be reigning, Strong for good in every land. They shall both in honor mingle, Both be upright, just and true ; Each engaged, with noble purpose Will the path of right pursue. Then will angels dwell with mortals, See each other eye to eye, Working for the soul's redemption, Filled with power from on high. And the coming generations, •Shall be ruled by Christian grace, For there will be true progression In a nobler better race. Then through hearts by good inspired, Angels from the worlds above, Will descend to teach earth's children Truths that form a heaven of love. They will lift the darkened spirit With their words of hope and cheer, That they may attain salvatfon E're they reach another sphere. Welcome then the angel bearers, Of God's power and truth sublime ; They will lighten all our burdens Through the vale of transient time. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
