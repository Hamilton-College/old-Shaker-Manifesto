A CALL FOR MERCY EUNICE WYTHE. [This poem was composed by sister Eunice while 3he was held in bondage to the relations of the world.] Father of mercies hear the erieo That rend my feeble breast Redress my sorrows, hear my sighs And answer my request. Kind Mother on Mount Zion's height An outcast child behold Let mercy's hand unlock the gate And lead me to thy fold. I mourn and sorrow like a dove Thy mercy to obtain sMy soul depends on mother's love To bring me home again. 0 God I look to thee for power To cut this cruel chain If thou wilt burst the prison door I'll not return again. Dear Brethren ever kind and just Where charity belongs Who are at Mother's banquet blest Remember those in bonds. Dear Sisters who in love combine And f?ast at Mother's board Unite your prayers to God witli mine That I may be restored. Ye pure attendants of the Lamb My fervent prayer receive That T may ever bless the name That does my soul relieve. Bright Angels spread your wings around And be my swift convoy To bear me safe to Zion's ground The seat of peace and joy. But if 'tis best to stand the test And patiently endure Lord may I have beyond the grave A refuge with the pure. Let patience stand at my right hand To keep me meek and mild That I may wait a better state Completely reconciled. Harvard, Mass.
