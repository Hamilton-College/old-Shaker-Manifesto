CHRIST THE HARVESTER Alonzo G. Hollister. 'The harvest is great, tut tine laborers are few.'''' Jesus. 'We pray to the Lord of the harvest, to send laborers into the field.' ' The first attribute of Wisdom is use.'� Harmonia. 'He hath made all things for their uses.'� Eccl. These are Neiv Testament quotations from Emphatic Diaglott. A popular Editor of a widely read magazine, wrote 'Shakerism is good for nothing if it is not good universally� if it ought not to be adopted universally. But universal adoption would be the suicide of the race, and a race has no more right to commit suicide than a man.' This string of assertions by proving too much, overthrows itself. It makes propagation over-ride every other consideration, and the paramount duty of every human creature. A conclusion opposed to the common judgment, to which the sophism is addressed. If it were true, it would make Jet*us Christ and all who follow his example, guilty of suicide. Moreover, the finest moral consciousness of the best minds of the race, condemns the act of suicide, while the same consciousness approves the act of virgin continence, in a life consecrated to God, from a desire to purify one's soul, and to benefit others. If any feel that it is their duty to multiply their species, after hearing the gospel that Jesus Christ lived and taught, Shakerism says to such, 'by all right means discharge that duty first; for no one who believes that to be an obligation, is prepared to receive Christ's gospel in its purity.' The fallacy of Dr. Holland's reasoning will appear in the following syllogism. It is not good to make wheat into bread unless all wheat should be made into bread. But if all wheat were made into bread, it would end propagation, contrary to the Divine plan. Therefore, no wheat should be made into bread. This represents the gist of his argument, whicii is commonly regarded by the ignorant as a knockdown against the gospel of virgin brotherhood aud sisterhood. The possibility of a higher use for life than to propagate species, seems not to have penetrated their thoughts. Incontestibly, the highest use for wheat, is as food for man. Take this away, and the main ^ause for its propagation, ceases. By applying a part to seed the ground, a large surplus is liberated to be used as food without periling the existeuce of the species. Here we perceive propagation is not the chief end for which life exists, but is a means only for multiplying individuals and continuing a species. It is thus with man. The highest use of his existence here, is not to propagate his species iu mortal bodies, nor to augment physical existence, but to prepare for a new and superior life in Christ, the Harvester of the world, iu which earthly generation can no more exist, than reproduction of wheat, exists in bread. The elements are there, but not the function ; they are disintegrated by the woman's 'leaven,' aud recombined for higher uses. Hence, to forbid converting one's life to its highest use in the service of heaven, because it disqualifies him for animal propagation, is to destroy the real use of propagation, by preventing advance to the higher life, the true end for which it was instituted. We say animal propagation, because continence and elevated aims, controlled by a holy Spirit, do not destroy propagation, but eliminates it from the animal, transfers it to mind, and sublimated in quality, it propagates a heavenly, incorruptible life, in lieu of the earthly and perishable. The procreative function in man, was made subordinate to the dictates of wisdom in rational understanding, and designed to be controlled by the will. Man practically iguores this radical law of his being, by utterly disregarding the order of seasons and times implanted in nature,�the fitness or unfitness of parties and circumstances�the rights of offspring to be well born- -and more, by making pleasure and not posterity, his object in this relation. At the same time, he practically admits that tie possesses the power and responsibility of self-control, by enacting statutes, attended with penalties for violations, to operate as substitutes for the higher, wiser and more efficient restraint to use for offspring only, which a due culture and illumination of the moral principle, establishes in the mind. Generation being an animal function, is confessedly inferior to the wisdom faculties, which are commanded by their quality and office, to subdue and have dominion over the animal. Hence, when the latter is exalted above Reason, the order of creation in man is inverted, the government through reason and judgment subverted, and the mental eye is baffled and confused into substituting effects for causes, pleasures for uses, and means for ends. He who discards the true uses of life and makes pleasure his leading pursuit, has or will have ample cause to ask himself, ' Is life worth living?' For by subordinating intellect to passion, he becomes a slave to 'the beast' that is in him, and is a worshiper of 'The Beast and his Image,' in his own imagination. It is written 'His servants ye are to whom ye yield yourselves to obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness.' Jesus declares 'He that doeth sin is the slave of sin.' These are truisms, not annulled by rejecting the authority which formulated them in speech. 'And the whole world wondered after the Beast. And they worshiped the Dragon (fierce devourer) because he gave authority to the Beast, saying, Who is like the wild Beast? And who is able to make war with the Beast ?' that giveth pleasure and preserves the species. 'And all those dwelling on the earth will prostrate to the Beast, whose names are not written iu the book of the Life of the Lamb, slain from the foundation of a world.' The foundation of this world is generation, and the social relations thence arising, from which the Lamb, Jesus and his virgin followers, are slain by the daily cross, and the testimony which they bear. 'Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bears much fruit.' As the grain must die to its first state, in order to multiply and transmit life to offspring, so must the human soul die to life in the auirnal propensities, which pertain solely to the earthly and rudimental state, in order to rise in the life of those heavenly graces and virtues which come down from above, and crown the victor over the beast within him, with immortal glory and honor. �'For whoever will save his [animal] soul, shall lose it, but whoever will lose his soul for my sake and the gospel, shall find it.' Mark viii. 'He, loving his [animal] soul, shall lose it, and he, hating his soul in this world, shall preserve it unto aonian life.*' John. It should be observed in this connection, that the ancients applied the term soul, [psucheen] to the seat of appetite and passion, and ascribed souls to animals. In Jude 19, it is translated sensual, marg. animal. Those who are called by the gospel in this life, and are faithful to overcome the world and conquer sin in the flesh while clothed with earthly tabernacles, sit spiritually upon white horses, as when heaven opened to the vision of John. These transform their affections, and conserve and transmute those vital forces pertaining to generation, into mental and spiritual powers and virtues, and raise them from the earthly, on to the Divine celestial plane. This transformation is typified in the conversion of the reproductive elements of wheat or other grains, into animal tissues and instruments of thought in man. Emerson's fine intuition bears witness to the law of the harvest, which we have here endeavored to expound, as follows. 'The human body is a vessel in which the Elixir of life is stored. Will a man spend for pleasure ? 'i he way to ruin is short and facile. [He glides down into the animal and becomes a slave to 'the Beast.'] Will he not spend, but hoard for power? It passes through the sacred alchemy according to that law of nature [and also of grace] whereby all life [disciplined on a lower,] cb'mbs to higher platforms, and bodily vigor, becomes mental and moral vigor. Alimentation becomes in higher laboratories, imagery and thought, and iu still higher results, courage aid fortitude.' Infused here, with a holy spirit from above, it becomes charity, beneficence and liberality, and more aud more unfolds till it is complete iu every virtue, and dispenses the all-healing, creative power of eternal life, in the perfect liberty of the children of God. ��True thrift, is to ^pend on the higher plans ; namely, in spiritual creation, and not in augmenting auimal existence. Man is not enriched unless through new powers and ascending pleasures, he knows himself by actual experience of higher good, to be already on the way to the highest.' Certainly no true disciple of the Divine Teacher will deny that, the highe-t good is found only in Christ. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
