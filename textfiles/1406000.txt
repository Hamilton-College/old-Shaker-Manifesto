WHAT IS TRUE RELIGION? ANTOINETTE DOOLITTLE There be gods many ' and religions many ; but only one true God and one true religion. Hence we inquire : What is true religion? All peoples, tongues and nations have had their religion, true or false. Pagan religion was one kind ; the ancient Jews had another form ; the Budhists of the Orient, which are very numerous, have theirs. The Christian religion (so-called, especially in America) is divided into sects and parties, chiefly classed under two great heads or ruling powers, Catholic and Protestant, but, when summed up, called by one name. Christian religion ! What shall we understand by the phrase ? Religion, when defined, we conclude means the soul's reliance�something to depend and lean upon. Webster's definition of religion, as far as it goes, is very good. He says : t; Religion is a high sense of moral obligation, and spirit of reverence or worship, which effect the heart with respect to Deity. ' Add his rendering of the meaning of ' Sanctity, which denotes purity of heart and life, springing from habitual communion with God. and a sense of His continual presence,' and we think we get a good hypothesis, as far as theory can extend, of what religion is and is designed to effect. In accord with a firm belief in any kind of religion, so, to a large extent, will the life practices of its adherents be. Hope of reward and fear of punishment have much to do with the religion of the present age. What in parlance is called religion is often national, traditional and inherited. In Catholic countries, ancestral religion, which comes from parents to children, often goes with them through life. Such persons, as a rule, do not think deeply nor reason for themselves, but conclude that what their sires and grandsires believed must be true. It is a trite saying; 'Whatpersons have not reasoned themselves into they will not be likely to reason themselves out of. ' Ancestral religion, we find, is not generally effectual unto salvation. Human beings, as a whole, are on the side of ease and self-indulgence. They like what brings to them the largest amount of present pleasure and the least resfcraiut. Thus, we see how easy it is for people to accept the doctrine of the atonement-�cne righteous man living, dying, suffering for all, to expiate their transgressions of moral and spiritual laws. People generally are beginning to understand, that physically, each individual must suffer the consequence of his or her wrong doings, and that effects follow causes, and that a 'mysterious Providence ;' does not inflict punishment upon the bodies of human beings. Diseases are often transmitted by parents from generation to generation, and in that way the sins of ignorance or of willful delinquencies follow from age to age, to vex and torture their progenies. Those entailed ills have to be borne as best they may, until outgrown by adherence to physical law, which require patience and perseverence in well doing. ideal religion, produced by erudite scholarship and largely discussed in the numerous churches of our time, show eloquence, and as far as theory can go, could not well be surpassed, but how much vital energy, effecting the life practices of those who listen to those finely-framed speeches, let those who are able decide. True heart religion energizes the soul and is its dearest and most valued friend ; and, when its mission is fully performed, it will permeate the whole being, and really make the surrounding atmosphere redolent with healthful life and beauty. Genuine religion cannot find full expression in words, but will manifest itself at all times and in all places in the minutest deeds of life. It is the soul's panacea, the tree of life to the spirit, and bears fruit meet for all needs. While prayer is the essence of divine love in the human heart, its breath of life which cannot be expressed by any form of speech, words detract from and lessen its potency, but, when unalloyed, it is the cementing link in the golden chain that binds the finite to the Infinite. True religion and prayer will form a perfect elysium where the soul can rest in God. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. '
