NOW. The following lines from Household Word*, are full of wholesome advice as well as beautiful imagery. They convey to the youthful dreamer alessou which it would be well for him to ponder. Arise ! for the day is passing While you lie dreaming on; Your brothers are cased in armor, And forth to the fight are gone; Your place in the ranks awaits you; Each man has a part to play; The past and the future are nothing In the face of the stern to-day. Arise from your dreams of the future, Of gaining a hard fought field, Of storming the airy fortress, Of bidding the giant yield; Your future lias deeds of glory, Of honor ; (God grant it may!) But your arm will never be stronger, Or needed as nowâ€”to-day. Arise ! If the past detain you, Her sunshine and storms forget; No chains so unworthy to hold you As those of a vain regret; Sad or bright, she is lifeless ever; Cast her phantom arms away, Nor look back, save to learn the lesson Of a nobler strife to-day. Arise ! for the hour is passing; The sound that you dimly hear, Is your enemy marching to battle! Rise !, rise ! for the foe is near ! Stay not to brighten your weapons, Or the hour will strike at last, And from dreams of a coming battle, You will waken, and find it past. Household Words
