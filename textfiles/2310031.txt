In memory of Sister HARRIET SHEPARD, of Union Village, O. Watson Andrews. 'Our Sister's gone, she is no more, She's left our coast, and quit our shore; Her spirit fled, and soars away To regions of eternal day.' Long time she tarried, suffered long, Did lack of patience do her wrong? We ask forgiveness, can no more, Since she has left this mortal shore, Beyond the reach alike of pain,� Of mortal kindness, earthly gain, If aught we've lacked in kindly deed, Or soothing smile in hours of need, We still are here and can amend Our ways, and be the sufferer's friend; And thus regain, if lost, her care, And kind remembrance and prayer. While she released from earthly fears, From earthly burdens, pains and tears, Has doubtless borne to that bright shore, Only the good here wrought in store. Not sounding titles, famous names, Nor splendid gifts, nor hoarded gains, Avail the soul in its last hour, Nor earthly pomp, nor earthly power, Nor saving power by others won, Attaining grace by David's Son, But heaven consists,�taught Mother Ann, In love to God and love to man.
