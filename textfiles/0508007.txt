Mt. Lebanon, June 17,1875 Dear Friend Miller : Your highly valued letter of the 14th is at hand. Let me get an article out of it for the Shaker and Shakeress. It is too good to lie idle in my desk. I shall use it, unless you say nay. About the flowers and all that, there is no difference in principle. But about dress, you are intoxicated with the wine of Babylon. Your world's women are horridly ugly — no beauty about them — while Shaker women are the glory of the earth, and when materialized, at the Eddys, as they are, are admitted by all to be beauty incarnated. Your sense of beauty is perverted. It will come right, if you have a care of your diet. Beauty rests upon utility. Also, we are only in our First Degree of the Seven. Let us alone until we grow up to the Ornamental. We want first to ' clean escape the corruptions that are in the world through lust.' Then, in this our Second Degree, we want to be freed from all physical diseases. We shall then have occasion for flowers, instrumental music, and cause for Ornamentation. Sin, painted, is one of the most detestable of sights. When I look at world's women, bedecked with jewels and loaded down with dry goods, I keep thinking of the ills that female flesh is heir to, in this day. They should dress in ' sack cloth and ashes,' so that the inner and outer might agree. Am always pleased to hear from you. Kind regards to your family, to friend Train, and to all friends. F. W. Evans
