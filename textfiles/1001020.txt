Editor Shaker Manifesto: 'Peace be unto you'... Greensburg, Decatur County, Ind., November 13, 1879 Editor Shaker Manifesto : ' Peace be unto you.' Dear Brotherâ€”To those who love your teachings I must honestly confess I cannot understand how you dare at this Christian Age of the world, to assert that you do not worship Jesus. I noticed this in your pamphlet called ' Plain Talks,' and I am wonderfully surprised that a man calling himself a Christian, should place his sentiment in the public print. I suppose you think He had a natural father, and therefore a bastard ; and therefore unworthy of your worship. Do you know when you make this assertion, and, of course, deny His divinity, you deny the plain teachings of God's Holy Word, and plunge the soldier's spear to the heart of the Holy Blessed Jesus ? who suffered the death of the natural and spiritual cross, thereby subduing the hosts of hell, to make it possible for you and I to be saved. I do from my heart pity your state of soul. But the kind, loving Jesus still prays, ' Father forgive him, for he knows not what he is doing.' Oh, may the Lord open your eyes, and like Judas say, ' I have betrayed innocent blood.' Edward U. Blake
