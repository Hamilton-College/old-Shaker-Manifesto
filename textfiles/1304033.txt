THE TEETH. The teeth should always, if possible, be thoroughly cleansed by means of pure, soft water and a brush, immediately after each meal. Tooth powders of a very fine and mechanical nature are allowable. Quill tooth picks are the only ones that should be used. Tea and coffee blacken the teeth. All hot substances are injurious. Everything that deteriorates the general health, injures the teeth. Dr. Shew.
