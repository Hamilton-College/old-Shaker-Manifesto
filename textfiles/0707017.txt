Dear Sister Betsey: Your kind letter was duly received, but my many cares prevented me from answering it at that time. I feel lonely ; somehow I walk before the Lord with fear and trembling. I do not become reconciled as I had hoped to have done before this. The world does not seem bright and fair as it used to. I have grown tired of living in it. Many times a day I leave my work, and with tears I cannot repress, I take my Bible and seek to find in it the comfort I can find no where else. I want to be free from the burden of sin. I had hoped to come and labor with you, and live, perhaps, a useful life; but my brother has no one to care for him, and he will not come with me. ' Ephraim is joined to his idols; let him alone.' It may be that the passion that commonly rules mankind may lead him to choose another companion, when my services will no longer be required; if so, I will take my little girl and seek among you that peace and quiet that the world cannot give. The world seems colder and harder since visiting you, and I will not mix with it. I read everything in ' The Shaker ' you kindly send to me, and prize it highly. I would never tire of 'The Shaker.' God bless 'The Shaker.' Give my love to all the dear sisters, and write again, please Victoria Baker To Betsey Johnson, West Pittsfield, Mass.
