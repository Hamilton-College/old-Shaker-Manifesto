GOLDEN GATE Canaan, N. Y. 1. Lead me lest mine eyes be blinded, And thy way I fail to see; 2. Feed me lest my spirit famish, For the bread and living wine; Guide my trembling, erring footsteps Teach me, and my life forever, Father, home to Mother, shall be thee. thine. CHORUS. Home to thee, Ever thine, Home to thee, Yet Ever time, Still trusting will I wait, Till trusting will I wait, Till ¦#¦' Angels bear me o'er the sea, And ope' the golden gate.
