RESPONSIBILITY Each Contributor is accountable for his or her own sentiments or ideas. It is the duty of Editors, being responsible to Authors, to prepare matter for the press. Writers should be 'A little deaf, a little blind, If happiness they'd surely find,' Or, otherwise, write only what has been well thought out. Better write two or three short articles, than one too long. It is no more advisable to ' catch the hare before you cook it,' than it is to have some- thing to say before you say it. Yet, as the only way to prepare a population for a repub- lic, is to establish one; as there are no means by which a child can learn to talk, except prattling; and as only those who go often into the water, at the risk of going under, be- come good swimmers, so it is with composingâ€” putting ideas into words. Therefore write, that you may learn to write; first being certain that already you do not know how. All Contributors, whatever become of their contributions, have our CORDIAL THANKS. Each one is expected to do better next time. We quote, or copy, for information. And never indorse by implication.
