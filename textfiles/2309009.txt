FACE TO FACE WITH TROUBLE. You are face to face with trouble, And the skies are murk and gray; You hardly know which way to turn, You are almost dazed, you say. And at night you wake to m onder What the next day's news will bring; Your pillow is brushed by phantom care With a grim and ghastly wing. You are face to face with trouble; A child has gone astray; A ship is wrecked on the bitter sea; There's a note you cannot pay; THE MANIFESTO. 211 Your brave right hand is feeble; Your sight is growing blind; Perhaps a friend is cold and stern, Who was ever warm and kind. You are face to face with trouble; No wonder you cannot sleep; But stay, and think of the promise, The Lord will safely keep, And lead you out of the thicket, And into the pasture land; You have only to walk straight onward, Holding the clear Lord's hand. Face to face with trouble; And did you forget to look, ; As the good old father taught you, : For help to the dear old Book? You have heard the tempter whisper, � And you've had no heart to pray, And God has dropped from your scheme O! for many a weary day! [of life, Then face to face with trouble; It is thus He calls you back From the land of dearth and famine To the land that has no lack. You would not hear in the sunshine; You hear in the midnight gloom; Behold, his tapers kindle Like stars in the quiet room. O! face to face with trouble, Friend, I have often stood; To learn that pain hath sweetness, To know that God is good. Arise and meet the daylight; Be strong and do your best! With an honest heart, and a childlike faith That God will do the rest. �Selected.
