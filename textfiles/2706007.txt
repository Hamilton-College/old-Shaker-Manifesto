It being customary to use our Periodical for recording notes of the weal and woe of our various organizations, I take the liberty to present a picture in brief of how things move in and around our domicile. It is the vernal season of the year, when 'Vernal flowers are preparatives to Autumnal fruits.' It being seed time we are busy in making preparation, by plowing and sowing, for the future harvest. The earth is attired:� 'By the soft season, when descending showers Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flo wei's.' If old Tyrant Frost is firmly kept in check and martingal, the indices point to a fruitful season. Sr. Amelia Calver having taken a trip to the United State's Capitol City and vicinity and having surveyed the works of art and monuments of wealth returned to her mountain home April 30. Some others have made an eternal visit to the New Jerusalem, the City of Heavenly Light. May 2nd, Sabbath afternoon, a company from the Mount went to Hancock to attend the funeral of Eldress Lois Wentworth. This afternoon we are summoned to attend the funeral of Sister Olive Chapel of the South family. 'On Eaith we have no ul&gt;iiing place . But to*t as billows beat.' My wandering thought sometimes runs against a query, that may not, at present, admit of a definite solution.�Example: Is the earth plane a nursery for producing intelligent individualities to people the spirit spheres'? Were there individualized spirits without first being developt in the matrix of materiality? If so, why were not all created spirits at fiist, uninfected by materiality? Why? Calvin G. Reed North. Family. May, 1897. Yesterday there past, through our peaceful village, seven teams heavily loaded with gun-powder; whither bound we are not yet informed. We hope it may not be for human destruction, but the thought gives vis a shudder while the news of war and rumors of greater war are daily reaching us. Greatly in contrast is this to the sights and sounds which greet eye and ear at the present moment. The strife may not be less�but how different in motive and effect. The 'shouldering arms' with lumber and garden implements by the Brethren,, with equipments for housecleaning and window painting by the Sisters, while the wondrous miracle of spring unrolls as TERMS. a beautiful vision to the inner as to the outer perceptions when we read what it symbolize.s in the life of humanity. Surely as the gushing life of spring and the golden wealth of harvests are wrapt in the cold bosom of winter, so during the long period of seeming spiritual inertia which, has brooded over the world, vital forces have been concentrating that ere long will find expression in a more enlightened and advanced people than have ever before been the subjects of a deep spiritual revival. Let us who have years and responsibility before us renew our faith in God, in the potency of justice and in its fuller meaning�Love, and whatever the present seeming advantages, bear always in mind that no blessing to the individual or community can ever accrue through a compromise of righteous principles. Many before us and with us have set noble examples while some have mist the mark. We are debtors to the wise and to the unwise. . By kindness of Editor in sending copies we are glad to know that 'History of the Shakers' has been put in pamphlet form entitled 'A Christian Community.' We think it the most agreeably written and, for its length, the most comprehensive of any sketch which has yet been issued. In appearance and worth it is a twin to 'Advent of the Christ in Man and Woman,' by the same author. The latter is equally graceful, clear and well-adapted for present circulation among refined and intelligent people. Blessings to all who are spreading the light. Catherine Allen. West Pittsfield, Mass. May, 1897. As I tried to recall some item of news by which I might interest the members of the Home Circle, and finding none, Sussyi Coolidge's beautiful poem came to my mind so appropriately that I 'pass it on' for the benefit of others. 'A commonplace life we say and we sigh, But wliy should we sigh as we say? The commonplace sun in the commonplace sky Makes up the commonplace day. The moon and the stars are commonplace things, And the flower that hlooms, and the bird that sings, But dark were the world and sad our lot, If the flowers should fail and the sun shine not,� And God, who studies each separate soul, Of our commonplace lives makes His beautiful whole.' Daily duties, enobled by Christlike motives may, like the diamond, be transformed from stones in the pathway to bright jewels in a crown. Housecleaning has been the chief industry during the past few weeks, and the 'Little drops of water, and little grains of sand,' have found a more practical use than 'making mighty oceans' or 'forming beauteous lands.' Nature's artist is busily at work adorning the hills and valleys about our home. The sweet Trailing Arbutus, which in part recompenses for the long cold winter, has brightened us with its star-like blossoms, and the friendly wild flowers, respond in answer to the 'Roll-call,' of the sun. The birds are daily holding long sessions of a Congress for the purpose of discusssing summer residences of safety and comfort. Among other welcome spring arrivals was that of Eldress Miriam Offord who alighted at our home and spent a short time with us, but she 'spread her wings for flight' and disappeared, ere we had but heard the flutter of her wings. Elder George Clark also spent a few hours with us. We are at present enjoying the presence of our loved Ministry. We would chain the feet of Father Time if by so doing we might hinder his flig ht, and thus make their stay with us lo nger, but he is a swift traveler, and each day disappears with 'King Sol' in his journey beyond our mountains in the west, before we can capture him. Eldress Lois, of East family, left us, the last day of April for a home in the Sum- mer Land, where we are told the beauties of summer are never interrupted by the cold winter. Her friends, including some from Mt. Lebanon, met to say farewell, only for a time, however, for we wish to join her in that heavenly home, at some future time. Fidelia Estabrook.
