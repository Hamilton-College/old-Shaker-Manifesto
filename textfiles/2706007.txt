West Pittsfield, Mass. May, 1897. As I tried to recall some item of news by which I might interest the members of the Home Circle, and finding none, Sussyi Coolidge's beautiful poem came to my mind so appropriately that I 'pass it on' for the benefit of others. 'A commonplace life we say and we sigh, But wliy should we sigh as we say? The commonplace sun in the commonplace sky Makes up the commonplace day. The moon and the stars are commonplace things, And the flower that hlooms, and the bird that sings, But dark were the world and sad our lot, If the flowers should fail and the sun shine not,ï¿½ And God, who studies each separate soul, Of our commonplace lives makes His beautiful whole.' Daily duties, enobled by Christlike motives may, like the diamond, be transformed from stones in the pathway to bright jewels in a crown. Housecleaning has been the chief industry during the past few weeks, and the 'Little drops of water, and little grains of sand,' have found a more practical use than 'making mighty oceans' or 'forming beauteous lands.' Nature's artist is busily at work adorning the hills and valleys about our home. The sweet Trailing Arbutus, which in part recompenses for the long cold winter, has brightened us with its star-like blossoms, and the friendly wild flowers, respond in answer to the 'Roll-call,' of the sun. The birds are daily holding long sessions of a Congress for the purpose of discusssing summer residences of safety and comfort. Among other welcome spring arrivals was that of Eldress Miriam Offord who alighted at our home and spent a short time with us, but she 'spread her wings for flight' and disappeared, ere we had but heard the flutter of her wings. Elder George Clark also spent a few hours with us. We are at present enjoying the presence of our loved Ministry. We would chain the feet of Father Time if by so doing we might hinder his flig ht, and thus make their stay with us lo nger, but he is a swift traveler, and each day disappears with 'King Sol' in his journey beyond our mountains in the west, before we can capture him. Eldress Lois, of East family, left us, the last day of April for a home in the Sum- mer Land, where we are told the beauties of summer are never interrupted by the cold winter. Her friends, including some from Mt. Lebanon, met to say farewell, only for a time, however, for we wish to join her in that heavenly home, at some future time. Fidelia Estabrook.
