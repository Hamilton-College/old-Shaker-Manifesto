GOING HOME. 'Ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest such an one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.'ï¿½2 Cor. ii., 7. Affetuoso. Canterbury, N. H. 1890. I will rise and go to my Father's house Where bread and wine are free, Where I know the gifts that my spirit craves, Are kindly spread for me. I will seek the balm for every wound, Forgiveness God's pure love; I will take the cross, the burden bear, And with the faithful move.
