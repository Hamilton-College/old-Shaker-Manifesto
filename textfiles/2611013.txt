Enfield, N. H. Oct. 1896. In this age of spiritual enlightenment, when the evangelical churches are blending in fellowship, and giving as did Jesu the Christ, free gifts of mind and soul for the elevation of the needy, it bespeaks volumes of praise to the doers of the work ai well as the hearers of the word of salvation. It is pleasant to realize that the old fence of exclusiveness that once hedged in the various churches is crumbling away, and the living vines of truth are drawing mankind out of the furrows of dogmatic narrowness into the broad fields of Christian duty. During the pleasant month of September we enjoyed a feast of love and soul communion with Sisters Sarah Barker and Elmira Hillsgrove, of East Canterbury. We are always pleased to meet our gospel kindred and would by courteous hospitable greetings let such know that we belong to the household of faith. Sisters Isabella Russell and Henrietta Spooner who attended the fairs, report good sales of fancy articles, and Brother John Bradford's onions and beets drew first premium. With renewed love to all, we waft a prayer petitioning strength for God's people everywhere. 'When soon or late we reach that coast. O'er life's rough ocean driven, May we rejoice, no wanderer lost, One family in Heaven.' George H. Baxter.
