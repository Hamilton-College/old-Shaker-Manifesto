Dear Children;—You are sowing on the field of... Enfield, Conn. May, 1882 Dear Children;—Yoti are sowing on the field of life. Be sure that the sesd is good. Now is the time to sow seeds of truth and virtue. Golden opportunities are often not valued till they are gone. Sowing 'wild oats' is a poor investment; sowing to the spirit yields a good return for expenditure. You cannot sow 'tares' and reap wheat. You cannot walk the broad road and the narrow path at the same time. You are sowing the seeds of life and happiness, or of death and misery. 'You'll surely reap the harvest from the seed you daily sow; you scatter thorns or roses, what you cultivate will grow.' 'Thorns never bear figs nor thistles grapes.' Each field produces a harvest of the seed sown; each act of your lives is a seed sown, which will produce a crop, and the harvest will be the same as was the sowing, not something else. If you sow 'tares' you will reap vices. 'One year's weed, sevren year's seed.' Let the product of your lives be such as you will be proud to garner. Be pure, then each act will be a fruitful seed. Sow the seeds of truth and virtue, then the blossoms will be SHAKER MANIFESTO. 213 the perfect ones of hope and cheerfulness, and the fruit, real happiness and joy. 'If you sow the seeds of sin, corruption youwilj gather in : if you to the spirit sow, life eternal you will know.' Think not lightly of these things. Guard well the gaps through which temptation enters your souls. There is a powerful incentive to gain the overcomer's regard. There is honor and eternal life before you. Your hearts are rich in possibilities, but as you sow you will reap golden grain q,r anxious weeds. Your brother, Daniel Orcutt
