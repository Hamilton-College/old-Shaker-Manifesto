Care of House Plants A lady in Kansas gives her plan of caring for house-plants as follows: 'I live in a frame house, and last Winter kept fifty pots of different kinds of geraniums, roses, fuchsias, and remontant pinks, all of which received the same kind of treatment, and in the spring my plants were more healthy and the leaves a dark-green color. Many came to me for slips in preference to the green-houses. Every two weeks all the Winter I would take a handful of tobacco-stems and steep them by pouring boiling water over them until it looked like strong tea; then when the tea cooled enough to bear the hand, I poured it over the plants. Sometimes the leaves would wilt for a few moments, and then straighten out and Jiave that bright, fresh look they have in summer after a shower. Then I would weaken the tea a little more and wet the ground in the pots, and I had no red spider nor green fly.'
