THE PREPARATORY WORK. Alonzo G. Hollister. The angels are deeply engaged in the preparatory work for the new Dispensation, operating in the spirit and power of Elijah, who is the Lord's messenger going before ; turning the hearts of the fathers to draw the children, and the hearts of the children to the righteousness of the fathers, which causes a revival of the spirit of obedience to the light of the closing Dispensation, as a prelude to the one about to enter. The preparatory work, is like the twilight that precedes the dawn of day. John the Baptist was the most noted visible agent in this work at the time of Christ's first appearing. The Society of James and Jane Wardley stood in the same relation to his second appearing. But as the final harvest of the world has commenced, and the field is very extensive, embracing all conditions, classes and nations of people, and as Christ's coming is still future to all who have not received him, the preparatory spirit is not limited to one time or locality, but continues to operate in such places and with such persons as are nearest ripe for the harvest work, and will thus continue to the consummation. It may be likened to preparing the earth in the Spring to receive seed. Until Christ, the Divine seedsman, appears (in his witnesses,) the seed of ''the Kingdom' cannot be sown. Or it may be likened to clearing the ground of rubbish, preparatory to founding a building, which cannot be erected in the Order of the New Dispensation, until Christ the builder, or architect, appears to direct. Therefore if souls commence to build in this light, and cease to look forward to that increasing and perfect work which it preludes, they will either fail and fall into a darker state than whence they rose ; or if they succeed in forming a system, become a dead body in the streets of mystic Babylon, and the result be the same. For if it be inconsistent to expect for a system established in the greatest light and power of the first Christian Dispensation, a better fate than that of the Primitive Church, which was supplanted by mystic Babylon, what should be expected of a system formed near its close, after its succeeding dispensation has commenced. The call now issues, 'Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.' Therefore to persist in sinning after hearing the warning, is to cleave to the plagues of old Babylon. Hence, sincere seekers must advance by the light and call of the spirit into increasing self-denial; a criterion taken in connection with its fruits, by which the salvation work may be certainly known. For as the flesh is lawless, and ever contrary to the Spirit, so the work of God is necessarily, ever opposed to man's carnal will, and eventually undermines and destroys all pride and vain glory. Yet it leaves the volitions free. ''Souls shall be willing in the day of my Power,' and 'The willing and obedient, shall eat the good of the land.' If there should appear to be a cessation of the work, let none turn aside from the way�there was half an hour's silence in heaven while the trumpet angels were preparing to sound�and they who wait upon the Lord are promised renewed strength. For unto you that revere his name, and watch and work for his coming, shall the sons and daughters of righteousness arise with healing in their wings ; to comfort the mourner, aud bind up the broken hearted who sigh for the reign of God to commence, and continue evermore. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
