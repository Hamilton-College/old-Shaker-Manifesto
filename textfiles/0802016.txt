WARNING Impressed by a Father's Spirit Why clad in sackcloth—sorrow's garb— When God's free light encircles thee? What sin has so defiled, or marred, That God, in truth, ye no more see? What snares have thine own fingers wrought To rob thee of thy robe and crown? Is not my love of greater worth Than all earth's wealth—could it be found? O brother, sister, where art thou ? Still wrestling for thy sordid self ? Art thou so fattened in (his love, Thy birthright goes for worldly pelf ? Look yonder—canst thou bear the sight— Thy name wiped from the Book of Life— Because thou didst not strength implore, And weakness conquer, in the strife? O favored child! confess, repent! And Jordan's waves will make thee whole; Fear not to plunge, throw off thy weight, And thou shalt save thy sinking soul! O, if the wretched lives of those Who've put afar the evil day, Could be unrolled, what deep regrets Those truthful records would convey! Justice may wait; yet sure as God Has called souls from the broad highway, So sure, will his unchanging law Be felt by all who disobey. Life unto life, death unto death, The savor of his work shall prove; This joy, or wail, shall yet be heard From all who've shared his boundless lore. Canterbury, N. H.
