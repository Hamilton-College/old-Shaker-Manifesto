REIGN OF PEACE. ''Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.'St. John, xvi., 27. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Pure as the fadeless noonday light. Calm as the gentle hush of night, 2. Read we of days when sword and spear,Darkened the earth with death and fear, 3. Many hosannas joyously, Sounded in Bethlehem glad and free, 4. For we have seen love's guiding ray, Followed its course till perfect day, Sweet as the breeze from the mountain's hight, Is peace, pure heavenly peace. Love chorded not in the strains of cheer, Nor peace, pure heavenly peace. And on the plains of fair Galilee, For the Prince of heavenly peace. Grateful to God who has filled the way, With peace, pure heavenly peace. Come to our hearts with thy loveliness, Soften our lives, control and bless, Bud to the world in its gloom and blight, Now has appeared the Christ of light, We too can join in a heartfelt song, Glad that the right is conquering wrong, Sound we again many praises sweet,Sung to the tread of angels' feet, Mold us and ever our souls possess, Sweet peace, holy peace, Substance of truth and the pow'r of right, Of peace, holy peace, Making our spirits in virtue strong, In peace, holy peace, For they are coming all souls to meet, In peace, eternal peace.
