THY WILL BE DONE. By Sarah J. Burger. O Lord unto Thine altar pure I bring Some cherished idol for an offering, That through Thy love my soul may chastened be, And though the sacrifice be hard for me, I'll pray, Thy will be done. Though bitter waters oft my cup may fill, In resignation I will do Thy will, Endure the cioss and trial, for at length I know will come the love, the power and strength To say, Thy will be done. Though roses crushed lie withering at my feet, There yet remains a perfume pure and sweet; And though life's joys sometimes may clouded be, A sincere prayer ascends O Lord to Thee To let Thy will be done. O may I gain that holiness of life That sanctities the soul and saves from strife, And in the spirit of pure love divine On bended knee at truth's most sacred shrine Pray that Thy will be done. And whatsoever I must feel or do, I know Thy holy power will help me through, Make light my burdens and relieve my care, And clothe with graces true my soul would wear So let Thy will be done. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
