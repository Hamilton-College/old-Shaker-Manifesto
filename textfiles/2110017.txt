Shaker Station, Conn. Christ is spoken of in scripture 'as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.' The full meaning of this phrase comes to me now as never before. Here is the shadow of a great rock where we find sweet home peace and rest beneath the shadow of his protecting, guiding love, while the lif e-battle grows more and more earnest. If we could always remember that He does indeed do all things well what a comfort and blessing it would he! How light our burdens would grow, how easily we could walk and faint not. It does not seem right that we should bear burdens that need not be felt if we had more faith and trust in his eternal goodness and power. We are journeying on day by day, coming with each step nearer the rest and joy awaiting the faithful. Why may we not have more of that rest, more of that joy as we walk? Why may we not even here breathe the pure air of heaven and be strengthened by the sweet songs of peace the angels sing? Let us struggle on, hope on, hope ever. Let us be strong, be true, be manly, believing that 'He doeth all things well.' 'Guided by the Lord's anointfed' we 'walk through green pastures and by still waters,' and though sometimes the way seems rugged and sorrows arise, we have strength and courage to go on undoubtingly, and find peace and happiness in unexpected places. 4698 spaces of cream were sold in Aug. Our new ever-bearing strawberry plants are remarkably vigorous, and give promise of an early and late crop next season. Now is the time to decide on the number of fowls to be wintered. Hens that have moulted should be separated from those that have not, and placed in winter quarters, free from draughts at night. The moulting hens should not be slighted. Hot milk is a valuable drink for them. They need a variety of health-giving diets. When the moulting season is over they should have a good supply of egg-making material. Buck-wheat and corn exclusively is not a good diet for hens. It is best to act wisely when starting in the poultry business. Large flocks of hens do not often pay as large a percentage of profit as smaller ones. D. Orcutt. Soixfeli Family. Desiking to unite with a 'good gift,' we say,ï¿½The testimony among us which serves to awaken our home circle to purity of life and goodness of heart, is that where a few truth-loving souls are assembled to serve God in sincerity, there will the spirit of Christ be, to bless them. 'We gain spiritual substance, something living eternally, by our own exertion, just as we may gain temporal sustenance by industry. To expect redemption from the life of perverted nature by the merits of any other human being, however good, will inevitably lead to sad disappointment. We have the most favorable opportunity now to commence to build a mansion in God's holy temple, in which we may abide. To defer this Avork until we leave the mortal form, is unwise. Divine instruction leads us to believe that all souls will have an opportunity for eternal improvement. We can most favorably commence the work of self-improvement today. To accomplish this great work, we must bear the cross of Christ, which will enable every one to say, 'I have overcome the world.' When we have overcome our individual world of selfishness and unhallowed desires and have grown to the fulness of manhood and womanhood in the ministration of Divine love, (Christ) we have truly 'set down with Him in his throne.' Our Parents made their outward lives subservient to a spiritual travail. The temporal duties of life claim attention, but they should be subjected to the spiritual growth. We are pleased to see Br. D. Offord's remarks about the Reaper &amp; Binder; we have one of the same kind, and think it works admirably. Two horses can draw it as easily as a mower, in heavy grass. It will do more work, and better, than any four horse binder. Its name deserves mention, Adbiance. We have been trying a Pruyn potato-digger and are convinced of its n\erits; may have more to say about it hereafter. Two horses of moderate weight can draw it quite easily, when properly adjusted. The weather has been hot for nearly two weeks, but a great change has come and we now fear that frost will overtake the corn. It is surprising how suddenly extremes follow each other in our New England climate. We wish to mention a brief visit to our home from Elder Andrew Barrett. We felt him a messenger of spiritual riches, gained by a life of consecration. Eldeks.
