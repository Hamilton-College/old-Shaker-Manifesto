THE SHAKER MANIFESTO D. A. BUCKINGHAM The Shaker Manifesto, tho' in appearance small, Has this goodly motto : Go preach the Kingdom' to all,— Embarrassed by none, it obeyeth the call. Sailing out in the deep waters where danger assails, Heavy surges are breaking, and darkness prevails, Adding trials and conflicts the Truth to maintain, Keeping boldly at work for humanity's gain; Ever prayerful and humble, while trusting in God, Reviving new courage, by proclaiming His word: Making paths of sweet sunshine, yea, happier days, All along thro' life's strange and mysterious ways; Ne'er flinching in purpose, but upholding the right, In the many or few, who are seeking true light,— Forgiving, forgetting all injuries past, Espousing no baneful emotions that blast, Sincerely inviting all souls who aspire To rise, and keep rising, still higher and higher Out of worldly dissensions— unholy desire.
