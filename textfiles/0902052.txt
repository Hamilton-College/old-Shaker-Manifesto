Men may think and talk as they please... ' Men may think and talk as they please,' writes Bishop J. Weaver; 'but of this lam satisfied, nothing will do the church so much good as the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Cold, abstract reasoning will do some good; but it will never unite divided hearts in the work of the church. Jesus is the great center. As we draw nigh to him, we draw nigh to each other. All are one in Christ. I know of no other way to lead people away from the follies of this world except to lead them nearer to Christ. When he becomes all in all to a soul, there is but little desire for the follies and amusements of this world.'
