We wish to circulate a few hundred copies of our ' Brief Exposition of Shakerism,' and ' Universal Church,' and will do so, post paid, to any address, on receipt of ten cents. Parties, at all interested in the people, called Shakers, can get a good view of our S3rstem and government, multum in parvo, by the reading the above, little but very expressive works. Other works not in the list of Publications, can be procured at this office.
