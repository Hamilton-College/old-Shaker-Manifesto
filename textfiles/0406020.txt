The mild face of Henry Bergh, the apostle to the animals... The mild face of Henry Bergh, the apostle to the animals, who sits in his ornamental office, with blue and gold surroundings, looking placidly out of his window, receiving the grateful nods of recognition from the quadrupeds which pass, particularly from the mild steeds of the Fourth avenue cars, will be grateful for the opportunity of perusing the following extract by the author of 'Travels on Horseback:' 'The Chinese,' says this writer, ' are always kind to animals and never punish ; hence a mule, that in the hands of a foreigner, would not only be useless, but dangerous to every one about it, becomes, in the hands of a Chinaman, as quiet as a lamb and as tractable as a dog. We never beheld a runaway, a jibbing or a vicious mule or pony in a Chinaman's employment, but found the same rattling, cheerful pace maintained over heavy or light roads, by means of a 'tur-r or cluk'k,' the beast turning to the right or left and stopping with but a hint from the reins. This treatment is extended to all animals they press into their service. Often have I admired the tact exhibited in getting a large drove of sheep through narrow crowded streets and alleys by merely having a little boy to one of the quietest of the flock in front; the others steadily followed, without aid either from yelping cur or cruel goad. Cattle, pigs and birds are equally cared for.' In the small state of Rhode Island there are no fewer than seven divisions of Baptists.
