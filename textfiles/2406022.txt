Dear Friend:--It would be very hard for me... Brooklyn, N. Y. 1894. Dear Friend ;ï¿½It would be very hard for me to express the feeling that the reading of those pamphlets which you have been so kind as to send me, have awakened in my heart. This I can assure you, that since I am acquainted with the principles which govern your Community, I believe there is no Society that I love and respect as much. I have read the 'History of the United Society of Believers,' The Manifesto of Jan., Feb. and Mar., all of which I found very interesting; and I learned that those who are making the greatest noise about Justice, Equalitj and Communism, are least prepared for it. It requires very good men [and women] first and always, to form a good society like yours. The timber necessaiy for such a purpose, as far as my observation extends, seems to be very scarce. The Religion of Christ is communism perfect, and to ameliorate society, the only way is to get nearer and nearer to him. Me and my family, and as many of my neighbors as I can get under my feet for our personal comfort, and to have our heads as near to heaven as possible, is what society is to-day. At least, there is one consideration I have now; to know that there is a people who practice the only true 'Religion of Christ,' where a man can do unto his neighbor as he wishes to be done by, and live with good-will to all and malice toward none, without running the risk of passing for a fool. As I have grown older I have rejected a great deal of what I was taught in my younger days. I have always believed in those examples of Christ, as everlasting truths. If you should publish anything in the line of pamphlets, I hope that you will think of me. I shall be glad to send you the amount of their price. The seeds which I have gathered from your writings will bring forth good fruits, if nothing more than to make a better man of me, and consequently, a happier man. Hoping to hear from you again if my writing has not proved too tedious to you, I remain forever, A Friend, G. J. S.
