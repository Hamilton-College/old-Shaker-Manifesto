WRECKED. MARTHA J. ANDERSON. What more could have been done for thec O soul! Whose plighted faith and broken vows, now lie Like empty shells upon a foreign shore. Where hast thou drifted? down a dangerous tide, Till thou art stranded on those hidden reefs That skillful mariners with care avoid ; But which the incautious dash upon With all the fury of the surging waves. Wrecked! alas! the very thought brings grief That barque, whose sails, spread to the favoring breeze, Bi-aved tempest, storm and tide full many a year, While faith stood at the he m, and marked her course, And every virtue, bore a noble sway At all the posts of duty and of trust. But, lo! a dead calm rested o'er life's sea, The white sails, reefed, unto the topmasts clung, The pilot slept, and all on board reposed, Nor ever thought of danger brooding near. E'en Conscience failed her vigils true to keep; So, lulled to rest secure, they sweetly dreamed Of quafling pleasure from life's gilded font. But, from below, up sprang a treacherous crew, As unperceived before; weak in their strength When all the higher powers held firm their sway Nor parleyed with a spirit mean and base. Bold Unbelief, at first possession took, Desires unhallowed followed in its wake, And bound were all the safeguards of that soul, They loosed the anchor, spread the outmost sail, Threw out the ballast, and in reckless haste Sped on, they cared not where they went. The Captain's voice was dumb, and mute the sighs Of all the former guardians of that barque. And now aground on shoals and sÂ»nds of time, O who shall rescue? Is there none to save? We leave it in the hands of Him, who rules The destiny of souls, and giveth charge Unto the angel world concerning them. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
