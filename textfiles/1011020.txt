The bit of a girl is not one of the ' goody good' children, but a perfect bunch of mischief who needs THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. 257 constant watching. She had taken a fancy to play with the key of her father's desk, often taking it out for the purpose. One day he told her never to take it out again, fearing it might be lost Some few days after he was lying half asleep on the sofa, the little daughter playing beside him. The sudden stillness of the room roused him to the fact that she had disappeared, and seeing the door to the nest room, where the desk was, open, he stole softly toward it to see what the child was doing. There she stood, just in front of the coveted key, both tiny hands clasped behind her, and leaning forward on her tiptoes, she kissed it gently. Then father crept unseen to the sofa, and in a mOment she came and stood beside him, both hands still folded behind her, and said: ' My' did'nt touch the key, 'cause papa told her not to.' Surely if a tiny creature like this could put temptation behind her, we grown up folks ought to have strength enough to.â€” Boston Transcript.
