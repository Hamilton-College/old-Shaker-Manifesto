HAVE JUSTICE. By Henry C. Blinn. WHAT a lesson in life ! Its simplicity and its powers so in contrast. A fable and yet so true. Written to amuse for the moment, it stamps an indelible impression upon the heart. The fable says,ï¿½'A man on his daily mission through life carries two sacks. The one in front of him was a receptacle for the faults, or crooked ways of his neighbors, while the one upon his back was a deposit for his own faults.' How easy it was for him to see that directly in front, and how utterly impossible for him to see that which was behind him. It might have been much better for the man as well as for his neighbors if he had occasionally changed the position of the sacks, as this would have brought his own errors in sight and possibly have changed the whole course of his life. It may be very true that our neighbors and even our dear friends may have faults that are not agreeable to our minds, and may sometimes seem almost startling, and then what? How about our own faults, our own darling, selfish, crooked ways ? While the sins of our neighbors have been under a crucial examination we become astonisht to learn that some one has made a report of the course of our procedure. A close observation of our own case might many times ameliorate the conditions so essentially, that instead of censure or unkindness, we might be induced to manifest the spirit of charity and then that of love. What says Jesus on this subject? 'By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.' Jesus is good authority for this form of righteousness. It is the seal of Christian discipleship and to secure this, there can be no place for malice. Those who live in the elements of the world know quite well that its influences lead to hatred, wrath, strife and sedition, which are the destroyers of peace and happiness among men. On the other hand the elements of a Christian life are love, joy and peace, and those who are interested in the promotion of joy and peace among their neighbors, certainly would not care to magnify their faults, or place barriers in their line of progress. A much better course of procedure would be to accept the doctrine inculcated in the first sermon that Jesus preacht. It is a marvel of brevity, but of just the right length to be of immense value in making a deep impression upon the mind. 'Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Those who repented were expected to change their minds. They then must walk in strait paths. As Christians, they must treat others as they would like to be treated. Nothing less than this wTas worthy of the name of a Christian. It was the work of a revival and men needed to have a change in their life work, for the kingdom of heaven was now at hand, and was to be establisht on the earth. Here commenced a new life, and Jesus and his disciples began to pray, 'Thy kingdom come.' They were anxious to make this demanded change as essential to their present and future happiness. 'kThy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.' People who enter into the spirit of this prayer become 'new creatures,' and instead of seeing so clearly and so fully the faults of their near neighbors, they soon find that these are vanishing and others stampt with their own signature have become the most conspicuous. Those who are anxious for the coming of the kingdom of God, will make all due preparation for this wonderful event. The tabernacle of God will be placed among men, and God will dwell with them as with his sons and daughters. Is there not great necessity for a consecration of the life to God, for preparing the way of the Lord and making his paths straight? Indeed, this spiritual work must eventually result in a new life and in a life where the foundations will be establisht in righteousness. It would be the building of a new city, where holiness will find a dwelling-place, and where the spirit of consecration will find an abiding home. East Canterbury, N. H.
