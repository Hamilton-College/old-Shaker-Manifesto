ISSACHAR BATES.-NO. 3. BY H. C. BLINN. In 1778 Issachar Bates was united in marriage to Lavina Mayntrd and became the father of a large family. His wife anil several of the children became worthy and honorable members of the societies of Watervliet and New Lebanon. Issachar Bates, jun. was a beloved Elder in the Society at Watervliet, N. Y. for a great many years, and Betsey Bates was an Eldress several years in the Church at Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. and then became one of the Ministry in which order she was greatly beloved by the Believers in the several Societies. Issachar now owned, a small farm and besides caring for these duties, he engaged somewhat extensively in the trading of horses, cattle and sheep. In 1780 he went with twenty live young men to West 'Point for three months, and in referring to this he says ; 'although Benedict Arnold sold us all to the British, the bargain was disannulled and we all returned safely to our homes, and this was the end of the war with me.' We next find Issachar in Petersham, Mass, and on a visit to the Shakers. He was anxious to see Mother Ann Lee, and to hear her speak. While at this place a disorderly mob made some disturbance, but no one was seriously injured. Issachar was very much interested in this meeting, and expressed much displeasure that it should have been disturbed by a mob. The preaching of Father James Whitta.ker and the singing by the Believers were very satisfactory to his mind, and at a later date he would testify that it was this special time that he received faith in the gospel work. He says, ' When I saw a manifestation of the life of the Shakers, so active in speaking, singing and warning people to turn to God and confess their sins, I was convinced that it was the -work of God, but I was not ready to be one with them. ' After the Shakers gathered to Harvard, and other places, they seldom visited Petersham and Issachar became wholly absorbed in the life of the world, in buying and selling and selfishly gathering the treasures of this world. At the age of 28 years he moved with his family into the State of N. Y-. and went to work in the woods, and obtained an honorable living. Although he made no poofession of religion, and as he says, ' hated conviction' yet the spirit of God. did not wholly forsake him, and serious thoughts would at times occupy the mind At the age of thirty seven, he formed a determination to mend his life, and still thought it was all in vain to think of being any better. He says, 'I was addicted to the use of profane language, and one day after giving vent to an expression of this kind, I said, I am all alone, nobody can hear me but God! I fell upon my knees and prayed and cried for God to help me govern my tongue, if no more. ' From this time he became a changed man, and for many weeks was in devout prayer to God for a freedom from sin. He says ' One day as I was in deep distress, a voice spol^p to me in these words, ' Will you be as willing to go and lead mankind in the way of righteousness, as you have been to lead them into vanity?' I answered yea, Lord, I will go where you send. ' Issachar says this created a little hope in his mind and he was led to attend church. He was among the, Baptists and heard them condemn themselves as sinners. Before the close of the meeting he was urged to speak, but had no thought of becoming . a member. They urged him to be baptized, but as he was not yet ready they read to him their covenant which he accepted. They then read the Articles of Faith, but he objected to a part of them and would wait till he was better satisfied on some points. Prayer now seemed to be his constant companion, and through this he enjoyed a direct ministration of the spirit of peace. He was overjoyed and returned to his family singing and praising God, which continued for many hours into the night. The next Sabbath he preached to the people as they passed on the road and before they entered the Church, very much to their joy and astonishment. At this time he consented to be baptized but did not expeiience the benefit he had anticipated. He still prayed that the spirit of God might direct him aright, and soon learned that he was to take the yoke of Jesus Christ and learn of him to be good even as God is Issachar contended that he received this ministration from God. That he was a free agent to choose or to refuse, and although he had played the part of the prodigal, he had through deep sufferings, returned to his Father's house Not long after this he was examined by four Baptist preachers and licensed to preach, which he did from 1795 till 1801. In the acceptance of this new light the Confession of sin, the swearing of oaths, the bearing of arms and following the fashions of the world, were all brought plainly to the mind as subjects which needed a most thorough investigation. For several years he kept pace with the revivals, but finding that they all ended in the life of the flesh or the spirit of the world, he began to conclude that salvation was not among them. ' Here I was for three years, my faith with the Shakers and my union with the world. I was warned to keep away from these deluded people. ' At this time the Shaker settlement of New Lebanon was seventy miles distant, but he made arrangements to go and see them. On his way he called to see his sister and learned that she had already found fellowship with the Believers, and had made confession of her sins to God. Issachar hesitated for a while what course to take, through fear if he went to Lebanon he might be deluded. On the way he tarried 'vith a man, at night, who had at one time ,ived with the Shakers, and he reported some dreadful stories concerning them. On arrival at the North House in Lebanon ' I soon met Elder Cooley who asked me what I wanted. ' I want to talk with you. What about? Religion. Do you profess religion? I do. What order? Baptist. Are you satisfied with what you have? I am not. Very well, have some breakfast, and then we will talk. 'I at first asked the privilege to tell my experience, for this reason, I had been informed that you would call it all the old heavens, and I do not think so. ' 'Well,' said Elder Cooley, 'tell yours and then I will tell mine. ' It seems that both of them had enjoyed a rich religious experience and both had been Baptist preachers, and had been led along from degree to degree till they had found that they were called to forsake the fellowship of the world, and live a life to God. Issachar remained in New Lebanon at this time only one hour and as he says, ' I ate quick, talked quick, heard quick and started home quick. ' Elder Cooley advised him to ' Count the cost well, ' in regard to the acceptance of a new faith. To remember that there is but one Christ. This visit was followed by a severe trial of faith which awakened all the internal and external enemies of the cross. A committee from the church waited on him, to warn him of the danger of believing a lie, and also of the danger of being lost. This contest was continued for several weeks, but Issachar had resolved upon being a member of the Society of Shakers and in August 1801 he made a second journey to New Lebanon and after an honeï¿½t confession was accepted as one of the Brethren. On his return home he met with trials on every hand; even his own family opposed the course he had taken. He says, ' I was like Job mocked of his neighbor who calleth upon him, and he heareth him ; and the upright man is laughed to scorn. ' In the course of a few months Issachar was sent, in company Math Benjamin Youngs, to preach the testimony of Believers. They first visited Hartford Vt. and soon won the respect of the people in that place. They next visited Pittsford Vt. at the time of a remarkable religious revival. The Brethren were very kindly received and solicited to speak in the several meetings which they attended. The blessing of God accompanied their labors and quite a number of persons faithfully promised that they would consecrate their lives to God, and many of them were able to endure unto the end.
