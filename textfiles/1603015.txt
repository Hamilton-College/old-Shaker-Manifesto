Our dear teacher Asenath: We were.... Shaker Village, N. H. Oct., 1885. Our Dear Teacher Asenath :ï¿½:We were happily surprised with a beautiful letter addressed to us, (see Feb. No.,) bearing your signature. A3 we read each sentiment seeming more and more expressive, we were led to exclaim, mentally ; How grand is the gift of language ! If words can go so far toward increasing the fervor of those who would do service for God, how much more power there must be in an influence emanating from a life of true devotion. While reading the clause expressing your hope that we might, 'like the more perfect fruit, ripen beneath the shelter of God's perfect love ;' every pure thought and impulse of the heart, seemed to expand in the resolution to follow our dear teacher into the broad fields of Christian labor. The swarm of 'Do's' you so kindly forwarded, we will indeed aim to make personally practical; and think we may answer, without a shade of egotism, that we are just the sensible girls you have taken us to be, quite willing to forego the sickly sentimentality of the more frivolous minded, in the strife to establish a character of true moral worth, which shall enable us to remain unshaken in our Christian faith, through all the vicissitudes of life. May you remember, and ever claim us, is the sincere desire of your Affectionate Pupils.
