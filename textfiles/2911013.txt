-Alfred., Me. Oct. 1899. Summer has left us with the record of a busy season. We have had success indisposing of our fancy work, among the mountains, and at the summer resorts along the sea shore. Our potato crop was light but of good quality, apples are few. Have harvested two hundred tons of ensilage corn with which the two silos at the barn have been filled and a large surplus left over which is being fed to the cattle. We have gathered a hundred bushels of cranberries from our meadows; would have had more if the frost had not come to spoil them. On the 2nd inst. a few snowflakes came fluttering down to warn us that winter is approaching. Colds are prevalent in society caused by sudden changes in the weather. Our Laundry is receiving a new coat of paint on the outside. While we are gathering temporal blessings may we be mindful of the blessings which our Heavenly Father bestows on the faithful worker.
