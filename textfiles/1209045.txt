The National Associated Press The National Associated Press, to which The Boston Daily Globe and Sunday Globe belong, has recently been reorganized, and has leased a special wire from New York to New England of the Western Union Telegraph Company. On Monday, August 14, The Boston Globe begun to receive its general news on a wire which runs directly into its editorial rooms from New York, the great centre of news of all kinds. Two or three papers in'the country have special wires to Washington, but we believe this is the first instance in American journalism where a daily newspaper has been able to secure its general news on a special wire into its editorial rooms.
