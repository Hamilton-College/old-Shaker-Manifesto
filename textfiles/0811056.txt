Soaking Potatoes â€”The common practice of paring potatoes, and leaving them for hours, and sometimes for days, reduces their value exceedingly as food. Solon Eobinsort in 'How to live' tells us that meat, fish, potatoes, and else, when left for twelve hours in water, impart to the water half their value. If, then, they are left to soak longer than twelve hours, there is more value in the water which is commonly thrown away, than in the article to be cooked. So far as the cooking of potatoes is in question, those who soak them for hours, are worthy of beingcalled very poor cooks ; as a comparison between the tubers soaked and unsoaked will abundantly testify.
