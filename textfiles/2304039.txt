Books and Papers. Alden's Cyclopedia of History A REMARKABLE HISTORY. We recently published a strongly commendatory notice of 'Alden's Cyclopedia of History.' In the interest of our readers we wish to repeat and emphasize what we said. A good Universal History ought to be in every home; this is certainly excellent, if not the very best for general use and reference ever published, covering all nations (except the United States, to be published separately) and from b. c. 5004 to a. u. 1892. Certainly it is the cheapest historical work we have ever seen; but that is what readers generally will expect from Mr. Alden, who has done so lu-ich to place the highest class of literature within popular reach. To get such a vast amount of matter within such small compass the type used is necessarily small, but it is beautifully clear, and the paper, printing and binding are of the best. Send 10 cents to Mr. Alden and he will send you a sample volume of UiO pages, containing the history of several nations complete, by which you can judge for yourself whether you want the entire work. His catalogue of choice books, 128 pages, sent post-paid for 2 cents, presents a wonderful feast for book lovers. Address John B. Alden, Publisher, 57 Rose St., New York.
