Alfred., Me. August, 1899. During the past month, thunder showers have been of frequent occurrence. On July 21, we had a very severe one from seven o'clock p. m. when the storm broke until after midnight it was a continual roar of thunder and the lightning flashed all over the sky, it seemed like too armies met in battle. We are thankful to say that we did not suffer any from it, altho rumors of disaster came from all around us. Hay*is harvested and we .find we shall have a plentiful supply with what was left over from last year's store The Sisters are busy getting basket work ready for sale. At present Elder Henry Green is in the White mountains trying to exchange some of it for the almighty dollars which we need for the comforts of life. We are having very cool weather, the evenings are quite chilly, if it continues to grow cooler we shall expect an early visit from Jack Frost. We look forward each month with pleasure for The Manifesto, for it is full of good things. It is one of the links that bind our homes together, for through its columns we hear from our gospel friends afar. Eva M. Libbey.
