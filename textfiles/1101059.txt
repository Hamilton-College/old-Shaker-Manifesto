Patent flour. Almost everybody knows of patent flour, but not everybody understands what it is. Stripped of technicalities, this is about the story of its manufacture. The best flour used to be made of winter wheat. Spring wheat yielded either much less in quantity, or else so much of the. bran got into the flour in its manufacture that its color was intolerably dark. The wheat would be ground and then bolted. In the refuse — the bran and middlings — would be included a large proportion of the spring wheat, and this would sell more particularly for feed for horses. Now, the best of flour, and the most expensive, is made of this very refuse of the old-fashioned process. It all came out of the discovery of a way to draw out the bran. Under the new process the wheat is ground about as before. The first result is an ordinary flour sold for exportation. Then the remainder is taken and put upon great horizontal sieves, and while agitation is going on there, an ingenious system of draft is rushing up through and carries off the bran. What is left is the glutinous portion of the wheat, the most nutritious and most productive, and out of this purified now by the drawing off of the bran, we get our new process flour. The result of the discovery of the process has been to make the poor spring wheat of Minnesota and upper Wisconsin the most valu able of grain.
