Slander ELMIBA HILLSGKOVE. The slanderer's tongue, 0, who can tame? What antidote, will any name? What shall we do for eyes, that sec, And ears, that hear so readily, The thoughtless words, so heedless spoken, The unkind look, or adverse token, By hours and days, mature in strength, Till, Slander, is their name, at length. Whatever ill is on the wing, And willingly suspicions bring To add fresli fuel to the flame? Pray, how can we such passion shame? When looking at our own misdeeds, Reflecting on our spirit needs, So much we see to do at home, We find no time to cast a stone. If Ave, henceforth, would seek to find The good, so often left behind, We might, by magnifying this, Rebuke whatever is amiss. There is a power, ruling all, The just, the unjust, great and small; And we as finite beings, fail, When from the judgment seat we hail. Canterbury, N. H.
