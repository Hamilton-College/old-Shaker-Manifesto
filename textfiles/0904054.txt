Book Table Religiously speaking, we do not like lawyers;... Religiously speaking, we do not like lawyers ; and yet, as a necessary evil, like doctors —whom we are afraid of—we are forced to respect ' Great Lawyers,' particularly when we are so fortunate as to stumble upon an honest attorney. Our father was a lawyer of Brooklyn, N. Y., and this opinion of legal lights may seem like filial ingratitude ; but we own to strong liking for lawyer ' stories ; ' and in a book published by The Law Journal of Albany, N. Y., entitled ' Short Studies of Great Lawyers,' we found a delightful and very instructive volume. The book is richly interspersed with anecdotes,amid much valuable information concerning legal subjects. Were we a lawyer, we should want this book on the shelf close by the Codes, and would frequently 'make a mistake on purpose,' by selecting and reading law in ' Short Studies,' rather than in the blue atmosphere of the more intricate Blackstone. The price is $2.00. Christ's First and Second Appearing Shaker Manifesto, Shakers, N. Y., Publisher. Just at this time when so many books are being issued upon The Second Coining, seems to us an excellent opportunity for calling attention to the above standard work of The Shakers. It is a most replete work upon the subject, and by far the most elaborate work ever issued by our people. Read as a history of the rise and fall of ism.s, or as the chronicler of the events of Christ's Appearings, it will be found unequaled in its line. It is a large octavo volume, bound in leather, containing more than 600 pages of theology, history and biography, and sent post-paid from this office for $1.50.
