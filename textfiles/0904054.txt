Christ's First and Second Appearing Shaker Manifesto, Shakers, N. Y., Publisher. Just at this time when so many books are being issued upon The Second Coining, seems to us an excellent opportunity for calling attention to the above standard work of The Shakers. It is a most replete work upon the subject, and by far the most elaborate work ever issued by our people. Read as a history of the rise and fall of ism.s, or as the chronicler of the events of Christ's Appearings, it will be found unequaled in its line. It is a large octavo volume, bound in leather, containing more than 600 pages of theology, history and biography, and sent post-paid from this office for $1.50.
