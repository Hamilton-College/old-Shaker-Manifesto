Union Village, O. Nov. 1893. The good old patriarch Job says, 'Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.' Even if that is so I am sorry he said it, for it opens such a wide door of excuse, (almost license) to the fault-finding pessimist. It is indeed, almost enough to sadden the countenance of the sunshiny optimist. O that the voice of the faultfinder and complainer were silenced forever. He is brother to those poor old negations, gossip and slander. Every word uttered in finding fault with another, is instantly photographed upon the astral medium, and conveyed with the swiftness and ruin of a poisoned arrow to the party aimed at, whether such party be conscious of it at the time or not. It will sooner or later most surely work its fatal effect. Always does,�no exception to this law. I am resolved to ignore the negative, discouraging side of existence and cultivate the positive side which brings so much righteousness, peace and joy of the Holy Spirit into our lives. 'From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.' Therefore if we have sunshine in our hearts, and talk sunshine it will have healing in its beams, both for sickness and sorrow. But if we are lorever having clouds and invidious criticisms of others in our hearts, we shall talk these and nothing else. Now I know these things are true from experience. Then the Bible affirms it, and when I quote the Bible I feel as safe as the little girl, who, when disputing a point with another little girl said, ''I know it's so for mother says so and what mother says, is so, if it aint so.' The Bible says 'A merry (optimistic) heart doeth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit drieth the bones.' Now for any thing to be like a medicine it must cure sickness and restore health and comfort. Here is an equal chance for us all to turn doctors and healers, instead of being 'troublers in Israel.' What a glorious change! Union Village is enjoying good health and excellent weather. If you could see all that Elder Joseph has done for the convenience, comfort, and artistic beauty of our premises you would be surprised if not confounded. 'And generations yet to come Will bless the memory of his name Yea, enter in and fill the home, And be partakers of the same.' as we fondly hope. But it will not pay them to come in with the sublime idea of subjecting the hells and setting Heaven Order among Believers. No man since the fall need consider himself sufficient for this; but let him come as a learner and disciple and he will find that we can do him good and make him happy. Our beets, which, for the last two years were eighteen hundred bushels, this year were only five hundred owing to the protracted drouth. Our potatoes and also all fruits were nearly a total failure; but 'Although the fig tree shall not blossom, yet we will rejoice, yea we will joy in the God of our salvation.' We have removed the heater from the Office into a new engine house just completed ; being twelve or fifteen feet west of Office, it is much more comfortable and convenient. It keeps dirt and coal dust 290 THE MANIFESTO. from the cellar and gives us the advantage of replenishing the boiler on the gravity system. There are plenty of hickory nuts, walnuts and butternuts, t3,is fall and the young folks delight in going to the woods for them. Last Saturday our beloved and welltried aged Brethren, Elder Henry B. Bear and Elder Stephen Ball came from White Water on a visit to Union Village for a few days. Every one was glad to see them. We had a blessed time in our morning Society meeting and again on Monday evening when we entertained them with singing, and toward the close sang and played the beautiful Farewell Hymn in 'Shaker Music.' I never enjoyed a visit more than I did with these two veteran saints. They expressed themselves much comforted with their visit and departed on Wed. morning for their home. A few weeks previous Eldress Ellen- - - - -Br. Thomas Mann and Sister Grace Rudduck visited White Water, and had a very enjoyable time�every thing and every body being brought into practical requisition for their entertainment, comfort and hospitality. I would not do without the Manifesto if I had to sell my necessary food to purchase it. There are no end of good, pure, sweet, spiritual sentiments as well as domestic felicities expressed in the Home Notes. Kind love and thanks to the whole Editorial staff and others who contribute in any way to the support of the Manifesto. 0. C. Hampton.
