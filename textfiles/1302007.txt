THE RELIABLE CHARACTER. NANCY G. DANFORTH. The person of unflinching integrity is respected by all; the friendship of such is universally desired, and in such times as try men's souls their aid is sought after by those who, in days of prosperity, ridicule and despise them. That person whether man or woman, rich or poor who will be firm for the right, regardless of present consequences is of estimable worth. Though he may be clad in rags and beg his daily bread, yet his virtue is of more value than re'Â¦al robes or golden crowns. To whom do we. look when burdens press heavily upon us, when troubles assail, or afflictions overtake us? Do we turn to the vain and fickle for help, expect succor or even sympathy from the inconstant? Nay, but the true and upright alone we would enlist on our side, knowing that there will be found strength and firm support. Then who can tell the value of such a character? The true friend in all the relations of life, who rejoices with the upright, loves and pities the erring, without stooping to their vices ; who stands alone, bearing reproach and scorn, from the multitude of evil-doers, rather than yield to do that which conscience forbids. Such are as pure gold, the salt of the earth ; around such all good clusters. They are the basis of good society, without them it could not exist. This being true in the moral, how much more in the spiritual life? The soul that is fully consecrated to do the will of God, will never complain at the cross or seek to shun it; but rather inquire : ilow can I do more good, be more devoted to the .cause of Truth? How are such beloved by their companions on earth ! With what love and admiration are they beheld by ministering angels ! Through the mediumship of such souls they are enabled to make known the will of God to those dwelling on the earth. Canterbury, N. H.
