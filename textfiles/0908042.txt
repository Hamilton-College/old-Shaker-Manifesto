LET ARISTOCRACY THINK Who shall judge man from his manners? Who shall know him by his dress ? Paupers may be fit for princes, Princes fit for something less. Crumpled shirt and dirty jacket May beclothe the golden ore Of the deepest thoughts and feelings— Satin vest can do no more. There are streams of crystal nectat Ever flowing out of stone ; There are purple beds and golden, Hidden, crushed and overthrown. God, who counts by souls, not dresses, Loves and prospers you and me ; While he values thrones the highest, But as pebbles in the sea. Man upraised above his fellows, Oft forgets his fellows then ; Masters—rulers—lords, remember That your meanest minds are men ! Men of labor, men of feeling, Men of thought and men of fame, Claiming equal rights to sunshine In a man's ennobling name. There are foam-embroidered oceans, There are little wood clad rills ; There are feeble inch-high saplings, There are cedars on the hills. God, who counts by souls, not stations, Loves and prospers you and me ; For to him all vain distinctions Are as pebbles in the sea. Toiling hands, alone are builders Of a nation's wealth and fame, Titled laziness is pensioned, Fed and fattened on the same ; By the sweat of others' foreheads, Living only to rejoice, While the poor man's outraged freedom Vainly lifts its feeble voice. Truth and justice are eternal, Born with loveliness and light ; Secret wrongs shall never prosper While there is a sunny right. God, whose world-wide voice is singing Boundless love to you and me, Links oppression with his titles But as pebbles in the sea.
