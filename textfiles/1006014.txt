PRENTISSIANA: LAW ' Law is a rule of action, prescribed by a superior, and which an inferior is bound to obey.'— Blackstone. So far so good — but who is the superior ? and who the inferior ? In barbarous ages and countries, the largest fighter — the conqueror — is the supei'ior — the conquered are the inferiors. In half civilized ages and countries, the few, who, by some kind of chicanery, grasp the land and the learning, are the superiors — the many are the inferiors — in the eye of the law. When humanity so far ascends the progressive grade that the many are disposed to do right because it is right, the many are the superiors — the few, not so disposed, are the inferiors. As units of a nation, or State, it is our duty and right to be subject to the laws of that nation and State—it will do us good. In a religious community, the constituted authorities; spiritual and temporal, acting in harmony, each in its order, are the superiors — we don't need an inferior. Entering the community — not by compulsion, but of our own volition, it is our highest privilege, as well as duty, voluntarily to square our lives by the rules of the order. It takes the conceit out of us ; fits and prepares us for the Holy Eternal Father's and Mother's mansions of eternal brightness. We bless our Saints — and who has a better right to ?
