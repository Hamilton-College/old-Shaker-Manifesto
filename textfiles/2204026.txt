Sonyea, N. Y. March, 1892. With the busy whirl of time February with many lights and shades has renewed its final march. Even so. Can February March? Yea and April May, didn't June know it? Snow is descending in abundance. March still wears the royal seal of winter, sleighing remains the very best and will till its close. Hay pressing will again be renewed the coming week. Time is always passing and pressing. The active, the far-seeing, the enterprising and unselfish portion of humanity, can find' something in the great universe of mind and matter to do, something that is good and useful and 'Something that is lasting that forever will endure.' The saw mill that has rested in silence the past summer will soon become a busy factor in home industry. Broom handles will be manufactured and much more work of the sawing kind will be perfected in days to come. Brother Henry Hollister of enterprising fame is abiding with vis, and is a trusty helper in guiding the Sonyea Craft; his vigorous spirit is a great blessing in our family; we value his presence, and prize his inspiring ministration. In our Sunday services and in our daily avocations he is ever helpful. Brother Clark Coburn recently moved from his old house to a new one, a house not made by hands but one secure in the heavens where moth and rust can not corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal. Br. Clark has been a member of Society for five years. During his membership and life in the Community he was ever interested in performing some good and never wearied in well doing. G. D. G.
