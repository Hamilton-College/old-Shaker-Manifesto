HOW NEARLY CHRISTIAN? The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania declares that 'Christianity is part ol the common law of the State; and waiving all question of hereafter, it is the purest system of morality, the foremost auxiliary, and only stable support of all human laws?' We suppose nearly or quite every State in the Union makes a similar claim. But wherein can we see any Christianity operative in the laws of any State ? Is it not an eye for an eye, life for a life, and such like dealings, after the manner of Judaism. Wherein does any State*bring riches and poverty upon a level, after the chris tian pattern ? or even does half as well in this as Judaism did ? Wherein does | any State oppose war or warlike preparations, as taught by Christianity ? Does any State encourage the growth of virgin purity, as did the friends of Christianity? True, almost or quite every State permits these principles to be observed by those who would be Christians ; but the States are in no particulars Christian in administration of their laws ; nor in the particular encouragement of Christian principles. If any State should begin to be as equitable and just in its administration as Judaism of old was, people would think the Millennium come ! We urge the trial of it.
