INFIDELS 'The new infidels have nothing whatever in common with Voltaire or Paine, probably do not sympathize at all with either the spirit of their writings or the separate opinions they advocated. They are not controversialists any more; they are not theologians. They make no war on particular dogmas —such as Trinity, atonement, depravity, perdition, literal inspirations. Those of them who profess hostility to Christianity, do it on grounds that neither Paine nor Voltaire would have comprehended—that even Parker did not occupy. Those who profess themselves Christians, do so for reasons peculiarly their own; they decline to receive Christianity as a doctrinal system, and but partially accept it as an ethical system. They regard it rather in the light of a symbolical illustration of their own moral sentiments, of sentimental value purely, or as the natural and legitimate development of one line of history. The rest classify Christianity among the great religions of the race, give it its place in history, appreciate what it has done, commend it for what it is doing, but seek elsewhere for their guidance and authority.' 'Between Trench Infidelity,' therefore, and American Rationalism, there are worlds of difference. They scarcely touch each other at any point. In spirit, method, aim, principle, conclusion, they are essentially unlike. They start from a different goal, proceed along a different track, issue at a different point. The atheist does not copy Diderot; the materialist turns his back on Helvetius; the deist forsakes the ways of Thomas Paine; even the mocker has a fashion of his own, quite unlike Voltaire's. There is no excuse for naming them in the same breath but partisan bitterness; and whether or not that can be accepted as an excuse, we leave our readers to judge.'
