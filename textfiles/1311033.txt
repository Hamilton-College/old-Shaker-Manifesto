Phrenological Journal and Science of Health In the Phrenological Journal and Science op Health for October, the reader finds special attractions as striking facts of human science are interwoven with literary sketches and illustrated descriptions, and the whole is presented in a very entertaining style. On opening the Number a fine portrait of the late Montgomery Blair greets us, and an interesting digest of his character follows. Next we have a well-written discussion of the 'Relations of Phrenology to Modern Philosophy,' in which the criticisms of Professor Bain are sharply analysed. Next we read a beautifully illustrated description of the 'St. Gothard Railway.' Following that are 'Some Observations on Amativeness,' The unfortunate Capt. Webb receives an appeciative notice, and an instructive article on Ossian, the ancient Scottish poet, follows. Eleanor Kirk gives some items of good advice to the modern youth, who thinks keeping his bureau-drawers in neat condition is woman's work; and a Western journalist sends the result of an interview with a deaf, blind, and dumb woman, who is certainly a remarkable case of intuitive apprehension. There is also a portion of Milton's charming 'Comus,' with notes by the editor, and original illustrations. In the Health Department Dr. Allen discusses the 'Laws of Heredity,' and other writers who know of what they speak, give excellent advice on the 'Eft'ects of Alcohol;' 'The Food of the Brain and the Teeth;' How Warm Water Cools,' etc. The subscription price is $2.00 a year.
