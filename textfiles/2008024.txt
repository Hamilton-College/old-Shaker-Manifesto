Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Elder Henry :�What a great blessing is health, and still greater is the assurance that our editor, compositors and we trust all in the household, sire now among the Messed in this respect. We are admonished by the non-appearance of our notes about home written for July, to he on time, always ready by living to the maxim, 'Never put off till to-morrow what should be done to-day.' What a line of thought is awakened by these few words! Who realh lives up to the injunction? We do not understand the counsel to mean literally that one must do all he sees to be done each day, as this would be an impossibility, but to make the proper selection of duties each day which shall exclude indolence and procrastination will be satisfactory. We spoke in our last of too much of a good thing referring to rain. We would to-day be glad of a little more, as we are just now verging upon a dry season. We have full experience of 'making hay while the sun shines,' and the work is being prosecuted with vigor�a large crop of grass on the dear old Granite Hills. Between flood and drought, our gardens are doing well. We had new pease and potatoes July 1 and 3, and while our Plum and Cherry trees are being destroyed by the Black Knot, (Has any one found a remedy?) other blessings give us sufficient cause for thanksgiving. Kind love to our dear friends, from Central Ministry to the least child Let every heart be glad and upon the 6th of August let us all sing : God's love is at the helm, We shall out-ride the storin; Whose life is in the light, Can fear no earthly . harm. Our friends of the North Family are painting some very needy houses, or buildings which need paint sadly, and we at the South Family are pushing repairs which employ both carpenters and plumbers. O these perishable walls, how they lead our minds to lay up treasures in the 'house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens !' Here let us ask the Sisters who read the Manifesto if they have tried the nice way of saving rhubarb for the early season of 1891? Before the stalks have grown to form an objectionable skin, cut the flesh in small, say inch pieces, and place in perfect self-sealing cans, filling them to the brim with ice-cold water. Screw the tops down immediately and you will find at the close of a twelve month, if your experience is like ours, that you have a nice article which you may stew and sweeten for the table, as though fresh from the garden. Among the singing birds that visited Central N. EL, this season, we had one family of the Purple Grosbeak, Carpodacus purpureus. In some localities this is known as the Purple Linnet. Its sweet song and beautiful plumage, would make it a great favorite, among those who are interested in the study of birds. During the month of June the morning notes of all our Bird visitors could be heard in full chorus, at 3 o'clock A. M. while at the present date they do not begin till 3-30.
