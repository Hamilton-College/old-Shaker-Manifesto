SHAKER CHRISTIANITY. Louis Basting. Bible students are well aware that the utterances of Christ and the apostles concerning these things are highly mystical, allegorical, prophetic. They arc difficult to harmonize ; the interpretations are about as numerous as the interpreters. But we may take it for granted that there is not much diversity of opinion regarding the nature of the millennium. The general consensus is that it will be a time of peace and plenty, of virtue and good fellowship. As one of the signs heralding the good time coming, I view the fact that leading Catholics and Protestants, infidels and believers can present their thoughts about theology and religion, morals and ethics, in The Sun without acrimony and bitterness. Such a thing was not known heretofore ; nothing was so sure to arouse evil passions as doctrinal controversy. The writer being a member of the Church of Christ's Second Appearing, commonly called Shakers, has no difficulty in interpreting to his satisfaction the manner and time ot the advent. What is known as orthodox Christianity regards Jesus as being an integral part of the Deity, God himself. We regard that proposition as unscriptural. By nature, Jesus was a human being, who 'was tempted in all points like as we are,' but his sinless life and obedience to the Divine will made him the Son of God ; and his special mission was 'to give power to them that believed on him to become sons of God' likewise. The Gospel which he preached was given to him by inspira- tion ; this constituted him the Christ. There is a difference between the man Jesus and Christ the Messiah. Jesus was not Christ from his birth, though undoubtedly his conception and prenatal existence was powerfully influenced to make him such in the future ; he became the Christ at the baptism of Jordan. It was the inspiring spirit that caused him to say; 'Before Abraham was I am ;' it was- the trembling Jesus who begged that the bitter cup might be removed. Peter says that the spirit of Christ spoke through the prophets, and Jesus himself taught that the spirit of Elias appeared in John the Baptist. This proves that the same spirit can speak and act through different persons at different times. There was a paragraph in n New York paper some time ago alleging that when Roscoe Conkling was upon his death-bed and when Christianity was mentioned to him, he spoke rather slightingly of it, saying that Christ had obtained his doctrines from the Buddhists of India ; that the Golden Rule and others of his teachings were found in Buddha's works, &amp;c. Now, instead of being a disparagement, this is a glorious proof of the genuineness of Christ's mission and of the pre-existence of the Christ spirit, who at all ages of the world has endeavored to manifest himself for its redemption. Divine truth is the same always, whether it comes through Buddha or Jesus, but the fullest and clearest enunciation of it, as far as we know, has come through Jesus. The coming of Christ does not necessarily imply the appearance of Jesus. The apostles had been with Jesus a long time before they discovered him to be Christ. It requires a state of inward preparation, a readiness to receive him before he can be discovered, but 'to them who look for him he shall appear the second time, without sin, unto salvation.' Ann Lee, an English Quakeress, came to this country in 1774, accompanied by a little band of believers; they settled in the forest near Albany and remained there eight years. She. taught that the higher form of Christianity consisted in following the example of Jesus. This logically resulted in the formation of a community whose members were celibates and owned no private property. The way of salvation, according to her, consisted in the confession, repentance and forsaking of sin ; the blood of Jesus could not accomplish that for anyone. She saw that comparatively few had the opportunity in this life of hearing the Gospel of Jesus Christ, therefore she held that nil souls would have it preached to them in the next life. She utterly rejected the idea of an endless hell of torment with no chance nor hope of delivery therefrom ; she considered it blasphemy against an allmerciful God to teach fore-ordination to damnation. Hands to work and hearts to God was her motto. It was her aim to produce in her followers, by her teaching and example, lives of virtue and simplicity, of industry and unselfishness. One sign of the appearance of the Christ spirit is that the message is delivered with a power that causes it to be accepted by a number sufficient for its preservation and perpetuation. This sign must unhesitatingly be conceded to Ann Lee, for in a few years' time�she died in 1784�she converted several thousand people to her views, who, soon after her death, gathered themselves in permanent communities, which, with one exception, are all in operation to-day. These converts were not an easily impressed multitude: they were hard-headed New England folk, whose orthodoxy was unquestioned, whose daily text-book was the Bible, who loved their wives and children, their hard-earned dollars and acres as dearly as any people in the world. It must have been an extraordinary person that could persuade such a class of minds to surrender their time-honored opinions; to give up their property, yea, even largely their wills and individualities ; to separate from wife and husband and the ties of the world and become Christian Communists. Another evidence in behalf of Ann Lee's mission is that the opinions of an unlettered woman like her have overthrown the doctrines of such learned men as Luther, Calvin and Edwards ; for hell and fore-ordination are practically no longer taught in the Protestant churches, the idea of probation is steadily gaining ground, and the formation of celibate orders is being encouraged. Tolstoi, whatever his faults and mistakes, is preaching virtually Shakerism. If it is asked why, then, is the population of Shaker Communities steadily decreasing, we answer that this is not chargeable to any of Ann Lee's precepts, but is almost entirely owing to internal short-comings. The time is not far distant when her people will gather themselves together, reform, re-organize, and pledge themselves anew to carry out the Gospel of Jesus Christ and become again an agressive power for good in the world.
