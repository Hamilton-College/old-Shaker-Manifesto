DISTINCTION BETWEEN RELIGIOUS RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS TOLERATION. Catharine Allen. Webster defines toleration as the allowance of that which is not wholly approved�the endurance of that which is objectionable, or of the expression of offensive opinions. Thus, religious toleration is that which is granted to those differing in opinion from the accepted creeds or tenets of the established church of a nation or state wherein Ecclesiastical and State rule are united, as under all monarchial governments. Under such conditions the property of the established church remains untaxed, and public money is used for the support of chaplains in the army and for other religious services dictated by the State, while none of the clergy of dissenting sects ever receive public appointments, but must be supported entirely by the dissenters whose church property is taxed at the same rates as any private possessions. Under this system we see that the State puts a premium on hypocrisy, by thus making it pecuniarily more advantageous to accept a given code of religious belief, than to declare and live by the individual convictions of reason and conscience. The governments of Russia, Turkey and most eastern nations are unlimited monarchies, where all religious sects, other than those of the established faith of said countries, are subject to the caprice of rulers who may at one time tolerate and even encourage the settlement in their domain of other sects and then without any reasonable provocation, issue edicts for their immediate banishment, as is the case at present with the Jews of Russia. On the other hand religious freedom is that which can obtain only under republican governments wherein Church and State are divorced. It has its securities in the recognition of a 'government for the people and by the people,' of those inalienable rights by which man is endowed by his Creator, the most important of which is liberty of conscience with the privileges of free press and free speech. By the Constitution of the United States these are ours to enjoy in common with every class of loyal citizens. In the Declaration of rights as first proposed the clause upon this subject read that 'All men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of re- 82 THE MANIFESTO. ligion, unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate.' To this Madison objected, pointing out this distinction between the recognition of an absolute right and the toleration of its exercise; as the latter would imply the power of jurisdiction. It was therefore so changed as to read : 'All men are equally entitled to the full and free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience.' It is recorded that in 1827, Lord Stanhope voiced the same sentiment from the House of Lord's, in the following words :�' 'The time was when toleration was craved by dissenters as a boon, it is now demanded as a right, but the time will come when it will be spurned as an insult.' Thus we see that toleration is opposed to rights, for it is the granting of unmerited favors rather than the acknowledgment of inalienable rights. We have said that under the Constitution of the United States, religious freedom is the right of all loyal citizens ; but at the present time, it would be more correct to say ought to be their right, for, during the twenty-five years a revolution has been going on in our nation, moving with accelerated speed toward a reunion of Cfrarch and State. Not only is this being systematically consummated by the Church of Rome, the mightiest and most perfect organization in the earth, but Protestant bodies, almost as a unit, unwittingly are forging the chains which in no distant day (according to her own bold declarations) Rome will make use of upon all who refuse to acknowledge her authority. Already is persecution in the name of religion going on in several different states of the Union. The Constitution of Tennessee, declaring that:� 'No human authority can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience,' has not prevented decision by the Supreme Court of that state against pious members of the Christian church, who, according to their convictions had observed the Scriptural Sabbath, and on the following day quietly employed themselves on the farm. By the instigation of their Christian brethren of other churches, numbers of the Seveath-day Baptists of Tennessee have for that offence been tried, convicted, and actually imprisoned with common criminals, and in their company worked in the chain gang ! The silence of the religious press concerning these outrages, which have been made public through the secular press, is significant of the general assent of the churches to persecution for conscience' sake, and, by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that this is a Christian nation, together with the act of Congress conditioning appropriation for the World's Fair to its Sunday closing, the government has been made party to religious controversy, thus practically making void the first amendment of the Federal constitution. The promoters of these measures have boasted that 'these are only the beginnings.' Thus we see that our supposed guarantees of religious rights no longer exist. That liberty of conscience in America is a thing of the past, and that the degree of toleration which we THE MANIFESTO. 83 are now allowed, rests upon the caprice of an arrogant and aggressive minority who are able to sway the actions of our highest magistrates in wresting from the people their most sacred rights. Verily, 'Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
