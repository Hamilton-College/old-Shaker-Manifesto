PRACTICAL RELIGION. A good lady employed a deacon of one of our Baptist churches to do some carpenter's work which amounted to quite a large sum of money ; and she said, when speaking of the job, ' I would just as soon hear Deacon- - - -pray now as I would have before he did that piece of work for me.' That's it! We want deacons and all other members of the churches to do in all business relations just that which is right. We believe in a practical religion. Spurgeon asked a young girl, who served as a domestic in one of his families, when she presented herself for membership in his church, what evidence she could give of having become a Christian, and she meekly answered, k-1 now sweep under the mats.' And the renowned preacher said it was good evidence, and we agree with him. Real religion leads one to do work thoroughly. The Presbyterian.
