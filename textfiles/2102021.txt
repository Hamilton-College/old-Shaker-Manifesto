Harvard, Mass. Jan. 7, 1891. Dear Editor:ï¿½-Christmas has come and gone, and with it we have had some sorrow mixed with our joy. The sad intelligence of the death of our beloved Elder Giles, swept over us like a thick fog, almost paralyzing the body as well as the spirit. An acquaintance of thirty-two years, while residing in the same family at Mount Lebanon, taught us to love him as one of the dearest of gospel fathers. Our Christmas was made pleasant by a beautiful meeting, and many of our loved ones from beyond the river came to greet us with messages of love. Santa Claus did not forget to make us a short call, and the family were interested to see what he had brought. The story was told at about 2. P. M. when many were made glad. We are just finishing the cutting of 100, 000 ft. of lumber. Our stock of fine wood for 1891 is nearly all hauled, preparatory to sawing. This evening we had quite a surprise. After a gentle tap on the door, in walked our school teacher, Frances Dempsey, with a beautiful banner awarded the school for the besi attendance of any school in the town of Harvard. This has been the talk of the little ones ever since it was presented. On the 3rd. inst. a large company went from Harvard to attend the funeral of Br. Lorenzo Prouty, in Shirley. Our Sisters are busy making baskets and other articles for the summer trade; so you see, we are, like the busy bees, improving each shining hour. With hearts full of affection, we bid all our gospel friends, Many Happy New Years. A. B.
