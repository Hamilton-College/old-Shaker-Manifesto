Beloved Elder Harvey:--The letter from your dear friend... Beloved Elder Harvey :ï¿½The letter from your dear friend, Enoch Jacobs, calls to remembrance his visit to Canterbury in Sept. 1846. I was at that date twenty-two years of age and assisted in printing one number of 'The Day Star,' a copy of which is now before me. I also bear the dear friend and Br. in pleasant remembrance and am sorry when I call to mind the forces that obliged the beautiful little 'Day Star' to fall below the horizon. More gospel light would have been before the world to-day, if that Star could have been held in its place. The number to which I refer is largely the testimony of Believers and no doubt, did much good on its mission of gospel love. H. C. B.
