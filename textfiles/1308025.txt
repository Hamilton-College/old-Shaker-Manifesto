House and Farm Watermelon Preserve —To 30 lbs. of melon add 34 lbs. sugar. Cut the melon in pieces an inch thick, or larger if preferred, and boil in 9 quarts of cider, or acid water, until it is soft, then skim out into a cullender to drain. Pour out the cider and put in the sugar, with water enough to dissolve it readily, and skim it well. Then put in the melon, and let it boil until it looks clear.—
