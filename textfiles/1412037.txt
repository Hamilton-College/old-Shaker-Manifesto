WHEN SORROW COMES. When sorrow comes, as come it will To every human heart, May trustful hope dwell with thee still, And bid the shades depart. May dove-like peace her pinions fold To brood within thy breast, And though thou hast not lands nor gold, Thou wilt be doubly blest. Be thine the courage that o'ercomes The zeal that never fails. And safe thy bark shall reach its port Unshattered by life's gales. Mamie S. Paden.
