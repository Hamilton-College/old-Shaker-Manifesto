WHO WAS THE HEATHEN? A family in St. Paul had never employed a Chinese servant, but thought they would like to try one. Accordingly, one presented himself, of whom several questions were asked. Among them were: 'Do you drink?' 'No, I Band of Hope boy.' 'Do you gamble?' 'No, I Band of Hope boy.' 'Do you smoke?' [rather indignantly,] 'No, I Band of Hope boy.' He was engaged and gave so much satisfaction that a dinner party was given by his employers. Wine was on the table, and the after dinner cards and cigars were enjoyed. Breakfast was prepared next morning. John appeared, bundle in hand, saying, 'I go.' 'Why do you go? We like you very much.' 'When I come here you say: 'You smoke?' You smoke. You say, 'You drink?' You drink. You say, 'You gamble?' You gamble. You heathen. I no stay.' 'If some tall steeple totters from on high Will gravitation cease while you go by?'
