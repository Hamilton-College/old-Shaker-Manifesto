TRIBUTE. Marcus Gregory TRIBUTE. To the Memory of Brother MARCUS GREGORY. Mary Johnston. ' He, giveth his beloved sleep-' At a few weeks journey of the New Year, just as dawn was approaching and the sun gleamed over the hill-tops, with a radiant smile to fie snow clad earth, a pure spirit awakened in the glory of its Eternal Home. What a releasement from all physical suffering, from the agonizing pain and torture of a diseased body, for of late years our dear brother was a great sufferer; but at all times bore his affliction with marked patience and resignation. He bore evidence of a living faith, founded on the Rock which wrought ï¿½'peace, patience, experience and hope.'' Hope that he would soon traverse the golden portals of heaven, where sorrow, sickness, pain and death are unknown. We believe that his hopes are at last realized, and that he is mingling with that innumerable host that have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb. Our beloved Brother, Marcus Gregory, was born in Shelby Co., Ky. (see page 72.) His parents united with the Society of Believers of Pleasant Hill in 1813, with eight children; all of whom remained steadfast to their first faith except one- Pleasant Hill was not much more than a wilderness then, and many years of toil and severe hardships passed before its beautiful and substantial buildings arose. Through all those years of hardships, when he was blest with youth and health, the world's brightest prospects and gilded charms beckoned to him, and the siren voice tempted, yet he kept the even tenor of his way. Like adamantine rock he withstood the Summer's heat and Winter's chilling blast. His feet were shod with the gospel of peace. He was armed with the shield of faith, wherewith he was able to parry the fiery darts of the wicked, and with the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit. Clad in this holy armor he went forth with his trust in God and 'pressed toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.' He was quiet and reserved, but always had a smile and pleasant word for every one. Faithful in every duty until disease and infirmity could no longer be resisted. Without any reserve he consecrated his time, and his talents, his body and soul to the great God that discerneth the intentions and motives of the heart. O I may we all be wise and strive to imitate this shining example and ' scatter the roses instead of the brier.' After his long life of usefulness he was ready to say in truth, ' I am now ready to be offered up. I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day ; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.' Go, worthy veteran go ! and reap the fruits of thy labors, and receive thy glorious crown of life. Dear Father, we miss thee from our midst, most deeply; and how sad our hearts, as we bid adieu to the last of our early Fathers of Pleasant Hill, and in our sorrow we fain would bring thee back; but we know that thou art happy, thy journey over and safe home at last! We feel that the heavens are re-echoing the gladsome welcome. ' Well done thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' Pleasant Hill, Ky.
