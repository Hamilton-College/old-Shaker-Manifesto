Phrenology . The time has come when people do not question the utility of Phrenology, and men in all departments of life are now applying its principles, both in self-culture, and in their dealings with others. The Phrenological Journal of New York is the only periodical devoted to the subject, and it includes with this all that relates to Human Nature, and the improvement of men physically, mentally, and morally. In the prospectus for 1882, the publishers make liberal propositions to subscribers. The price has been reduced to two dollars a year, and to each subscriber is offered a new Phrenological Bust. This Bust is a model head, made nearly life size, of plaster of Paris, and so lettered as to show the exact location of all the Phrenological Organs. It is a handsome ornament, well adapted to the centre-table, mantel-piece, library, or office. With the aid of this, and the illustrated key which accompanies it, together with the articles published in the Phrenological Journal on Practical Phrenology, each person may become quite familiar -with the location of the different Phrenological Organs, and a good judge of Human Nature. The Bust is sent by express, carefully packed, to every subscriber who sends in addition to the subscription price ($2.00), 25 cents extra for the boxing and packing; or, No- 2, a smaller size, will be sent by mail, post-paid, on the same terms, to those who have the Bust, or prefer the new Book Premium, will be sent 'The Phrenological Miscellany,' worth $1.50. Our readers cannot do better than to subscribe at once for the Phrenological Journal ; it will bn found the best possible investment for the money. Those who desire a more explicit description, together with prospectus of the Journal, should send their address on postal card, or accept the publishers' offer, and send 10 cents in stamps for sample copy of the Journal to Fowler &amp; Wells, 755 Broadway, New York.
