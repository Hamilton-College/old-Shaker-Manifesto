A BEAUTIFUL LEGEND [Contributed by G. B. A..] A BEAUTIFUL LEGEND. A charming tradition is connected with the site of which the Temple of Solomon was erected. It is said to have been owned in common by two brothers, one of whom had a family; the other had none. On the evening succeeding harvest, the wheat havingbeen gathered in separate shocks, the elder brother said to his wife : 'My younger brother is unable to bear the burden and heat of the day; I will arise, take my shocks and place them with his without his knowledge ' The younger brother, being actuated by similar kind motives, said within himself: 'My brother has .a family and I have none; I will contribute to their support. I will take of my shocks and place them with his without his knowledge.' Judge of their mutual astonishment when on the following morning they found their shocks, undiminished. This course of events transpired for several nights, when each resolved to stand guard and solve this mystery. They did so, on the following night they met each other half way between their respective shocks with arms full. Upon ground hal lowed with such associations as these was the temple of Solomon erectedâ€”-so spacious and magnificent, the admiration and wonder of the world! Alas ! how many in these days would sooner steal their brother's whole shock than add to a single sheaf.
