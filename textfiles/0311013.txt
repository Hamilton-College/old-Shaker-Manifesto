Great Britain is very angry with Little Ashantee... Great Britain is very angry with Little Ashantee, and Queen Victoria is about to wage war with King Cuffy. A leading English journal says : ' Our troops would have no difficulty in destroying the Ashantee capital. Tiie houses are built of combustible materials. We find no satisfaction in the contemplation of hostilities carried to such lengths as the burning of towns and villages. But a war has been forced upon us,' etc. And, further on, the same journal announces the departure for the scene of operations of the transport 'Adela,' loaded with military stores, and continues: ' In the garrison churches at Woolwich, about the time the Adela sailed, the hymn usually sung when the troops are at sea was given, the chorus â€” O hear us when we pray to Thee For those in peril on the seabeing sung with deep feeling.' Man ever makes God in his own image. Fighting, warring ' Christians ' naturally invoke a blood-thirsty, war-loving Deity. This is the same God that our Modoc-murdering ' Christians ' want to get into the U. S. Constitution! Keep him out!!
