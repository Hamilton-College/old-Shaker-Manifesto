Much Beloved Elder Henry:--The Manifesto reaches me each month... Milton, Umatilla Co., Oregon. July 6, 1890. Much Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½ The Manifesto reaches me each month, ladened with heavenly manna for each soul who is thirsting after righteousness. Yea, to my soul it is food and drink indeed. May it prosper and be a guiding star to many who are yet in darkness and ultimately lead them into the light of Christ's and Mother's gospel is my earnest prayer. In last number of Manifesto in the article 'Whither are we Drifting?' is a call for a reply from some one. The subject under consideration is one that requires deep thought and is of intense interest to all who desire the prosperity of Zion. Consecrated property of Believers never should be desecrated by the deadly and poisonous influences of worldly-minded people. The employing as hirelings those of the world, brings into our midst death and destruction to the mind of the novitiate, and to the youth of our Societies an ignominious blight to their young and plastic minds. Jesus says 'I have called you out of the world' which emphatically means away from all of its influences. Are we separated from the world when we hire them among us. While I had the glorious privilege of being among Believers (but through the fore of circumstances compelled to mingle with the world) I saw much and heard much, which convinced me that the seeds of iniquity were constantly being sown in our midst by those employed who are of the world. Each one of us carry with us an influence for good or evil, and from us this will radiate in magnetic currents and thoroughly permeate all within its reach. This being the case, what can we expect from those who live in sin and are the daily victims of ungovernable lust. Often have I heard the expression 'The Shakers are dying out, and it will not be long before their property will pass into other hands.' God forbid ! for I know it to be his work and cannot fail, yet we must do our duty, if we expect his blessing. 'Hands to work and hearts to God' being our motto, let each rally to the work, that Zion may become free of all that defileth. Thine fraternally, Wm. W. Bellmire.
