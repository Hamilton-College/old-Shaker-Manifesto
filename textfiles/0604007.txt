I would never choose to withdraw myself from the labor and common burden of the world... __I would never choose to withdraw myself from the labor and common burden of the world; but I do choose to withdraw myself from the push and the scramble for money and position. Any man is at liberty to call me a fool, and say that mankind are benefited by the push and the scramble in the long run. But I care for the people who live now and will not be living when the long-run comes. As it is, I prefer going shares with the unlucky. â€” George Eliot
