It was said by Nordhoff... Pleasant Hill, Ky., Arc;. 189o. IT was said by Nordhoff in his book upon ''American Communism' that 'to look upon the members of the Shaker brotherhood, revealed to him an appearance as of something wanting,the semblance of a life that had been lived in vain.' This sentiment, though possibly penned in more homely words than were used by this eminent writer, made upon me an impression that has ever been before me in reading the literary work of authors on Shaker Communism, not of the faith of the United Society of Believers. The introduction to old age one receives among the Shaker people, is one of the most pleasing meetings that is accorded a kindly inquirer. It presents to you a life that has long since relegated its walks of busy usefulness, (as is spoken of the active career of the brother or sister in the full discharge of family life) to the quiet of meditation, and review of the career that has been safely passed through, and now presents the beautiful picture of the reward of an earthly life well lived. There are some, and the writer has personally observed them, who, at this period of life, will bewail and moan over their fate; speaking of themselves as being set aside upon the human shelf, worn out and useless, an incumbrance upon the busy hive of workers. They speak of themselves as hav ing lived too long. Oh ! this is sad. But many are seen whose proud delight it is to recount and narrate every detail of a past that has lived to become eighty or ninety years of ripe and natural existence. It will be found, in reviewing the past, every joy accounted for, every grief made whole, every debt and obligation paid. It is a pleasing sight and is an incentive to live the better life. It speaks well, too, of the, virgin life of the true Believers, those who accepted the higher example of Christ, and who in the Shaker Church followed in the teachings of Mother Ann Lee. She was an inspired woinau of the faith in the second appearing of Christ, to the United Society of Believers, as the Shakers now address themselves. This is a life of toil, of faith, of charity, of celibacy, and preparation for the eternal salvation. The brotherhood and sisterhood of this religious sect, are a long lived people, those whose respect for their covenant has been of paramount consideration. It is a successful life, when you can approach and ask, 'Is it well?' And you receive the response, 'I would live it all over again, were it granted.' F. Silsby Tripp.
