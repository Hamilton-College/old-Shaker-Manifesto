HOW TO BE ACCEPTED JACOB KULP What shall I do to be of use Unto my fellow-man? How best serve God in spirit, truth, And do the good I can ? I will confess, repent, forsake, And keep my heart from guile ; Perchance my God will then accept And on my offering smile. He asks : 'My son give me thine heart,' And can I this refuse ? Nay ! consecration to thy work Is just the life I choose. I give whate'er I claim of earth,— My wealth, my talents,—all, What e'er the gifts I might possess, The offering would be small. The carnal life, the selfish will Must both be crucifiedi; No flesh may glory in thy sight, Nor prosper in its pride. The creeds and forms which progress check, By truth shall be consumed; Then shall thy will on earth be done, And here thy Kingdom come. Thus all who hope to reign with Christ The cross he bore, must bear, Denying all ungodliness And in his sufferings share. The promise is 'He shall receive An hundred fold in time ;' Most humbly I acknowledge, Lord, This measure now is mine. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
