LOVE OF NATURE. By Martha J. Anderson. In love with nature, how my heart is sighing, For woodland copse, or some sequestered dell, Where simple beauty grandest art outvieing Seems weaving there some calm enchanting spell. The soft dark earth from out her heaving bosom Sends up the tender shoots of tree and fern, And early, budc the sweet and lowly blossom, Whose roots defied the winter cold and stern. As spring awaked the latent seed-germs sleeping, From dells where long a wealth has hidden lain, So in my heart I find there is in keeping, Some good to resurrect to life again. My pulses throb in unison with nature! Her Maker gave my being form and birth; And life adapted to each living creature, Links all in harmony with mother Earth. And when the breath of southland comes upon us, When Blue-birds warble and the Robins sing, When gentle showers drop dewey freshness o'er us, 1 hail with joy these harbingers of spring! It is a festival of joy and gladness! My heart would join Creation's rapturous lays, Not keyed in minor tones of pensive sadness, But rich and full the swelling songs of praise! O hasten to the forest girded upland! Where long the trees have rtood so grey and bare, Which now seems vieing with the beauteous lowland, To greet sweet spring in vestments bright and fair. In yonder haunt�'tis nature's quaint seclusion� The low Arbutus trails along the ground, x Blue Violsts and white, in rich profusion, With tiny Hare-bells blooming may be found. The Maple leaves ambrosial nectar's swelling; The Pine and Fir in brighter robes appear; The Ash, the Beech and Chestnut, all are telling, That rosy June her wonted smile will wear. The Shade tree first the vestal garment wearing Stands like a spectre 'gainst the Oak and Bay, Whose dark green leaves with virgin white comparing, Cast sombre shadows o'er the woodland way. The Black Birch tempts us with its twigs so tender, For roots of Sassafras we search the ground, The Sptuce and Hemlock healing juices rendet, For Esculapian balsam there is found. The noble Elm that graces yonder meadow, And towers aloft beneath the sunny sky, With spreading branches forms a grateful shadow, For the contented flocks that graze near by. Soon will the Ash with coral clusters bending, Look like a queen in Orient array; The low Sumac with opening plumes ascending, Skirts all the forest by the hedge and way. The Poplars tall come forth in shining vesture, And Popple leaves still tremble as of old, For nature, true to every form and gesture, Transcends no law as life and growth unfold. Where Balm of Gilead fills the hillside clearing, The mountain rises in its majesty, And on its slopes between the rocks appearing, The clustering Pinksters grow all wild and free. The Willows wave with lithe and gentle motion, Beside the streams that flow from wooded hills, And fragrant as the flower extracted lotion, The air with perfume from their censers fills. The Squirrels pace the outstretched Walnut branches, Their storehouse in its trunk is now quite bare, Instinctively they cast their wistful glances, As though a future feast was growing there. The flocking Crows their former nooks discover, And in discordant cawing seem to vie, As hither�now the wintry storms are over� To tree-top tall to build their nests they hie. How beautiful the Lichen and the Mosses ! Which ornament each ancient tree and stone, This network fine,Time's hand with care embosses, By mystic art as yet to man unknown. Just place them under microscopic glasses, And you will see in miniature portrayed, The woodland, glen, and field of emerald grasses, With curious forms that grow in damp and shade. The orchard dons its garland fair and youthful; In wealth of floral beauty lavished here, Beheld the blush of promise�proving truthful� 'Twill crown the golden harvest of the year. I love the flowery vales and dimpling meadows, The pebbly brooks and fields of waving grain, The changing colors of the light and shadows, That play with zephyrs o'er the hill and plain. Oh God is good ! His loving care bestowing On honest labor of the tiller's hand; He that goes forth the seed of Spring-time sowing, Shall reap a blessing from the frMount Lebanon. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
