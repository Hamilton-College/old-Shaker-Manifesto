PROPHETS By whom were the Prophets inspired ? Or whence came their rythmical song ? That Avators have play'd on their lyres, As they march'd with the ages along ? Was it not by the angelic throng, Who inhabit Eternity's strand, The Christs of the innermost spheres, Who await the Deific command ? The heaven of heavens their home, Where all primal cells were first form'd : By these all creation has come, Have never by evil been storm'd. From thence were the Prophets inspired, ' Mid the races and nations of earth: Prophetesses, too, tuned their lyres, As they sang of the heavenly birth. Pure glory on glory I see, For ever and ever advancing, Rolling on like the billowy sea, With the grandest of music enchanting. To the sun, the bright sun, we ascend, Returning from whence we proceeded; As planets, when roll'd to the end, In oceans of fire are bathed. Ed.
