Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1894. Mild weather still holds on, fair and cloudless for weeks at a time; as though it was tempered by Providence to alleviate the sufferings of the homeless and needy. Sleighing continues fine, with no huge drifts to flounder through, when meeting loaded teams, but plenty of room to pass a slow going horse as in summer time. Elder Isaac Anstatt paid us a short visit on the 20th ult. We enjoyed his hearty laugh as well as his sound common sense, and have invited him to come again, trusting tli^it next time he will tarry with us longer. Our cord wood pile grows longer and wider every day. Good thick ice and a straight smooth road across the lake, saves the teams many a mile of hard travel. Most of our Brethren are at work on the Eclipse Cornplanters. We finish them at the rate of ten machines a day. We hope to have them all completed by the time the maples are ready for the sugar harvest. Small orders for sweaters come in now and then; also an occasional order of custom shirts. While not all we could wish, still, 'small favors are thankfully received.' Our Second family Brethren and Sisters have now all become members of the Church and North families, and the buildings are vacant for the first time in a century. We have moved over one hundred and twenty-five loads of household articles and there are many more to follow. Elder William Wilson has gone to New York to endeavor to effect a sale of their large farm. We are all enjoying average health, with the exception of a few cases of the ever present New England cold. G. H. Kirkley. North Family. Feb. 1894. In one of our recent meetings we listened to an excellent discourse of the character language of the Believer. It was stated that its worth in soul growth could not be fully known until the effects appeared. Who can question the efficacy of refined language as being other than an impetus to kouI goodness, and should we not use the best to illustrate the glory of life? Minds like temperaments vary, science, doctrine and philosophy have their students and admirers, and lovely nature gives a hearty amen to all. We should not simply be theological pens containing only religious ideas, but like nature's ex- 72 THE MANIFESTO. pansive fields, contain those elements that enrich, enlarge and ennoble every organic part of our being. Nature re-echoes her notes of approval that as a variety of flowers adds cheerfulness to life, so variety of gifts adds usefulness. We can not disconnect one essential moral, social or temporal block from our structure, but we can add thereunto. Therefore, as good language is the filter of refinement, so is broad mindedness the open door to greater works of righteousness. We are pleased to record a visit from Elder Isaac Anstatt. His presence was an inspiration of cheerfulness and his encouraging counsels to the young were impressive, being created by a union of love and sympathy, qualities which give tone and vivacity to life. In enumerating life's blessings, we deem it worthy of note, that we are so situated that throughout the entire year we can meet for soul devotion with the Church family. Long would pen linger upon the theme of 'Home, sweet home,' as thoughts of the wretchedness abroad, which is being lessened by noble men and women, come to us, but space is too precious for mental story or written comparison. We are enjoying good health, have a large yard of wood nicely stored for another cold season, and a good crop of ice sixteen inches thick, for the summer. As the command of God's Church is to 'study the creation of souls' and win them to Christ, may we be '.doers of the word and not hearers only.' George H. Baxter.
