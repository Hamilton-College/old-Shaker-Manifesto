Unnatural or Heavenly ? EDITORIAL NOTES. Every attempt at a fac simile representation of Jesus Christ's life, is met by two classes of individuals: Of one class we will hear that the attempt is in contradiction to the behests of natureâ€”unnatural. Of the other class we will hear : ' This is not of earth ; this is of heaven.' Which is the true definition of the attempt ? We claim both are. To do heavenly deeds is an unnatural proceeding, according to the interpretation of what nature is understood to be. That Earth and Heaven can be opposites and yet both right, good, each in its place, is a lesson to be learned by many good folk. The chemist finds in his laboratory, oils and alkalies ; and everywhere we find opposites which are equally good to all appearances. The earthly tends to the grosser or lesser good; while the heavenly has enduring and eternal value. ' The first, was of the earth, earthy (good but transient and of the lesser good) ; the second, is the Lord from heaven, a quickening spirit.' Let the attempt of copying Christ represent eternal features, and these will be opposites to those of temporary consideration, however good they may be considered. The Shakers sing: '' Oil and Water cannot blend, N either flesh with spirit ; Purity of heart alone, Can heaven's gifts inherit.' And let it be understood that the Uesh is inferior to the spirit; and while one is natural, the other is heavenly.. The decision classes the individual.
