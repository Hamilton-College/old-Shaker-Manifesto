Juvenile. IMPURE STORIES The New York Tribune, under the head of 'Talks with Correspondents,' prints the following: The White Cross.ï¿½For the benefit of W. L., who wears a White Cross badge, and who complains of offensive stories and badinage he is compelled to listen 10, we relate the following which occurred in an office, in this city last week : ' Among those who occupy this office, consisting of a suite of fine rooms, are two high-toned Christian gentlemen. Some of them have held positions of eminence. To their office came a man who claimed a club acquaintance with one of them, and who, finding two or thre'3 of them together in the reception-room, began to tell an offensive story, illustrating it as .he went on by reference to a map hanging on the wall, and standing necessarily with his back to the auditors. When he got through his story and turned to receive applause, no one was in the room but the type writer boy, who had been busily at work all the time. The auditors had quietly taken themselves to their respective rooms, and the visitor had nothing to do but take his hat, and retire. That is a good way to listen to a vile story.'
