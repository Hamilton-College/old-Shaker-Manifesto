WESLEY ON DRESS ' I advise you ... (1) That your apparel be cheap, not expensive ; far cheaper than others in your circumstances wear, and than you would wear if you knew not God. (2) That it be grave, not airy or showy ; not in the point of fashion. And these easy rules may be applied both to the materials whereof it is made and the manner wherein it is made, or put on. ... Wear nothing, though you have it already, which is of a glaring color, or which is in any kind gay, glistening or showy ; nothing made in the very height of the fashion; nothing apt to attract the eyes of the by-standers. I do not advise women to wear rings, ear-rings, necklaces, lace (of whatever kind or color), or ruffles, which, by little and little, may easily shoot out from one to twelve inches deep.'â€”Wesley's works, vol. 6, p. 547.
