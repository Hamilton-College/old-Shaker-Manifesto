Harvard, Mass. Sept. 1895. With the many duties pertaining to this mundaneship and to loving friends, one is neglected if we fail to remember The Manifesto, whose many readers hail it with pleasure at the close of every month. Through its columns we have tidings from sister Societies and can rejoice in their prosperity and sympathize with them in adversity. We have been blest with the presence of five respected and worthy Sisters from Enfield, N. H., who were the bearers of love and blessing from their Society. Such visits tend to harmonize and draw us into closer union of spirit. Our school is now in session; few pupils enrolled yet, but expect more soon. The farmers report an abundant supply of farm products although the potato harvest was injured by the prevalent potato disease; yet we have a good supply. Our herbs are not as fine as we anticipated on account of the drought of the early part of the season. With grateful hearts we sing. We are blest in many ways, We are blest in many things, We enjoy the happy days That true contentment brings. Marcia M. liullard.
