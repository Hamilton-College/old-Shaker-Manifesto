WHATEVER IS,IS BEST. [Contributed by Genevieve DeGraw.] I know as my life grows older, And mine eyes have clearer sight, That under each rank wrong, somewhere There lies the root of Right; That such sorrow has its purpose, By the sorrowing oft unguessed. But as sure as the sun brings morning Whatever is,is best. I know that each sinful action As sure as the night brings shade Is somewhere, some time punished Though the hour be long delayed, I know that the soul is aided Some time, by the heart's unrest; And to grow means often to suffer But whatever is,is best. I know there are no errors In the great eternal plan, And all things work together For the final good of man. And I know when my soul speeds onward In its grand eternal quest; I shall say as I look back earthward Whatever is,is best. I know on the shores immortal Where God and his angels reign We shall see not through a glass darkly But a brighter vision there claim. And I know in the land of Beulah In that peaceful land of rest; When earth and its burdens are ended We shall meet with all that is best. ï¿½Selected.
