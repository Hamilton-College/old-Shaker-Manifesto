Shakers, N. Y. May, 1895. 'The world is in commotion and human hearts are stirred.' The varied emotions that are stirring human society illustrate the development that the individual, society or nation has attained in their intellectual and spiritual growth. 'When ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, then know ye that the time is at hand.' This certainly is applicable to the present. That the time is even at the door for the old heavens and earth to pass away, we fully believe. Not by might or power, but by the spirit of truth; as the work will be one that will call for each soul to enter the temple and see that it is made clean; a fit place for the abiding of the holy Spirit. Our Society meetings have lately been blest with the special ministrations and presence of the veteran souls who have passed over the river, who have made themselves known visibly to our mediums. It is a comforting assurance to know that we can not be separated wherever our earthly habitation may be from their presence and power. The month of May has to date, the 8th, given us some very warm weather. The temperature several times ranging above eighty. Our weather prognostications are an average high temperature for the summer. How correct it will be time will prove. Indications are good for a bountiful fruit year. Hamilton DeGraw.
