What a Good Cow will do â€”A good cow will make 200 pounds of butter in a season, and skim-milk, fed to 30 pigs, will grow 200 pounds of dressed pork, or the same skimmilk fed to a calf will put on at least 200 pounds of live weight. A good steer fed in the ordinary way will dress 800 to, 2,000 pounds at four years, having grown on the average 250 pounds of meat each year, whereas the cow has made 200 pounds of butter, and the refuse of her milk has produced nearly as much meat in the pork or growth of young beef in the calf as the average growth of a steer for one year.
