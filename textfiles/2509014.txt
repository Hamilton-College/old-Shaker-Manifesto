ABIDING HOPE. 'We have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come.' Heb. vi., 5. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. I have thought of the fair land of promise, 2. I feel their pure influence of blessing, Of the unclouded light glowing there, Their music comes oft to my ear, Of purified souls, their homes pearly white, And Peace flying o'er the deep flowing stream, And the beautiful robes that they wear. Has left her sweet gifts with me here. 210 THE MANIFESTO. ABIDING HOPE. Chorus. By the bright shining river I'm waiting, Ever trustingly waiting to go; When the good Angel carries me over, That hoped for, I fully shall know. 3 I walk 'mong the lilies of virtue, And roses of love pave my way; I hold in my hand rich treasures of life, Tet a little while only, I stay. 4 For spiritual truth is my striving, And substance abiding and real; For freedom from sin and lurements of earth, And the true resurrection to feel. 5 'Tis true, what I've sown I shall harvest, Unmerited joys are not mine; But dread holds me not, with courage I hope For life that is wholly divine.
