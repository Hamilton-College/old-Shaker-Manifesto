LOYE TOKEN Dear Eldress Antoinette : I would proffer love to you, and grateful acknowledgments for the benefit that I have derived from the perusal of the S. and S. It has been filled with mental instruction and soul-food, which to me have been like sweet manna. I am mindful that it has caused many hours of weariness and toil on your part to make it so good and acceptable. My thanks are due to all who aid the cause By pen, or works, and keeping laws, In building up the good and true In this our Zion home below. I would encourage those who are young to ever bear in mind while they are forming habits of life, that self-denial in the mind is the first requisite for the formation of a true and substantial character; always let pleasureseeding be subservient to duty and principle. Curb vain thoughts, and restrain sinful desires, then it will be easy to bridle the tongue and sow seeds of peace and love, instead of discord and strife. How beautiful it is to see those who are full of youthful vigor arid activity, turning the strength of their minds to self-culture — training themselves to become useful — to honor God, and to bless the race by their existence. To do this, the voice of conscience must be regarded in small things which will lead to the observance of counsels, rules and regulations which are constructed for the wellbeing and protection of society at large, and are way-marks in our consecrated Zion home. In this way, the evils of the human heart are subdued — character is made brilliant and beautiful, and the soul is happified and filled with peace and joy. All such souls are an ornament and strength in Zion, and a blessing to humanity ; their influence is healthful and saving wherever they are. Eliza R. Avery, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
