HONORABLE AGE 'Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time.'- -Apocrypha. The age which stands in honor Flows not through mold of time, Nor measured by the length of years That run in rythmic chime; But wisdom crowns the hoary head, And marks the gifted sage, While an unspotted life on earth, Is honorable age. M. J. A.
