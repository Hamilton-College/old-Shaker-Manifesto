CHRISTMAS OFFERING p 1. Sweetest music softly stealing O'er our hearts in tuneful chime, Shall, in joyous notes reTealing, / 2. 'Wake we now to joy and gladness, Christ the Saviour we have found; Banish from our hearts all sadness, Swell the song of olden time, When the morning star was beaming, Angels sang of peace and love; And in deeds of love abound. Now the fount of good unsealing, Let us all our souls up fill; Many souls awoke from dreaming, Hail'd the light from Heaven above. Gladsome sound we echo still, p Peace on earth, to all good will. And, in kindly Christian feeling, Breathe sweet peace and speak good will. Gladsome sound we echo still, Peace on earth, to all good will.
