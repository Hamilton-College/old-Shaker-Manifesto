CHOICE OF TREASURES 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures of earth.' EMMA J. NEAL That heart which builds for self alone, The miser's portion gains ; But when its wealth is needed most, There's nought of worth remains. When death shall still the throbbing pulse, And silence action here, The clink of gold will not appear In the immortal sphere. The boatman, from that sylvan shore, May hear the miser's call, But cannot bear his pauper heart Where love o'ershadows all. No counterfeit wears virtue's mien, When heartfelt joys unfold ; Eternal gains, with bogus coin, Cannot, be bought nor sold. Where bloom the fruits of paradise, True worth e'er gains its prize ; While worldly titles, fame — all liesThrive only in disguise. Those who so fully are absorbed Amassing earthly ore. Of well-filled vaults, they here may boast, But none of heavenly store. By giving much the soul grows rich, Where'er its hands may toil To build for others homes of health, Or cultivate their soil. The philanthropic soul ne'er wants The miser's golden store ; 'Tis blest by blessing others here, And on the eternal shore. Then let me choose the ' better part,' The riches God has given — For Jesus taught, the pure in heart Should find their wealth in heaven. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
