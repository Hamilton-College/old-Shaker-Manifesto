PRENTISSIANA: Hatching Chickens by Machinery Some years ago, a good Catholic lady introduced me to her gallery of well-selected pictures. Prominent in the group were the two Marys, one nursing a baby, the other, in form erect and gallant bearing. The lady adoringly pointed to the firstnamed Mary. Pointing to the other, I said ' I like this Mary best.' The lady rejoined, ' to be sure she is the best looking, but she's not the Mother of God.' The other — the Mary Magdalene of Holy Writ — was a choice type of humanity, largely in advance of the age in which she lived. She was above the common level. From her autobiography, we make the following extract : ' The men of my period were not the men of my ideal. I did not love them. This was the sum of my offending. When I found an object lovable — a man, coming up to my ideal of manhood, I loved as only true woman can love. The hitherto sealed fountain was opened. I had found one worthy to loose the seal. And now, from my serene abode in the higher spheres, in the simplicity and innocence of early childhood, which I still retain, I would speak a word to the damsels of earth. Squander not your soul's holiest affection on unworthy objects. Keep the treasure, your birthright inheritance, in consecration. It is of more worth to you than the universe without it. If lost, it is not regained in its pristine purity.' But what has this to do with the text ? Nothing, sure. The effort to make chickens by machinery is afac simile of the pious effort to make sons and daughters of God by a Trinity of masculines — an abortion. From the sublime center of all vitality, all the way down, the feminine —the affectionate element—is sine qua non. In the most advanced heavens to which we can stretch our spiritual vision, are Seraphim — feminine, as well as Cherubim — masculine angels. And what would heaven be without them?
