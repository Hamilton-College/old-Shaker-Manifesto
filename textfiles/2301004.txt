Shaker Station, Ct., Jan. 1893 Dear Children ;â€”Another year of life is forever gone. Have you wisely improved it? Not an hour nor a moment can now be recalled whether they were spent in doing good or ill. Begin the New Year right. If you would save hours do not waste moments. The days are fast speeding away. Take each one as a gift to be used in God's service. Improve your talents and you will receive the reward. Let no moments run to waste, years have come and gone in haste. Fight against sin and subdue it. Forsake wrong doing to-day. Delays are dangerous and often prove fatal and time is none too long for repentance. Every victory strengthens the victor. The suffering which sin brings is the inevitable consequence of that sin. 'Pleasures in a sinful way, while they flatter you ever betray.' Keep good vows better this year than you did last. Each day make your heaven. Duties even in small things are duties still. The duty of the hour is to live right now. There is no pleasure like duty well done. Struggle for a clean heart. Base your actions on principle. 'A lack of principle is often the principal lack.' Never evade the question, Is it right? 'The pure in heart shall see God,' therefore be so pure that you can see godliness in each other. A conscience unspotted is heaven within. Your Brother, Daniel Obcutt
