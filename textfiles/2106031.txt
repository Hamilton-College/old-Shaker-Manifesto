Elder Henry, Beloved Br.--In a late correspondence.. South Union, Ky., Mar. 1891. Elder Henry, Beloved Bit.ï¿½In a late correspondence with our good mother, Eidress Adaline Wells, in speaking of the government of the tongue, she remarked, 'If one man conquers a thousand times, a thousand men, and another conquers himself, the last is the greater conqueror and has achieved the greater victory.' 'Greater than the titled hero, Is he, who himself controls.' We like the Manifesto and hope it may survive and prosper through all the perils which our standard-bearer may pass. Our faith is unshaken that God was and is the great Master builder, and that a structure thus reared, can safely ride over each storm that may come against it. Your Sister, Jane Cowan.
