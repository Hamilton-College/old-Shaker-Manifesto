Dear Children:--'One year more is quickly numbered... Shaker Station, Ct. Jan. 1895. Dear Children: 'One year more is quickly numbered, With the ages of the past, And you scarcely heed the moments, As they pass you by so fast.' It is always in order to turn over a new leaf in the volume of your lives. The crosses and trials of the old year are past, and the firm resolve that the clean page before you shall be free from blots, will give hope of spiritual victory. In commencing the New Year with good desires and corresponding efforts, there is an inspiration that gives new life, strength and courage. Afflictions and troubles will come, but press heavenward, asking God to bless your efforts. A good beginning is an essential element of success. Victory in the Christian warfare is the result of soul labor, the application of energy and the right improvement of time. Let your endeavor be to grow better each year, for brief is the time that you journey here. Only as you grow better do you really live. Perform your whole duty, for little omissions of duty; small acts of disobedience, as they may seem to you, will prove a sexious obstacle to your happiness. Beware,'There is a way that seemeth right, but the end thereof is death.' Well improve each passing hour, watch, and foil the tempter's power. You will never regret constant perseverance in the right path, and though the progress you make may not seem to be very great, at times, yet if it be sure and steady, you will win the reward. It is wisdom to live the greatest number of good hours in a day. Improve this moment while you have it, and the next as it comes, and so on, and you will have no regrets. Be rich in good works and strive for the treasure, lasting and eternal, that will insure you happiness. Childhood is a fit time for the reception of virtue and truth. So let purity be your guiding star and you will overcome all evil if you persevere. Daniel Orcutt.
