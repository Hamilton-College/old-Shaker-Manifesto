Living Comparisons The rolling river as it flows From glacier fields on high, Dissolving from the mountain snows, Like dew-drops from the sky, Leaps dazzling in the yellow sun, Rejoicing on its way, It spans the chasms, one by one, And crowns them with its spray. Exulting in its new-born joy, It bounds from hill to plain ; Ko heights impede, no depths destroy, Nor gathering winds restrain. 'Tis thus when dawns the better Way, With brightness on the soul; Out hearts will bound like Lambs at play, Or ocean billows roll. But as Love's current grows more wide, More gently will it flow ; Though strong as moves old ocean's tide, Yet soft as falling snow. Each golden sun, each silver star, Swift as its mystic flight, Moves through the azure fields afar, Still as the voice of night. Far down within the bosom deep, Where minist'ring angels come, Where faith and hope their vigils keep, There is devotion's home. Thence from each pure and trusting soul, Doth grateful incense rise ; Unspoken, thence heart anthems roll, That gladden fairer skies. Pure gospel life is like a stream, That moves with even tide ; No lightning-flashes o'er it gleam, No cataracts divide. But mirror'd in its waters bright, The smiling stars appear, Like jewels from the crown of night, The Angels scattered there. Thus may the current of our love, Like some fair river flow ; Though brighter than the skies above, More deep than seas below. And while o'er Jordan's rolling stream The glistening fields we see. Serene as is an Angel's dream, May our devotions be. E. T. Leggett
