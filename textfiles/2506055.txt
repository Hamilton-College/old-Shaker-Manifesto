So much of the friction... 'So much of the friction, the pain, the disorganization of life is due to lack of truth; so many of us lie passively, keeping silence when truth demands speech clear and free. The majority of us would resent the charge of cowardice with indignation, but often we are not above defending silence by calling it reticence, which we feel is a word that involves the possession of a strong character. It is an element in a strong character if it does not overbalance equally desirable traits. How much courage it takes to speak when speaking involves disagreement with one whose opinion we value or whose displeasure we dread! Yet how can we hope to keep a place in a friend's estimation, unless we have the courage of our convictions? Being truthful involves being brave. Spiked guns never won a battle, and never will. But being truthful does not mean rattling shot, nor sharp-shooting. It means a fair, open field, a face-to-face encounter. Silence, we say, is golden. It is if speech is unnecessary; but it becomes the basest metal if truth demands speech. Life is too short to waste it in useless encounters. Meet each obligation as it comes, and peace and respect, the foundation of confidence and love, will be the natural outcome.'
