HAZEL BLOSSOMS. Lydia Staples. It was but yesterday, on woodlands wild The sweet brier twined its strong and thorny stem With leaves of green, and set its blushing gem Of pink, where fell the shades that day beguiled And early sunbursts where the morning smiled. But now, when brown leaves skirt the forest's hem, The hazel wears its tawny diadem, And follows on, a lonely pilgrim child. Again its time to bloom will come and go, We may not see it in the lonely way, But, in that love which bade its gold to blow Along the flowerless paths in autumn grey, We can like it, though late, a chaplet bring, And lay Upon life's shrine, an offering. Mt. Lebanon, N. T.
