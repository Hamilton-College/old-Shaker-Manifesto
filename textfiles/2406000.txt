HISTORY OF SOUTH UNION, KY. No. 8. JAN. 1, 1862. Three long trains of cars passed over the road, with companies of Infantry, on their way to Bowling Green. This sight was of common occurrence. The cars were sometimes so heavily laden that many of the soldiers were obliged to get out till the train could pass a steep up grade. During this exhibition the crowd would become so excited that the air was filled with their cheers and wild screams. This evening twenty-one Cavalry called to stop over night. They all received supper, shelter and breakfast. Jan. 2. Five armed men called at the Trustees' Office. Three were in a buggy and two on horseback. They said they wanted to buy some cloth, and a roll of twenty-four yards was brought forward. This they seized and hurriedly made off, saying; 'as we have to fight your battles, we must have some clothing.' From the mark on their hats we supposed they were Texas Rangers. Whether or not they were soldiers, we could not tell; but we did know that they were robbers. Jan. 3. Four soldiers called for dinner and were accommodated. For this attention they expressed many thanks. Jan. 8. We note this as a remarkable instance. Forty Cavalry passed through our village and made no demands. In the evening two Cavalry men called for supper, lodging and breakfast. As this burden was so light it gave us but little anxiety. Jan. 9. This evening forty Cavalry called for supper, lodging and breakfast. We treated them as kindly as we could and on leaving they manifested a very pleasant spirit, JUNE, 126 THE MANIFESTO. Jan. 10. Five soldiers were provided with a dinner at the Trustees' Office. Jan. 12. Sixty army wagons passed through our village. A guard of two or three soldiers accompanied each wagon. Only five horses were to be seen while it required two hundred and thirty-eight mules to haul these heavy loads. Jan. 14. This morning five armed men called at the Trustees' Office and asked to see some cloth, or handkerchiefs or anything we had for sale. From our former experience we had grown to be careful and did not present much for them to buy nor to take by force of arms. The Brethren kept a close watch and followed them as they went toward the Sisters' new brick shop. We informed them that we could not allow armed men to enter the Sisters' rooms. We then persuaded them to go and see the cistern and then invited them to take dinner at the Post Office. In this building they saw a free man, of color, who was quite feeble. They seemed quite anxious to know to whom he belonged, and where his master was at this time. They made enquiry of Elder Solomon Rankin about the number of persons that lived in the large dwelling. Elder Solomon informed them that not less than ninety Brethren and Sisters lived in that house. At this reply they seemed much surprised, and remarked, uIf so many of you live in one house you would tight and kill each other.' Elder Solomon told them that the good man, Jesus the Christ, had taught us not to fight nor kill. One of the company remarked, 'We do not know him; he does not live in Texas.' In the com*se of the conversation Elder Solomon spoke of the case of Ananias and Sapphira. 'Yes, we are well acquainted with them ; they lived on the right side of the style.' Another said, 'If you do not swear, nor fight, nor kill, nor drink whiskey, we do not see what you can do.' Elder Solomon replied, We work for our living, that we may have something to eat and to wear and to give to the poor. But said they ;ï¿½'What do you do on Sundays?' We improve our time in reading and writing and in attending Religious service. 'Well,' said they, 'this must be a heaven of a place, and you are certainly a very good people.' At 9 o'clock p. m. we were disturbed by the noise and tramp of Cavalry horses in the street, in front of our buildings. The Brethren on making enquiries, learned that they wanted supper for two hundred and twenty-five THE MANIFESTO. 127 men. As it was so late we urged them to go to the hotel about a mile distant. At this they threatened to break into our buildings and help themselves if we would not provide for them. As we did not wish to awaken too much of their anger, we concluded to do the best we could and informed the Colonel that it would be two hours, before they could have the food. An officer by the name of Keep then said that his men must have some rest. The Brethren conducted the soldiers to the West family, which had been vacated for some months, and then provided hay for the horses. The men were ordered to rest till three o'clock in the morning, when they would be called to breakfast, instead of being called to supper. The Brethren who acted as night watch, said the soldiers were cold and hungry, but were obliged to lie down on the floor or on the ground, and many of them were soon fast asleep. A part of this company under Col. Scott went on to Yost's tavern and remained there over night. (To be continued.)
