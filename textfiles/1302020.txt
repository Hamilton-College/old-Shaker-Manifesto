LIFE IS BRIEF. I walked through a garden all verdant and fair, The flowers were in fullness of bloom; Methought as I gazed, they live not for themselves, For the)' fill nil the nil' with perfnme. But feelings of gloom over.shadowed my mind, Which caused me deep sadness and grief; Tiley witheI' and die 'neath the cold touch of time, Their beautiful life is too brief. The spring•time comes laden with opening buds, A.nd Summer soon fans them to bloom; And whll« I'm enjoying their beauty so rare, ' Tiley're bJiglJtedand fall to earth's tomb; But, there are .fays that time cannot touch, That tilde uot with floweret or leaf; In glory they brigbten in regions beyond, Where life is unending, not brief. So unto tile spirit of goodness I turned, To jO)'S that wi!lnever wax 01U; Where pleasures celestial, of angelle birth With heavenly beauties unfold. The spirit immortal exclaims with new hope, Toil on th'ough all sorrow and grief! .Thy existener, shall last through etel'llity's day, But time, and this earth.life, are brief. Then come loving angels with wisdom endowed, :My be'ing with power embne! Give light to direct me in luty's straight path Awl faith that is stendfnst and true. And while I am climbing the highway of truth At times oyersh,\dowed with gl'ief--' Your sweet hallowed presence each' day may I feel, Through the journey of life that's so brief. And when time hns folded its wings over me, And death opes the bright pearly gate, Maya substance etcrnnl untarnished by sin, Be the treasure my soul shall await. 0, then may I list to tho glad welcome sound, Of angels who've brought me relief! 'Enl'th's toils are all ended, Jour work is wen dour, Through tho life that was trunslent and brief.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
