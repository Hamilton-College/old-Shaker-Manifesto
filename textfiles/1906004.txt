WHILE WE MAY. Ada Cummings. Now while we are on life's journey, And can see our friends each day. Let us learn to love and cherish Their true friendship ' while we may.' For too soon we'll see them lying 'Neath the turf all white with snow, Which will cause the deepest anguish That our loving hearts can know. For there's not a household circle That has not one empty chair; There is not one earthly tenant That of grief has not a share. And we know the All Wise Father Gathers home our dearest friends; Those to whom our souls cling closest, Those on whom our hope depends. Tender are the sacred voices, Those we know, whose love is true; Lightly tread the willing footsteps That bring joy and pleasure too. Gentle are the hands that hasten Love's own mission to complete, Closely binding all together, By the cords of friendship sweet. All too soon these pass before us, One by one they fade from sight; All too soon they join1 the chorus In the happy land of Light. Leaving us, they'll find their mansion Where the flowers bloom alway, Then let us, O dearest kindred, Cherish loved ones, 'while we may!' *' While we may,' the heart is throbbing Like the heaving ocean's song; *' While we may,' the veil is lifting, And the time will not be long. ' Not be long,' we often murmur, E'er they all will pass from sight: But at last we too may anchor Safely in the port of light West Gloucester, Me.
