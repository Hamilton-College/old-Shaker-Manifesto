The sick room should be quiet, cleanly, and well aired. Label all medicines. Poison should be placed above the reach of children. A good nurse has a very steady hand, a clear head, and a kind heart; she is not talkative or nervous. Avoid arguments with the sick; do not tease them with business ; do not sit or lean on the bed. If a friend calls on a patient their stay should be very short. The practice of visiting the sick on the Sabbath is a very poor one ; that day often thus becomes the most fatiguing of all of them. As a general thing do not go into a sick room unless you go to help and not to talk. Do not deceive the sick; deceit breeds suspicion: they will worry lest you are 'keeping something from them.' To persuade the dying that they will recover is treason against the interests of the soul. It soothes and cools a fevered patient to wash them with warm water in which saleratus or soda has been dissolved.
