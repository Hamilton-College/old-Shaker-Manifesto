AN EXTRAORDINARY RUSSIAN SECT. The Nest for Godly People is the title of a Kussian religious sect which has come into existence during the last fifteen years. Its head-quarters are at the historic fortress town of Bender, in the neighboring government of Bessarabia, and its strange name is due to the fact that its members�all of the peasant class�dig a grave in the floor (which is of dried earth) of their habitations, or else in their gardens, and lie therein until overcome by lmnger; in order, as they say, to commune with God, confess to him their sins, and examine their past life. To enable them the better to do this the grave is covered with a wooden box-like lid or canopy, having a door in it for ingress and egress, so that they lie in the grave as in a coffin, and were it not for small apertures in the top part of it they would run the risk of being suffocated. When the grave or 'nest' is in the garden it is thickly surrounded with bushes for the sake of greater privacy, and guarded by a savage watch dog to prevent curious or impertinent people going near it. These sectarians pretend that in their ecstatic moments, and when suffering extreme hunger, they see saints and devils, and some of them are subject to hallucinations. Another peculiarity of the members of this sect is that they hold as little conversation as possible with other people, or, in fact, with each other; so that the kind of life which they endeavor to lead is akin to that of uncloistered monks.�Day Star. The above representation of a new religious sect, is indeed, very peculiar. Possibly they may be exactly as here represented, and if so, they only form one more order of the great and singular religious world. Should this new system make its converts better able to practice the self-denial of which Jesus speaks, and to establish in their homes a growing, practical righteousness, then most assuredly, they will have attained to an honorable and worthy position. In the lukewarm state of the religious world of today, where almost everything that pertains to this life is placed in advance of the cross of Christ, where selfishness dominates and the poor arc cast out, it is not strange that new orders should arise and entertain the belief that they are called of God. And why not? Religious ''names and sects and parties' from the days of righteous Abel down to the present date have been claiming recognition on the earth. It is a wonderful page in the history of man, and to the thousands, a page that cannot be harmonized in their minds with the principle of righteousness. As strange as it may seem, many of these religionists have been more bloodthirsty than were the savages of North America. The zeal which they manifested for their God was to increase their own selfishness and to dominate over the souls and bodies of other men. Since the days of Jesus, the Prince of peace principles, this selfish and cruel spirit has been called anti-christian, as being opposed to the loving kindness which Jesus manifested for the children of this world. 'All things, therefore, whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them.' This has been laid aside, many times a.s not being a convenient rule by which to act. Fortunately for us who walk upon the earth today, the civil arm of the government has obliged the Christians to live more peacefully, and we may hope that these godly people of Russia may be privileged to dig holes in the ground, and if they choose, sit in them and pray and sing psalms. Prophets and teachers m-iy yet come from their ranks and preach a righteousness that will condemn the world. We wish them all the peace and happiness their new order of life may bring.
