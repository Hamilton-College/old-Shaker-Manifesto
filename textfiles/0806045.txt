Signs of a prosperous farmer Signs of A Prosperous Farmer.â€”When you see his barn larger than his house, it shows that he will have large profits and small afflictions. When you see him driving his work, instead of his work driving him, it shows that he will never be driven from good resolutions, and that he will certainly work his way to prosperity. When you always see in his wood-house a sufficiency for three months or more, it shows that he will be more than a ninety days wonder in farming operations, and that he is not sleeping in his house after a drunken frolic. When he has a house separate from the main building, purposely for ashes, and an iron or tin vessel to transport them, it shows that he never built his dwelling to be a funeral pile for his family, and perhaps for himself. When his sleigh is housed in summer, and his farming implements covered both winter and summer, it plainly shows that he will have a good house over his head in the summer of early life, and the winter of old age.
