PRAY, SISTERS, PRAY When women pray, The dear Lord listens well. He only knows How many piercing thorns fall in their way For every rose. He sees alone, Of countless heavenly seeds their weak hands sow, And tend with hope, how many fall for one That cares to grow. He, only He, Can gauge the love that, faithful waited on Beside the Martyr's cross at Calvary When all were gone.
