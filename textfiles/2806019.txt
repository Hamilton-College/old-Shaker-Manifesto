The confession of sin to God... The confession of sin to God, is one of the foundation principles of the Shaker Church. It is taught from Genesis to Revelation and in Christ's church must be a ruling feature. An unconfest Christian would be quite like the description of old Babylon, as given by the Revelator,'The habitation of demons, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.'
