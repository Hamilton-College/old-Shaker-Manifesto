PROGRESSION 1. Be firm our endeavor to follow the right, Though many our purpose oppose, 3. The hill of redemption with courage we'll climb, Though rugged our pathway and steep, 3. The darkness of doubt that be clouded our way, Fades far in the distance from sight, The weapons we wield are untarnish'd and bright, And mighty to vanquish our foes, We will join the victorious army of truth Unflinching 'mid trials and dangers of time, Still sunward our course we will keep, For a sweet sound of triumph floats down from the spheres We press for the glory of eternal day, Where lingers no shadow or blight, We will swell the grand chorus with heaven's bright throng Whose vanguard before us have gone, They traverse the land of perpetual youth, All grown'd with the laurels they' ve won. There's joy in the conqueror's song, With hope all inspiring with gladness it cheers, And hastens our journey a long. The blessing of victory see, The conquest of self over error and wrong, The life that remains for the free.
