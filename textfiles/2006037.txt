Which of the virtues named in the Beatitudes is a quotation from Psalms? This beautiful promise was given to one of the disciples... Text :�Ask and it shall be given you. Luke xi., 19. This beautiful promise was given to one of the disciples of our Savior. It teaches that if we pray earnestly with a meek and humble spirit we receive the blessing. As 'every good and perfect gift is from above,' we should look to no other source for these treasures. God's greatest gift to us is the Holy Spirit from which we learn to do his will. It is often called a lamp to guide us in the darkest hours of temptation and trial and if we follow in the path to which this light directs we shall find the road which Christ's true followers mutt tread. 'Knock and it shall be opened unto you ' Whut thought can be more cheering to the weary pilgrim than to know that the gates of endless glory and peace are open to those that fear God and keep his commandments?Hancock, Mass. Henrietta Morgan. Is there only one God; and what reasons have we for thinking so? Is there only one God; and what reasons have we for thinking so? 1st. All ancient or modern religions believing in many Gods have not elevated humanity as the Christian religion has. 2nd. The only true good is real happiness. The only way to attain that good, for an}T and all nations, ancient or modern, is by practicing love to humanity, charity, peace, sobriety and purity. This truth alone blesses humanity, as revealed by history and experience. This points to a oneness of disposition in tlie creative Power or first Cause. If a oneness of disposition then probable one God. 3rd. All life is the same and from one first fsuntaiu, us death and great accidents reveal, bringing all on a common level. As shown also in Acts xvii., 28. 4th The natural laws of the universe are uniform, supreme and universal. If the work of many Gods this would scarcely occur; because it reveals the work of one mind. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Fred Worthington. We should keep in the strait path of the Chritian traveler... Text :�Turn not to the right hand, nor to the left, remove thy foot from evil. Prov. 4., 27. We should keep in the strait path of the Christian traveler, and turn not to the right nor to the left, for if we do we get very far away. There are many roads and paths that are joined on each side by others. They each have a name They are disobedience, falsehood, selfishness, pride, unthankfulness, neglect of prayer, and many others. When we get out of the strait path, we have to go back. But how? By a full confession of sin and being sorry for it. We must turn from evil, sinful ways to good ones. But is it easy? Nay, it is only gained by great effort. My motto should then be, 'If at first you don't succeed, try, try again ' If we keep on trying we will at last gain the victory over sin. Hancock, Mass. Clara Wilmarth. THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER. Albenia Grimes. Ox the shores of the sea of Galilee near Capernaum was the interesting lesson given of 'The Parable of the Sower.' This subject fills my mind with many serious thoughts and I ask myself, how can I receive the help and benefit that it is intended to give unless I carefully read and reflect. It causes mo. to pic ture ia my mind two paths in life, one pursued by the wise who are obedieat, and the other by the unwise who are disobedient, and the joy and sorrow they bring upon friends by the choice they make. If by obedience we strive to mould our lives to their counsel and instructions we insure a ten-fold reward, which is the inward consciousness of doing right, and the blessing of God and our kind teachers, who devote so much of their time for our benefit, striving to impress upon our minds these beautiful lessons taught by our Savior. By disobedience we become like the Avayside hearers whose hearts are hardened by neglect and sin,1 so that truth makes no impression, and the wicked one represented by the fowls, plucks away the good seed. 'Our scripture examples are Pharaoh and Festus, so is the one who interrupted Jesus while he was preaching to ask him to interfere and compel his brother to divide the iuheritauce with him. If we become hardened as were the wayside hearers, the good seed will find no soil in which to grow, the voice of conscience will be hut-hed and thus step by step the downward course is taken. These reflections prompt me to make a resolve that these beautiful lessons will not be lost on me while having this privilege to learn how to devote my life to God in the days of my youth. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
