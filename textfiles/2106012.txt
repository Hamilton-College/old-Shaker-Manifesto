Mount Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. Apr. 30, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�Enclosed, please find the list of books, pamphlets, tracts, etc. with price, to be secured at the several families at Mt. Lebanon. Thank you for the advanced copy of the Manifesto. It is like the month (May) bright and betokens good things for the future. You truthfully remark that mankind are going up and not down. They are moving toward God the Father of light and the dispenser of all good gifts. A few more steps in this direction will lead them to acknowledge a heavenly Mother, and when she is found the wheels of progress, as Sister Emily Ofl'ord says in her excellent article, will roll more rapidly. The fire that was kindled in the first appearing of Christ, has been and is beingrekindled by her testimony. Believers should fan the flames and increase the fire by throwing into it those things which the spirit of God does not approve. The accumulated brush from orchards put on the asparagus bed was burned four days earlier than last year. By the help of a quart or two of kerosine it burned with rapidity. Is it not so with individuals? When prepared and willing to be helped, they are readily touched by the gospel fire and find enough to consume, as we by searching find the moth and the miller, the rubbish and dirt where we least expect it, upon cleaning our houses. 'Our God is a consuming fire.' She will not only clean out every vestige as small as a breast pin or a finger ring, that savors of a worldly life, but the very spirit that would keep that life alive. Not only sins committed, but the nature of sin that we all possess is embraced in the testimony of Mother, and whoever accepts this must part with their dearest idols. The idol may be a father, mother, son or daughter, husband or wife, selfish prop- erty�or some bad habit like smoking or chewing tobacco, it must eventually be consumed by the fire of truth. And happy and glorified is that soul 'who spares no idol, great or small.' Our good father, Elder Frederic, is still a prisoner. The wound is healing nicely. In mind lie is as active as ever, always reading or writing when not conversing or sleeping. We have finished house cleaning and have on hand two hundred dozen shirts to make. It would seem that every man and boy should own as much as one, but alas! alas!! Booth's 'Darkest England' tells the story and New York city might repeat it. Brethren are preparing gardens, and Sisters have raked the door-yards. Cows were turned out to pasture the 21st of present month, earlier than ever before known. If the readers of the Manifesto are interested in weather reports, there is a lively little paper called 'Words and Works,' that is printed at St. Louis, Mo., foretelling the state of the weather; and by it, we learn that frost and snow will give us one more call in May ere winter takes its final departure. In the meanwhile the grass will grow and flowers bloom, and seed-time and harvest will not fail, no more than can the love of the Gospel fail. O, there's a love that can never die, 'Tis pure as the heavens, warm as the sun in the noonday sky. It giveth life, health and endless joy, And liftcth souls from earth. O come ye needy, share this love, It is of heavenly birth. A. W.
