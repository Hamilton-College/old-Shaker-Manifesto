Harvard, Mass. March, 1896. The wheels of time have whirled us along through zero's cold, blinding stoims till we now have the 'windy month' attended by all its disagreeableness; yet Nature is not only grand, but beautiful in all her moods. With what interest we watch the snowflakes descend; how varied their crystal forms. When meteoric conditions fluctuate between rain and freezing, and both try for the ascendency, then every tree and shrub is encased in glittering armor that when the sun's rays fall upon them they sparkle as though hung with diamonds. Winter and spring are now contestants, each striving for the ascendancy. Our wood is nearly housed and preparations are being made to secure some of the sweets from our beautiful maples. Br. Ezra Newton, our centenarian is very feeble in health and may not remain with us much longer. Occasionally an inquirer calls for a few days and then goes his way. We hold ourselves in readiness for whatever God has in store for us. Marcia M. Bvllard.
