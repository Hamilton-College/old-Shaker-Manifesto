Beed. Jan. 1895. At our last writing of Home Notes we were in the midst of our first heavy fal) of snow, and long seemed what are called the 'dead months' before us; and now when these Notes appear, we shall be greeting according to old-timed ideas, the first of the 'living months' when slumbering vegetation begins to stretch and yawn underground, preparatory to awaking to duty. Our Christmas this year as in other years past, was made particularly pleasant, by the efforts of our young people to give us pleasant surprises. When the family assembled for breakfast, we found a pretty group of whiterobed young Sisters and girls and little boys wearing 'Merry Xmas' badges standing statue-like around an organ over which was a beautiful arch of evergreen, white paper chains and glistening with tinsel balls and bells. After prayers they sang an original Christinas hymn, the six boys keeping time on the chorus, with little bells. At the close of the meal, another hymn was sung, and the chorus of this was timed by a chime of bells, by the young Sisters. On the last verse they marched off to the farther part of the house that the sound might end in a cadence. Our Christmas forenoon service, was as usual beautifully appropriate to the day, proving to us that even centuries can not erase the lesson taught by the Prince of Peace. At the hour for our evening meal, the organ again called us to the dining room, where we were treated to vocal and instrumental music, recitations, etc. by the young people. Meanwhile physical needs were not forgotten; for between the acts, dainty and simple refreshments were served, and we pleasantly passed two and a half hours. It is right to have the young imbued with the idea that it is their duty and pleasure at Christmas to contribute to other's happiness, instead of feeling that they must be the recipients of some costly present, at the sacrifice of hard-earned means, needed for their necessities. Emerson said 'That is no real gift, which is not produced by the giver.' Thus skillful fingers can often create a gift precious both as a token of love, and an object of use. It is also pleasant that the efforts of the young find appreciative responses, in the hearts of the older members of our family, who love and bless every endeavor to TERMS. 40 THE MANIFESTO. make home happy. Reciprocity intensifies the pleasure of doing good. We were blest with the presence of our loved Ministry, and their words of love and encouragement, greatly enhanced the pleasures of the day. Amelia J. Culver. South Family. Jan. 1894. 'Christmas 1894' will long be remembered by our home circle. The tide of holiday feeling which prevails throughout on that memorable occasion was felt long before its real advent. Finally the longed for day had come. All the stockings had been filled, good measure, pressed down and shaken together, and we had a foretaste of the good things to come. Our forenoon meeting was one of those rare occasions of complete union of feeling, which makes you feel as if sitting in heavenly places. The opening testimony was 'Forgive and Forget' and proved to be like the touch on the button of an electric battery; all seemingly made it a thought whereby to profit the coming year. Articles appropriate for the occasion were road inspiring us to more 'Faith' in the 'Saving Power of Christ.' A quartette sang a new piece, 'Peace and Praise' adding to the good already prevailing. We retired from our Father's table filled with thankfulness and joy, refreshed, renewed and quickened to good works. More was to come. Of course we suspected it all the time, for a week ago I overheard two boys 'telling their piece.' Then the young people went to the locust grove, in spite of the crispy cold, in search of evergreens, ferns and moss, and Christmas eve: such a hammering, running and thumping could be heard in the meeting-room, almost till midnight, that any person with average common sense could draw up a conclusion as to what was going on. And it did go onit was a great success and lasted fully three hours before we saw the end. But let me tell you of the beginning. At five o'clock the family gathered into our meeting-room which was tastily decorated. The arrangement was evidently made for a double purpose. We were conducted to chairs at the south end some of which may have endured the burdens and friction of nearly a century, while others were the latest products of upholstery, massive in their cushioned elegance, desirable Christmas presents for the veterans of the family. A group of young Sisters, robed in spotless white, opened the entertainment by the ensuing colloquy, which was rendered with ease and grace and was a most creditable expression of the pure and practical views of young women reared and influenced by gospel principles. Friendship, Love, Charity, Humility and Sunbeam were the speakers. From the many items read, spoken, sung and played only very few can be mentioned. 'The Bridge' by Longfellow was sung to organ accompaniment by a treble singer with elegance and precision. The reading of several humorous articles, alternated by recitations, closed the first part of the programme. At the usual hour for supper we were transferred from the intellectual to the physical department. A placard with 'Free Lunch' in bold lettering pointed to a group of tables laden with a repast worthy of the most sanguine vegetarian. All tropical fruits seemed to have appointed this their place of rendezvous and were cordially welcomed. After this, not unpleasant interruption, we resumed our programme. Little 'Sunbeam' a child of seven years disguised as an angel, asked sympathetically 'Little lamb who made thee?' An imitation of all musical instruments including the bagpipe, on the organ entitled, 'Wandering Minstrels' excited considerable hilarity by its 'telling' and skillful rendering. Among the pieces read was one I can not help mentioning for its importance. 'How to cure gossip' tells of an unfailing cure of this wide-spread plague. We are willing to send it free of THE MANIFESTO. 41 charge to all afflicted (please enclose stamped envelope.) It is not 'Beecham's pills.' Two songs, 'Good Night' and 'We'll never say good-by,' intimated that all things, even Christmas entertainments must come to an end. After a few remarks of satisfaction and the wish expressed by many for a repetition of such gathei'ings we retired with thankful hearts to the Giver of all good things. Nor did we wait a long time before the above wish was fulfilled. The Old Year had to be marched out and the New Year welcomed. For this purpose we assembled the first evening of the New Year. After some instrumental music two representatives of the Old Year exchanged with two representatives of its successor their different views concerning the past and present, hoping the best for the time to come. After this two groups were formed which in calisthenic marching keeping time to song and music marched out the Old and marched in the New Year. A quartette sang 'Fear not' (Canterbury leaflet) and a selection from the 'Overland Monthly' entitled 'Good Night' was repeated in unison. This was a fair imitation of the New Year, which for all of us will, as we resolved, be a time for true intellectual and spiritual culture. Ernest Pick.
