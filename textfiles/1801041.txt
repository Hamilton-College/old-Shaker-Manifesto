' Be not weary in well-doing.' Gal. vi , 9 Why should we weary in doing well if we are striving for something better than that which we already possess? Were we unwilling to make any effort to do or be good we should soon find ourselves lacking that firmness and constancy which characterizes the lives of our older Brethren and Sisters. We must be constant and earnest if we would gain the true riches promised to those only who are willing to work unceasingly for the right. Let us be constantly aiming toward that which is highest and heat, for 'in due season we shall reap if we faint not.' We can easily perceive that if the gardener did not care faithfully, each day, for his flowers and fruits, weeds would grow up very soon and spoil his choicest plants. It is just so with our spiritual growth, if we neglect to care for the beautiful flowers of Honesty, Truth and Purity, our lives show it by a gradual development of that which is of the world; then let us not grow weary in well- doing.
