Beloved editor; I want to extend... Shaker Station, Conn. 1880. Beloved Editor ;ï¿½I want to extend to you the hand of sympathy and appreciation, and tell you that the Manifesto is to me a help and guide. It comes quietly and promptly, bringing comfort and cheering words. It is a gem and treasure, and no one who desires to cultivate truth and purity can afford to be without it. I sincerely wish it God speed. Daniel Orcutt.
