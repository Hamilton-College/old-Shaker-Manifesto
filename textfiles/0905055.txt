Let Chinee Stay The Chicago Tribune reports a conversation with an intelligent Chinaman named Chan Pak Kwai, on the subject of anti-Chinese legislation. He denied many of Senator Blaine's assertions, and said : ' There are hundreds and thousands of families in Cliina where the family ties are as sacredly kept as among the whites ; and, under the influence of the mission schools and Christianity, they are increasing every year. The charge that the Chinese do not assimilate with Americans or adopt their manners and customs is also false. They are slow to accept the policy of brickbats and cobblestones, it is true. You must remember that they are completely ostracized. If a Chinaman marries a white, woman, the first thing is to kill him. Still they have married white women, and established good homes. They are not allowed to attend the public schools, nor to have public schools in their own quarters. What education they get of American ideas, manners and customs they must get by observation or in mission schools. If you will give the Chinaman the privilege of stuffing ballot-boxes, he will probably put on American toggery and cut off his queue. The Chinaman's queue is his badge of nationality. With it, he is a subject of the Chinese government, and under its protection. If he cuts off his queue, puts on pantaloons, and adopts American manners and customs, he is denationalized., and ceases to be a Chinese. But the American government will not admit him to citizenship, and he therefore becomes a waif without a nationality. He, therefore, prefers to wear a queue, and be the subject of some government. I once cut off my queue, put on American dress, adopted your manners so far as I was able, and, after fifteen years' residence, applied to the government for citizenship, and was denied. I then put on my queue and Chinese costume, so that I might belong to some nation. If the American government would admit to citizenship a Chinaman when he had acquired the English language, adopted the customs of your people, and established a character for honesty and integrity, thousands are now ready to cut off their queues and become American citizens.'
