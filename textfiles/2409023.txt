Harvard, Mass. Aug. 1894. Again Nature has favored us with a beautiful day and we improve it by going 216 THE MANIFESTO. to Shirley to meet with our gospel kindred in prayer and praise. We met Elder Hiram Baker of Enfield, N. H. and were happy to see him. We are pleased to learn through the Manifesto that we were in union with some of our sister Societies in noticing our Nation's holiday. On the lawn tibles were spread with dainties for material enjoyment, and we enjoyed a picnic here till the regular Fourth of July shower drove us to shelter. But our pleasure was not spoiled, for we had a good intellectual feast of singing, recitations and dialogues. Haying is finished, and good judges say there are a hundred tons of good hay snugly packed away in the barns. Our labor is now turned to herbs, of which we have a generous supply considering the long drought. We have a bountiful supply of blueberries and whortleberries, which keep our young people busy. They are quite near and a half dozen pickers go into the field after dinner, and return at night with a bushel or a bushel and a half of nice berries. They are a good substitute for the loss of our small fruits. We recently received a visit from Bishop Chatschumain, an Armenian who is lecturing through the States in the interest of his down-trodden countrymen in Armenia. In the evening he spoke to the family upon the productions of the soil of that country, the social relations, habits and religion of the people. They claim to be the oldest Christian nation in existence, say their church was established in the days of the apostles. They use no pork and seldom taste animal food. A good Christian example.
