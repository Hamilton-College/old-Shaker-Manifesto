WHY NOT F0RGIVE HIM? Why not forgive your brother, If he comes to you in sorrow? Why not your anger smother Ere the dawning of to-morrow? You say he has reviled you Your dearest friends among; But has error ne'er beguiled you? Have you ne'er committed wrong? Why not forgive him? He is penitent and humble, He is weak and in your power— Who is not apt to stumble When passion rules the hour? He wronged you in his blindness ; Now act the Christian's part, And pour the balm of kindness On his sad, repentant heart. Why not fotgiva him? Can you look for sweet contentment, Or can love your bosom fill, While you cherish fierce resentment For the one who treats you ill? No ! spite of proud position, Of place, or power, or pelf, Unblest is your condition Till you triumph o'er yourself. Why not forgive him? With his grief his heart is riven, And can you with reason pray That your sins may be forgiven When from him you turn away? Vaunt not your pure condition, Nor back forgiveness keep— Think of Heaven's admonition, As ye sow so shall ye reap.' Why not forgive him?
