PEBBLES FROM THE PATH OF A PILGRIM PEBBLES FROM THE PATH OF A PILGRIM. A book of 320 pages, large type and beautifully printed. The Author of this wonderfully interesting volume, is Mrs. H. B. Hastings and she tells us in the Preface that 'it is a book of facts and not of fancies. It is sent with a stranger's greeting and offered with a stranger's prayer for a benediction upon the little volume.' Those who open the Book to read of the Little fatherless Girl, will also read on about the Story of an apron, and then on and on with the same interest till they reach the last page. Published by H. L. Hastings. Boston, Mass.
