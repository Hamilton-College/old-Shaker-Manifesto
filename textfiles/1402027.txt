SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. Groveland, N. Y. Canterbury, N. H. In the Spiritual Sky there is beam - ing A Sun that will never go down; O'er the hill-tops its light is streaming, Be - vealing the E - ternal Throne. E'en the arches of Heaven are shin - ing, And the path of the pilgrim is bright; All dark clouds have a silver lin - ing From the orbit of truth and right.
