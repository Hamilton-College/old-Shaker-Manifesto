IN MEMORIUM. By Oliver C. Hampton. Our good and venerable Sister, Nancy McKee has departed this life, (see page 90) While yet a girl of twelve or fifteen years, she solemnly consecrated her life and her all to God, and during her long and useful life she has never once faltered in that holy consecration. The writer has been acquainted with her for some sixty years and through all that long period has recognized the same unflinching loyality to her vows of sacred devotion to her God and her faithful pilgrimage in the path of purity, charity and self-abnegation. Her faith and loyalty to her religious convictions were of that sterling stamp 'which works by love and purifies the heart' and which can never fail, 'till it bring forth judgment unto victory.' Though in this our day such are invaluable to the Church and their loss almost irreparable, yet we are only too well aware that we can not retain them with us always. Our consolation is that our loss though very great is yet their gain and having fulfilled the sufferings in Christ which our Savior left as a legacy for all who should be accounted worthy to reign with him, they enter that land of peace and everlasting consolation, 'Where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.'
