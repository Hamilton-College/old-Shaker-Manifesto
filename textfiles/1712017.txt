MY FAITH MRS. E. E. BROWN I trust in God; whatever ills Around my pathway fall, Whatever clouds obscure ray sun, God sends and guides them all. I am not wise to frame a creed, Or talk of things divine ; I know not where 'twixt good and ill, To draw a boundary line. I cannot tell what saints shall nil His glorious courts above, I only know this one blest truth ; That God is boundless love. And knowing this, I cannot fix The limits of his grace, 278 THE MANIFESTO. Or tell what souls have strayed beyond The light of his dear face. So in my faith I vest content, Where'er my lot may fall; I cannot wander far from Him Who.-e care is over all. Selected.
