LIFE'S JOURNEY. BETSEY J. KAIME. Come home, my soul and meditate Upon life's journey, full of cares, A wilderness through which we tread, And often termed ' this vale of tears. ' 'Tis not, frail man, thy resting place,� Wherefore, the Power, great and divine Scattered some sorrows in thy path, Lest thou shouldst cling to things of time. In youth avc fondly grasp the joys Which Nature paints in pleasing hues, And though convinced they are but toys How loath the gilded bait to lose ! How eagerly we take the cup Which sparkles with its promised sweet; But when we drink its contents up, The dregs of bitterness we meet. Great disappointments mark our path, And sorrows come,�a lengthy train, Until by sad experience We find earth's charms are all, all vain ! O, if we only could believe Those who have proved its emptiness, We should escape a score of ills And taste of troubles many less. Go to the aged, grey-haired man, Whose cheek hath lost the glow of youth; Whose palsied limbs and trembling frame Betoken the approach of death. Go, go ye young, and ask of him The secret of true happiness ; And hear him with a feeble voice The secrets of the heart express. Truth undisguised he now holds forth, There's no' deception in his speecli; And may the knowledge he imparts The young and inexperienced reach : ' Once I was young and full of life, Saw Nature's charms before me spread; The earth seemed robed in loveliness, And time on pleasure's pinions sped. I fancied all was well with me, No dark clouds gathered in my sky; But joys as bright as rainbow tints Were in imagination's eye. I grasped them, but the grasp was vain, Not satisfied, I still pursued; But like the ' Ignes-fatui, ' They further on were always viewed. Something then whispered to my heart'� 'Twas reason's calm, dispassioned voice, Why shouldst thou thus thy moments waste In making sucli an unwise choice? This earth, my child, a shadow is, All of the substance lies beyond; Then why so greedy to possess, Or of unreal pleasures fond? The sweetest flower of Spring decays, The fruit of Summer cannot last,� While Autumn's mournful passing breeze Declares, 0 man, thus life is passed! Then look above the things of sense; By faith explore the goodly land,� The Christian's true inheritance, Who taste pure love at God's right hand. Passion then spoke : Yet longer wait, There's time enough to heed the call, Come, try once more, the tempting bait, I did so, but the end was gall. Then in my heart, I firmly said : To reason's voice I will attend, And gather me a precious store To feed on when this life shall end. Nature shrunk back from such a course, And plead with eloquence for life; Its language had surprising force, And most deterred me from the strife; But nerved anew, I took the field, Conferring not with flesh and blood; True self-denial was my shield, And all my trust in Daniel's God. I gained the victory ! young friends ; Myself I fairly overcome ; And blessed is that soul who stems The current, just as I have done. The days I've spent in pleasing self, As blank leaves in life's pages seem ; But those I offered to my God With pleasing recollections teem. So if you seek for happiness, Plant well your feet on virtue's soil, And in this life you will receive An hundred fold for all your toil. ' Canterbury, N. H. �&gt;*�
