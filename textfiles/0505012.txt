Marriage. Protestant Christianity 'The Significance of the Tilton-Beecher Trial,' from which we excerpt the following, touching the two dominant institutions of the country â€” Christianity and Marriage: These questions will be asked and profoundly considered by the Christian world, and by everybody who has not already settled them adversely to the 'only name under heaven' by which it is claimed it is possible to be saved. We entirely agree with Mr. Tracy, attorney for Beecher, that the validity of the Christian scheme is at stake in the Beecher trial. There is another equally important Institution at stake in this trial, and that is the marriage institution, at least from the church standpoint. If such a man as Beecher cannot and does not keep his marriage vows, who can and who does? If the result of two generations of Christian sanctification, salvation and ministerial exaltation, does not prepare a man to live virtuously inside marriage, there must be something wrong in marriage or something wrong in the Christian salvation.
