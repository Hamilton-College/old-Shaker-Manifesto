NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Aug. 18. Beloved Elder Henry :�Who would care for any notes about our home? Well, we have not, in my remembrance, had such a season as the past. For eight consecutive days we could do nothing in the hay field, and in July we had rain for fifteen days. Not a single Sabbath have we staid at home from public meeting on account of rain. [Good ! such a record as that is worthy a place in the Manifesto. Attend the public Service, and if it rains, dress accordingly. Ed.] Now, if we take fifteen rainy days and four Sabbaths out of a month, we have only twelve days left. This makes the farmers look rather blue. To see much of the labor of the season, with the fertilizers and manures that were spent on the potato crop,� so great a loss, to say the least, is quite discouraging. Some of our sheep have been destroyed by the dogs, and all in all it makes a mournful story. In the near future all this sadness may be turned to sunshine, and our notes to joy. D O. Aug. 27. Sister Amelia has a night blooming Cereus, and at 9-30 P M., she cut off a flower that was nine inches in diameter. By placing it on the ice, it kept fresh all the next day and could be placed on the table at meal time. The plant has produced three flowers this season. On Sabbath August 18th. Elder Calvin G. Reed and brothers Washington Jones and Dr. Carl, with several Sisters went to Lebanon Springs to attend a camp meeting. The place of the meeting is two miles from the Shaker Village. [We trust they imparted and received much good, and were persuaded to go the second time. Ed.] Watervliet, N. Y. Sept. 3. Elder Harvey L. Eads of Pleasant Hill, Ky., was with us on the 1st. and 2nd. inst. He was much revived in health. He shares our unbounded love. Hancock, Mass. Aug. 21. This has been a season of almost perpetual rain, and our large oat crop has been very much damaged. We have harvested some of our potatoes and think we shall not have more than one third of a crop. Sept 3. Sisters, Eliza A. Stratton and Julia Briggs, of Canterbury have been with us for a few days. We are all pleased to meet with our beloved gospel friends. Sept. 7. Berkshire hills and dales, have yielded an abundant supply of Blackberries this season. The East family Sisters have canned nearly or quite three bushels, for home use. A delicious substitute for apples. L. W. Enfield, Conn. Our new hay-loader is an interesting machine. It looks like a huge spider. [Is a huge spider interesting?] The Brethren think it saves them valuable time and much hard work. They unload the hay with a horse-fork, which is also a great invention. The crops on the farm have been good, except the damage done by the rain. Potatoes some injured. Apples scarce. The weather fine for harvesting. The second crop of grass is being cut and a very good yield. Corn is also commenced cutting and is very much better than was expected. A considerable tract of meadow land is being stocked down. Carrots and Beets have somewhat recovered from the long rains, and look well Everything looks prosperous at the present time. M. W. Harvard, Mass. Harvard has had too much of that evenly dispensed blessing which is shared alike by the just and the unjust; spoiling potatoes and beans ; hindering the harvest and injuring much of the forage crops. Sept. 4. Ensilage corn is being cut and stored, and estimated to be about one hundred tons. The experience of one year with ensilage of an inferior quality, (damaged by frost,) induces the belief that a good quality will give satisfactory results. The Silo is twelve by fourteen feet, and twenty-eight feet deep. When filled it was covered with hay, and overlaid with boards,�then thick sheathing paper,�then boards ; and where there was any indications of excessive fermentation, bran was used to prevent it. The gospel,�the religion of this world, is to know how to extract the most and the best from the elements,�the blind forces of nature, and to keep abreast of the moving, living, progressive world in all things. This is laudable. Avoiding alike, antiquity and the fashionable idiocy of the times. To make this world a little more of a paradise,�better for those who follow. To elevate the soc;al line and heighten the joys of those around us, and make acquaintance with the other angels when we meet them. E. M. Shirley, Mass. We have secured a large hay crop, and considering the state of the weather, in good condition, besides some five acres of nice winter wheat. Apple crop, short. Canterbury, N. H. Aug. 30. Have gathered about 60 bushels of pears and will have many more. The farmers are digging the potatoes, and the yield is satisfactory although rust has to some extent, injured the crop. Have had one case of scarlet fever, but the patitnt has wholly recovered. Two Sisters have been to Boston, Mass., and to Providence. E. I., on business Two other Sisters have been to Albany, N. Y., and to the City of New York, on business The Summer school closed on the 22nd inst. The exercises were quite interesting and the pupils passed a very commendable examination. For several Sabbaths our Church has been closely filled A great many have come to see and hear the Shakers. Services generally, continued from an hour to an hour and a half, and the best of attention given to the singing and speaking. Sept. 13. Br. John Cumings of Enfield, N. H. made us a visit of one day. Enfield, N. H. Aug. 26. Summer school examined on the 16th. inst. Some forty persons were present. The visitors were from Vermont, Mass, and Penn. Ail appeared interested in the exercises. Great satisfaction was expressed by the Board of Education. The first family enjoyed a v�-ry pleasant banquet on the lawn in front of the Family Dwelling. Tables were tastefully spread and well supplied with a variety of food. Some forty or more enjoyed the repast. The children marched to the place singing a beautiful harvest song, and the time passed very pleasantly. Sept. 9. Brs. Freeman White and Robert Clark, of Canterbury, have been with us, on a vi&gt;it, since the 2nd. inst. Several companies have attended the Advent Camp meeting at White River June tion. They return very favorably impressed, and will, no daubt, profit by the privilege.
