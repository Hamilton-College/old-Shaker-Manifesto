White Pine for Barren Fields White Pine for Barren Fields. [We enjoy a personal pleasure in noticing that the Boston Post, Philadelphia Ledger, and other papers are giving demonstrations of approval to the enterprise and good judgment of our Bro. Pease. We have the greater pleasure in reproducing the following types, because Bro. 0. Pease has been foremost and liberal in sustaining The Manifesto.â€”Ed.] We call the Shakers a peculiar people, and perhaps we do them no injustice, but like many other classes and societies, with all of whose ways we do not sympathize, they are capable of giving us profitable ideas if we will only accept them. The Shakers do not bestow much thought upon art, but they work in admirable harmony with nature. Their splendid avenues of trees, their farms under almost perfect cultivation, show that they do not slight the gifts with which they have been intrusted. A writer in a New Haven paper says that ' probably no man in all New England has done more in a certain line for the benefit of posterity than Elder Omar Pease, of the North Family at the Shaker settlement at Enfield. He has sown in the last thirty years over 200 acres of white pines, and to-day from the hill east of his residence can overlook their dark, dense growths, their various heights, indicating their different ages. He says that only once in about three years do the white pine seeds ripen. Four quarts of seeds well distributed will stock an acre. His best success has been after buckwheat and without harrowing. Pines grow where the land is poor^ and a man who has 200 acres of comely growing trees rising annually to his memory in this world leaves a monument better than marble.' All of this is true, and we wish it might not be simply abstract truth. There are thousands of acres in New England now bearing nothing better than mullein and sorrel that might be treated to the white pine remedy and become richly paying territory. Boston Post
