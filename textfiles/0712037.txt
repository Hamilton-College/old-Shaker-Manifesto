The Common Sense, a spicy monthly, printed at St. Louis, gives up in despair when thinking how very differently professedly Christian sects believe. ' The Shaker Christians refuse to propagate, while the Mormon and worldly Christians cannot propagate too much.' It was Henry C. Wright who spoke in New Haven: 'I cannot see how any believer in the Old Testament can come to any other conclusion than that of the Mormons; nor do I see how it is possible for any believer in the New Testament to arrive at any other conclusion than that of the Shakers ! Jesus and Paul taught and practiced celibacy. Were Paul living to-day, in my opinion, judging from his writings, he would be a thorough-going, first-class Shaker ! ' Our opinion of Christians is, they are such as follow Jesus and his immediate disciples in life—not merely in admiration. If Mormons, worldly people, or Shakers, take pattern of Jesus, then are they Christians, not otherwise. The Old Testament treats particularly of the old man—Adam and his descendants. The New Testament as particularly rises up to the new man—Jesus, the Christ—and 'old things are done away, all things become new,' like unto Jesus. No man nor woman can, at one and the same time, worship the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New. One teaches human propagation ; private, personal interests ; retaliations and wars ; politics, etc. The other teaches Celibacy; universal brotherhood—community of goods—Peace ; non-resistance ; and separation from the world. Which of these two classes is Christian? ' Choose ye, which ye will serve ; for ye are the servant of him to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey.'
