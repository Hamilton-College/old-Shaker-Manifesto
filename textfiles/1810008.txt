BIBLE SCHOOLS. Dr. Carl. I trust that it is not needful for me to present any very strong argument why every well regulated family of Believers should have a fixed hour set on the Lord's day to gather together the children, youth, and all others of the family, who may wish to attend a Bible School where the Scriptures may be taught in simplicity and purity ; that these may ever be as a lamp to their feet, guiding them in the way of life and bringing out God's plan of salvation to all mankind. Indeed, is this not our duty, 'To train up a child in the way he should go :' and how can we do so without God's word for our guide ? Our interest should be for the future of Zion and the Gospel, as given to us by our Fathers and Mothers. And I trust every Brother and Sister, who is truly such in the Gospel, will come up to this important work, and let us pray and labor and look for good to come out of such, and not get off behind self and look for evil to come. Surely then, there must be evil in the heart and no love for God's word to prosper among his people ; and wheu we come together let us remember here is an assembly of persons not so hardened iu transgressions as to make the effort put forth, fruitless. They are here to be taught, sincerity, confidence and love. It is the high and holy privilege of the teacher to stamp indelibly the glorious seal of God's truth upon these waiting hearts. When a teacher with a proper sense of the importance of this work sees before him a class of thinking, reasoning, immortal beings, and truly realizes the relation which he sus- tains to them and to God, he is forced to exclaim with Paul, 'Who is sufficient for these things?'-�and then rest only in the God given assurance,�'My grace is sufficient for thee.' True, prayerful preparation of the heart is the only requisite for a successful teacher. Without this all else is in vain. One whose soul is overflowing with God's love, will accomplish vastly more for the Gospel than a score whose talents consist entirely of intellectual accomplishments. A great many wellmeaning persons fail because they are not fully impressed with the fact that this is not only laying the corner-stone, but the whole foundation of the grand and responsible v/ork. It is not only for the future in the life of the pupil, but for the Gospel work. If they desire with an ardent longing, to learn the great secret of leading souls to Christ, let them remember the words spoken by our great Teacher, 'He that abideth in me and I in him, the same briugeth forth much fruit.'
