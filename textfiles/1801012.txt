IN MEMORIUM. ELDER LEMUEL C. TORRY By Alfred E. Doyle Earth to earth and dust to dust For this is Heaven's decree, And nature bows to pay the debt That makes the spirit free. But we who mourn with keen regret The losof father, friend and brother See hut the passing glorj' of tbis world And not the rising of another. Through the valley of the shadow, One by one alone must tread; We call this death, but is it true That ours are with the dead? Faith and Hope both answer nay, Death is but the gate of life, To higher planes and broader fields— Of onward upward strife. Our present loss is future gain, One friend below for one above; It must be so in God's own law, For God Himself is love. We have this hope and can rejoice In the field well fought and won, And with him share his well earned joy To hear the sweet ' Well done.' But we shall miss him, Ah how sorely, The kindly voice and helping hand; But whispers hope we'll find our own All in a fairer, better land. What shall we say, for words are weak, To these the children of his care? The Lord of Heaven is the orphan's God, Take everything to Him in prayer. For He has promised to kindly temper The wind to the shorn lamb, To bless with-holding or bless in giving The chastening rod or healing balm. Full well we know, how blest the thought, The journey he has trod, Though strewn with thorns led safely on To the Harvest Home of God. A fond farewell, a glad God speed Our father, friend and brother, Not dead but risen, still let us say— From this life to another. This holy faith, Oh glorious hope, To know whate'er befall, Of joy or grief in Heaven or earth God's mercies cover all.
