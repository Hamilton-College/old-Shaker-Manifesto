Shaker Village, N. H. Jan. 1882 H. Shaker Village, N. H. Jan. 1882 My Darling little Girl ;— What nice little girls I can claim for my sisters. Eeally, I feel quite rich when I count you all mine and ours. What would our home be without the children and what will Heaven be unless you are all there? It is the first month of the New Year, in which I trust you have commenced to be real happy. Happy because you are trying to be good and have such a beautiful home. You wished me to write you a letter. This is such a good wish, that I think it worthy of notice. It does not seem very long since I too was one of the little girls, and can well remember just how pleased I was when receiving my first letter, with my name superscribed on the envelope. I felt quite womanly but acted very much like a child, clapping my hands, and jumping with delight. So you see I know just what such wishes are. I have always preserved my letters many having been written by precious friends who have passed on to their Spirit Home. My ittle sister must learn to be a nice letter vriter, and perhaps you will write one to your sister H.— at some future time. Im&gt;rove all your golden opportunities in your nany happy schools and be like the busy litle bee gathering honey from the fragrant flowers Gather all the good you can fromyour many friends, and lose no opportunity or doing a kind act. I love your cheerful Good Morning, and your pleasant Good Night. I hope you will always be such a good little child that you an meet your sisters with happy expressions, 'hen you will be our sunbeam giving brightness to the home, and carrying joy to the Angels. Please give my love to your faithful Teach SHAKER MANIFESTO. 45 ers. They are all very dear to me, also take your loving companions by the hand, and give them my love. As I kneel in prayer I ask the protection of guardian spirits upon all of them. Lovingly your Sister,
