The Outlook The March Magazine Number of The Outlook, publisht in Inauguration Week, is appropriately, a 'Washington Number.' Under the title 'The New Administration' a careful estimate is given of President McKinley and his Cabinet, with sketches of the lives of the members of the Cabinet and with excellent portraits. A companion article is found in the editorial review of President Cleveland's administration and discussion of his character and place in history. The New Congressional Library (or National Library, as it might well be called) is the subject of a fine article by the famous artist and novelist, Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith; this is illustrated by four full-page reproductions of water-color pictures painted by Mr. Smith expressly for The Outlook. Still another timely feature of national interest is the article on 'Civil Service Reform; Its Origin, Progress and Prospects,' in which the advance made under the several Presidents from Grant to Cleveland is traced in an interesting way, and with frank criticism as well as praise. Mr. Justin McCarthy's 'Story of Gladstone's Life' continues and this month the score of illustrations includes several beautiful views of Hawarden photograph! expressly for this purpose. Mr. Homer Folks, Secretary of the Charities Aid Society, in 'Reform and Public Charities' makes a striking contrast between Tammany methods and those of the present New York Administration. (Illustrated.) In fiction the feature of the month is a strange story of New Orleans life and character by Miss Grace King. [$3.00 a year. The Outlook Company, 13 Astor Place, New York.]
