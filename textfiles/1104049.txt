Judge Religions by their Fruits That old Catholic woman, of whom Mr. Stevensori tells in his 'Travels with a Donkey,' who said to him that there was no difference between Protestants and Catholics 'save that ' wrong was more wrong for the Catholic' who had more light and guidance,' came very near telling an important truth. That was all the difference that the good old saint herself knew, and if there were other distinctions whose import she did not quite grasp, who shall deny that she clearly stated the only lawful claim that one religion can have for pre-eminence over another ? If my neighbor's religion makes 'wrong more wrong' and right more right for him than my religion does for me, then his religion is for him a better religion than mine is for me. A religion that does not deepen the moral convictions and strengthen the moral purposes is good for nothing; and all religions are to be valued in proportion as they bring forth in their votaries this fruit!
