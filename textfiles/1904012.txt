TWO KINGDOMS. AGNES E. NEWTON. One of earth, presenting treasures Valued by the^human heart; Knowledge, wealth and selfish pleasures Offer of their store a part. These are thine if thou wilt worship And the God of this world serve, Heads the tempter with the Chrigtian; Seeks from truth his heart to swerve. Present joys! no lasting treasure,� And for these to lose the soul! Of what profit? said the Savior, Though ye may obtain the whole. One of Heaven, O Christian Pilgrim, Lift thine eyes, its glories view; Know it is your Father's pleasure To bestow this Kingdom new. Love divine the pathway brightens, Leading to those portals fair; Calls thy soul from earth's attractions To secure an entrance there. Lose thy life, as did the Savior; Follow where his precepts lead, 'Not afar,' but in life's testing His disciple prove indeed. Seek and find, the treasure hidden, Buy the field ! possess the prize. Wisely choose the Heavenly Kingdom,� This thine every need supplies. Trust in God with faith unflinching, Holding ever on thy way. Truth will lead thy soul from darkness To the light of perfect day.
