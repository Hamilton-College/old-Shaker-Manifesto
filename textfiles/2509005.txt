PEACE. By Cora C. Vinneo. Long time ago when life was fresh and new, God sent His waters over all its face And spoke His vengeance from the storm cloud's place. But when the sunlight pierced the darkness thru, His dove of peace o'er hills of billows flew To find sum emblem of His wondrous grace, Sum living thing that helpless man might trace, The promise of His luv and mercy too. So o'er the waves that make our spirits clean, Flies sum dear bird to find a verdant spot, Sum resting place where bitter strivings cease. Oh may it reach a quiet isle serene, Where sin, and care, and trial enter not, And bring from thence the olive branch of peace. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
