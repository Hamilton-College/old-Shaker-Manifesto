Leverrier, the French astronomer, measuring the courses of the planets... 'The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.' Psalm, xiv., 1. Louis Basting. Leverrier, the French astronomer, measuring the courses of the planets, discovered a certain perturbation in their motions which he could not account for. Persisting in his investigations he came to the conclusion that there must be a powerful body in a certain region of the heavens whose attractive force was the cause of the otherwise inexplicable irregularity he had observed. He had not the necessary instruments to verify his conclusions, and therefore wrote to an astronomer at Berlin, asking him to search for an hitherto undiscovered star ; and as a result, within one degree of the spot indicated, Neptune, a planet furthest removed from the sun, was found. Never was true science, based upon deductive philosophy that aims to show the cause of established facts, more triumphantly vindicated. Is there not an equally unerring process of reasoning applicable to the moral and spiritual world whereby the perturbations and irregularities and disturbances of conscious human existence may be explained? When examined into without bias and with a purpose to know the truth regardless of pre-conceived opinions, it will be found that the cause of human misery lies in the tendency to stray outside of the orbit of divine law ordained by God. The modern school of agnosticism is composed of such as are know-nothings by choice and of free-will. They belong to those who prefer darkness rathur than light. Leverrier was convinced of Neptune's existence by no other proof than such as the resources of his mind afforded. What was to him absolute certainty, would have been to others incapable of his comprehensive grasp, but idle speculation. God exists whether I believe in his existence or not. For any one to deny his existence is to assume that he knows more than the vast majority of all ages, who in oue form or another, acknowledged the Supreme Being; or, it is the virtual admission of being of such density of mind that the same evidence which sufficed unnumbered millions is not enough for him. Men may be wicked and depraved from one cause or another, and still believe in God ; but to deliberately deny his being requires an effort of the mind and a hardening of the heart, and it may be questioned if it is sincere after all for it is unnatural. Some great sorrow or bereavement, some great misfortune or affliction, some crisis in life when the long repressed depths of emotion are broken up and the utter helplessness of human nature becomes apparent will cause the soul instinctively to cry to God for that aid without which it is impossible to bear the burden and live. Yes, it is suffering that brings us home to God. Queen Louise of Prussia, fleeing from the capitol before the usurper, accompanied by her children, (one of whom was lately laid to the tomb as the greatest monarch of Europe) stopping at a wretched house by the wayside, wrote with a diamond ring upon a windowpane : Who ne'er his bread with tears did eat, Who ne'er in nights of deepest sorrow Upon his lonely bed sat weepingï¿½ He knows you not, ye heavenly powers. It is not the thoughtless children of ease and of self-indulgence, the vain butterflies of pleasure and fashion, nor the learned, the great and powerful of this world who know God best; but they who have passed through deep tribulation and have become purified through suffering can speak with confidence of God in whose sheltering arms they have found peace and rest.
