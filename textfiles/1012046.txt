O, make thy life all pure and true... 0, make thy life all pure and true, Fill it with deeds of high endeavor, Be brave to dare, be strong to do That which thy God approveth ever. Let patience, gentleness and love, Crown e'en thy name with thoughts of sweetness. So shalt thou walk all fears above, Man â€” woman in thy rich completeness.
