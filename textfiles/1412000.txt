AN ANALYSIS OP HUMAN SOCIETY. No. 2. DECLARING THE LAW WHICH CREATES AND SUSTAINS A COMMUNITY HAVING GOODS IN COMMON. The second phase, is .manifested in countries called free; said countries bringing forth millionaires, paupers and criminals. The land�the prime element of existence, being in the hands of a few ; the masses are compelled to submit to the outrage of having no land, and of being servants to those who have. Forced to pay interest on enormous debts which they never contracted, and to support governments instituted to oppress them, and priesthoods for which they have no reverence. The organic law of the Divine order of human society, is love to God supremely, and neighbor more than self� 'in honor preferring one another.' 'Let the greatest be the servant.' This order was represented by the Pentecostal Church ; and is now by the people called ' Shakers. ' With them there is neither millionaire, pauper nor penitentiary ; slave nor dependent and where he who is the greatest is the most of a servant. The mission of Moses was to establish the just order. And to effect that he required that the propensities (which all have in common with the lower animals) should be subject to the following laws. The dietetic, the procreative, the agrarian, the agricultural, the moral, the financial and the Sabbatical�of days, rest to the body. Sabbath of years�rest to the land and a cancelling of debts; and every fiftieth year, all who had lost their land took possession of it again. These laws Avere more sweeping in their practical operation | than most are aware of. ? The nations and civilizations of antiquity fell in consequence of the unrestrained action of the propensities. Modern civilizations are taking the same course. It is righteousness alone that exalteth and giveth permanency to nations. The mission of Jesus was to begin on earth the Divine order in human society, as was manifested in the Pentecostal Church, and now in that of the Shakers. The Divine faculties were and are called into action, and the propensities excluded. The results were, and are, a virgin life and a community of all good things. If communities, having goods in common, based on the total exclusion of^ the action of the propensities, exists in our day, the cause must be referred to the divine element in man being quickened. Having classified society according to the organic law of each, and defined the phases thereof, I will now proceed to analyze society, and again inquire, First, what are the primary atoms of human society? Man and woman are the primary atoms of human society. Second, what are the forces of these atoms as regards the formation of society? Their most potent inherent force is an affinity to unite and form matrimonial relationships. This force may be called the animal force, for all animals in common with man are its subjects. They all marry as does man. Third, the above force is the objective, but what are the inhering forces oj each atom? The inhering forces in each are dual, one is represented by animal emotions, the other by divine emotions�benevolence, goodness. There is also a neutral force, the intellect, it is not emotional ; it is a servant to either force. These forces are the magazines of human power. Fourth, what are the products of the action of the objective force ? The product of the action of these atoms is the Adamic community, consisting of father, mother, and their children. When the offi-hoots have matured, they fly off to fulfill their destiny, as their parents have done. Here we find, first, a force to form a community ; second, a force to disintegrate the same. And again, a third force, repelling any coalescence with every other such community. Hence family distinctiveness. Having arrived at a knowledge of the forces which create the family relationship, limit its extent and maintain its distiuctiveness, we become possessed of a base of operations, to weigh and measure what they are able to do, and what they are not able to effect. The forces of the physical world are, to some extent, controlled and modified Yy man, but he cannot change them essentially ; whatever form they may assume under his hand, they continue to bear a strict relation to their primary forces. So man or woman, on the Adamic plane or sphere, can be trained, till a great change in the common acceptation of th* term has taken place. But, on examination, they are essentially the same, and bear a strict and true relation to the above forces, and to the sphere thereof. And any attempts of the subjects of said sphere, to raise themselves out of, and beyond the power of the forces thereof, by the aid of said forces, must prove a nullity. Hence the formation of communities, embracing a number of families, recognizing the forces alluded to, have all died out, or merely linger along. And so long as the primal forces remain intact, the same results will attend any attempt to establish communities having goods in common. First, because families do not coalesce. Second, communities having goods in common, do not admit of a plurality of centers of affection. And third, utterly reject the distinctive element. Therefore, Adamic families are incapable of forming communities having goods in common, being under the power of the forces of animal emotional life, represented by the propensities. Said forces and propensities being incapable of manifesting divine emotional life�incapable of forming a universal brotherhood, having one center of affection�God. Seeing that there is not a kingdom recognized on earth, where the Divine emotional force predominates, and has taken the mental force and subdued the animal in man and brought forth an order of society, with law, order, and a civilization corresponding thereto, perhaps we may find a single individual who may have focalized in himself such a kingdom. On looking over the past, we find one individual who states 'That his kingdom is not of this world, and that his subjects will not fight. ' Here are encouraging indications. ' But what are the forces by which this Nazarene purposeth to create and vitalize his kingdom? He says, ' Call no man on earth father. ' Here he abrogates the order of the earthly father�the husband, and of course the wife�the mother. Indeed, as far as his kingdom is concerned, the whole procreative order. And the reason is, ' For one is your father, even He who is in Heaven '�one center of affection�God. And in his own life, Jesus on this point, gave a practical example (see New Testament) and eaii'l, ' Those who do the will of my Father who is in Heaven, the same (all humanity in that state) is my mother, sister^ and brother.' Here is a new relationship. His Father is in Heaven�in a heavenly sphere ; and those who do the will of his Father�whose every word and act are in harmony with the Father^ are also of that sphere, whether they be in a mortal body or not. Here we find that love to God is the vitalizing element, or creative force of Christ's kingdom. And love to those brought forth by that force, brings forth a universal brotherhood�the Divine order of human society. Such a kingdom will not be of the world, neither will its government stand in physical power, nor operate by force after the manner of the kingdoms of the animal man. The germ of the Adamic family is very limited in its unfolding^. The germ�love to God, in its unfoldings embraces all humanity. And the voice of that unfolding, is ever, u Whosoever will let him come' and inherit the Divine life and the true and good flowing therefrom. Where the life and love of God is shed abroad in human spirits, there is no need to manufacture a community having goods in common ; it springs up of itself, and is the result of the internal forces of divine relationships. Here we find focalized in Christ, first, a force to create a universal brotherhood; second, a force to destroy-the organiz'ng affinities of the Adamic relationships. Wherever two or three are gathered together in the power of these superior forces, there will be law and government, and an ultimate civili- nation that eye hath not seen nor ear Beard, neither hath it entered the heart of the Adamic man to conceive of. In conclusion, the Divine�the Shaker Order of human society, and the Adamic, will run parallel through the ages. The latter is the boyhood, the former the true manhood of the race. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
