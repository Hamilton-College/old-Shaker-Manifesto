NOTHING NEW. CATHARINE ALLEN. How can I write, or think a new thought? Several thousand years ago, the wise man of the East, declared there was nothing new under the sun. History, and its recorders repeat the fact; and nature, the oldest, and truest of all teachers, bears its truth through all her treasured volumes. Even the fresh bright robes of Spring, are woven of fabric as old as Eternity ! The same water that supplied rivers andjoceans in ages past, and then blest the earth, descending in gentle showers, or in copious rain-falls, or bursting forth in bubbling springs from her deep boscm, has continued to bless the earth and the inhabitants thereof ever since : it may have formed many new channels, but the material is the same. Activity has kept it pure, and it comes to us ever as a new gift. Each individual inherits the germ of every faculty possessed by uny of the human race, and these must be developed in all by the same changeless laws of progress. The inventor, thinking he has something new in the art of mechanics, seldom offers the product of his toil to the public, but A, B, and C, coming in from different sections, are ready to bring forth similar improvements, attesting that the idea was first theirs ; and history bears record of ancient nations where the same principles had been in service in far superior development, for centuries previous. Excavations in our own New Country so called, bring to light ruins of cities and peoples long since extinct, and bear undeniable evidence of high civilization, and traces of arts and sciences there buried, which have not as yet been re-discovered by the now existing races. And what of literary and spiritual attainment? It has been said that 'a new verse in literature, is as rare as the appearance of a new star in the constellations of heaven,''ï¿½and it must be apparent to any acquainted with ancient writings, that the product of mind to- day. only reflects the light that illumed the pages of the past. The poets of the present, reverberate the strains of lofty thought that pulsed the minds and hearts of bards in ancient time. Media of long ago, beheld glimpses, and were gifted in prophecy of that Millennial Day that has so gloiuously dawned upon our souls, and for whose blessed increase, the Saviors now risen on Mt. Zion, are toiling. Many beautiful chapters in our own Bible, and in the sacred writings of other nations, although written in different periods, and in tongues unknown to each other, prove the unity and antiqui ty of Truth, and how actively it circulates through the universe of Soul, vitalizing and supplying the elements of growth, to the immortal part, as do the pure waters that intersect the land, giving fertility and life thereto. Again, in studying the personal history of individuals in whom the earthly life has been supplanted by the development of the higher, angelic part; wheth- | er this growth has been attained by souls struggling in isolated conditions, or in community relations, as did the Essenes, and those of the Pentecostal church, or within the cloistered walls of monasteries and nunneries, or even in the more advanced relations of the Shaker Order, we cannot fail to observe the simularity of spiritual experience, and the fact that one common cross, and the same rugged highway awaits every one who would reach the celestial heights of conquered self-hood. This echoing of the past, must ever continue ; no one can hope for a new thought, or experience, until having advanced beyond that which has been attained by any predecessor, and even ( then it will only be shadowed from intelligences still beyond, in higher spiritual spheres, for God alters not. and human nature remains the same from age to age. But the mind is a germ of God, it is endowed with the capacity of limitless unfoldment and expansion, and religion, the vitalizing principle of the soul ever operates to refine, elevate, and liberate it from the chains of error and death. It is this, that prompts the deep yearning and ceaseless struggling of the spirit to reach the divinity which gave it birth, where aspirations mingle with inspirations from the deep springs of Truth, whose waters impart new life eternally. Thus truth, although the most ancient, and all comprehending reality, is also the newest because it is the force of activity that keeps all things within its power, ever new. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
