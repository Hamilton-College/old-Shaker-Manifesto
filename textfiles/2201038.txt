THE 'LANDING.' 'Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.'—John, xv., 14. Canterbury, N. H. Andante. I shall meet the brave souls at the 'Landing,' When shore unto shore shall respond; Where kindred and guardians are joyful, To widen the spiritual bond. I shall meet them as friends of the Saviour, Who vict'ry in earth-life have found; Where he triumphed they also had conquest— Together they reign, and are crowned.
