Shaker Station, Conn. North Family. July, 1897. Beloved Editor;�We contribute a few lines to The Manifesto and thus add to Home interest we trust. We are enjoying one of the best of God's blessings� good health. The Brethren are having great success on the farm. Not because of the great numbers toiling thereon, but because God is in the midst of those who serve Him faithfully, and whose interests and loves are universal; no one claiming aught as mine or thine. Jesus said, 'Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.' Showing we can not love and serve God unless we love and serve one another. We have taken advantage of the pleasant Sabbaths, and held our morning religious services at the Church. In the afternoon they meet with us for Singing. We enjoy this interchange very much. Our dear Father, Gilbert Avery is enthused with the vegetarian principle and says he is going to be a vegetarian the rest of his life. If he at the advanced age of eighty-nine years can change his diet, should those who are younger think it such a task? The Brethren are drawing coal for winter use. The haying is already commenced. The cherries are almost all gathered. Through the liberality of our friends at the Church we have enjoyed quite a feast of strawberries; another year we hope to have some from our own garden. The peaches are fast ripening. The Sisters are painting and improving all that needs this attention round about home. We hope Elder Andrew Barrett will continue to keep us informed through the Home Notes as to the progress they are making in Florida, as we are much interested that they prosper. Love to all our gospel kindred. Edith E. Shufelt.
