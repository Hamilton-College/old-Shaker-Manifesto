PUREST BLESSING Canterbury, N. H. 1. Shun the thorn and grow the flower, Speak no sentiment unkind; 2. Let thy deeds like sunlight falling Where the shadows often stray, 3. Best, amid the pearls that glitter, In the victor's diadem, Let thy life like balmy showers, Give sweet fragrance to the mind. And thy voice in loving accents Cheer the weary o'er life's way! Is the one of purest water-----Love—the brilliant, sparkling gem! For with We are This the days so swiftly passing, Friends may go and come no more; all so prone to error, Gifts of love and gospel care halo of our Savior, This the glory of his strife, Let them bear thy purest blessing,—Giving but refills thy store. Are the sweetest joys that mingle With our battle and our prayer. Let us weave its radiant brightness In the fabric of our life.
