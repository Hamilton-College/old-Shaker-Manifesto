ECONOMY. [Contributed by M. Witham.] Economy is the true source of independence and thrift. This is the hard lesson for our people to learn. The easiest and best way to accumulate is to stop expenditures. Learn to do without many things which you have heretofore regarded as necessaries. Particularly never live beyond your income. Live now so that if a better time comes in the future, you will at least be even and ready to enjoy it. If you draw upon that better time in advance, you take away the pleasure it would bring and cloud both the present and future. He only is free who has learned to live within his income. Golden, Rule.
