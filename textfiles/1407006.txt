Every effort toward sustaining or disseminating the truths of Christianity... ELMIRA HILLSGROVE. Every effort toward sustaining or disseminating the truths of Christianity, brings the blessing down in greater or less degree upon its subjects. We may not be able to do great deeds of goodness, yet many little deeds, like grains of sand or drops of water, make the mountain of God's Holiness, and the boundless oceati of his mercy. Inasmuch as we arc steadfast in obedience to our understanding of God's work, manifesting by a living example its efficacy, thus leading others to enquire of the doctrine, are we not working for Christ's kingdom? When we can lead another soul from darkness to light, by forgiving seventy times seven, in one day and cheerfnlly working on and with them unto final resurrection in good works, are we not doing for Christ through one of his little ones? 'Whosoever shall give a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. ' Cold water has its peculiar refreshing qualities, and is, perhaps, as simple an offering as could be bestowed. Our Savior used it symbolically to show that small gifts and sacrifices are acceptable, when they are all we are capacitated to do or give. The widow's mite wrought the greatest blessing to the giver, of all who put into the treasury of the Lord at that time ; because cheerfully given though it was her all,�her whole living. Even so is our all without reserve asked of us, in sacrifice,�the daily surrender of selfish loves and appetites. while we bestow the kind word, look or deed which shall be as cups of blessing to the poor whom we have always with us.
