Narcoossee, Fla. Oct. 1897. 'With all thy gettings get understanding.' It is very evident that there is no liberty, only in the spirit of truth, and when the soul has that in possession and is grounded immovably, it realizes a liberty in its manifestations that is not obtained elsewhere. Unless God build the city they who labor,labor in vain. In union with our parent Society we are striving to build up our little branch. If we have truth for the basis of our structure we shall succeed. We expect trials on our march through life, and the only way to meet them is with an unflinching purpose. During September we had frequent showers, and on the 20th we had a great down pour,eight inches in 24 hours. The rain did much damage. The land in Florida is so porous that after a heavy shower, we can again begin to plough, in about ten hours. Commercial fertilizers are of little value on pine lands, until they have been fertilized by the cattle. Our pinery has been enlarged. The Sisters are engaged in the raising of tomatoes and have over 200 plants set. Our cassava which stands some six feet high, is about ready to dig. This is a root that will be greatly prized in Florida for its amount of starch and as food for the table. Andrew Barrett.
