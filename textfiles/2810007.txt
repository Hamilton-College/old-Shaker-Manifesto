Shakers, N. Y. Sept. 1898. We have had another proof of the truth of the ancient proverb thaf'allgood comes THE MANIFESTO. 157 to those who wait.' We have anticipated and hoped that the Editor of our Manifesto would find time to give us a call, and we almost concluded that we were hoping against hope, when his benign presence appeared in our midst. We were thankful for the short period of social communion that we enjoyed with him and will hope that sometime in the not distant future it may be repeated. The quickening of the moral and spiritual sensibilities of the nations as manifested in the proposal of the Autocrat of Russia to call an International Conference to consider the question of the disarmament of the nations, is evidence that the brutal system which has literally made bondslaves of all races has seen the hand writing on the wall, and is realizing the fact that its days are numbered. We will pray and will work to hasten the consummation of that time 'When the war drum throbs no longer And the battle flags are furled, In the parliament of man The federation of the world.' September has heralded its advent with a tropical climate. Up to the present date of writing, the 5th inst., the thermometer has daily registered in the nineties. But we enjoy the antumnal season when the result of the anxiety and toil in producing fruits and vegetables is realized. Hamilton JDeGraw.
