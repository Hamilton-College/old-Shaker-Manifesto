Work Cheerily, Boys From the Ohio Farmer Do your work bravely and cheerily, boys, Whatever the duty may be; Work thoroughly done, without bluster or noise, Is the kind that's delightful to see. Then rouse in the morning with never a plea For 'a few minutes longer' in bed; But up! like the wide awake boys you should be, With so many pets to be fed. Your chickens have called you, and called you in vain To come with their oats and their corn; And the roosters proclaimed in their cheeriest strain That their breakfast time comes with the morn. And the little white rabbits with tender pink eyes Look timidly out from their nest : I know they are watching for two little boys To bring them what rabbits love best. Then up and be stirring! I care not how much You whistle and sing at your work: If you throw your good-will into all that you touch, You will never be tempted to 'shirk.' So whatever you do, boys, though hard it may be, Do it cheerily, bravely and well; Then you will be boys most delightful to see, And men who will make their deeds tell!
