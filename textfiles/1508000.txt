Testimony of Eld. John Parrington. In consequence of an extraordinary revival of religion which took place at New Lebanon in the summer of 1779, and extended through the neighboring towns, I was brought into a deep labor of mind concerning my own salvation. In this revival I diligently attended the meetings, and was much engaged in religious exercises, by which I was greatly awakened to pray earnestly to God for deliverance from sin and from the nature of evil; but no deliverance could I find. I closely observed the operations of this revival; but could not find that it wrought any abiding effect upon its subjects. I therefore diligently searched the scriptures, prayed to God, and confessed my sins to Him alone in secret places. But all this produced no abiding comfort; for I found that in all my labors and struggles I could not obtain any victory over sin ; nor could I see any among the subjects of the revival that appeared in any better situation, as t� religion, than myself. Notwithstanding all my experience in the illuminations of the Divine Spirit, and all the flattering encouragements of many old professors, who earnestly endeavored to persuade me that I was a Christian and an heir of salvation, my feelings were not satisfied. I felt myself unworthy of the name of a Christian, and had no confidence in making a public profession of religion, unless I could live according to my profession; and therefore determined not to name the name of Christ, till I could depart from iniquity, nor call myself a Christian without being convinced that I was such in reality. (See 2 Tim. ii., 19.) In the spring of the year 1780, I received intelligence of a singular sect of Christians who had come from England, and lived somewhere above Albany, and who excited much attention on account of the singularity of their religion and the remarkable power and operations which attended it. This intelligence made me very anxious to see the people for my own satisfaction, feeling myself fully prepared by my late experience and my knowledge of the scriptures, to receive an understanding, and to judge of the virtue and efficacy of their religion. In agreement with my parents I went to see them, (being then in tke 20th year of my age,) and was among the first in this country who visited these remarkable strangers. I found them indeed a very singular people ; and after critical enquiry and careful observation, I had evidence sufficient to satisfy me that they possessed the power of God beyond any other people I had ever seen. Instead of asking me to tell my religious experience, and inviting me to join the church, as my former teachers had done, Mother Ann Lee, the leader of this little community, taught me the necessity of confessing my sins in the presence of God's witnesses, and showed me the propriety of bringing my deeds to the light, and of being joined to the Lord in one spirit, according to the scriptures. I saw and acknowledged this to be right. I tarried several days, and saw with much admiration the wonderful displays of Divine Power among these people. When I was about to take my leave of them to return home, Mother Ann told me I might open my mind and confess my sins, if I was so minded, before I returned home. I said I believed it to be right to confess my sins ; but I had thought to return home and labor to get a deeper sense of sin, and try to mend my life a little. Mother replied, 'That is very good ; but you can gain a deeper sense of sin after you have confessed them, as well as before, and be better able to mend your life. ' Being fully convinced by what I had heard and seen, that this was the real requirement of God, I undertook it, and made as honest a confession as I was able at that time. After I had got through, Mother said, ' You have done very well so far ; but you have not confessed all.' She then told me of a number of secret sins that I had committed, which I had not recollected, and which I well knew was before unknown to any living mortal but myself: and I was fully convinced that she could not have known these things but by the revelation of God. I therefore felt able to return home and say as the woman of Samaria did of Jesus Christ, / have seen a ivoman who ivas able to tell me all that 1 ever did in my life. Here I received that holy unction from Christ, through Mother Ann, that fully enabled me to cease from sin. Here I found boldness and confidence before Grod and all men, and felt my adoption into the family of Christ, and among the sons of God. Here I found an entrance into the pure and peaceable Kingdom of Christ, and felt my soul united to the invisible, heavenly host, and filled with the quickening power of God, which gave me strength to resist all evil, and to keep every sinful propensity in subjection to the law of Christ. And I felt a full assurance that by continuing in obedience to the testimony I had then embraced, I should gain a complete dominion over the powers of darkness, and reign triumphant with Christ, in purity and holiness. In this I have not been deceived ; for I have found my faith fully verified. Indeed it is impossible it should be otherwise ; for the testimony that I received, and with which I united, was like a two edged sword against all ungodliness and every appearance of evil; therefore all who are obedient to it, must certainly be saved from all ungodliness. This grace I have obtained, and this power I have received through the special ministration of Mother Ann Lee, whose piercing testimony awakened the inmost feelings of my soul, and roused the sleeping faculties of my mind, which had long been bound in nature's darkness. Thus did my soul receive a special manifestation of the healing power of God, as really as the impotent man at the Beautiful gate of the temple received the miraculous cure from Peter and John. (See Acts iii.) And here I would ask all candid people, By what authority and power did Peter and John heal the lame man's infirmity? Did they communicate that which they did not possess? Peter testified that God had glorified his son Jesus ; and through faith ia this same Jesus whom they had crucified, was this man healed. Even so I can testify before all men, that it was through faith in Mother Ann, whom God raised up and endowed with the spirit of Christ, that I was healed of the infirmities of my spirit; even through Christ manifested in that woman, who was shamefully persecuted, abused and slandered by a lawless and wicked generation; because she zealously maintained the principles of purity and holiness, and boldly testified, by precept and example, against all the abominations of the wicked. It must appear evident to every reasonable mind, that had she not possessed the spirit and power of Christ, she could not have communicated it to others. And had she been laden with iniquity, and fraught with evil and unclean spirits, as many have asserted, she could not have purged those things from other souls. Christ did not cast out devils by Beelzebub, and no one else could ever do it. The nature of evil and all evil deeds are directly opposed to godliness, and if ever subdued and purged out of a soul, it must be done by the spirit and power of goodness, or it never can be done at all. And had not Mother Ann brought forth the genuine fruits of righteousness in her own life and example, she never could have wrought in souls such conviction of sin, and turned so many from the ways of iniquity into the pure paths of peace and righteousness, as she has done; and that this was truly the fruit of her labors, many living witnesses can testify from their own personal knowledge and experience. Now let the candid among mankind judge and compare evidences ; let them contrast the accusations against her with her uniform testimony and doctrine. Her worst enemies cannot deny that her testimony was a &gt; opposite to every evil of which she is accused, as fire is opposite to water. Can any man or woman of common sense suppose that thousands of rational beings, born in a land of ]iberty and civilization, and brought up in the midst of moral and religious principles and instructions, and in the pursuit of a pure and undefiled religion, and who possessed all the propensities of human nature common to other people, would deny themselves of all worldly pleasures and enjoyments, and subject themselves to the dictates of a woman of base character, who lived in direct opposition to those principles which she daily preached to others ? Or are the people called Shakers such dupes to folly and fanaticism that they will constrain themselves against every dictate of reason and common sense and in violation of every feeling of nature, to maintain for such a long period of time, the principles of a fanatical female whose life and example contradicted her own testimony ? I was well acquainted with Mother Ann, and had many opportunities with her during her ministration in this country. Being a free man, and feeling a powerful religious attachment to her and the Elders with her, I embraced every suitable opportunity to visit them, and be in their company at the different places where they ministered the gospel. I often visited them at Watervliet, and was with them in prison at Albany�I was with them at Harvard, Shirley, Woburn, Ashfield, Richmond and Hancock, in Massachusetts, at Enfield in Connecticut, and here at New Lebanon : I have seen and heard them in many meetings, and was well knowing to their deportment in public and private, and was well acquainted with their manners at home and abroad, and therefore feel fully able to give a true statement of their lives and characters. And I feel it justly my duty to contradict the false reports which have been spread abroad by the tongue of slander concerning them : for in all my acquaintance with them, I have ever observed the same uniform example of temperance, chastity, righteousness, and every gospel virtue. Their lives and characters were in strict conformity to the doctrine and example oi Christ; and they constantly taught the same to others. Although many malicious and abusive charges have been published abroad in the world, for the purpose of criminating the character of this Society and its first iounders ; yet all that can be said in the spirit of slander, is unworthy of the credit or attention of any rational person. Those who have little or no acquaintance with the Society, are not qualified to give any correct information concerning it. And as to those who have apostatized from us, they condemn themselves by violating their own faith and consciences ; and to them the words of the beloved apostle will justly apply : 'They went out from us, but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.' (See 1 John ii., 19.) Many such unfaithful members have vainly pretended to hold relation for a season; but their ungodliness has justly brought them under reproof; and instead of reforming, they have thereby taken occasion to indulge themselves in resentment and falsehood, and to deny the faith which they had once embraced, and become as traitors to those who honestly maintain the cross of Christ. Such apostates have often palmed upon the Society and its leaders the crimes which they themselves had committed, while pretending to hold relation with us. Mother Ann was ever faithful in good works, she often deprived herself of comforts, that she might be able to comfort others. She spared not her strength nor her life in promoting the cause of God, in strengthening the feeble, comforting the afflicted, reproving the careless, correcting disorders, purging out sin, and zealously striving, at all times, to build up righteousness and peace in all who embraced her testimony. I bless the God of Heaven that I have lived to see the fulfillment of those blessed promises, given us by the faithful messengers of truth, who first administered the gospel to us, 'That if we would yield a faithful obedience to the law of Christ, now made manifest, we should be blessed in our outgoings and incomings�in our basket and in our store ; and above all that we should enjoy the blessings of peace and salvation, which Christ had promised to the faithful. ' As the fruits of their precepts and examples of industry, neatness, prudence, temperance and godliness, I have seen a Society of people spring up, and grow and increase in order, beauty and harmony, till they are, in my view, the glory of the earth�a city of refuge, a shining light to the nations. On the other hand, I have seen the false accuser, the vile slanderer and proud persecutor, who gladly would have trampled under foot the meek and lowly followers of Christ, either left to become a shame and a reproach to civil society, outcasts among men and vagabonds in the earth ; or if their rank and standing in society has preserved them from these disgraces, they have not escaped the stains of dishonor, nor the stings of a guilty conscience. Numbers have lingered out their days under evident guilt and condemnation, and left this mortal stage with '' a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation,' knowing that the day of reckoning must come. Knowing and feeling a sense of these things, and standing in the fear of God, I solemnly warn all to be careful that they touch not the Lord's anointed, and do his people no harm. Kemember the counsel of Gamaliel to the Jewish high priest and his council: '' Refrain from these men and let them alone: for if this counsel or this wTork be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.
