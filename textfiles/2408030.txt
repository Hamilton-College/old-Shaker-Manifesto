Cosmopolitan WHAT IS BEAUTY! QUESTION OF A BUND MAN!' Replied Aristotle. But Mrs. Sherwood says that it is 'dynamite' in her article which opens the interesting pages of the July Cosmopolitan. Beauty is always a fascinating subject, and Mrs. Sherwfflod's discussion is an especially interesting one. That the July Cosmopolitan is a midsummer number is shown in many directions. Three short stories, including one of sport and adventure, two travel articles, and other light matter, make up 128 pages of charming reading. The July Cosmopolitan marks the close of the first year since the revolutionary announcement was made that the price of that magazine, already low, had been cut to onehalf of three dollars a year. All sorts of predictions have come to be unfulfilled during the yearit would be impossible to maintain the ratethe quality would be loweredthe size would be decreased. But even severe critics admit that with each succeeding number there has been a betterment in the quality of articles and illustrations, and the size has remained unchanged, except the always growing advertising pages. The magazine printed, for the six months embraced in Volume xvi, one million four hundred and nineteen thousand copies, an entirely unapproached record, and has doubled its already large plant of presses and binding machinery. The walls of the magazine's new home are rapidly rising at Irving-on-the-Hudson. Artistically designed by McKim. Mead &amp; White, the new building, with its eight porticos, will be 279 feet long by 79 feet wide, and one of the most perfectly lighted buildings in the world, having 160 large windows each nearly double the size of the ordinary window opening.
