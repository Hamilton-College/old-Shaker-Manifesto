Watervliet, Ohio Dec. 1897. The summer is past with all its beauty, and the falling leaves remind us that winter is drawing near, and that we must be prepared. We are trying to carry out the principle of godliness in our home. As cleanliness is next to godliness, we have been putting our home in order. A new coat of paint on our kitchen and dining-rooms will add much to the pleasantness of these places. We have also removed some old buildings that were not in use. We have been blest with an abundant hay crop and the late rains have brought forward our wheat crop, so that we have great reason to be thankful. The interest on good roads has given us employment for several weeks and as it was by order of the County, it proved to us a double blessing. The cutting down of some old trees near the buildings has been to the village, a decided improvement. Spiritually, let us strive to lead a pure and holy life; forgetting the past, let our lives be in peace and harmony. 'Let us not be weary in well doing, for in due time we shall reap if we faint not.' Have thankfulness for our present home, however small our inheritance on the earth. If faithful we shall realize more than the poet's dream and more than the prophet's expectation. These are my expressions of love and gratitude to God, and may The Manifesto spread the glad tidings of truth, throughout the whole earth. John Westwood
