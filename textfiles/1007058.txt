THE MODERN CHURCH'S INVITATION. Come hither sinners for advice. Not, however, without price, We need you if you are well heeled To labor in our harvest field. But if you have an empty purse And are not able to disburse, We do not want vou in our fold-The only key to which is gold. Don't tell us of the Lord's reply When the rich man did apply, That he must sell all that he had So that the naked might be clad. Our Saviour's was a different case, He needed no costly meeting place, For His poor and simple band Needed no churches large and grand. But how shall our temples rise Until their steeples reach the skies? To build them needs wealth untold, So if you join you mnst have gold. According to your worth in gold Shall be your welcome to our fold, If you your thousands count by tens Most hearty shall be our amens. But if you are poor we'll pass you by, Our motto, 'no poor man need apply,' We've nothing further now to say Only, that for you we shall pray.
