Shaker Station, Ct. Jan. 1895. How comforting is the thought that salvation is free to all who work for it. 'Work out your own salvation.' It requires the crucifixion of all sinful elements to be a true cross-bearer. Cross-bearing insures eternal life. First the cross, then the crown. 'If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me,' said Jesus. The injunction is plain, and how pleasing it THE MANIFES TO. 43 should be when we know that self-denial will yield happiness and heaven. Denying self is a Christian duty. How sweet are the hours we spend in God's service. We can not do too much for the cause of truth and virtue, though we toil incessantly. One virtuous person may turn many others heavenward. There is no safety in sin. As we go through each day, let us think of coming days, and make provision foi their trials, crosses and duties, by doing our very best work at character building. 'Dimensions of Westminster clock, London. Diameter of dials, 22 ft. The minute hand is 16 ft. long, the hour hand 9 ft. and both weigh 200 pounds. Length of pendulum 15 ft; weight 680 lbs.' 'Diameter of the dial of the clock in the new city hall, Philadelphia, 27 ft. 'The largest hanging bell in the world is in China. It is 18 ft. high and 45 ft. in circumference and is of solid bronze.' Daniel Orautt. South Family. Jan. 1895. Once more we are on the verge of a new year with its hopes, and aspirations. The one that has so quickly passed has been crowned with blessing, peace, and plenty, and we would render thanks for the mercies bestowed upon us by the bountiful Giver of all good. Christmas was made a joyful occasion. A general invitation was extended by the Church Elders to all of the Society, to spend the day with them, which was accepted. A very impressive Service was held. It was truly commemorative of the life Christ taught and lived, while on earth. May it prove a profitable season to those present. At 12 o'clock we were invited to a sumptuous repast of which we partook with thankful hearts, not unmindful of those whose lives were full of want and poverty. At 2 p. m. we all convened in the dining hall to listen to music, and to the speaking of pieces taken from Scripture, also reading from the older class, for all took some part, which made the occasion very interesting and useful. At the close of the entertainment presents were distributed from a heavily laden Christmas tree which stood waiting to furnish many valuable and useful gifts; all were remembered. A lunch was served and at 5 o'clock we returned to our homes made happier and wiser for the Christmas of 1894, and also with many thanks to those who contributed to our comfort and pleasure. Sleighing is very good, with the prospect of more snow. On the 3rd inst. a party of ten went on a sleigh-ride, and returned reporting a very pleasant time at Broad Brook, Ellington and Rockville. Chopping in the woods gives employment at present to the farmers, also the preparing of corn fodder by machinery. Our stock are thriving well by their good care, as the abundant supply of cream from twenty cows proves the value of sparing no pains for their comfort, and keeping everything in order; 3,500 spaces of cream in October; 3,465 in December; so it goes care, care! The ice harvest commences on the 7th inst. under favorable circumstances, as we have snow for sledding. Improved machinery aids in getting ice; we put up about 209 tons as easily as we formerly put up 50 tons. At present, ice is a necessity for the dairy and the refrigerator; but we believe electricity will make us independent of ice in a few years; it is in the air, that creamers and coolingrooms, will be refrigerated by machinery.
