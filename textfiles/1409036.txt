SUNSHINY ROOMS. We have heretofore spoken ot the great importance of pure sunshine. No article of furniture that will not stand sunlight should be put in a room, for every room in a dwelling should have the windows so arranged that some time during the day a flood of sunlight will force itself into the apartment. Never mind the fading carpets. Better lose the color of the caipets than the color of the cheeks. The importance of admitting the light of the sun freely to all parts of our dwellings cannot be too highly estimated. Indeed, perfect health is nearly as dependent on pure sunlight as it is on pure air. A sun bath is of more importance in preserving a healthful condition of the body than is generally understood. It costs nothing, and that is a misfortune, for people are deluded with the idea that those things only can be good or useful which cost money. But remember that pure water, fresh air, and sunlit homes, kept free from dampness, will secure you frorn many heavy bills of the doctors, and give you health and vigor which no money can procure. It is a well-established fact that people who live much in the sun are usually stronger and more healthy than those whose occupations deprive them of sunlight. And certainly there is nothing strange in the result, since the same law applies with equal force to nearly every animate thing in nature. It is quite easy ty arrange an isolated dwelling so that every room in it may be flooded with sunlight some time in the day, and it is possible that many town houses could be so built as to admit more light than they now receive.
