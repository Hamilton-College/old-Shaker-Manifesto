RESPONSIBILITY. ANNIE STEPHENS. There is a moral responsibility resting on each individual to yield obedience to the light of truth that shines in the soul, clearly revealing to the understanding the path of duty and right. It requires a great deal of courage to walk therein ; to do violence to our own self-will, to put away the weaknesses of perverted nature, and conquer the many adversaries of our soul's good. Though the effort and struggle are great, yet the recompense is equal. The consciousness of victories achieved over evil, the glory of living above the sensual, and rising in the pure spiritual realm of ever blessed realities, where angelic motives inspire to noble and unselfish deeds ; truly brings fullness of peace, and a joy, that the votaries of worldly pleasure know not of. How many heroic souls, have sacrificed their physical lives, for the promulgation of great and true principles. How many have sacrificed the preferments of this world, to spread some glorious truth, that God had revealed for the uplifting of humanity. Many have fallen as martyrs in the cause of right, and though they have suffered unto death by the hands of cruel designers, they were as firm in their faith as the rock of Gribralter, knowing that the truth, 'though crushed to earth will rise again' triumphant and glorious. Though there are but few who tread the ascending and rugged paths of duty with unfaltering trust; who listen to the Divine Voice within which ever calls to come up higher ; still the number is increasing, the hearts of humanity are being uplifted to a higher ideal of life ; and to a consciousness, of their responsibilities as immortal beings. Who can deny the fact that the soul lives after its divestment of mortality, and will continue to live through the countless ages of eternity. The grand possibilities of the human soul lie before us, a life of endless unfoldment Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
