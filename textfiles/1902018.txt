WHAT IS THIS WE HEAR? Dr. Carl. The parable of the Sower is given by three of the evangelists, and if we will notice, there is note-worthy difference in the application. Matthew records the exhortation, 'He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.' Mark adds the admoni tion of the Savior. 'Take heed what ye hear.' But in Luke, the what is1 changed to how, and we read, 'Take heed how ye hear.' Bringing these three passages together, we have this as the law in regard to hearing. 1. God having given us faculties to hear and to comprehend the truth, and having sent his messengers as ministers, and we may add, his messenger as the Manifesto, to proclaim it. It is the duty of every one to hear and read when they can. 2. As there are many false teachers, and we may add many false heralds, we must be careful as to the kind of teaching aud reading we seek. Every Believer will have to be on his guard or he will find himself floating off with the tide of the world. It is not enough for him to attend only upon the claims of the preaching and reading of the gospel, he must see to it that it is the true gospel, and as it comes from God he must hear it in the right spirit; not receive the truth into stony ground, or on a heart that is as hard as a beaten path or amid the briers and thorns of worldly care, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the word. There is a great deal said aud written about preaching, and is it not time that we should look at the other side ? It is said that in many cities and towns that the number of church-goers is very small, and that the non-church-goers excuse themselves by saying that the church services do not interest them. But this excuse is of no account. Christ told his disciples to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Paul writes, 'By the foolishness of preaching' (that is by what seems foolishness to the carnal world,) 'ï¿½to save them that believe.' Again he says, 'Faith cometh by hearing,' and 'without faith it is impossible to please God.' We may learn from history that truth and righteousness have extended and triumphed in the world only where the gospel was faithfully preached. But let us go a little farther after the truth. Shall a man quiet his conscience because he may listen to one who claims to be a preacher, though he ignores the great truths of the gospel? Shall he remain with those who deny the divinity of his Lord? Shall he hear those who scoff at the solemn announcement, 'The soul that siuneth, it shall die.' Shall he hear those who prostitute the Sabbath to catch a gaping crowd, who instead of preaching Christ, give a lecture on some political issue of the day? Shall this continue to be the life of the worldly church ? Then there is a greater work for God's people, and if we can see our duty and our work. God will come to our help aud many shall be added to our number, who will help us on the way. If the Master should come into our gathering would not his first and most earnest admonition be, 'Twke heed how you hear?' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
