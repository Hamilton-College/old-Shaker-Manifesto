PITY THE POOR. 0, pity the poor, The starving poor, The poor so thinly clad; For the winds are cold, So piercing cold, They must he suffering and sad. Don't ask if they're ' good, ' Nor say that you ' would, ' If you 'onlyknew who they are; They have their sorrow : No hope of to-morrow,� Give them,�'tis better by far. 0, how they implore, Standing at the door. For only a piece of bread � See how they shiver,� Merciful Giver! They say, ' Mother is dead. ' It may not be true,� No matter to you, They are hungry, cold and sad ; So relieve their wants, I pray you, this once, And make their sorry hearts glad. They were once innocent, But have been missent,�� Perhaps led by want astray; 'Tis hard to be good, Even when you would,� Upon the world, cast away. O, pity the sad, Be kind to the bad,� The beggars that seek your door; Treat them tenderly, Speak to them kindly,� 'Tis not a sin to be poor. Winter grows colder, Hunger grows bolder, And pinches the soul within ; But Charity is mild As a loving child, And softens the heart of sin. All of one Father, Let us say 'Brother, ' For this is right we know; The hungry to feed, And the blind to lead, Thus lighten the pangs of woe. Merciful Father ! Let not our brother Go hungered from door to door; Nor let our sister, With no one to love her, Be cast on the world's rough shore. But let charity seek For all those that weep, From cold, and hunger, and grief; And lay up a store, To last evermore, By giving to want, relief. From The Sunbeam.
