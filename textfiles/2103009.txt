Robert Aitken, My Dear Friend:--I duly received your kind letter... Walmer Road, Birkdale Southport, England, Jan. 9, 1891. Robert Aitken, My Dear Friend :� I duly received your kind letter and Elder Eads' Book, for both I am much obliged. I was afraid from the reports of the storms at the time of your voyage, that you would have a rough passage, and regret to learn that you was so ill. It is pleasant to hear of Mr. Carnegie's kindness to you. He is a good man in spite of his enormous wealth. I am sorry to learn from your letter that the vast growth of material riches in the United States is having the effect of degrading the people. It would seem that too great prosperity is always an evil for nations, be they monarchical or republican. The increase of wealth in individual hands is the curse. What is made by society ought to be enjoyed by society in the highest sense of enjoyment, namely, in the moral and spiritual welfare of community. You and I know that man wants but little food, if that be � obtained from the goodly fruits of the earth. I can live healthfully and happily on a few cents a day. This fact is proof to me that the bounty of God should go to the advancing of our mental and spiritual nature. A rational being does not want more than sustenance. All the surplus of our gifts from nature should be turned to the development of our highest powers. That is to the making here on earth that spiritual existence which most religions defer to the other world. I am quite at one with your Society in believing that the vast spiritual universe is open to those who live purely, holy, and for eternal purposes. I have found much pleasure and instruction in Elder Eads' discourses. He has the true illumination. I should be glad to converse with him for I find in him a brother in the spirit. It has taken me some time (in my busy life) to read his book. You will excuse my delay to reply on that account. I have thought several times of the suggestion made by James Burns of Southampton Row, London, that the Shakers should open up this country. I do not think our people are ready for such a movement. They are too individualistic. They need to be socialized and spiritualized a great deal more before they can appreciate the lofty system under which your Community lives. But of this I am assured, namely, that thousands of our men and women, yearn for the peace and purity and spiritual joy, in which Brethren and Sisters dwell. You alone have tried to make this world with all its lowering tendencies, the fore-court of that heaven of rest, that is believed by the multitude to be impossible of attainment now, and doubtful of attainment even after death. Hence you are the pioneers of the great future of humanity. That Britain should have been the birthplace of Shakerism is profoundly significant and portends, I think, to show that our race is ripening for an incalculable spiritual advancement in the near future. By and by when we have got much preliminary political and religious difficulties out of the way, our people will begin to adopt your principles. As you know, stupendous changes are coming upon the world, and they are purely of a spiritual nature. That means the decay of fleshly appetites of every kind, the exaltation of the permanent in human nature and the down-treading of that which makes us earth-bound and materialistic. I should be obliged to you to receive some work informing me of Ann Lee's prophetic work here and in America, or to know from you where I can obtain them, here. She was the first teacher of the new principles, and it is necessary for me to know what can be learned of her wonderful leadership. I do what I can to forward the good cause of spiritual progress by teaching and study, and your Society has been, and is working in this field. All sorts of agents are needed to hasten the progress of the human family from its present unhappy and bewildered position, to the harmony, peace and fraternity which only an absolutely spiritual conception of our beings can bestow. Civilization will be lost and man again be hurled back into bestiality unless the leaders of spiritual truth do their duty. Now, civilization to me is nothing but the bringing together the dispersed and divided children of men into community. But the unscrupulous reign of the wealth made in society by a few, and their habits of natural pleasures and contempt of the spirit will end in the sanguine downfall of the race for an indefinite period, unless we do our best to teach spirituality. The battle is tremendous between the powers of light and d arkness, and all the social convulsions and religious shocks of the world prove it. 1 hope this long and somewhat vehement letter will not fatigue you, my dear friend. But I write as I wou.ld talk with you, and that is impossible just now. I hope some time to have the happiness of seeing you again either here or at your home. We are, I am sure, kindred spirits, equally desirous of raising our fellow-beings somewhat while it is called to-day, and hoping to do forever. I am yours in love and truth, Garrett Flynt.
