JOY OF LIBERTY. CATHARINE ALLEN. The records of history, which acquaint us with the conflicts between Science and Religion in the past, forcibly remind us of the great cost by which the radiant dower of civil and religious liberty, now bequeathed to us, has been obtained, and causes us to rejoice in that glorious gift of faith, established by divine revelation, and reaching upward to the eternal hills of progression, and in which science with religion peacefully unites in the strength of that immutable law, which links cause with effect, forever. This beautiful faith is, indeed, 'the substance of things hoped for,' the wealth for which the past has toiled. It emancipates us from narrow, dogmatical creeds which cripple the mind, fetter hope, and detain within their prison bars, the soul that yearns for liberty, that longs for the divinity which gave it birth ; and feign would take its flight on aspiration's wings, to find its native element, a home in Truth. This liberty wre may attain, and soar with strength of eagle's wings until we reach that sunny home where God is life, and light. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y..
