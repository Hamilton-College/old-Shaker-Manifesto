The Bible Triumphant The Bible Triumphant, by Elizabeth A. Reed. This book is a reply to a work entitled 'Self-contradiction of the Bible.' 'But the Bible has been overthrown, refuted, demolished and exploded so many times, and the process has required such frequent repetitions that people hesitated about abandoning the old book at the bidding of an anonymous pamphleteer.' One singular feature about the Bible History is that so much reverence should be given to the Book, and then such a hatred manifested by all Christians to God's chosen people who wrote the Book. Published by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
