It is overtaxing parents and friends to ask that they shall supervise work which properly belongs to the duly qualified instructor writes Elisabeth Robinson Scovil in an earnest protest against this growing evil in the April Ladies' Home Journal. Text books and methods change so rapidly that we who finished our school days a score of years ago feel that our powers are altogethe r inadequate to the demands upon them when we are confronted with some knotty point in grammar or a more serious difficulty in mathematics. We can only sigh helplessly over our inability to throw any light on the subject, and feel strongly that it was the duty of the teacher to have explained the problem so as to make it clear to the juvenile understanding.

This book is a reply to a work entitled 'Self-contradiction of the Bible.' 'But the Bible has been overthrown, refuted, demolished and exploded so many times, and the process has required such frequent repetitions that people hesitated about abandoning the old book at the bidding of an anonymous pamphleteer.' One singular feature about the Bible History is that so much reverence should be given to the Book, and then such a hatred manifested by all Christians to God's chosen people who wrote the Book.
