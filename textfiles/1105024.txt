SOWING AND REAPING I saw the farmer toil On rough and rugged soil ; From early morn 'till night, He worked with mind and might. ¦• The year rolled on ; and then I viewed his lands again, 1 found the ground well-tilled, His spacious barns well filled. His was a rich revvai'd; And yet I know, dear Lord, He must have toiled in vain, Without Thy sun and rain. I thought of other soil On which Thy children toil, To root out weeds of sin, And plant Thy grace within. There is a little spot There Thou hast cast my lot; Thou hast consigned to me Young hearts from sorrow free. I've sought by toil and prayer To reap a harvest there; When will that precious field, A plenteous harvest yield ? I've tried to sow Thy truth Through many years of youth; I've marked the tender shoot And hoped for early fruit. But human hearts, we find,' Like mother-earth inclined To nourish thorns and weeds Instead of precious seeds.
