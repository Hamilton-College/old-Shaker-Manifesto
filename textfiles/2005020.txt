Enfield, Conn. 'We feel the balmy breeze of May, Soft blowing down the grassy way.' We should fill the hours with some worthy object in view, for they seem to fly as if on the wings of the wind. Mental, physical and spiritual activity is the source of happiness. Duty is the watchword. Farm and garden work begins to press. A good garden is the gem of the faim. The more it is cultivated the better. We should have good seed to plant. Good seed is the basis of success, and we cannot afford to'j have any but the best. There is more than one way of doing things, and it may be that there is a better one than ours. If so, it is right to learn it. We should aim to make lets acres produce more, and with less work. Wood ashes are excellent for all soils deficient in potash. The difficulty is to get enough of them. No matter about the fine points of hens if the egg basket shows that they are all right. Good care is the best hen-doctor. Put sitting hens in quiet, dark places, away from disturbance. D. Orcutt.
