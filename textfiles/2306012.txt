FAITHFULNESS. J. L. Jones. [Contributed by Sophia Wayne.]God is not wasteful. He poorly apprehends the Divine that regards Him as balancing his books according to some scheme in which the glory or doom of the mortal is determined by some sacrificial, ceremonial or theological entry; a book-keeping in which kindly deeds and cheerful words are not entered. The salvation we should covet is faithfulness. Not the acceptance of a saving scheme proffered from without; but, loyalty to a saving grace springing from within. Not acceptance of popular belief; but, the dispensing of kindness. This salvationwhich comes by fidelity finds its exemplification not simply, or perhaps chiefly, in the muster-roll of our churches, and those whom our preachers class among the 'saved,' but among the uncounted millions of sincere souls that are content to do their daily work faithfully. Carry their nearest duty with patience and thankfully live on the near loves of dear hearts, though they leave no memorial but a world made a little better by their lives. Studying thus we shall find the secret of a salvation that most of the creeds miss. 'What shall I do to gain eternal life?' Discharge aright The simple dues with which each day is rife Yea, with thy might, Ere perfect scheme of action thou devise Will life be fled. While he who ever acts as conscience cries Shall live, though dead. Chicago, III.
