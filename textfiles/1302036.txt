Kind Words for the Year 1882. Shaker Village, N. H. I think the January No. of the Manifesto an improvement on former numbers. The general tone of the paper is good. The printing is nice and on paper good enough for such a work. J. S. Kaime. Enfield, N. H. The March No. is the best this year. A. Perkins. Shakers N. Y. The April Manifesto is the best No. this year. G. B. Avery. Shaker Village, N. H. I think the May No. real good. Mary Whitcher. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. I think the June No. of the Manifesto, aa exceptionally good one. A. G. Hollister. 43
