'TIS VICTORY. Florence A. Staples. The power that yields to death and to defeat, Yields but the conquest to the nobler strife; The force repellant, mightier forces meet, As fast recedes the ebbing tide of life. But, vainly cowering 'neath the sway of doubt We mark as death the power that sets us free, 'Tis but transition unto joys more real, The triumph of immortal life to see. Oh life! thou hero, haloed but with bliss, And lauriate with emblems of thy grace, Thou'st smitten but the transient unto dust, Entombed, the perishing receives its place. While, 'mid the tranquil hush, the calm serene, The spark that knoweth not decaying blight Thy snow plumed pinions bears from earth away, To dwell amid unchanging scenes of light. Why tread this vale as one of doubts and tears? The mead is sure, the recompense is just. O life! thy power calms turbulence and fear, Divines the mission of exalted trust. Thy thrilling touch the latent germs revived, And hope's white blossoms swayed in balmy air; Thy voice, a minstrel inspiration woke, As floats its echoes down the aisles of prayer. Clothed in the majesty of thine alone, In dimless glory shines thy crown of light. The chill damps of the misty tomb, O life, Ne' er touched thy gleaming robes of spotless white. N~o shadows linger e'er to veil or mar Thy radiant form, in symmetry complete, Love, from grief, tears the sable pall of fear, And at thy bidding, casts it at her feet. We view thee as an angel form of light, Enrobed in vestments of immortal bliss, And through the cloud-wreaths, view thee gleaming bright Transfigured in thy perfect loveliness. Conferring but the 'boon, perpetual youth, That knows no blight, no withering or decay; As fresh, as bright, in emerald unfold The buds of spring-tide to the west wind's play. The conflict's ceased, the victory is won, The struggling force with force is done,� 'tis o'er. The spirit greets the cheerful morning light, And of earth's gloom and sorrow, knows no more. For, mounting upward from earth's din and strife, Disrobed but of its brief mortality, Its gladsome song through arched dome portals rung, 'Tis spirit life and breath,�'tis victory! Canaan, N. Y.
