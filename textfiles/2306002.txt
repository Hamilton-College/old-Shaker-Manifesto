PREPARE THY HEART. Lucy S. Bowers. O restless heart, disturbed with anxious care, And torn with winds of worldly strife and woe, [low. Sweet Peace on silver wing is hovering Within thy courts a holy place prepare For her, the subject of thy hope and prayer. Cast out the troubling guests the soul may knowï¿½ Self-will and pride, that wander to and fro Despoilers of the bliss which thou shouldst share. Let in the angels, Truth, and Joy, and Light, Who swell the fullness of sweet harmony, Who guard love's ceaseless fountain pure and bright, They are the ministers of God to thee, Make welcome these, and Peace will find a place, And fill thee with her own abiding grace.
