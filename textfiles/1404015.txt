TRUST. I cannot see, with my small human sight, Why God should lead this way or that for me; I only know He hath said, ' Child, follow me. ' But I can trust. I know not why my path should be at times So straightly hedged, so strangely barred before; I only know God could keep wide the door; But I can only trust. I find no answer; often, when beset With questions fierce and subtle on my way, And often have but strength to faintly pray; But I can trust. I often wonder, as with trembling hand I cast the seed along the furrowed ground, If ripened fruit for God will there be found; But I can trust. I cannot know why suddenly the storm Should rage so fiercely round me in its wrath; But this I know�God watches all my path� And I can trust. I may not draw aside the mystic veil That hides the unknown future from my sight! Nor know if for me waits the dark or light, But I can trust. I have no power to look acrots the tide, To see while here the land beyond the river; But this I know, I shall be God's forever; So I can trust. London Evening Magazine.
