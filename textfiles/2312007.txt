HARMONIZED. Catharine Allen. '�'�Thou canst not see my face and live, for there shall no man see me and live.'1''� Ex. xxxiii., 20. '�'�Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.'�Matt, v., 8. The first text forms part of the answer to the request of Moses that the Lord's presence should go with him and the people, and that the Lord would show him his glory. The Lord promised his presence and verified it in that wonderful manifestation which appeared in the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night to guide the children of Israel, also in many other marked evidences of supernatural power, revealing his mercy and goodness, and desire to grant the request of Moses as far as possible, but at the same time assuring him that he 'could not see his face and live.' So the Lord spake to Moses saying: ' c While my glory passeth by I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand.' Considering the nature of those spiritual forces that were then being manifested in material form, we conclude that this ' 'glory of the face of the Lord' had reference to a special manifestation of that mediating spirit to whom Moses was then trustfully looking, and which on that occasion had gathered to himself a concentration of those forces too intense to behold with unveiled mortal vision. It was probably of an electrical nature, or other elements that would consume, for, previous to this, in the same chapter it is stated that the 'Lord spake unto Moses face to face,' and in another place that:�uGod spake unto Moses from the burning bush,' and warned him not to come too near. In these instances we would understand that their Lord was a ministering spirit of great intluence, and possessed of wonderful power in manipulating those superhuman forces, which are frequently called miracles. Moses evidently possessed unusual power as a medium, and thus for the preservation and guidance of the Hebrews occurred some of the most remarkable exhibitions of spirit power, of which history bears record. In the above text;�'No man shall see me and live,' it seems conclusive that the physical man was referred to. All the teaching and manifestations of that dispensation were of a material nature, concerning the necessities and higher development of the natural man and woman. The Israelites were pre-eminently a figurative people, and like all their types and shadows, this passage has a spiritual significance which perfectly harmonizes with the beatitude ; 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.' We must crucify the carnal life, die to our lower self, then in our inmost thought and feeling we can attain that divine purity in whose light we can see God and abide in his glorious presence. Mt.
