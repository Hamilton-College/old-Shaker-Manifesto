BEYOND THE GATES. LEWIS HORTON. ' The things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are unseen are eternal. ' The beautiful things that are unseen, Robed in a glorious light, Some day will dawn in a golden sheen, And banish our darkest night. No greener fields on the earth are known, Neither fairer skies can be : The stars that shine in our midnight zone Are lamps on an unknown sea. Breezes of heaven blow soft and sweet; Across bright waters of gold, And angelsï¿½anthems of joy repeat The love that never grows cold. Leaves of the trees in emerald green Reach out fair hands to the skies, Rivers of life flow gently between The hills where joy never dies. We see not the flowers fragrant and fair, That grace the land of the blest, Breathe not the fragrance that burdens the Or know of the heavenly rest. [air, Jewels whose wealth can never belong To weary travelers of earth, Shine on the robes of a radiant throng, Treasures of heavenly worth. And stories we know that never were told To a mortals' list'ning ear. Songs that are sung, and never grow old, Gems of the immortal sphere. There music resounds we never have heard, Sweet in melodious song. Joy to the souls of angels conferred, Triumph of right over wrong. [sight Things which we see will pass from our When ' all things new ' are revealed, Life-giving love will lead us aright, When gates of pearl are r.nsealed. The way may be long, the path may be To that rest so kindly prepared, [steep, Courage weary pilgrim, thou surely shalt The harvest so many have shared, [reap Canterbury, N. H.
