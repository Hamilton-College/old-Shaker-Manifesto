What You Can Never Catch â€” Boys and girls, what is it that you can never catch, though you chase after it on the wings of the wind? You can never catch the word that has once gone out of your lips. Once spoken it is out of your reach; do your best, you can never recall it. Therefore take care of what you say. Never speak an unkind word, an impure word, a lying word, a profane word.
