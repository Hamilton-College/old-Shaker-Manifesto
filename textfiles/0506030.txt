THE CROSS MY CHOICE The cross of Jesus I'll bear, I'll bind it near to my heart; His yoke voluntarily wear, And in his service take part. I'll yield up my all unto him, And walk in the straight, narrow way That his shining goal I may win, In regions of eternal day. Earth shall not my progress impede, Nor hinder my journey above; I'll hie me on ever with speed, To that land of light and of love, Where Ann and where Jesus have gone. And all ancient Saints onward press'd; And where, 'mid the glorified throng, Our own spirit kindred are blest. O beautiful home that I see ! I fain would take wings, and away From earth and its shadows to thee â€” To substance that ne'er will decay. Julia Johnson, West Pittsfield, Mass.
