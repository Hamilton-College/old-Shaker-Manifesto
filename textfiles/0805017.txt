SHAKER COURTESY One of the 'true blue,' aged brethren of Mt. Lebanon, made to his kind, young sister in the gospel— Ann Offord—the present of a beautiful box, so ar' ranged internally, as to be a practical present. In re turn, she poured forth her gratitude in poetical song inscribed to her venerable friend. Now, listen to his thoughtful, practical reply : Beloved Sister Ann: Your New Year's salutation is very acceptable. That which comes from the heart, reaches the affections. On this commemorative occasion, I congratulate you, and myself, that we are called MAlKmnESTO. to the practical manifestations of 'Peace on earth, and good-will to all Humanity'—a weighty responsibility—to embody, in ou every day lives, Divine Wisdom and Love The time has fully come for the Law to be written on our affections. Indeed, to be the music of our lives. 'Tis ours, to 'sing the song of 31oses and the Lamb!'—to include in our lives, the harmonies of Natural and Divine Law. While the propagative man and woman shrink from the cross we bear, it is ours to sing of the triumphs, and the glories of the Higher Life. Dearly beloved Sister : Go on your way rejoicing; and when we get through with the fleeting shadows of earthly conditions, may it be said of you, of me, and of the whole household of faith: 'These are they, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.' In gospel love, your aged brother, John Shaw
