Editor of Manifesto, My Dear Friend... South Atiiol, Mass. Editor of IVIanifesto, My Dear Friend :�I have been so exceedingly intensted in the life and doings of Ann Lee, I have road the little book over and over. I am delighted with the Christian experiences noted therein, and now by the kindness of a friend I have had the Manifesto of March and April. 1 am also much taken by some of the plain Christian talks therein printed. I was held to consider the quotation, Gal. v., 24, And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections (margin says passions) and lusts. This has been the experience of such as have been Christ's since that epistle of Paul to the Cralatians, A. D. 58, so that this is no new doctrine, as some claim. 1 have heard much talk about a (or the) resurrection life, while those claiming to live the life, lived in pleasure. In plainer words they rushed from a single, pure life, into marriage, and from all outward appearances became slaves to the flesh. I always doubted their sincerity. Now i read in the Gospel according to Luke chap. 20, beginning with the 33rd verse,� '�The children of this world marry and are given in marriage ; but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage. ****** They are equal unto the angels and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.' Here we have something on which we may rest our faith and hope. Jesus Christ gave us the precept and example nearly nineteen hundred years ago, and all along He has had true followers who delighted to walk even as He walked. Why? Because they loved Him, and while the Shakers may be the first and only Society holding this Christ life up to the world, I have known some cases where married people, in the prime of life, have lived together, where the true light shone on them, b?ing married, and have been as free from the flesh life as are the angels in heaven, fulfilling the injunction at the hand of the beloved Paul: 'Let them that have wives be as though they had none ;' but if there is not union and agreement with husband and wife to Jesus Christ's example, then the next best will follow'. A Society like yours would ba a place of refuge indeed. Did not Jesus Christ himself say 'All men can not receive this saying ;' and then again He said, 'Many are called, but few are chosen.' What was this calling, but the marriage supper? And why not chosen? Because the old garments were not exchanged for the white raiment. I believe in this real li e, walking with Jesus, and to Him be all the praise. 1 am walking in the way, and find it so sweet and satisfactory, so free from the world of trouble. I have my trials and temptations, but there is peace in believing. The spirit says, 'This is the way, walk ye in it,' and the 'spirit and the word agree.' God bless all the dear ones who see the way, and give them confidence to walk in the way that He has cast up in this wilderness of sin, is the prayer of A Believer.
