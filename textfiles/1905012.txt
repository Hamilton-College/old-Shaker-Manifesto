SONG OF THE MYSTIC. Father A. J. Ryan. I walk down the Valley of Silence� Down the dim, voiceless ralley alone! And I hear not the fall of a footstep � Around me save God's and my own; And the hush of my heart is as holy As houses where angels have flown ! Long ago was I weary of voices 'Whose music my heart could not win; Long ago was I weary of noises That fretted my soul with their din; Long ago was I weary of places Where I met but the human and sin, I walked in the world with the worldly; I craved what the world never gave, And I said : 'In the world each Ideal, That shines like a star on life's wave, Is wrecked on the shores of the Real, And sleeps like a dream in the grave.' And still did I pine for the Perfect, And still found the False with the True: I sought 'mid the human for Heaven, But caught a mere glimpse of its blue; And I wept when the clouds of the mortal Vailed even that glimpse from my view. And I toiled heart-tired of the human, And I moaned 'mid the mazes of men, Till I knelt long ago at an altar And heard a voice call me. Since then I walked down the Valley of Silence That lies far beyond mortal ken. Do you ask what I found in the valley? 'Tis my trysting place with the Divine, And I fell at the feet of the Holy And above me a voice said : ''Be mine,' And there arose from the depths of my spirit An echo�'My heart shall be thine.' Do you ask how I live in the valley? I weep, and I dream, and I pray, But my tears are as sweet as the dew drops That fall on the roses in May; And my prayers like a perfume from censers Ascendeth to God night and day. In the hush of the valley of Silence I dream all the songs that I sing; And the music floats down the dim yalley, Till each finds a word for a wing That to hearts, like the Dove of the Deluge, A message of peace they may bring. But far on the deep there are billows That never shall break on the beach: And I have heard songs in the silence That never shall float into speech; And I have had dreams in the valley Too lofty for language to reach. And I have seen thoughts in the valley� Ah me ! how my spirit was stirred! And they wear holy veils on their faces� Their footsteps can scarcely be heard! They pass through the valley like virgins Too pure for the touch of a word! Do you ask me the place of that valley? Ye hearts that are harrowed by care T It lieth afar between mountains And God and his angels are there; And one's the dark mount of sorrow, And one�the bright mountain of prayer! Selected.
