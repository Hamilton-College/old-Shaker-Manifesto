Ayer, Mass. Nov. 1891. Dear Editor :ï¿½I have read with great pleasure, in the Nov. Manifesto, an interesting account of the 'Harvest Home.' If we had more of such beautiful entertainments, in our Zion home, I think it would be productive of much good. As the outward is an index of the inner life, why should not our home be made pleasant and attractive with everything of a useful character. As young minds are active in thought we find among them a desire to beautify their gospel home. Should they not receive a just appreciation of their worth and efforts in the right direction. Our good Elder Elijah often prompted us to be faithful in looking after the neatness of our premcies. There is a great responsibility resting on each one, to feel for the honor and credit of their home. The relations are the closest of all relations, its harmony is most sensitive, and the feeling of interest should be alive in every heart. Kudeness of speech and action mar the harmony of our home and our characters are tried by the multitude of trifles we meet, rather than by great trials. The larger usually give warning of their approach and we summon all strength to meet them, but sittle things come unexpected. To meet them successfully we need the spirit of Christ dwelling constantly, within us. It is in the home life that the value of religion is most fully tested. Here we can measure our growth in grace and learn what Christ is able to do for us. If we find it easy to exhibit a Christian spirit in public and to serve Christ in public, but not so easy in our home relations, we may have a good reason to question the genuineness of our Christian experience. The Journal of home duties, informs us that potatoes are harvested. Apples picked and the products of t the garden in the cellar. Steam pipes have been laid to the dwelling of the Ministry and also to the Barn, and we hope it may prove of use and be profitable in every place. A. D. B.
