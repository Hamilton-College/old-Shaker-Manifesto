THE GOSPEL, IN A NUTSHELL MATTHEW MESSNER Jesus was what the system he introduced made him — an illustration of the practical workings of Christianity. He differed from others, only as far as life-practice made him to differ. He was a model, for all who would be Christians — holding animal nature in subjection to spiritual life. He was a high hope to humanity — is now — as to what human nature can attain unto. With similar propensities ; tempted in all points as we are ; yet using the good power in him to defeat all selfish ends. Jesus, being like other men, he was the proper person to be our examplar ; had he been born without a similar nature, he would not have been the needed, desired model. His gospel is an exemplification of dominion over every perverted and unspiritual appetite; giving hope and power, unto every soul, to accomplish salvation and redemption, by daily self-denial and the spiritual cross. His life was the result of compliance with the higher laws of his being — and by similar compliance to the same laws, every man and woman can, cheered by his example,' go and do likewise.' If we want the salvation which was in Jesus, we must live as he lived; or we may want salvation from sin, time, and eternity without end, and never obtain it, except we ' take up our crosses,' and live his life.
