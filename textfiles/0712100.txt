Printing and journalism in China A , Chinese printing office is a greater curiosity , than one would think. The alphabet num- , bers way into the thousands, and a cap and lower case goes all the way round the inside Â¦ of a two-story building, and half way up the roof. It takes an apprentice twenty years to learn the case, and then he has to use a step ladder to get at the higher branches. A case was pied once in Canton, and it took five days to remove the type from the body of the foreman. They punctuate wherever they can drop a dot, without regard to the prospective. When the editor coins a word, the printer whittles out a new character with his jackknife. The journeymen set type by the square foot, and never belong to a union. They do their press work by hand, and use boxing gloves to ink the type. They have one paper in the empire a thousand years old, and the bound volumes half fill a pagoda. It is rumored that Bennett has started to edit that venerable paper. The editor's head is responsible for all items published in the paper, and is taken off whenever an article of news is published. Not an editor has been beheaded in China for the last five hundred years. The Chinese have just invented a twenty-five cylinder press for printing tea chests, with which they are able to print one a week. San Francisco Monitor
