HOW TO MAKE TALLOW CANDLES. First we get some candle wicking and double it and twist the lower end and put on little sticks; we then take some babery tallow and beeswax and melt it. We then take these sticks and dip them, they then must cool before dipping again. This process has to be repeated until the candles are the size we wish them. Some candles are made by turning the tallow into moulds and letting them harden. E. B. K.
