Paint for farm buildings An old subscriber, Wardville P. O., sends for the benefit of our other subscribers the following recipe for paint for farm buildings : The following is a very cheap and excellent paint for farm buildings, forming a hard surface, and as its hardness increases by time, it is far more durable than paint. Take freshly burned unslacked lime and reduce it to powder. To one peck or one bushel of this add the same quantity of fine white sand, or fine coal ashes, and twice as much fresh wood ashes, all this being sifted through a fine sieve. They should then be thoroughly mixed together while dry. Afterward mix them with as much common linseed oil as will make the whole thin enough to work freely with a painter's brush. This will make the paint of light gray stone color, nearly white. To make it fawn or drab, add yellow ochre and Indian red ; if drab is desired add burnt umber, Indian red and a little black ; if dark stone color, add lampblack ; or if brown stone then add Spanish brown. All these colors should of course be first mixed in oil and then added. This paint is very much cheaper than common oil paint. It is equally well suited to wood, brick or stone. It is better to apply it in two coats, the first thin, and the second thick. Farmer's Advocate.
