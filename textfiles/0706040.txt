Feeding values and effects Feeding values and effects.—'Please state the relative merits or values of corn a $2 per 100 pounds, oats at $1.75 per 100 pounds, bran at 65 cents per 100, and barley at $2 per 100 pounds, for feeding work-horses ?hese are the prices of horse-feed here. How much bran will be equivalent to four quarts of corn? We have not produced enough corn or oats to feed our teams for a year. Our crop of wheat was good, and bran is cheaper than ever before here by ten cents per hundred-weight.'—T., Fort Collins, Col. * * * ' What is the relative value of oats and corn for horse-feed? Which is the healthier to feed alone, and which is the more profitable to grow for consumption on the farm, where all the manure which can be made is needed? Likewise, which takes up the most strength from the ground? And lastly, in cultivating and cropping an orchard of young apple-trees, eight to ten years old, which is preferable?'—Farmer, Meadville, Penn. Basing the answer to T.'s question on the proportion of digestible fodder-constituents in these several articles of fodder, as determined by numerous experiments in Germany, we should have the following results: Calling the feeding value of one hundred pounds of corn 200, that of one hundred pounds of oats would be 175, of barley 190, and that of bran 175. Therefore, eight pounds of bran would be about equal to seven pounds or four quarts of corn. In practice, the feeding value of bran may not come so near that of corn as is indicated by these calculations; but still there can be but little doubt that wheat-bran, at 65 cents per hundred-weight, is much cheaper fodder than corn at $2, provided that the animals thrive equally well on both. As to the comparative effect of oats and corn on the soil, in answer to Farmer, it is sufficient to consider that while the weight of an average crop of oats is but about 1600 lbs. of grain, that of a crop of corn is about 2750 pounds; and, therefore, even if we do not take into account the much greater weight of the stalks and leaves of the corn as compared with the oats, it is evident enough that the corn-crop must make a heavier draft on the supplies of plant-food in the soil than the oats. The oats would, therefore, in your orchard, rob the apple-trees of much less nutriment than would the corn; but, on the other hand, the cultivation that corn requires when it is properly cared for would be so beneficial to the trees that the evil of its greater exhaustive effect might be almost counterbalanced.—New York Tribune.
