WestPittsfieldd, Mass. Dec. 1891. Deak Editor :â€”As the present year is nearing its close, perhaps it will not be amiss to recall some of its incidents. Our broad, fertile country has been wonderfully productive in the past season; the cereal crop has been large, and the various kinds of fruits have generally been plentiful. We have, like those in other localities been threatened with a water famine; but the long wished for rain finally appeared, and our fears have somewhat abated, but more rain is needed. Weather is remarkably line for this season of the year. Have had only one light snow fall and that quickly disappeared. The Old World seems to have met with a reverse in regard to food supplies, what may have been the cause of the failure is to us unknown. Some attribute it to their forms of government, but whatever may have been the cause, it is pleasant to contemplate that our country is blest with a surplus and can assist in providing sustenance for the starving millions of Europe. If) THE MANIFESTO. Rightly estimated it has with us been a year of prosperity and benefits. Sickness has prevailed to some extent in our communit ', and a few are still in an enfeebled condition. An occasional mishap has also occurred. A few days since, as Br. Oliver was driving in the city of Pittsfield two teams that were left standing untied became frightened and ran. One of them ran against the carriage in which Oliver was seated damaging the vehicle considerably, and causing him to be thrown over the dash-board upon the ground. He however with remarkable presence of mind retained his hold on the reins and escaped serious injury. Maj the coming New Year be a happy one to all our Dear Friends. J. L. S.
