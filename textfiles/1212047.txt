Washing Oil-Cloths. â€”Some working girls cannot imagine that they can clean an oilcloth without a pail of strong, hot suds and a good, stiff' scrub brush. Then she puts to her work all the strength of a good, strong, healthy arm, and smiles with great satisfaction at the result of her labors. No doubt for a few moments, till the cloth is dry, the colors stand out clearly and the floor looks fresh and brilliant. It takes but a few of such scrubbings, however, to destroy the best oil-cloth ever made. But take a pail of clean, soft lukewarm water, a nice soft piece of flannel, and wash your oil-cloths ; wipe them very dry so that no drop of water is left to soak in and rot the fabric, and you will have little cause to complain that they wear out fast, provided you select one of good make. After washing and drying, if a cloth is wrung out of a dish of skim-milk and water and the oilcloth is rubbed over with this and then again well dried, the freshness and lustre of the cloth will well repay the extra labor.
