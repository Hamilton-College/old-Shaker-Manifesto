Shakers, N. Y., March 1, 1877 Editor Shaker: The article in the February Shaker upon ' The Shaker Covenant,' clearly defining our obligations as a community to stand unflinchingly in its support, not only meets my warm approval, but I do not see how it could have been materially im- proved. None of us can deny the binding force of this sacred compact upon us, as members of our societies. And our obedience thereto, or our non-compliance with it, determines whether we shall stand or fall by it, from the Christian standard. Its justness is clearly manifested, in that it controls each and all alike; and if delegating superiority to any, it is upon the gospel principle, 'let him be servant of all.' Our rights are all secure, so long as this covenant remains in full force; and no privileged class can exercise an unchristian power upon any, but all are bound to the most unselfish brotherhood by its wise provisions. But there is great danger, beloved editor, as believers in our faith grow in the wealth of this world's goods, that selfishness and a worldly ambition for place and power may seek to exercise an unShaker dominion over the weaker brethren. A vast amount of trouble may be made or avoided by carefully studying your excellent treatise upon this subject, and guiding our conduct thereby. Man naturally loves to exercise authority over his fellows; and if he is not brought under Christian influences, becomes oppressive by a little brief power. Aware of this fact, let us jealously guard our sacred charter against any entering wedge that ignores the golden rule and the rights of all the brotherhood. Thanking you for the ringing clearness of that article, I am yours, Orrin Beaver
