Alfred, Me. Beloved Editor :ï¿½Eldress Lucinda Taylor, of this place, has been appointed to the Order of Ministry and all bless the appointment. We have a fair crop of apples for an 'off year.' Grain of all kinds was injured as were also the beans. We have not entered into the cultivation of cranberries, but some places on our meadows yield quite liberally and this season has been more abundant than is usual. The young people picked eighty bushels, and we anticipate that we might have secured one hundred bushels, if the rain had not made the meadows so wet, that we could not pass over them. J. B. V.
