Killing Rats .â€”The following cheap and simple method is said to be in use in Germany: A mixture of two parts of wellbruised common squills and three parts of finely-chopped bacon is made into a stiff mass, with as much meal as may be required, and then baked into small cakes, which are put down for the rats to eat. Several correspondents of the German Agricultural Gazette write to announce the complete extirpation of rats and mice from their cow-stalls and piggeries since the adoption of this simple plan.
