Darwinism rible thing to see nigh a whole generation of men and women professing to be cultivated, looking around in a purblind fashion, and finding no God in this universe. I suppose it is a reaction from the reign of cant and hollow pretence, professing to believe what in fact they do not believe. And this is what we have got to. All things from frog spawn ; the gospel of dirt the order of the day. The older I grow—and I now stand upon the brink of eternity—the more comes back to me the sentence of the catechism, which I learned when a child, and the fuller and the deeper its meaning becomes: 'What is the chief end cf man?' 'To glorify God and to enjoy Him forever.' No gospel of dirt, teachitig that men have descended from frogs through monkeys, can - ever set that aside.' Hartford Courant
