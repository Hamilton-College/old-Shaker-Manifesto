WAKING THOUGHTS. Annie R. Stephens. The rosy light of morning broke From a cerulean sky; And nature from her dreams awoke To tell the dawn was nigh. And I awoke, as if from dreams, Thus did my heart aspire,� To fill the day with sunny gleams Of noble, true desire. And with an earnest soul and will I rose to meet the day, Its many duties to fulfill That cumber us alway, But ere a few short hours were spent, My plans�forgotten, all, On other missions too intent, My lips let harsh words fall. Oh life's wasted, wasted power Of aspirations vast, That thrilled my soul at morning's hour To bless ere day was past. Oh! lofty thoughts, resolves that burned Within a living flame; Those vital fires to ashes turned From whence no brightness came. Oh thoughtless words! Oh idle thought! Yea, weak and erring will; [fraught Life's misspent hours that should be With good instead of ill. And as I viewed^by sunset light, My failure and defeat, I rose with more encouraged might Life's many foes to meet. Failure, new vistas to us opes, Suffering brings us joy; And on the ashes of our hopes We build to God's employ. But hark! I hear a soft voice speak Which bids me bravely bear; And while my erring heart is weak To seek the strength of prayer. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
