SAVE THE DEAD LEAVES The leaves which annually fall from any of our large deciduous trees will make sufficient fertilizing materials to produce another tree of the same size. To accomplish this, however, it will not do to allow the leaves to be scattered by the winds, washed down creeks and rivers and wasted. We know that decomposed leaves make most excellent manure; but the ground will not grow rich very rapidly, even under trees, unless the annual deposit of leaves remains and decays where they fall, which is seldom the case except in large forests. The leaves that fall from our shade and fruit trees are mainly blown away into the roads and ditches and do nobody any good, when, if carefully saved, they would add considerably to the fertility of one's garden. On damp days, and early in the morning, while the leaves are wet, have them raked up and put into a compost heap, and you will find that the twenty to thirty wagon loads of leaves annually saved about your place, make one or two loads of superfine manure, and just the best thing known for garden plants. Do not wait until all the leaves have fallen before commencing to save, for a large proportion of them would be blown away by that time, but begin early, and thereby nearly all can be saved.â€”Agricultural World and Michigan Homestead.
