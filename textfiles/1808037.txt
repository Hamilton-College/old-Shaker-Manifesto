Dear Children:--Take care of your thoughts and your actions will... Enfield, Conn., 1888 Dear Children:�'Take care of your thoughts and your actions will take care of themselves.' ' What you love you think about: what you love, you strive to obtain. Good thoughts are like good air, invigorating and strengthening. 'Pure thoughts produce their image on the soul, and a beautiful image it is.' Pure thoughts are good company. Have as many of them as possible. The best guard against impurity of action is purity of thought. Every pure thought is valuable. ' When a thought comes to your brain, That would place on life a stain, Banish it from heart and mind, Eor a purer thought to find.' Keep your spirits constantly guarded with virtuous thoughts and no evil can enter there. 'To near your God be pure in heart.' Cultivate virtuous thoughts and you will gain untold happiness�riches without measure. Fit yourselves for that home where you wish to go. Keep your thoughts pure and you will make rrogress toward a healthy body and soul. Thoughts produce actions, actions strengthen habits, habits form characters. The more you strive for purity, the better. If you have virtuous, loving thoughts they will write themselves in your faces and manners, and they n&gt;ay be encouraging to those who read them. Your lives will be spotless if your thoughts are pure. Watch well what seed you sow, for from the seed comes the crop. Like will produce like. Watch against temptations, evil influences, all the wiles of the adversary. Otherwise there is no safety. Sow well, reap well. If the sowing be sinful, the harvest will be painful. If you sow thoughts that are impure, your harvest will be grief and sorrow. If you sow the precious seed of loving, virtuous thoughts, thoughts that will bear the fruit of truth and purity, you are sowing that which will yield rich returns. When you have for your companionship virtuous thoughts, you have an element of constant joy, and of constantly increasing joy. As you have sown, so shall you reap. The sowing has been in your hearts and lives, the reaping is there also. The precious fruits of the spirit are yours. If I have said that which will awaken in your hearts purer thoughts and higher aspirations, then am I blest and happy. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
