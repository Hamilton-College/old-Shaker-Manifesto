FRIENDSHIP How hard it is to find a friend, One on whom we can depend. Sometimes we think the treasure got Till trial proves we have it not. Many, to serve their selfish ends, Warmly declare they are your friends : But soon as serving self is o'er, Behold they are your friends no more. Others will act a part more base,â€” Always be friendly to your face; You turn your back, then they your name Expose to obloquy and shame. Apparent friendship others show, That you may confidence bestow ; Your secrets thus they oft obtain, And use to injure your good name. Those who of others tell you much, My counsel is, Beware of such ; They bring your neighbor's faults to view, And, absent, speak the same of you. A faithful friend I highly prize, But mere pretense I do despise. Whene'er disposed a friend to trust, Be always sure to prove him first. Selected
