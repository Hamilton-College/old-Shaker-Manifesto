THOUGHT There are blanket sheets with millions of money behind them, and with but a commercial value that all told do notgive so much thought that is good and valuable as is contained in this gem from the sparkling, living, glowing pages of Helen William's little paper, THE WOMAN'S WORLD, published in Chicago for three cents a copy and $1.00 a year, and the type of which is set by her daughter's hands. 'And the world's thinkers, what of them ? Soul captains; men who lead battalions of souls in opposition to the hosts of ignorance, and conquer; obliterating their very memory from the face of the world ; are these not the valiant heroes of earth, whose conquests shall endure when the conquests of those other captains who have led bodies only shall have passed as a dieam? I say yes I say that the things which we see not are mightier than the things which are seen. I say that thought is the one universal conqueror whose mission is constructive, not destructive, and to whose care is committed every work that will endure. It is because there are a thousand non-thinkers to where there is one thinker that the great bulk of the race lies in chains of the basest servitude. A servitude that no extraneous force- - neither of organization nor of dynamite, can break ; nothing but the lifting and the lightening power of thought can reach it. Millions of thoughts from millions of thinkers; thought individualized ; each thought the seed germ of a life, generating more life- -this is the lever by which humanity can be raised. Selected.
