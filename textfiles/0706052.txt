Society Items West Gloucester, Maine West Gloucester, Me. The drought has occasioned a great deal of trouble in this section all the winter past. Failure to send obituaries direct, caused errata in Charlotte Thomas' age, which was 89; and Margaret Steadfast's residence, which was Alfred, Me. The measles have been very prevalent in this vicinity, but now abated. Efforts are being made to finish the Stone house at Poland hill, so long and greatly needed. Eight rooms now complete, with the addition of a beautiful meeting-room, 26 x 43 feet. David Rittenhouse, the celebrated astronomer, who was skillful in measuring the size and determining the position of the heavenly bodies, found that a thread of ordinary sewing-silk drawn across the glass of his telescope would completely conceal a star. The finest fiber of silk would hide a distant star for several seconds. So the smallest speck of prejudice, or the finest thread of worldly policy or ambition, drawn across the lens of the mind, obstructs the light of divinest truth, and hides half the glories of the heavens. To see the spiritual world, we must keep the passions, cares, and loves of the earth from the eye of the soul, as the astronomer wipes the dust and steam from his glass.
