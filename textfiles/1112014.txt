VALEDICTORY With this issue of The Manifesto —the closing of Vol. XL—the present management of Editor and Publisher ceases. It gives us extreme pleasure to announce that The Manifesto WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE AND FLOURISH captained by earnest hearts and perhaps abler influences. We feel warranted in saying, that in regard to our Shaker testimony, The Manifesto will, in the future, even more so than in the past, give forth no uncertain sound. The record of its past is so well known to our readers, that modesty forbids that we do other than to leave judgment upon it with them. We leave it with considerable satisfaction, acknowledging that we have enjoyed much satisfaction in our past labors upon it. It has not been a sinecure, but invariably the reverse of such. We cannot envy bur successors, but make them welcome to every aid and comfort that any can bestow. We appeal to the generous for their continued subscriptions; and hope that, by the aid of tangible funds and gospel encouragement, the hearts of the future management will be made many times glad. We thank the contemporary press for many kind words and valuable exchange list. We call the especial attention of all to. the future address of our monthly.— The Shaker Manifesto, Shaker Village, Merrimack Co., N. H.
