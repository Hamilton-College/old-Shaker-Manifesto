THERE FELL A STAR FROM HEAVEN J. L. D. SMITH. I saw a falling star Shoot downward from the sky- - The heavenly glories far- - The gleaming radiance die. A starry path of light, A darkened way before, Down sinking in the night- - Its time of beauty o'er! Alas ! for falling star, Light fading on its track; No glory from afar Will call the wanderer back. I saw a human soul Made in God's image bright, Spurning his wise control, Turn downward from the light. It missed the golden gate ; It did not run its race; Yet, groping now, too late, Its pathway would retrace. Alas ! for human soul, Were not a Helper given, The while the ages roll, To lead thee back to heaven ! Selected.
