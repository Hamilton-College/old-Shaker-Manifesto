In Memory. One of God's rarest noblemen Has reached his well-earned rest. O will not saints and holy men Sing 'Welcome home! ye blest?' And bid the ransomed, as a host, To shout 'Admission free!' To one so worthy of high trust And confidence, as he? Low at his feet might monarchs kneel And princes lay their crowns, There, reverently their pledges seal To him, whom God enthrones. With him rejoice, dear friends on earth Whose memories can trace Naught but the nobleness of truth, Naught but a growth in grace. Let countless blessings on him fall Who stood as few have stood, [toil, Through lengthened years of care and Safe model for the good. Who like a Daniel feareu his God Rather than face of clay, And dared pursue the rugged road Of duty every-daj. Dear Father will you now accept The children's mite, to-day; Though small this tribute of respect Which our poor words convey? Asenath C. Stickney. Canterbury, N. H.
