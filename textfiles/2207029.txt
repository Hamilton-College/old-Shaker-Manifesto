INQUIRY. No. 5. It is quite common to be asked the following question. 'How do you settle difficulties that arise between individual members of your Society ?' In a Christian Community the members must be governed by the spirit of Christ. The contract which is signed by persons on entering the Society, and the Rules and Regulations of the Order, which are for the same purpose as the bye-laws of other Societies, determine quite clearly the course that must be taken by each member toward every other member. To injure another person by word or report or deed produces disunion and the trespass must be corrected by confession or acknowledgment. The correct government of the mind is an essential Christian discipline, and to be able to maintain a gospel relation, a good union must be sustained. No member has a right to trespass upon the privileges of another and if this is done, either carelessly or willfully, it must be apologized for, or if necessary made a subject of confession.
