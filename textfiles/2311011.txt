'CHOOSE YE THIS DAY WHOM YE WILL SERVE.' Julia M. Lincoln. This command given by Joshua to the children of Israel centuries ago, comes to us at the present time, with an increased power and emphasis. It is indeed the call of the Holy Spirit, unto souls who would live the higher life, apart from the sin and selfishness so prevalent in the greater part of humanity to-day. In order to make this choice to our everlasting advantage, due consideration, aspiration and true moral courage is required on the part of every individual, to rise above the power of Mammon, and turn aside from the transient pleasures of the world, and find those eternal joys whose source is divine. Only those who have been touched by conviction, who have received into their hearts the light of truth, are prepared to make the full and necessary sacrifices, are willing to subdue all vain ambitions, selfish desires and sensual passions, all of which constitute a worldly life, that they may in deed and in truth 'serve the Lord' with their whole hearts. Besetting temptations and vain allurements of an earthly life, are spread out before the gaze of the young like a panoramic scene, painted in bright, though false colors, and what is the result! Many being deceived, choose unwisely and turn away from the beautiful path of purity and uprightness into the dark valley of woe. We who have heard the command of the Spirit, 'Choose ye this day whom ye will serve,' know its real meaning and realize the importance of yi.-lding implicit obedience thereto ; there can be no reserve of selfish ties and affections, the natural and earthly mast be sacrificed that the spiritual and divine life within us may be more fully developed ; and this is not accomplished without real determination and a daily struggle against the powers of our lower being, lest they gain the ascendancy. Therefore when the decision comes, as come it must to every individual, whom they will choose to serve, whether the Egyptian gods of their ancestors,�an inheritance of accumulated sins resulting in War, Marriage and Private Property�or whether the living God, who has led them out of the house of bondage and from Egypt's dark land, into a land 'for which they did not labor, and to cities which they built not, and to vineyards which they planted not' and to an hundred-fold relationship. Mark the difference! The wise, true and heroic soul could never falter in making the decision, 'As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
