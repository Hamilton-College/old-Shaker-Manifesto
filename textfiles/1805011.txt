Beloved Editor:--While thinking upon the excellencies of brevity in expression... Shaker Village, N. H., Mar. 1888. Beloved Editor :�While thinking upon the excellencies of brevity in expression of thought I came across the following list of short words which some linguist presents to us affirming that the name of God is spelled in four letters only, in nearly every language spoken. For example he says :� '� In Latin we have Oeus' ' French Dieu ' Greek ' ' Theos ' Hebrew Adin ' German Gott ' Scandinavian ' ' Odin ' Swedish Codd ' Syrian Adad ' Persian &amp;yi*a ' Tartar ' ' Idga ' Spanish Dias ' East Indian ' 'J Esgi ' Turkish ' ' Addi ' Egyptian Zent ' Japanese Zain ' Peruvian Lima ' Wallachian ' ' Zene Now if to this list we append the uames of some of the attributes of Deity it will readily be perceived that most words implying goodness or greatness in the truest sense are generally composed of few letters. Our Divine Teacher we know was wont to dictate his most vital lessons of truth to his listeners of simply constructed sentences in words of one syllable only. Here is one example�'� I am the way, the truth, and the life' another� 'Why callest thou me good?' uThere is none good save one and that is God. ' The words way, truth, life and many others from the same source viz., love, joy, peace, each present to our thought an idea of Infinity and the primal principles upon which heaven itself is founded. Further, the names of all great and grand objects in nature are presented to us in terms the most brief. For example the sun, moon, stars, sky, sea, ice, snow, frost, dew, rain, hail and wind, are each symbols of a mighty and stupendous power. Word pictures are they, conveying to the imagination, as well as to the external senses scenes the most vivid, inspiring, vast. Does not the word sun at once suggest boundlessness of light and heat? the moon, splendor ; the sky, the stars, immeasurable distance�the sea,vastness, the ice, piles of crystal light, the frost, the dew, unlimited surface, the rain, the snow, bounty, while hail and wind and storm serve to remind us, that there is a power before which our human strength is weakness, our finite wisdom, folly. Therefore, from the facts which we have been considering, may we not infer that Brevity is not only the soul of wit, but the culmination of strength in expressions of thought by means of language. At this point, a practical hint for my benefit seems to flow from the point of the pen, and reads thus 'Any truth scientific or religious, conveyed in a pithy, concise manner, is oftenest welcomed by editors in general, and oftenest read and longest retained in the memory of the reading public. ' With this fact, in full view, I must conclude my plea for brevity. ASENATH C. STICKNEY.
