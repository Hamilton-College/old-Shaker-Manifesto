NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Aug. 18. Beloved Elder Henry :�Who would care for any notes about our home? Well, we have not, in my remembrance, had such a season as the past. For eight consecutive days we could do nothing in the hay field, and in July we had rain for fifteen days. Not a single Sabbath have we staid at home from public meeting on account of rain. [Good ! such a record as that is worthy a place in the Manifesto. Attend the public Service, and if it rains, dress accordingly. Ed.] Now, if we take fifteen rainy days and four Sabbaths out of a month, we have only twelve days left. This makes the farmers look rather blue. To see much of the labor of the season, with the fertilizers and manures that were spent on the potato crop,� so great a loss, to say the least, is quite discouraging. Some of our sheep have been destroyed by the dogs, and all in all it makes a mournful story. In the near future all this sadness may be turned to sunshine, and our notes to joy. D O. Aug. 27. Sister Amelia has a night blooming Cereus, and at 9-30 P M., she cut off a flower that was nine inches in diameter. By placing it on the ice, it kept fresh all the next day and could be placed on the table at meal time. The plant has produced three flowers this season. On Sabbath August 18th. Elder Calvin G. Reed and brothers Washington Jones and Dr. Carl, with several Sisters went to Lebanon Springs to attend a camp meeting. The place of the meeting is two miles from the Shaker Village. [We trust they imparted and received much good, and were persuaded to go the second time. Ed.] Watervliet, N. Y. Sept. 3. Elder Harvey L. Eads of Pleasant Hill, Ky., was with us on the 1st. and 2nd. inst. He was much revived in health. He shares our unbounded love. Hancock, Mass. Aug. 21. This has been a season of almost perpetual rain, and our large oat crop has been very much damaged. We have harvested some of our potatoes and think we shall not have more than one third of a crop. Sept 3. Sisters, Eliza A. Stratton and Julia Briggs, of Canterbury have been with us for a few days. We are all pleased to meet with our beloved gospel friends. Sept. 7. Berkshire hills and dales, have yielded an abundant supply of Blackberries this season. The East family Sisters have canned nearly or quite three bushels, for home use. A delicious substitute for apples. L. W. Enfield, Conn. Our new hay-loader is an interesting machine. It looks like a huge spider. [Is a huge spider interesting?] The Brethren think it saves them valuable time and much hard work. They unload the hay with a horse-fork, which is also a great invention. The crops on the farm have been good, except the damage done by the rain. Potatoes some injured. Apples scarce. The weather fine for harvesting. The second crop of grass is being cut and a very good yield. Corn is also commenced cutting and is very much better than was expected. A considerable tract of meadow land is being stocked down. Carrots and Beets have somewhat recovered from the long rains, and look well Everything looks prosperous at the present time. M. W.
