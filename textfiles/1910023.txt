Enfield, Conn. Our new hay-loader is an interesting machine. It looks like a huge spider. [Is a huge spider interesting?] The Brethren think it saves them valuable time and much hard work. They unload the hay with a horse-fork, which is also a great invention. The crops on the farm have been good, except the damage done by the rain. Potatoes some injured. Apples scarce. The weather fine for harvesting. The second crop of grass is being cut and a very good yield. Corn is also commenced cutting and is very much better than was expected. A considerable tract of meadow land is being stocked down. Carrots and Beets have somewhat recovered from the long rains, and look well Everything looks prosperous at the present time. M. W.
