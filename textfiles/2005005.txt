AS WE SOW, SO SHALL WE REAP. Abraham Perkins. Extraordinary are the mercies of God and abundant are the evidences that our earth teems with his goodness. Realizing as I do the crowning work of God with man, which is to culminate in the perfect redemption of the soul from all that is earthly and sensual, a resurrection from dead works to a life in Christ, a virgin character, I feel the necessity of ever keeping in view my Christian call and mission. For me as an individual, and for our body as a Christian sect, a large field is open both for spiritual and physical labor, requiring much sacrifice ; and as scripturally taught, and as exemplified in fruits, we reap what we sow in all the labors of life. If we sow to the flesh, we shall of the flesh produce the fruits thereof, fruits of the fall, emanations derived from elements as they exist in ourselves, fruits of corruption. While if we sow to the spirit, our reward is eternal life; we reap a harvest of divine excellence, a fruitage more than human, unmistakable proofs of the veritable truth of the promises of the Most High. Although we are commanded to judge no man, yet by the fruits of humanity, humanity is known, and character is comprehended by that which is daily cropping out in life. If our strength and powers are given on the animal plaue, though much good wTheat may be the product of our field, of -a character praise-worthy and distinguishable in the Christ life, yet evidence is clear that the conspicuous and most prolific crops of that field are tares, which have nourished and cumber the ground for the want of proper cultivation of the soil. As in the natural order, so in thcspiritnal,-there is a garden within ourselves to be dug about and fed with the salt of the spirit, that it may grow good fruit and produce spiritual outcomes; However great and impressive may be the call of God to the soul, however favorable the opportunities for Christian life, however extraordinary and bountiful the ministrations from the heavens to man, or however much he hath cried, Lord, Lord, prophesied in his name and done wonderful works, if ultimately found a worker of iniquity, his sentence must be the declaration of the Savior pronounced upon the foolish man,� 'I never knew you ; depart from me.' Awhile on the other hand, those who have taken upon them the }^oke of Christ and faithfully borne it, who have learned of him to be meek and lowly in heart, his promise is,�'Come unto me and ye shall find rest unto your souls ; for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.'
