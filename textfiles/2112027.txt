Beloved Elder Henry :�If with the dial-plate we could say, 'I take no heed of time Save when the sun is shining,' we could impress upon each moment as it passed some interesting item; for surely so sunny an Autumn is -unprecedented in our history. Were the poet Hood to materialize in our locality, we think his negative description of November would be changed to the affirmative. Fourteen consecutive, clear, crisp, cloudless days, which really would be delightful, were it not that we think with a shudder�even on our hillside�of our almost dry springs, ponds, reservoirs and cisterns, and fearing a water famine, we anxiously watch for, and welcome the clouds. Such is life! But less sunny is our inner home. The rather sudden failure of our loved Eldress Ann, has gathered the nimbus clouds about us. Now, that she is released from public life and service, we had hoped, that as of yore, her sweet spirit would linger for a while in happy old age, with her own home friends. And it may be so yet; but now she is seemingly looking from life's west windows at a setting sun. To supply the vacancy left by her removal, we of the Church lose in Eldress Augusta, a valued friend, a firm pillar, and one as true as the needle to the Pole; and while1 others step to the front, we rejoice that in true worth we are still self-supporting. May it ever be thus, which will be, if each member of our home, feels as did Ruth of old that we have one God and one people, with interest undivided. Just at present we have with us from our sister Society at Watervliet, Sisters, Samantha Bowie and Ella Benedict. When the time shall come that we have more reunion, of our loved, our Community friends, our views will be broader, our heart-love stronger and our interest and life-work more to one purpose. A. J. C. Center Family. Nov. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�Our Home Notes are rather concise at this time. Am glad to report that fall work is pretty nearly finished so far as gathering in and housing the crops is concerned. Some plowing to be done and some necessary repairs of fences around home. We have added quite a number of sheep and cattle to our stock which we hope will prove profitable to the family. Health of our people quite good. Tour Brother, T. D. R. Sorrtli Family. Nov. 1891. The harvest time has come and gone leaving many grateful hearts and pleasant remembrances of the full reward of their earnest labors of fruits and vegetables. We can have no cause to complain. We have stored in the cellar over two hundred bvxshels of apples; seven hundred bu. were made into cider and we dried three and one. half barrels. Of black and blue huckleberries we gathered, preserved and canned one hundred and fifty gallons. One hundred and fifty gallons of tomatoes were put into stone jugs while there were preserved and pickled three gallons of each. Of potatoes three hundred bushels are placed in the cellar for winter use, while seven hundred bushels were sold. There were eight acres of corn which yielded a rich supply, enabling us to dry between thirty-five to forty barrels, the kiln being finished, afforded us an opportunity of using it which proved satisfactory. We have gathered for the winter three hundred hubbard squashes for home use. There is also an abundant supply of turnips, carrots and onions of which sixty bu. were sold. I think we have every reason to be thankful. A. W. Nov. 1891. so we are to round the last notes for 1891. But not till after Thanksgiving and Christmas, will the vibration cease. And after these have died away we shall long hear the echo. Thanksgiving is a good time, to recall the many blessings it has been ours to enjoy, and to bow our hearts in practical appreciation and gratitude. A good time to 'gather up the fragments that nothing be lost' Attention to little things is what assures our prosperity. Christmas time seems a very appropriate season to look back over the passing year and make note of all mistakes and blunders, in thought, word and deed; with an eye on the future. A good time to renew and strengthen all our good resolutions, and to form new ones. We have had most beautiful weather the past few week with some very sharp freezing. Our streams and springs are very low, and unless we get an abundance of rain before winter sets in we shall have considerable inconvenience. There is no time we so fully appreciate the value of water as when it is scarce. It is about the same with other good things. Our measure the past season has been filled to overflowing; and it would seem as though there was nothing good enough. The first Believers would say ' 'thankfulness made easy the way of God: and the unthankful were unholy.' With such a superabundance of temporal there is some danger of a wasteful manner being entertained; which in no wTise adds to out comfort or gospel travail. We have had a beautiful rain to-day for which we render grateful thanks. D. O. West Pittsfield, Mas Home Notes for West Pittsfield, Mass., written at Shaker Station, Conn. Dear Editor :�The busy finger of time significantly points to the date of present month, reminding us that 'Home Notes' should be forwarded to your ever interesting periodical. We have been sojourning the past four weeks with dear gospel friends in the beautiful Conn, vale, the land that teems with luscious fruits, golden grains, and flows with milk and honey. Spiritual blessings abound in profusion and our extended visit here, has been restful, satisfactory and highly beneficial to soul and body. May the heavenly powers continue to sustain, bless and prosper the consecrated souls in this portion of our Zion whose hospitality is proverbial, and whose labors of love are unceasing. Br. Ira, and Sisters accompanying him, were two weeks in the state of New Jersey; then returned home as financial business demanded Ira's attention. As he began to realize the beneficial effects of the climate, it was deemed advisable for him to return, consequently the same company journeyed thither, and remained another two wTeeks. The conclusion now is, that he is improving in health and strength. May the power that assists to shape the destiny of human beings, still uphold and grant to him and others the boon of health. Later reports from home state that Br. Ira is now transacting business in New York City. Crops of all kinds yielded fairly and are secured for Winter. Apples were more plentiful than was anticipated earlier in the season. We were much interested in the account of 'Harvest Home'' in Nov. Manifesto. J. L. S. Shaker Station, Conn. Nov. 1891. 'Watch in all things.' It is impossible to progress heavenward without constant watchfulness. If we would see and know ourselves as we are seen and known of God, we must constantly watch our hearts, our passions and appetites. Prayer and watching will save us from many wrong steps and much misery. We need the enlightening influences of the Holy Spirit to enable lis to discern that which is excellent and 'hold fast that which is good.' Prayer and watchfulness is the armor for the battle of life. ' There was one hour in which it was the North Family. And privilege and duty of the disciples to watch and pray with their suffering Savior. But they slept, and so he said, 'Sleep on and take your rest,' as much as to say, your opportunity is past. Watch, said Jesus�and well we may. Our greatest opportunities may come to us to-day. 4641 spaces of cream were sold in October. 918 bushels of apples have been dried. Our apple crop will exceed 4000 bushels. Warmth, proper food and cleanliness mean success in poultry raising. Cabbage is indispensable as a relish for hens, and a sufficient supply should be stored to feed during the winter. Gravel should be placed in barrels and scattered on the ground occasionally. Bran, with ground oats and meat scraps 'steamed in milk is an excellent mixture for hens. About one hundred hens for an acre is considered to be the right number. D. Orcutt. SoTitli Family. Nov. 1891. The November number of our Manifesto has arrived richly laden with good things, and is a reminder of the duty to produce something of interest in and about home. The blessings which ever attend the faithful are ours, and our hearts swell with gratitude and thankfulness to God for his precious gifts of peace, plenty, and health. Winter again gives signs of approach, a steady cold spell warns us to secure our crops. Corn is nearly all husked. 50 tons of beets and carrots are in the cellar, also 1000 bushels turnips. Winter apples in great abundance are secured, and cider apples so plenty it has made it unprofitable to gather and haul to the mills. Very little rain has fallen this Autumn making it a favorable opportunity for pushing along the fall work, but causing fears of a short supply of water during the winter. It is good for us to feel our dependence under Divine providence, on our own exertions for temporal and spiritual blessings. M. W. Ayer, Mass. Nov. 1891. Dear Editor :�I have read with great pleasure, in the Nov. Manifesto, an interesting account of the 'Harvest Home.' If we had more of such beautiful entertainments, in our Zion home, I think it would be productive of much good. As the outward is an index of the inner life, why should not our home be made pleasant and attractive with everything of a useful character. As young minds are active in thought we find among them a desire to beautify their gospel home. Should they not receive a just appreciation of their worth and efforts in the right direction. Our good Elder Elijah often prompted us to be faithful in looking after the neatness of our premcies. There is a great responsibility resting on each one, to feel for the honor and credit of their home. The relations are the closest of all relations, its harmony is most sensitive, and the feeling of interest should be alive in every heart. Kudeness of speech and action mar the harmony of our home and our characters are tried by the multitude of trifles we meet, rather than by great trials. The larger usually give warning of their approach and we summon all strength to meet them, but sittle things come unexpected. To meet them successfully we need the spirit of Christ dwelling constantly, within us. It is in the home life that the value of religion is most fully tested. Here we can measure our growth in grace and learn what Christ is able to do for us. If we find it easy to exhibit a Christian spirit in public and to serve Christ in public, but not so easy in our home relations, we may have a good reason to question the genuineness of our Christian experience. The Journal of home duties, informs us that potatoes are harvested. Apples picked and the products of t the garden in the cellar. Steam pipes have been laid to the dwelling of the Ministry and also to the Barn, and we hope it may prove of use and be profitable in every place. A. D. B. Canterbury, N. H.

While thousands of human beings in other countries are hurrying to escape from the flooded districts, all of the New England states are suffering, more or less, from a protracted drouth. Springs, rivulets and rivers are quite below the usual low water mark, and the well-springs that are indispen sable in the blessing of life are fast growing less. With a long winter before us, a thought of greatly increased labor is brought forward and we are, at once, reminded of our finite position in nature. If the readers of the Manifesto fail to observe that they are looking at the impression of a new and beautiful face type, we shall recommend them to visit some oculist for defective eyesight. In 1792 the Community at this place built their 'Meeting House.' The shingles which were placed on the roof at that date, have just been removed and the house now has the adornment of a new covering. Religious service has been held in the family Dwelling during the summer and but few spectators have been admitted. The family Dwelling which was built in 1792 has also been under repairs, and with its new A 1 oven for the bakers, its new chimney and eight dormer windows for the attic, it may be expected to hold its place for another one hundred years. On the 12th inst. Elder Abraham Perkins and a younger Brother,�Frank Theobald of Enfield, N. H., called to see their gospel friends at this place. They leave for home on the morning of the 16th. Elder Abraham was for a long term of years the senior Elder in the Order of Ministry, and during that time became strongly identified in the general prosperity in the Society of Canterbury. We are very glad that they loved us so well as to make us this pleasant visit. * Shakers, N. Y. Nov. 1891. We have all our crops housed for the winter. We have had a lagre supply, of apples, 270 barrels for Avinter use, and 750 barrels for vinegar. Since this month came in we have bid a long farewell to two of our beloved aged friends. Sister Catherine was one of six sisters, and all of them closed their days as members of our Community. All were persons of integrity and fully devoted to the gospel cause. The grandmother of sister Catherine was the first to embrace the faith after Mother xlnn came to America. She often walked the distance of three miles to attend religious worship, and Mother Ann would often say to the Sisters, 'Nellie is coming, be ready to meet her.' She passed through severe trials as her husband was bitterly opposed to her religious faith, and did all he could to prevent her from being a Believer. Sister Catherine's father and mother accepted the faith of Believers, and permitted their children to do the same. J. B. Alfred, Me. Nov. 1891. It seems but a few days since I was writing 'Home Notes,' and still it is time for more. Rapidly the days are passing. Soon we shall all be where it is ever day and Home Notes not needed. Since last writing we have been blest with the privilege of meeting gospel friends from three of our Societies. Oct. 16th. Eldress Rosetta Hendrickson and Sister Eva Larkin of Watervliet called and stopped over the Sabbath. We enjoyed a beautiful meeting with them Sabbath P. M. The heavens seemed to come down to us and angels of light ministered unto us. . Many soul-inspiring testimonies were borne by faithful Brethren and Sis- ters; also many of the young renewed their determinations to be loyal to the cause. Just before the close of the service, Eldress Rosetta spoke very impressively to the young upon the subject of obedience. 'Strict obedience' said she, 'to our spiritual advisers and to our own conscience will insure perfect happiness and safety.' Though they tarried with us but a few days, we felt strengthened by their presence. Hope when business calls them this way again, they will not pass us by. Oct. 28th. we were again blest by meeting with two Sisters from East Canterbury, Sisters Eliza A. Stratton and Mabel Liscomb. We had hardly time to get acquainted and inquire after our Canterbury friends, their tarry was so short. Presume they believe in the saying, 'Short visits make long friends.' Think Br. Pliny Worcester of Sabbathday Lake must have been of the same mind, for he stopped with us hardly two days. Nevertheless we were pleased with that short visit from the worthy Brother and thank him (and all our gospel friends) for calling. Hope we may be privileged with other calls, when there is more time to spare. The apple crop proved to be much better than expected. 640 bushels have been gathered of grafted fruit. Of those made into cider for vinegar there is always a plenty. Our Brethren think I should have mentioned in last month's Notes, the hundred tons of corn ensilage that was raised on four acres. They think it was doing pretty well for 'away down east.' F. C.
