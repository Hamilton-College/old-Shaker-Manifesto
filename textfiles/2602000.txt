HUMILITY. By Joanna J. Kaime. Within the 'vale humility,' Life's crystal streams abide, No scorching sun nor parching drought Can stay the living tide; By earnest prayer and trusting love, With faith and works combined The honest seeker after light. This peaceful vale may find. How many fail in growth of soul Who climb the barren height Where worldly elements control And truth is lost to sight. The Christian's faith will ever lead Where meekness lends her charm, For only those who find this grace Shall win the victor's palm. Here in the shadow of God's love Is safety for the soul, Here naught offends nor intercepts The spirit's wise control. I caught a glimpse in youth's bright day Of blessings since made known To-day these are my treasure-store, My everlasting home. East Canterbury, N. H.
