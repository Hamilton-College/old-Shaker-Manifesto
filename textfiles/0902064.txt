UNJUSTIFIABLE INDEPENDENCE It is one of the sequels of personal power, even in a public place, that before very long its possessor comes to feel as if he were born to it, and in no way personally amenable to the people. Unconsciously, almost, he comes to feel an immunity of responsibility and of action. This is never good for him ; and in a republic, at least, he must be forever held re- sponsible to the people who have uplifted and hold him. â€” Mary Glemmer
