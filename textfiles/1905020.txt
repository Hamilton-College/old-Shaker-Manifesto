Y., have always given a great deal of attention to hygiene, and their secular reading includes journals like the Scientific American, Journal of Chemistry, New York Tribune, Boston Herald, American Agriculturist, and the Sanitary Engineer, all of which are in their reading room. During a brief stay in the community we had an opportunity of seeing how carefully they attend to sanitary matters. It seems singular that a community whose main thoughts are turned toward spiritual things and to preparing for another life should be so zealous to secure bodily health. The results of this care and attention are shown in the remarkable vigor and longevity of all their members; and their example might well be followed by more worldly-minded people. The tombstones in their cemetery record numerous deaths among the nineties, and we were struck with the fresh and lively interest which an elder past eighty showed in conversation on general topics. The Shaker doctrine as regards hygiene is simple, and includes plain and wholesome food, manual labor for all, early and regular hours, and good ventilation. The latter is a constant study. Slats are placed in every window to make an opening between the two sashes, so that there shall always be an influx of atmospheric air. Small holes along the base-board in all of the halls aid this end. In the gathering rooms are round openings from out-doors; just below the steam radiators, to supply fresh air, and the central (student) lamps have vent pipes to carry off the products of combustion ; in addition, all beds are stripped and windows kept open to it sure an ample circulation of air. They have a copious and pure supply of water brought from a distance with a heavy pressure, GOIbs. The wooden conduit has just been replaced by a cement pipe and the storage reservoir enlarged. All rain water from roofs is utilized for laundry purposes. The laundry itself is a model of convenience and neatness, and is a curiosity from the fact that all the fittings were put in by the Shakers themselves. The washing, wringing, and drying apparatus is simple, yet perfect, and nothing seems wanting. The sanitary arrangements are well worth imitating. In each dwelling there are baths, sinks, and w. c.'s, all well ventilated, while the out-door privies, which are more generally used, are treated much the same as earth closets, the material being taken away every few days and composted. The house drainage, which is mostly kitchen waste, is conveyed to an open drain which encircles an orchard and is not offensive, while it is very serviceable to the growth of the apple trees. The Shaker regard for cleanliness is strikingly shown in the milking room in the huge stone barn, which is wonderfully clean and neat, while the arrangements for carrying off and preserving the manure are very ingenious. The Shakers are a progressive people, and are always experimenting with new devices. When the farmers in the vicinity want to buy new implements or machinery they usually call and see what the Shakers are using, and what they think will serve best for the purpose. To have gained the endorsement of the Shakers for his wares is a great card for a manufacturer or dealer, and one man remar ed that 'he would rather do a piece of work for them for nothing than make a bad job of it, as their good will was not to be despised.' Another noticeable thing is the solidity and durability of everything that the Shakers construct. Their walls seem as if laid for all time, and the thoroughness with which every detail of workmanship�both indoors and out�is executed would draw tears from a 'jerry' builder, and recalls the work of past days when men labored with a conscience. My visit was limited to the North Family, one of the seven communities that compose the New Lebanon society. The Elders informed me that their careful attention to hygiene has a theological basis, they believing that science and religion, 'truly so called,' are one and the same. � Charles F. Wingate, in Journal of Hygeio-Therapy. HOW TO DETECT LEAD IN WATER. The salts of lead give rise to serious symptoms, among which may be mentioned colic, gout, rheumatism, kidney disease, paralysis, blindness and insanity. The physician may feel quite at a loss to account for these phenomena until he detects lead in the water his patients are accustomed to drink. The test is very simple. Water containing even a trace of lead will be turned blue on adding a little of the tincture of cochineal. The Sanitary Volunteer.
