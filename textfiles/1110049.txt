Service SERVICE. ''Not all that is high is holy ; Not all that is sweet is good ;' Not every desire Toward which we aspire Pleases our God as it should. Sometimes the joy that we covet Is not a joy when possessed; And to labor right on Till our duties are done Is better, far better than rest. He who by pride is exalted, He who as monarch is known, Less honored may be By the Master than he Who stands at the foot of the throne. Far better it is to be humble, To serve in the lowliest place, To labor and plod With the veriest clod Than the likeness of God to efface. Brethren's Advocate.
