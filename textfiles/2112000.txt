THE KENTUCKY REVIVAL. By Richard M'Nemar of Union Village, Ohio. Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 12. Account of the Progress of Shakerism among the Revivalists. The flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh; these are contrary the one to the other, so that every person according to the principle by which he is governed, whether flesh or spirit, will conceive, judge of, and denominate things around him. Hence, Avhat is food and medicine to one man, may be poison to another; what one calls truth, another calls error; what is the work of God to one, appears the work of the devil to another, and even the happiness of one may be the misery of another. The same thing is often distinguished by names directly opposite, according to the sense of different persons. He who was called the Son of God by some, was denominated by others, the prince of the devils. What one calls Shakerism another calls the testimony of Jesus Christ, and a Shaker in the language of some, is by others called a true Believer, a child of God, a follower of the Lamb. What is still a greater contradiction, that which is called a work of redemption by some, others distinguish as a work of the deepest delusion. From this diversity in the sense and language of mankind, it will be necessary to treat of this religion in a twofold order. 1. According to the real sense and understanding of those who have embraced it. 2. As it is addressed to the external senses of mankind in general. In each part of the history, impartiality requires that I use the names of distinction and modes of expression peculiar to each. Accordingly I shall proceed in the first place to give a brief account of the entrance and progress of the testimony of Jesus the Christ, among the subjects of the revival in Kentucky and Ohio. Great expectations had been formed by the subjects of the revival of something very great to take place in the summer of 1805, in which God would especially answer their ten thousand prayers, in delivering them from sin and opening the way into the holiest of all, pursuant to which, the same spirit that had convinced them of sin, inspired them to pray and confidently look for deliverance from it, and stirred up such warm expectations of its near approach. That spirit, on the first day of the first month, in the same year, dispatched three men,ï¿½John Meacham, Benjamin S. Youngs, and Issachar Bates from the Church at New Lebanon, in the state of New York, with the testimony of Jesus the Christ, and as living witnesses of God, to open and confirm to the people, that way, and only way out of sin; that complete salvation which they themselves had found, and that everlasting life and glory of which the Church in that place was in possession. They arrrived in Kentucky about the first of March, tarried a few days at Paint-lick where they were kindly entertained; from thence they journeyed to Cane ridge and spent a few days among the subjects of the revival in that place, by whom they were treated with unfeigned respect. From thence they passed over into Ohio, and paid their first visit to Springfield, but without exercising particular labors in any of those places ; they prosecuted their journey until they arrived at Turtle-Creek, near Lebanon, on the 22nd. of the same month. They came first to Malcham Worley's and tarried with him over night, and the next morning they came to my house, which was the first means by which I knew that a church or people by such a name existed upon earth. We spent the remainder of the day principally in conversation on the most interesting points in religion, and from the evidence I could collect, I judged them to be men of honest principles, singular piety, and deep understanding in the things of God, and as such I determined to treat them so long as their deportment was correspondent. Some of their conversation I could not so well understand; a number of things appeared new, but considering the copious field of truth, too extensive for my comprehension, I was rather disposed to hear and learn more of God, than to shut out everything that was not included in my little sphere of knowledge. The next day was the Sabbath, and as they desired to know whether the rules of our meeting would admit them to speak in public, provided they had a feeling so to do, I answered that I knew of nothing to hinder. I was sensible the spirit of the revival, as well as that of our wholesome government, imposed no restriction on any man from testifying his faith, nor bound the conscience of any from hearing whoever they chose, and upon this principle, the door was fully opened for them to make any labors at Turtle-Creek, either in public or private to which they conceived they were com missioned. Accordingly, Issachar Bates and Benjamin Youngs attended the meeting and opened the testimony of Jesus Christ, which might all be summed up in this one saying. 'If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whosoever will save his life- shall lose it; and whoso ever will to his life for my sake shall find it.' From their own feelings, as well as in behalf of the Church from whence they came, they expressed great union with the work of God that had been for years past among the people, convicting them of their sins and pointing out by words, signs and many other ways, the door of hope for salvation ; but they further testified that the time was now come for them to enter into actual possession of that salvation, of which they had received the promise that the way to attain it, was by selfdenial, taking up a full cross against the world, the flesh and all evil in our knowledge, and following Christ; walking as he walked, and being in all things conformed to him, as our pattern and head. Particularly according to St.' Paul, becoming dead with Christ to the rudiments of the world, dying unto sin once, rising with him to a new, spiritual and holy life, and ascending step by step in a spiritual travel, and separating 'farther and father from the course of a corrupt and fallen nature, until we arrive at the perfect stature and measure of the sons of God. That the first step in this saving work, was to confess all our sins, and when we confessed them, forsake them forever. And wherein we had injured and defrauded any one, to made restitution ; in so doing we should find mercy ; and being faithful, should receive that measure of the holy spirit, which would be an overcoming power, not only sufficient to keep us out of all actual sin and defilement, but to cleanse and purify both soul and body from the very nature of evil. These things they delivered, not as mere speculations, but as things that had for many years been reduced to practice, and established by the livingexperience of hundreds in the church of Christ, to be the way and only way of God ; the one door of hope for a lost soul, and the sure entrance into the righteous, peaceful and holy kingdom of God's dear Son. They did not pretend to direct others in a wray which they themselves had not travelled but testified that with these plain terms of the gospel, they had complied; and the substance of the promise they had received, and could say without boasting or dissembling, that they had received that overcoming power, w'hich kept them faultless before the throne of God, even in the presence of his glory, was a matter that greatly concerned us. That as Christ had now made his second appearance, for a final settlement with every soul of man, and as God had wrought so great a wrork among us, in waking up, enlightening and preparing us to make a final choice; and by a special gift of his spirit, had sent us his everlasting testimony of truth, we ought to be very cautious how we treated it. Such as were illuminated in the great and marvelous light of the revival, to see the evil nature of sin, and stirred up to seek the way out of It, and had the only way of God opened to them, if they should reject it, their case must be deplorable. Although the light and power of the spirit might have been again and again restored to such as fell into sin, while they had not the proper means of keeping out of it, yet when those means were of- fered, should they be rejected, there remained no more protection for such a soul, but they must lose the salutary effects of their former light, and fall under the power of the wicked one. Upon this principle, the subjects of the revival must either embrace the present call of God, and in obedience thereto take up the cross and follow Christ, or gradually lose the extraordinary effusions of the spirit they had been under, and leaven back into a more corrupt and deplorable state than ever. If a historian cannot be disinterested and unbiased it is necessary that he be honest; therefore I acknowledge that nothing ever presented itself to me that so powerfully interested my feelings as the above testimony. Although I was not wholly unbiased, I can say with propriety, I was far from being biased in its favor. A thousand objects presented themselves to bias me against it. But its intrinsic weight, the importance of the work that was past, the salvation of thousands that hung upon the point of its termination, and that of my own soul with the rest, balanced the weighty demands of the three insatiable idols of time, and held me at least upon an equilibrium for several weeks, so that without prepossession or predetermination, I could candidly investigate the subject, ready to go with the weight of evidence, whereever it should preponderate. During this interval, my searches and researches into the Scriptures, their history, precepts, promises and prophecies, the signs of the times, my own past experience in religion for fifteen years, the nature of the past extraordinary work, and the present state of the subjects of it, with all the rest of the professors of Christianity with the many questions and answers that passed in conversation, were they all written, would swell into a large volume. In this kind of exercise I was not alone. The general agitation may be in some measure conceived of, from the following letter, dated Caneridge, April 2, 1805. (to be continued.)
