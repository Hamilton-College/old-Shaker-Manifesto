Harvard, Mass. April, 1895. The long tedious winter has finally left us, after holding us in its icy embrace till the last of the month. Not a spring note was heard during the month, save on one sunny day a bluebird uttered one feeble song, and then disappeared not to come again till it could hail tl.-e month of showers. The farmers have the wo;id securely housed, and are now busily engaged making preparations for seed time. It has been arranged for our South family to remove from their present home to live in our Church family. The removal takes place about the 18th of April. 'ihey will be heartily welcomed. In concentrating our forces ti-ere is strength. Our aged ones have endured the severity of the season remarkably well and all have been free irom illness, with tLe exception of an epidemic of colds which soon left us. Our centenarian, Br. Ezra Newton is very feeble and needs constant care. He has been growing more feeble since the celebration of his one hundredth birthday. In these troublous times we have much cause to offer oblations of praise to the Father of mercy and justice. By living by the revelation of his spirit we have a peace that the world can not give neither can it take it away. Marcia M. Mallard.
