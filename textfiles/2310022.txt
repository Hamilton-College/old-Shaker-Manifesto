Enfield, N. H. Sept. 1893. 'The more a man deny himself the more the Gods bestow.' Not a bestowal of this world's goods for creature comfort, but a peace of mind, which always comes, if it is enjoyed at all, through self-denial and sacrifice. If the example of our Savior, Mother, and many other noble ones who have fought the good fight are of value, they certainly proclaim these conditions, as necessary to the highest state of usefulness and happiness. What do the numerous suicides by the wealthy teach, other than that the path to even a tolerable contentment in this world is not one of luxury, but honest work for the good of others? ' We as United Societies, are neither rich nor poor, do not profess to take any advantage of our communal possessions, let us often 'sit alone with conscience,' and inquire how loyal we are to our sucred Covenant. We acknowledge the kindness of our sister Society at Canterbury in sparing Br. Albert Evans to make us a visit, at this busy season; one is better than none, but as our Sister Jessie Evans,, has been with us teaching, we shall call it two, and be very grateful, as becomes brothers and sisters of one household, all working for the good of the whole, and that whole, not confined to any locality. Over five hundred feet of 8 inch iron pipe is being laid by Brethren, which furnishes water power at laundry and dairy, the wooden tube having out-lived its usefulness, unless it be to test the patience of Br. John C innings and others who have repaired it; we have had brooks of various sizes in summer, and ice to match in winter for several years, so one source of vexation to the spirit will be removed. Thanks to all the writers and well wishers of the Manifesto now and ever. Mary Ella Briggx.
