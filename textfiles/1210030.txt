Jerusha Smith , at Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. August, 21. Age, 82 years, 5 mo. and 8 days. She closed her earthly pilgrimage as she had lived, full of grace, honor, dignity, firmness and tranquility. She arose in the morning as usual and while sitting at the table for breakfast was paralyzed and became helpless. She was taken immediately to the infirmary, and at the close of three hours, passed quietly to the realm where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. C G. Reed.
