BABYLON IS FALLEN. Hail the day so long expected! Hail the year of full release ! Zion's walls are now erected, And her watchmen publish peace; From the distant coasts of Shinar, The shrill trumpets loudly roar, Babylon is fallen! is fallen! is fallen! Babylon is fallen, to rise no more! Hark, and hear her people crying, ' See the city disappear ! Trade and traffic all are dying! Lo, we sink and perish here! Sailors who have bought her traffic, Crying from her distant shore, ' Babylon is fallen ! is fallen ! is fallen ! Babylon is fallen, to rise no more! ' All her merchants cry with wonder, ' What is this that's come to pass?' Murmuring like the distant thunder Crying out, A/as! Alas! Swell the sound, ye kings and nobles! Priests and people, rich and poor ! Babylon is fallen ! is fallen ! is fallen ! Babylon is fallen, to rise no more! Lo, the captives are returning! Up to Zion see them ny ! While the smoke of Babel's burning f Rolls across the darkened sky! Days of mourning now are ended, Years of bondage now are o'er, Babylon is fallen ! is fallen ! is fallen ! Babylon is fallen, to rise no more! Zion's children raise your voices, And the joyful news proclaim ! How the heavenly host rejoices ! Shout and echo back the same! See the ancients of the city, Terrified at the uproar ! Babylon is fallen ! is fallen! is fallen! Babylon is fallen, to rise no more !
