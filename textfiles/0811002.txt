MISTAKEN SOULS HORTENCY G. HOOSER Mistaken souls, are those who think to be saved from sin and sorrow, by the blood of Jesus, Avithout their own endeavors, to work out their salvation with fear and trembling ; as verified by the precepts and example of Jesus. Let no man say that he is a Christian, except he can say in the language of Christ that his own arm, is bringing salvation to him. Again, mistaken souls, are those who find their way into Societies of Communists with no higher motives than to spend easy lives at the expense of the faithful seiwants of the vineyard ; and expecting, ''the penny,' as promised. That penny is salvation from sin and sorrow—this they do not find ; but they do find an outward cleansing, with food, clothing and comforts for the outer man. These things all enjoyed, constitute a great salvation. Thousands, have the Shaker communists saved from cold, hunger and destitution ; but this is not being saved from sin and sorrow ; for alas ! we soon find such ones, begin to sin against the regulations of Society, and break the peace, by finding fault, wishing to direct, and to correct the leaders in this, that and other things. These assumptions are not received ; and soon they are offended, and thus the reward of their own sin brings sorrow, and their absence. But let the honest seeker after l'ighteousness, live up to Shakerism ; and he will find complete salvation and redemption from sin ; and be enabled to become pure and peaceable, feeling a just relationship to the church of Christ on earth—in full communion with the angels in heaven, and be accepted of God —the Father and Mother above.
