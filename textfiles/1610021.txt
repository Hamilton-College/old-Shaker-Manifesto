THE SPIRIT LIFE. [ Contributed by Elder F. W. Evans.] Mr. James M. Durkee of Pittsfield Mass., and the late Isaac Auger of Shaker Village, Hancock, Mass., had a very interesting conversation on the subject of the Spirit Life, of which Mr. Durkee tells in the following letter to Elder Evans. Pittsfieli), Mass., May 14, 1886. Elder F. W. Evans, op, Mt. Lebanon, Col. Co., N. Y.�My Dear Si�:�Several weeks ago I promised to give you some points of a most remarkable conversation which I held with the late Isaac Auger of Hancock, Shaker Village, West Pittsfield, Mass. I had known and done work (job printing) for Mr. Auger, for the last twenty-four years, and I never knew him to spend twenty minutes in conversation upon any subject before. He seemed unlike himself upon this occasion He entered my office about 9.30, A. M. and remained some two hours. The subject of Spirit Life had been strongly impressed upon my mind by the Sunday school exercises,, in which I had been engaged the previous Sabbath day. After being seated, I remarked, ' Mr. Auger, what is your opinion regarding Spirit Life, also, that of the Shakers generally? ' He answered, 'Spirit Life is, as I understand it, the invisible existence. The visible life is a figure of the invisible, for 'The invisible things of Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his invisible power and Godhead revealing a dual deity� a Heavenly Father and a Heavenly Mother.'' 'Spirit Life is all about us, it is everywhere, as is God, in whom we live and move and have our being. Those who were once in visible conditions, as we now are, are with us, influencing us to a greater or less degree. And, through proper mediums, they can communicate. Not so much at present, as when God's plans are more completely fulfilled. The world's people, and even Church people, fail in a great degree to comprehend the spirit teaching of Jesus. He said, ' My words they are Spirit and they are life. ' And Paul said, ' The things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal. Day by day, year by year, the Spirit Life or condition is to be more and more manifest. As the morning sun dispels the shadows of night, so the glory of God�of the Spirit Life-1�is to remove the darkness of earth life. God is Spirit, and all things must be made like himself, spiritual, or there could be no eternal existence. ' Again, I asked, Mr. Auger, What will become of those who reject Christ while in the earth condition?' He answered, 'They will be burned up, as we are taught by Malachi, ' For behold the day coraeth that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble and that day that cometh shall burn them up, saiththe Lord of Hosts.' The greater part of the Bible is in figurative, parabolical and symbolical language, and the above quotation is figurative of the eternal power of God that operates to the destruction of evil. It will be burned up and sin will cease from the universal dominion of God. ' And the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth, as the waters cover the bottom of the sea.' Ezekiel: 'Son of man the House of Israel is to me become dross ; all they are brass and tin andiron and lead in the midst of the furnace.' As I would say, they go into a furnace of fire, receiving the full recompense of all sin, until they acknowledge their sins and become loving and obedient to God. Understand me now as using the word hell in the same manner that Malachi uses the word furnace. A suffering process will continue until purification is effected. A melting, fiery operation until the dross of evil lusts of flesh and mind are purged away, for he will thoroughly purge his floor, separating chaff and wheat, the good and evil. ' This will I believe, be the ordeal through which every spirit will pass. God is love. And all things in Heaven and earth, in this visible world and in the invisible world, must be purified and sanctified by the love of God our Heavenly Father and Mother. ' Elder Evans, there are many other points he touched upon, and altogether it was one of the most wonderful sermons to which I ever listened. When he came into my office that morning for a small job of printing, lit- tie did I expect from him such a singular and unique discourse as he delivered, and which I can but partially recall and imperfectly record, and that it would be the last time I should ever see and hold converse with hini in this life, for he soon afterwards passed into the Spirit Life which he had been so fluently and feelingly discussing, and which left such an indelible impression upon my mind and feelings. I give to you these thoughts because I have ever since been impressed so to do, for the benefit of his many friends in West Pittsfield, Mount Lebanon and in Pittsfield proper, where he was for so many years well and favorably known. Elder Evans, I have now fulfilled my promise to you, in recording as nearly as I possibly can in his own language, my last interview with Mr. Isaac Auger. As I said from the first,.it was printed upon my mind as with indelible ink never to be erased. Very Respectfully, James M. Durkee.
