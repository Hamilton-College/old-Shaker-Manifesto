MY SHIPS THOMAS SMITH When my ships come in from the foreign shores, From across the sea, . The precious wealth of the sunny lands They will bring to me. You laugh and you say they are fairy ships, But how should you know ? For I sent them out with their sails afloat, Long—long ago. One ship is Love, and she courses on Under Faith's command ; And the shining cloud of Hope leads on Like a guiding hand. And Charity, with her colors out, And her white sails spread, Steers on through the winds and waves of life, To the port ahead. I've watched and waited their coming in, Though, as yet, in vain, Still I know they're breaking the swelling waves Of the rocky main. Sometimes I see the black clouds rise In the northern sky, And I know by the breath of the old storm king, That he's thundering nigh. And think of my ships, far out at sea, On the heaving blue, And then I think of the trusty hearts Of my trusty crew. And I laugh at my weak and foolish fears, For at once I see, That the Father holds in his mighty hand, Both the land and sea. But when the fav'ring winds blow calm, And the summer sun Go^th down in a haze of blue and gold, When the day is done, Ah ! then I think of my ships afar On the billows blue ; And again I think of the happy hearts Of my happy crew. And my heart grows light, for I see and know, That through day and night, Through calm and storm, will the beacon glow, With the promise bright. My ships ! my ships ! ah, yea, they'll come, From across the seas. They'll come with their snowy sails afloat In their native breeze. My happy hopes are not in vain, Nor my trustings o'er, For I know they'll come across the main— From the foreign shore. Canaan, N. Y.
