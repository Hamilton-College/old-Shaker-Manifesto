FRIENDSHIP. By Isabella Bussell. True Friendship ! what a sacred trust To hold unharmed, through time and change; Whatever joys, or ills betide ; To keep within our vislon*s range. That star so beautiful and bright, Which through all ages should endure, A solace kind, a beacon light To guide us on to paths more pure. And yet, alas ! how oft this tie Is broken by an unkind word, And hearts that once were pure and true Unto their deepest depths, are stirred With jealousy and cruel hate Engendering deeds of vice and erime Befitting more, the beasts of prey Than man, the human, the divine^ Who, then would willingly forego, The pleasure, which true friendship brings, Or sacrifice life's higher joys, For lower, baser, meaner things ? *Tis love alone can conquer hate, And light the darkness comprehend, While error vanishes from sight, As truth's effulgent beams extend. Then let us strive while life remains To cultivate these graces rare, To work and toil for other's good, And in their joys and sorrows share. To scatter blessings by the v/ay, As on our upward march we go, Will make the journey seem less drear, And help assuage another's woe, We may not always know the cause, That fills another's heart with pain \. Far wiser, then indeed, for us From words of censure to refrain:. And who can tell the grand results. Arising from our lives below ? Tf all our energies are bent, In doing good where'er we go.
