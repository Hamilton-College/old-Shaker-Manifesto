Deaths. Fanny Taylor Fanny Taylor, at Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Aug. 17, 1892. Age 86 yrs. 6 mo. We say to her: Go, dear Sister, with the angels; Go and dwell with the unseen; Thou hast reared a noble structure, Palace fit for any queen. Go in peace, the angels call thee; Enter in the joyous rest. Take thy seat 'mid queens and princes, For by heaven thy soul is blest. ,T. E. S.
