Beyond the Sunrise [Contributed by F. W. E.] BEYOND THE SUITEISE. This is really a new book. The authoress tells unpopular truths in a fascinating style. To see it, is to read it. One can not afford to lay it by without eating it. Its presentation of Ann Lee's mission is boldandfree. Revelation ; Spiritualism ; Duality of Deity ; Probation in a future life; Intercommunication of the dead and living; Two orders, composed of those who choose the Family social relation, and those who choose the Kesui-rection Life on earth; The political equality of woman, with an Order of male and female Celibates to fill all Civil Offices ; are succinctly but pleasantly set forth, with many other topics intensely realistic and interesting to be best learned from the book itself.
