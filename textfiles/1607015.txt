We believe in Revivals. In revivals of lively, living faith and a whole soul full of good works. In the manifestation of the spirit of God which gives men and women voices to speak, and to sing, and to pray for a steadfastness in righteousness. In revivals to pray without ceasing, and to renew all promises and pledges that our lives shall be in the light. Revivals that shall develop a righteousness to walk humbly, love mercy and to make the possessor a better man, and the whole world better for his presence in it. Revivals for the Christian are as essential for his spiritual growth as is food for the body. He arises refreshed and covenants anew to walk more closely with God. Revivals are angels of mercy. Their mission is to do good, and whether they stimulate new life for better and xnore consistent care for the health and protection of the body, or awaken new thoughts of heaven and heavenly things, they should always be welcome messengers. They may come as the angels of God come. Come to us when we are in the house of worship, when we are in great joy, or when we are in deep sorrow. They may come when we are in the active duties of life, or when we sit in meditation. Everything from which we may draw our lessons tells us in the plainest language that the manifestation of a new life is our sign of spiritual success. The church of Laodicea was severely ad^ monished because it rested so securely on its then present attainments. It had grown careless of its gospel mission, and the spirit of indifference was in the ascendency. It was neither dead nor alive ! How sad was the state of that church, and how sad is the state of any church that falls into the same channel and drifts on toward the world. Christian men and women are expected to put on Christ and then to abide in his doctrine ; and the promise of eternal life is only to that class who wear the yoke and bear the cross of daily selfdenial. Whatever this may mean to those who are baptized into the spirit of righteousness, and have made their garments pure and white in the life of the Son of God ; it is susceptible of abundant variations in those who are traveling from the low and degraded conditions in which man is sometimes found. None are so low but that they may be reached and become the recipients of 2;ood gifts, and none are so well grounded in the faith and in the life of Christ, that they may not be made better by a '' refreshing from the presence of the Lord.' JULY, 1886. In every effort that is made for the growth of the mind in manners, morals or religion we can recognize the manifestation of God's loving kindness. The revivalist who engages in this work may be but a little in advance of his hearers, and make sorry work of calling the unregenerate to repentance, as he has such a crude idea of the power of the words which he employes. In this class we sometimes find those whose illustrations of a Christian life are coarse and strangely in harmony with a correct use of the English language. One ray of light, howrever, is better than none, and the acceptance of so small an amount may possibly turn the hearer from some physical or spiritual sin, and through this lead him to begin the journey of eternal life. This ministration of God's universal love comes when we are ready to accept it. 'Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you.' To obtain the kingdom of heaven, is in the spirit of the parable, like seeking for the treasure that was hid ia the field. Briers and thorns may encumber the ground and the work of examination prove anything but pleasant. Iu this anxiety for good, hope keeps the heart alive! Toil on, toil on till the good treasure of God's love is found. Faithful and zealous|servants who are working for the elevation of man, by making him think of better things, by the publication of good books, and by the awakening of an enquiring mind, may be found in every nation and in every class of intelligence. Those who are privileged to occupy an elevated position and can see the great necessity for information should welcome every messenger that brings the gospel to the poor, or brings the spirit of peace down to suffering humanity. God works by whom he will, for his 'tender mercies and loving kindness are over all.'
