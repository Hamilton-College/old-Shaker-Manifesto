INVOCATION TO ANGELS. ARABELLA SHEPARD. [The following lines were written by Sister Arabella at the age of eighty five years.] Angels guard my erring footsteps, While life's mazy path I tread, Till my days grow long and weary, Till the morn of life is tied. Till the deep'ning shades of evening, Gather round my sinking form. Then kind Angels sent from Heaven, When the night of death shall come; Lead me safely through the valley, Take, Oh, take my spirit home, Angels take my spirit home. When I fly my homeward journey, Grant me wings as pure as thine, Place a crown upon my forehead, There forever more to shine. On a harp of heavenly music, Teach my willing hands to play Anthems such as angel choirs, Chant through everlasting day. Holy Angels sent from Heaven, When the night of death shall come, Lead me safely through the valley, Take, Oh, take my spirit home, Angels take my spirit home. When my evening sun is setting, Gently let the shadows fall, When I leave this earthly temple To obey the Master's call. Guide me through the chilling waters, Light my pathway to the tomb ; Rob the arrow of its sharpness, And the churchyard of its gloom. Gentle Angels sent from Heaven, When the night of death shall come, Lead me safely through the valley, Take, Oh, take my spirit home, Angels take my spirit home. North Union, Ohio.
