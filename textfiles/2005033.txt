Dear Manifesto:--I thought I would write you a short letter... Sonyea, N. Y., Feb 13, 1890. Dear Manifesto :ï¿½I thought I would write you a short letter. I came amonu: Believers August 10, 1889 and like it here very much. I go to meeting every Sabbath-day, and also to Bible class every Wednesday evening, both of which I never fail to enjoy. I tried to answer a few questions in the November number of the Manifesto. I will now close. From your friend, Seward J. Parks.
