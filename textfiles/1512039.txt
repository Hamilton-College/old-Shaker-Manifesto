CARE OF THE SICK. A Sic'K-Roojr should always be one or peace and quietness, things used in the sickroom should be kept neat and clean also physicians should try to make it as pleasant for the patient as possible treating them with the utmost kindness and giving them all the attention possible to make them happy.. Patients should not be worried and visitors should not come to see patients very often as they are liable to become exhausted. Nellie.
