Dear Editress : — We are pleased with the new form your much admired paper has assumed. We have ever cherished the idea that woman possesses God-given faculties; and that she lias an inherent right to exercise her powers of body and mind freely. And, in this day of Christ's second appearing, it becomes her duty to take a firm stand in aiding the great work of progress in its onward march, which must, sooner or later, revolutionize all man-made systems and creeds; and your little paper seems to us the best exponent of the dual principle, recognized by the Shakers, of any thing that has yet appeared. And coming, as it does, fresh from tke intellects, and warm from the hearts of its con- tributors, it enlivens our feelings, while we increase in gratitude to God that we are numbered with the little flock who are receiving such bountiful blessings. Great coldness is manifested in this section of country in regard to religious matters. Religion is of secondary importance. But in our Zion home we earnestly pray to God for the protection of His heritage, and for the advancement of truth throughout the land. We believe that His hand is not shortened, but He is still able to save all who call upon Him—to open eyes that are blind, and unstop ears that are deaf. And we wish your little craft much success, now that she is loosed from her moorings, and launched upon the waters, freighted with golden treasures. God grant that she may bear light and truth to this sin-darkened land. And should she, at times, be tempest-tossed on the billows of opposition, we have faith that she will out-ride all storms, and come safely into port; and that each successive trip her value will be enhanced, because she will be better appreciated. We would hold up the hands of those who are so nobly defending the cause of purity and righteousness ; for the zeal manifested is worthy of all commendation and support from every Zion traveler who loves God more than mammon ; and who, from his or her heart, desires to perpetuate true principles and that living faith which will elevate and regenerate fallen humanity. And we will renew our pledges to battle for the right with increased zeal, and to move straight forward in duty with unbroken ranks, and to renounce all that is self-pleasing, that we may do the will of God. 'Our work is before us, and our reward will be with us;'— we shall reap what we sow. And may we leave behind us, as the poet aptly said, 'Footprints on the sands of time; Footprints that perhaps another, Sailing o'er life's solemn main,— A forlorn and shipwrecked brother Seeing, may take heart again.'
