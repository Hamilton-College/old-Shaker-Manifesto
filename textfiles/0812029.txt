Here is what Prof. Swing... Here is what Prof. Swing has to say of the yellow fever: The yellow fever is only the general unreasonableness of city existence. It is a final outbreak of pent up forces. The human constitution can endure dirt and bad food and bad air for a time. A powerful race may resist disease for ten or twenty years, but at last the steps become feeble and the enemy in the air and in the blood makes the assault. We call this enemy yellow fe- ver, or small-pox, or cholera, or scurvy, or plague, but under any of these names it is only the final shape of unwisdom. Man looks after his commerce and neglects his physical laws.
