Center Family Dec, 1892. The Christmas season is fast approaching, that great season of joy and gladness to all. The great day of all days in the year, when all the world can rejoice and be glad that one was born who has made the world better and happier. The family send their Christmas greeting to their friends who read the Manifesto and wish them a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Time flies and the seasons come and go, a reminder that we will all soon be in another world and our places filled by others. The winter has been pleasant and very little snow at Mt. Lebanon, and the hills are brown and bare. The family have all been well this winter except a few colds. Thanksgiving day found the family very thankful for the good crops of the last season The Family had the Church Family with us at the morning meeting, a very pleas-: ant season enjoyed by all that were present. On Sunday afternoon, Dec. 11th.,we went over to the North Family to hear. M. M. Pomeroy of New York speak on the religious movements of the day, especially the Salvation Army. He gave a very interesting account of the work in which they are engaged and the good they are doing. With his broad and liberal mind he takes in the whole world, he also freely acknowledges that Believers are a power for good and thinks they should imitate the Salvation Army, in preaching our faith that others may become partakers of our gospel.
