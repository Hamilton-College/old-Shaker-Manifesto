GOOD INSTRUCTION August C. Frederick. If a man fall in the path of sin, be ye ever ready to restore him to the path of righteousness ; do not pass him by, lest by so doing he may fall lower. Consider yourself in his stead. Would you not feel blessed for the kind assistance of a brother in restoring you to the proper path ? If you fail in the first attempt of resurrecting a brother into the path of right, be not weary of well-doing but strive with a stronger will. Help him to bear his burdens and also make them light. If you are wronged do not seek revenge, which only makes you fall lower than the brother you are trying to help up, but return him good, which will be like a blessing to him and for which you will likewise be blessed. 'Love your enemies, do good to those that hate you, and pray for those who despitefully use you;' and 'as ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so to them.' We may have faults of our own, and* should carry them in front of us in order to see them ourselves and our brother's should be carried on our backs ; for how canst thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam in thine own ejTe ? Pull out the beam in thine own eye first, then thou shalt see clearly to pull out the mote in thy brother's eye. White Water, O.
