BOAST NOT OTIS SAWYER Boast not thyself, vain man, oh boast not! For thy life's but a vapor, at best— As the dew of the morning, 'twill vanish away, And thy vesture must lie in the dust. Then seek not for glory—vain pleasure rejectBoast not of thy beauty nor strength ; For the hand of the Lord thy career will detect, And will mete thee strict justice at length. Boast not, vain man, of rank nor of birth— Of one blood are the children of men ! Boast not of thy talents, though they're of great worth, Heaven gave them, they are not thine own. Boast not of thy life, nor thy prospect of age ; Thy sun may go down at noonday; To secure life eternal thy mind should engage, Time is precious, oh do not delay. Earth's boasted joys flit by as a dream, They no lasting comforts afford; But the fiery baptism of Christ, will redeem, 'Twill abide, 'tis Jehovah's own word! Oh boast not of wealth, for at best, 'tis but dross, E'en fine gold will vanish away; But the Pearl of great -price that is gained by the cross, Will endure through an eternal day.
