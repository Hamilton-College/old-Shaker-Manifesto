The religious literature of the United States has reached a volume which astonishes even those who know it most familiarly, writes John Habbeiton in the September Ladies' Home Journal. Religious magazines and weeklies equal the secular periodicals of the same periods in number, and among the contributors are many whose names are well known to general readers. The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health, for September, contains many features of especial merit. The frontispiece is a striking and artistic portrait of Charles Darwin, which accompanies a finely-written description of the great naturalist's home, domestic habits, character, etc., by a literary lady who was for many years his neighbor and friend. Italy is the subject of Dr. Felix L. Oswald's brilliant installment of illustrated Race Studies. Prof. Nelson Sizer continues his series, How to Study Strangers, the Mental Temperament being the topic, which is also profusely illustrated. A phrenograph of the celebrated humorist, Bill Nye, by Prof. Sizer, is exceptionally interesting, being a stenographic report of a personal examination which Mr. Nye underwent incognito. To this are added an excellent portrait and biographical sketch'. Two venerable and eminent friends of the science are sketched by Mrs. Wells in her Phrenological Biographies, viz.: Drs. Joseph Hurford and Samuel Irwin. Following this is the second paper of a philosophical discussion of Approbativeness, with illustrations. The departments of Child Culture, Hygiene, and Anthropology are up to the usual standard, and the editorials are especially strong and comprehensive, the principal of these being the fifteenth paper upon Systematic Moral Education, in which the functions of Conscientiousness are ably considered. Only 15 cents a number, or $1.50 a yr. Address Fowler &amp; Wells, 27 East 21st street, New York. PARLIAMENTARY POINTER PARLIAMENTARY POINTER. The above is a neat little volume designed for the vest pocket, containing all the rules of ordinary parliamentary practices, so arranged as to admit of ready reference while a question is before a meeting and requiring an immediate solution. This can not be said of any other book on parliamentary law. All others seem to have been designed more for study than for use in assembly work. The different phases of this subject (of which every man thinks he knows considerable, and yet very few know more than enough to lead them into blunders) are carefully classified, and in many cases the same point is repeated under different headings, thus furnishing immediately the desired information. By a unique system of easily learned abbreviations the whole subject is brought into a space that can be readily concealed in an ordinary sized hand. To any member of any society, open or secret, the 'Parliamentary Pointer' is worth its weight in gold. It is published by Thos. J. Crowe, Detroit, Mich. Price by mail in flexible cloth cover, only ten cents.ï¿½ The Corruptions of the New Testament Fraternal Tidings. Among the many very valuable publications that are sent out on a mission into the world, is a little work entitled, 'The Corruptions of the New Testament,' published by H. L. Hastings, of Boston, Mass. No one can read this little volume without being much better informed on the subject of the New Testament writings, and certainly they would converse with a clearer understanding of their subject. Price 35 cts. J. K. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
