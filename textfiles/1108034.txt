TRUE GOODNESS ANNIE STEPHENS Where shall we find that wealth of soul, True goodness pure and deep, That worketh by the golden rule Its recompense to reap? Not in the soul whose lips would speak In loud and lengthy prayer, Yet feeleth not for others' needs Their sorrow and their care â€” It glows in smiles of tenderness, In every loving deed; In thrilling tones of sympathy They prove a friend in need. And in the heart, deep rooted there Is its true glory seen ; Shedding a Christ-like radiance, As did the Nazarene. O ever blessed power of gooc, Within my being shine ! And may thy graces lovingly Around my spirit twine. For I would crave the pearls of truth, And purity of heart, To deck my spirit now in youth, And joy to me impart. That mine may be a life made blest By goodness e'er untold; Thus weaving for my spirit form A robe more bright than gold, That dimmeth not by length of years Nor wears by moth nor rust; But brighter grows by deeds well done While in this form of dust. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
