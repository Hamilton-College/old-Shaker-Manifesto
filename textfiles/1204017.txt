Correspondence From the Letter of a Friend, in Pawtucket, E. I. J. [From the Letter of a Friend, in Pawtucket, E. I.] Elder Nicholas A. Briggs ;—I have perused the documents you gave me, on my leaving the Village, and am pleased to say,—That I see no inconsistency in your teachings, more tthan this ;—I am fully persuaded that yours must be a very enjoyable life and expands into peace and happiness, such as few or none atain in their natural living, for the vanities and pleasures of this world. That you emulate the life of Christ is of tself a sufficient guaranty of the nobleness of your aim and commends your life of purity and chastity. I know that he has said, If we would be his disciples, we must deny ourselves and follow him. I here had a train of thought about these matters since reading your circular. I don't know that I am prepared to grasp your theories in their entirety, at once, but they are very feasible if a man would live holily in this world. I feel with the Church, there is too much form, while the power of religion is denied by the life.' Your life and work in the world is not in any degree understood by the masses of the people and only few could be persuaded to accept it did they know of it, because of the lusts of the flesh and the pleasures of life, which in themselves, are only emptiness and leave a sting behind. I am in strong sympathy with you and wish that I was more pure, as He, Jesus, was pure. Accept my thanks for all kindness. Ever yours.
