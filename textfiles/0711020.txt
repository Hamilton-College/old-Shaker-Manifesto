PLAIN TALKS Another edition of Plain Talks— our late pamphlet of 24 pp.—is called for from several directions. We are happily disappointed, in that it proves not to be too ^plain. By some, east and west, it is deemed an invaluable assistant, in answering very many questions most likely to rise in an inquirer's mind. The second edition is entirely exhausted — even novitiate elders we find are pretty close with the bait—and we have had calls for two hundred and fifty copies which we could not supply. So soon as we can get sufficient encouragement to pay for half an edition of one thousand copies, we will trust providence for the means whereby the balance—twenty-five dollars—can be secured. It will be comforting to any to add a missionary to aid in the spread of our gospel work. Five cents each from one-half of the household of faith would print and circulate a very large edition ! Who will take hold of the project?
