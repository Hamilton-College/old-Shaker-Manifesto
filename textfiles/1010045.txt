The Ears .â€” No sharp instrument should ever be used in cleansing out the ears, for they are easily injured. A damp cloth round the end of the finger will do all that is necessary. When children press pebbles, beans, or other substances into the ears it is best to inject warm water with a syringe, and if that does no good consult a doctor; but in no instance should pincers, hooks, etc., be used by the unskilled. The same rules hold good when insects make their way into the canal. Itching is often temporarily relieved by dropping a little warm glycerine into the ear. Boxing children's ears is liable to injure the tympanic membrane and may produce deafness. The same may be said of the use of cold water when allowed to enter the ears. Therefore bathers should plug their ears up with cotton. Strong draughts should also be avoided.
