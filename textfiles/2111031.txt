White Water, O. Deak Editor :�As ic has been a long time since I have written for -'Home Notes�,'&gt; I thought I would write you a few lines. Crops are fair: wheat turned out on an average 18 to 20 bu. to the acre. We had about 700 bu. of wheat. Good prospect for corn. We have been putting down a fine stone walk from tlra family dwelling to the gate ; we also repaired the milk-hou�e, and laid a stone platform in front of it, and a brick walk, so it is fixed pretty nicely. Our Beloved Ministry, Elder Joseph Holden from Mount Lebanon, and Elder Oliver Hampton from Union Village, paid us a flying visit on the 15th. of Sept. The writer recently spent four days at Watervliet, Ohio, and had a very pleasant time. I went to the Soldier's Home on the 18th. ult. and looked about the place. On Sunday, Elder Oliver preached a good sermon, and many thank him for his good advice. I also enjoyed the company of the good Elders while at Watervliet. Many thanks to all the Brethren and Sisters at Watervliet for their kindness to me. Elder Henry Bear and Elder Lafayette Parker made a visit to Union Village on Sept. 28. The farmers in this vicinity are putting in their fall grain. Kindest love to all who read this. H. W. F.
