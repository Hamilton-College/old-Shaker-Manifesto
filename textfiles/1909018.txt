ONE AT A TIME. One step at a time, and that well placed We reach the grandest height; Orie stroke at a time, earth's hidden stores Will slowly come to light; One seed at a time, and the forest grows ; One drop at a time, and the l'iver flows Into the boundless sea. One word at a time and the greatest book Is written and is read ! One stone at a time and the palace rears Aloft its stately head; One blow at a time, and the tree's cleft through, And a city will stand where the forest grew A few short years before. One foe at a time, and he subdued, And the conflict will be won ; One grain at a time, and the sands of life Will slowly all be run ; One minute, another, the hours fly; One day at a time our lives speed by Into eternity. One grain of knowledge, and that well stored. Another and more on them, And as time rolls on, your mind will shine With many a garnered gem Of thought and wisdom. And time will tell, 'One thing at a time and that done well,' Is wisdom's proven rule. Golden Days.
