BRIEF RULES FOR HOLY LIVING Rev. William Wisnee of Ithaca, N. Y., about fifty years ago, drew up a set of rules for Holy Living, to be adopted by the families of his parish. We will strive to keep our minds free from every thought which we believe will be offensive to God. We will not spend our time in foolish jesting or unprofitable conversation, but will consider the very moments precious, and endeavor to fill them up with usefulness to ourselves and others. We will not indulge ourselves, or countenance others, in speaking of the faults of any one, unless it be with a view to do good. We will endeavor to educate our children in such a manner as may make them most useful in the world. We will not suffer any person, not belonging to our family, to reside under our roof, unless he will refrain from all unclean language, from Sabbath breaking, intemperance and all outward wickedness. We will devote a portion cf every day to prayer, to reading the scriptures, and to de vout meditation. Selected.
