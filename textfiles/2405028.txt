Dear Children:--'Watch and keep... Shaker Station, Conn. Deak Children:ï¿½'Watch and keep your garments pure.' Watching is a potent means of escaping the pitfalls of sin. To be on the watch tower faithful as a sentinel, is wisdom. Once alfow the adversary to enter your heart and you may soon be entirely his own. The slightest tendency to wrong doing, left unguarded, will destroy your happiness. Groat danger lies in neglecting to watch in little things. Watch yourselves as precious buds and plants, lest evil influences destroy the lovely flowers of virtue and truth. Nothing but ceaseless vigilance and virtuous living can save you from such a dreadful fate. Virtue is 'the pearl of great price,' and those who possess it have true riches. Shun the malaria of vice, beware when sins entice. Grief and trouble are the wages of sin. Evil proclivities, if not erased, will take root in your mind, spring up and grow, and produce grief and condemnation. There is so much comprised in being watchful. You must have the courage to live above impure thoughts, selfish strivings and sinful desires, as very few do have. You must resist the despotism, tyranny of wrong habits, or there is no safety. It blights the spiiit to live in sin. Beware of 'the flatterer's smile,' is wise counsel. It is more difficult to expel bad guests than to receive them. Strive for good that you may find, watch in heart, soul and mind. You can not be too watchful. Oh this one word, watch, seems more weighty than all others. Jesus said, 'Watch,' and well you may. Watching and praying is profitable employment, and satisfying service. Your innocence can be protected only by unremitting vigilance. 'The still, small voice' is a reminder of these things. Be wise in the present and avoid bitter experience later. Make strong resolutions and keep them. Find your solace in adherance to duty. Strive for pure, victorious living. If I have said that which will encourage you to more watchfulness, then am I blest and happy. Daniel Orcutt.
