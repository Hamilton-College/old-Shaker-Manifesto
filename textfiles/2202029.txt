[The following beautiful letter was received at this Office from the very kindhearted writer and appreciative friend, who, although a stranger to us, has formed a more or less intimate acquaintance with some friends in the Community and has the generosity to present her gift of thankfulness, to the readers of the Manifesto. While there are many unthankful hearts who have shared bountifully of the blessings of God, and the communion of earnest and dearest friends, who are ready at a moment's notice 'to turn and rend you,1' forcibly reminding one of the words of Jesus, and warning us to have special care of the distribution of blessings, it is soulcheering and refreshing to make records of the overflow of thankfulness that wells up as a spontaneous gift to bless those from whom we have received those treasures that make our inner life more pleasant and which the spirit of the world can neither give nor take away.
