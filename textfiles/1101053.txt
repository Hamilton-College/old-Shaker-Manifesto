Neuralgia Neuralgia.— For neuralgia in the face or other acute suffering elsewhere, the following remedy has been tried with good effect: Cut a thick slice of bread all across the loaf — fresh bread is best; soak one side for a minute in boiling water, and rapidly sprinkle cayenne pepper over the hot side; apply while still smoking hot to the painful surface. The bread retains the heat long enough for the cayenne pepper to begin to act, and cayenne does not affect the delicate skin as mustard does. It acts as a rubefacient, but not as a blister.
