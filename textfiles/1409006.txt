THE GOSPEL WORK LIKE A RIVER. MARY WHITCHER. The limpid stream rolls on O'er rocky beds and sandy plain-;. In haste to reach its broader homeï¿½ Salvation's fount, where life obtains ; And here we see the rolling tide Which purifies the fount within, Casting the refuse on each side As doth the heart adverse to sin. Till tins is reached we bear upon Our surface what the world may give. But when obtained our ocean home In ebb and flow to God we live. Canterbury, N. H.
