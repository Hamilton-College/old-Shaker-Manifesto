Break the Seals, Read and Understand! ANTOINETTE DOOLITTLE. ' When I was a child, I spake, understood and thought as a child ; hut when I became a man, 1 put away childish things.' So said Paul in substance. Sometimes it requires a long time to attain to a state of manhood and womanhood, or a condition, where we are able to understandf reason, think and act correctly. I am inclined to think, it is better for children to be taught to fear some one, and reverence something, even if that fear and reverence be somewhat misplaced, and misdirected, than for them to grow up high-headed an 1 strong in their own way and will, regardless of the prayers, tears and entreaties of parents and friends, and devoid of reverence ; upon the principle, that it is easier by far to turn the thoughts and feelings, into a right channel and mode of reasoning, even as it is easier to turn a stream of water into a new conduit, than to search out an entire new source of supply. I call to mind when I was a child, and leaned upon the knee of a pious mother, how she taught me to think of a God in some far off region, who was 'angry with the wicked everyday;' and if we did that which was Avroug in his sight, He would surely punish us. The preachers and singers in those days, seemed to be in perfect accord. The minutrs told of a literal hell; while the selected choir sang :� ' This awful God is ours, He tliundtrs when he please ; He rides Upon the stormy skies, And manages the [seas.' My young receptive mind, imbibed those ideas, and when a roaring thunderclap burst over our heads, 1 thought it Avas the voice of an offended God showing his displeasure at some wrong that mortals had done. I was also taught to reverence the Bible as the word of God ; and what an awful thing it would be ; if any one should take from, or add one word to the Holy Scriptures, which contained all that was needful for mortals to know. However erroneous I now think those ideas were, they were the best that my instructors could give at that time, and were beneficial, many times in keeping me from wrong-doing. As T now read and understand the Scriptures, I venture to enquire without compunction of conscience ;�What is meant by the term Rook, that would be such a diabolical crime to take from or add unto? Thee was a time when the Bible, as a book, did not exist. Was there no word of God previous to what we call the Scriptures of Truth ? Those scriptures were called into being as events transpired ; many of them were written upon parchment or engraven on stone. The art of printing was then unknown ; and for centuries they only existed in a fragmentary state. The Adamic age had its history. 'I he Abrahamic followed. Then the Mosaic dispensation, with its numerous sacrifices and ceremonies, extending over a long period of time. During that period, many Prophets arose, delivered their testimony and then slept with their fathers who had passed on before the*n. In the fullness of time, the many books of the , Old Testament were collected and compiled, many parts of which we think had much better been burned than printed. However, that book, or books, gathered into its present form, was not brought forth all at once in some miraculous way, any more than the temple of Solomon was builded in a moment without preparation. The materials existed, ages before they were gathered from the mountains, and quarried from the earth ; but human labor and skill were requisite to build the temple, and it took time to rear and perfect it. For the sahe of brevity, we Avill pass by the New Testament, with its long history of written and unwritten Gospels, according to the several disciples of Jesus as they have come down to the nineteenth century ; leaving the council and cardinals, who have met in conclave from time to time, to decide what was canonical, orthodox, or heterodox, what should be retained or rejected�and hear what the Revelator John had to say concerning the Book, this book, the Lamb's book of Life etc. upon which so much stress has been laid, and which it would be such a heinous crime to tamper with. The New Testament did not then exist in its present form. I once asked a professed minister of the Gospel, his opinion of' the Apocalypse ; he replied, ' to me it is still a sealed book ; and I do not dare to do much with it; it is too much like getting into an apothecary's shop ; I am fearful I should break some of the vials] ' John, when on the I&amp;lo of Patmos certainly had some marvelous Kevelations; and while in vision, saw and heard many strange things that would come to pass, when the inhabitants of earth were prepared for them. He was instructed by the Angel who opened his inner sight, to write the things which he saw and heard, and seal them, that they might be a witness of the truth, and evidence the spirit of prophecy to incoming generations; when, in the fullness of time, the seals would be broken, and the key to those revelations would be given to inspired men and women, who would be able to unlock the mysteries pertaining thereto ; when the Holy City, the New Jerusalem had descended to earth, and a new spiritual temple erected beautiful in all its parts, containing a throne, and a pure river of life clear as crystal proceeding from that throne. Then will all the mystery pertaining to those utterances and predictions cease, by being fulfilled. Then will idol worship cease, whether in ?:ook form or any other form. Living witnesses will arise who will be inspired as deeply and truly as was John the Kevelator who will speak the truth, and no longer depend upon the letter that killeth. If we could see the heaps of gold and silver that have been paid to a hireling Priesthood for their dry husky explanations of the Book of which we have been writing.�would it not be astounding ! Let the Seals be broken, that we may read and understand ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
