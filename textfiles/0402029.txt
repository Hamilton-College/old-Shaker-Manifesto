Eldress Betsey Bates, in the Spirit Land... Eldress Betsey Bates, in the Spirit Land, sends greeting to the Brethren and Sisters as follows : The Angels in heaven, and saints upon earth, Are blending together in heavenly mirth, Inviting us all to be of good cheer, And greet ev'ry one with 'A Happy New Year!' Though cold-hearted Death, with sharp sickle in hand, May reap from among you, for the immortal land; Yet we 're not divided, our spirits are here, To encourage and strengthen through the coming new year. The Sunbeams of light are shedding their rays; With courage look forward for far brighter days: For faithful Believers are hastening near An increase of the Gospel for the ensuing year. Stand firm in the Gospel, and keep in the Ark; The trumpet is sounding for souls to embark : The blind shall see God, the deaf his word hear. The dumb shall sing praises, and hail the new year. The harvest is great, and the lab'rers are few; There's a work for each faithful Believer to do. Be true to your trust, and be of good cheer, And you will rejoice at the close of the year. Eldress Betsey says : With this receive my affectionate Gospel love; and I should be pleased to have every family share of this Union Greeting. Instrument, E. P.
