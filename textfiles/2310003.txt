TWO SHIPS. H. Muriel Patriarche. I built a ship�a great large ship, And Pride stood at the helm And steered for Fame, that wondrous land And Wealth�bright, golden realm! And Pride was captain, mate and crew, And launched my ship with much ado. 'Now go, my ship, my great, great ship, And laugh the winds to scorn.' And, lo, my ship came back to me All broken, bent and torn! I built a ship, a lowly ship, With modern wings of white, And thought not of bright Wealth or Fame But pleasure rose in sight. Love was my captain, mate and crew, And launched my ship without ado. 'Now go, my ship, lowly ship, Thy modest wings unfold.' And, lo, my ship came dancing back Just weighted down with gold! �Selected.
