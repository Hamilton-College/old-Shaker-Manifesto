'WHAT ARE THE WILD WAVES SAYING?' [Contributed by S. A. Collins.] What are the wild waves saying? Forever the whole day long! Just over, and over, and over! One grand, monotonous song! Who can their language utter? Or tell us the song they sing Who can explain their music, Or tell us the message they bring? I know what the waves are saying An angel told it to me : 'Tis the bass of the heavenly anthem, Struck on an earthly key! 'Tis a part of the grand old chorus They chant in the world above Over and over for ever, In the anthem 'God is Love!' Forever reverberating Thro' all the invisible spheres, The echoes forever resounding Thro' all the eternal years; Forever rolling and swelling, In tonesall tones above The same glad story telling That Godour Godis Love! From the roar of the great Niagara, To the tiniest waterfall From the tides of the mighty ocean, To the smallest ripple of all . Mingling with unheard music, Sung in the heights above, That Godthe God we worship That Godour Godis Love! Go on, then, waves of the ocean, I never will doubt you more; You have brought me a heavenly melody I never had learned before! I could sit and listen forever To your grand monotonous song; I never should wea.y to hear it, Forever the whole day long. Some time, in the blessed future, I shall hear the other parts The tenor, alto and treble, From sainted human hearts: Nay, moreI shall join in the music, Here or in heights above, And sing with the glorified millions, That God, the Lord, is Love. ï¿½Selected.
