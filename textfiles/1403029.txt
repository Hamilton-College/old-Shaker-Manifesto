NOTES NOTES. Whatever else may demand the attention of the professor of Christianity on his pilgrimage through life, the spirit of Christ,�that spirit which made Jesus pre-eminently the Son of God, should become our teacher and protector. It has lovingly promised to lead us into all truth, life, light and knowledge and by a growth in these divine blessings, ultimately, to make us free sons and daughters in the kingdom of our God. ' Let names and sects and parties, Accost mine ear no more ; ' for there can be no intrinsic worth in a name, Avhether applied to religion or philosophy, and there can be no warrantable objection to a faith in God, although in partial obscurity from the wise and prudent of this world. Let os accept, with willing hearts, the spirit and courage of the apostle, and glory in our freedom,, and then with him we may well exclaim,�' What if some do not believe, shall unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid!' And we as unqualifiedly repeat with all the earnestness that our light and experience have given us, God forbid ! That some religious bodies are satisfied to abide in the rudimental work of Christianity is not strange. Accepting one degree of light, they become satisfied and fail to prosecute the journey �which was to make them free in Chri-t. External forms and ceremonies may have captivated the mind and effectually ruled the religious life. The doctrine of water baptism, of laying on of hands, of the physical resurrection and of the literal day of judgment, have like the tithes ot mint, anise and cumin, been the subjects which have claimed the most attention. A rigid exactness has been demanded in these while weightier matters pertaining to* truth and righteousness have been allowed to waste away by utter neglect. The pentecostal spirit has been lost and the church forming an alliance with a secular order, has been represented as walking with the world. ' Just walk with me but a little space, ' Said the world with a kindly air; ' The road I walk is a pleasant road, And the sun shines always there; Your path is thorny and rough and rude,. And mine is broad and plain ; My road is paved with flowers and dew. And yours with tears and pain ; The sky above me is always blue, Xo want or toil I know; The sky above you is always dark; Your lot is a lot of woe ; My path you see is a broad fair one, And my gate is high and wide; There is room enough for you and me, To travel side by side. ' Our lur;e as a religious body must rest upon the faithfulness which is manifested in the order, to abide as living members of a living church upon the foundation which Christ has laid for our salvation. His testimony has been denominated the testimony of the resurrection heavens, as it calls us from dead works into life and light, and out front the tombs and sepulchres Of selfishness and uncleanness into the glory and beauty of the Kingdom of God. Are we right? Can we testify with corresponding boldness and simplicity with the good apostle,�' We know we are of God ! ' It is indeed, better to look up and have courage to do right than to be double-minded and unstable. To be of God we must be pure, be peacemakers, and this state can be reached only through an honest confession of all sin. To encourage us in this work of the cross it has been written, 'If we confess our sins he [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' Nothing short of the acceptance of the divine Spirit and an unclouded honesty can work this effectual change. If we are now able to establish a claim as being among those who have heard the voice of the Son of God, then we certainly have a part in his spirit and in the work of the first resurrection, upon whom the second death can have no power. Christ has given us this assurance, 'I am the resurrection, and the life. ' If we accept this we have no need to wait for some special day, afar off, at the end of time for the reanimation of our earthly bodies, as the life of Christ will dwell in us while on the earth and give us a place in the resurrection from the dead. Having received this heavenly home and the unbounded mercy of God, we might well be called unprofitable servants if we should fail to present them in all their beauty and glory to those less privileged than ourselves.
