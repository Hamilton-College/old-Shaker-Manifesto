GOOD BREAD. I notice articles upon Graham Bread in the Am. Agriculturist and other papers. Perhaps our experience at the North Family, Mt. Lebanon, ma}r be of some interest and service to the public. For many years we have used bread made from wheat of our own raising. We wash the wheat thoroughly, kiln-dry, grind it ourselves, coarsely, use it unbolted, and bake it in a soapstone oven. No leaven in it. It is good wheaten bread. I doubt whether really good men and women, Christians, can be raised upon poor bread, made of adulterated materials and chemically corrupted by leaven. If a clean thing cannot be brought out of an unclean' then how can a good thing be made out of bad materials? Have not a loaf to spare, (unless to feed the hungry,) a bushel of wheat, nor a barrel of flour to sell at any price. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
