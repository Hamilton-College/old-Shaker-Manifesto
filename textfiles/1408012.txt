TEMPERANCE. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. Elder Archibald Meacham of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. was a bright and shining example of temperance in all things. The following incident took place some years ago which is worthy of note. He had been presiding Elder many years, at White Water Village, Hamilton County, Ohio. On his return home to Mt. Lebanon, he called at North Union, which is a half-way house, between the two remote Villages. While at the table one of the sisters asked him what he would like for drink? Water, cold water; said he. Is that all? That is all. She was surprised She began to expostulate with him. Would it not l&gt;e better to heat the water? Nay, I think not! Would you not like to have it sweetened a little? Nay, I think not! What shall I do to make it better? Nothing ' It is good enough. The venerable patriarch, modestly replied. Just let it be, as God made it. I do not think you can make any improvement on God's work. North Union, Ohio.
