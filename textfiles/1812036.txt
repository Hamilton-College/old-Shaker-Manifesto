OUR MODEL. We are the clay, and thou our potter. Mold us, Father, to thy will: Shape us by thine own true pattern, By thy wisdom and thy skill. Measure us by thy perfection, By thy fullness and thy grace; May no flaw or stain or blemish Mar thy image or deface. Round our souls to thy perfection : Try us in the furnace heat Of affliction, if it strengthens, Proves us, makes us more complete. Selected.
