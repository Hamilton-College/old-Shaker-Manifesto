DANCING IN WORSHIP CHAUNCY DIBBLE Singing and dancing are inherent in the dispositions of human beings. It is to those in the vigor of life an outward expression of a thrill of pleasure. The idea has obtained, that all worship must needs be expressed through the medium of the tongue. The virtue of piety is often wrongly ascribed to such as can make eloquent sermons and prayers. Being required to devote our ' bodies a living sacrifice' why should it be considered irreverent or incompatible with Christian dignity to worship in the dance ? Form in itself is only an outward expression of worship. Revivals of spirituality which stir men's souls with deep convictions often produce outward operations. Shouting and playing on the timbrel did not suffice the Israelites when they were delivered from the bondage of Egypt. Those inspired ones on the day of Pentecost did not so restrain their spiritual emotions that they merely sung. Deliverance from the slavery of evil habits and tormenting lusts, and the opening of the spiritual vision to see the beauties of the higher life, fills the aspiring mind with joy inexpressible, and causes the spirit to leap from its shackles of selfishness into liberty and simplicity. 'Twas thus our leaders learned the beautiful order of marching in circles, and other exercises, sacred on account of the sincerity of their souls ; and because kindred spirits drew near, and the door of inspiration was opened. Modern Spiritualism was not a new lesson to our people. From our origin as a peculiar people these manifestations have attended our worship. There can be no circle of mediums more congenial or attractive to spirits than a company of pure and innocent brethren and sisters united in the spirit of Christian love. In such society and under such conditions the higher class of inspirations predominates ; and false spirits are easily detected and excluded. Shakers, N. T.
