TRIBUTE. By Stephen Gowen. BE thou faithful unto death, and 1 will give thee a crown of life.' Rev. ii., 10. This is the promise to the faithful, and I know that our beloved sister, Eldress Eliza R. Smith, who has just passed from our sight, has been faithful unto death, and will receive a crown of life. She has given her life through faithfulness and prayer, to assist others in obtaining the pearl of great price. Her interest was the temporal and spiritual interest of the gospel home, and her anxiety was that the young Brethren and Sisters might become steadfast in the life of Christ. Her advice to those who had set out to win the prize, was to gain it by being true and honest. I ti ust we shall bear in remembrance, this worthy example that has so kindly been placed before us for so many years, and thus honor the memory of our beloved El dress. We read of those who leave large sums of money for some good cause, and we think of them as being very kind, but how much better has been this life to God, which our dear Eldress has given for the protection and happiness of other souls. Let us be faithful unto death, that we also, may win a crown of eternal life. Alfred, Me.
