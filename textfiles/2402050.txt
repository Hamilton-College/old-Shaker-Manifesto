World's Fair Cosmopolitan The second edition of the December World's Fair Cosmopolitan brings the total up to the extraordinary figure of 400,000 copies, an unprecedented result in the history of magazines. Four hundred thousand copies�200 tons �ninety four million pages�enough to fill 200 wagons with 2000 pounds each�in a single line, in close order, this would be a file of wagons more than a mile and a half long. This means not less than 2,000,000 readers, scattered throughout every town and village in the United States. The course of The Cosmopolitan for the past twelve months may be compared to that of a rolling snow-ball; more subscribers mean more money spent in buying the best articles and best illustrations in the world; better illustrations and better articles mean more subscribers, and so the two things are acting and reacting upon each other until it seems probable that the day is not far distant when the magazine publisher will be able to give so excellent an article that it will ciaim the attention of every intelligent reader in the country. 52
