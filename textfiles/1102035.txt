Analytical Concordance In justice to those honorable publishers, I. K. Funk &amp; Co., 10 &amp; 13 Barclay street, NewYork, we would state that they now have for sale Dr. Young's 'Analytical Concordance,' printed under the Doctor's own supervision by government presses in Edinburgh. That there is extant a ' miserably executed reprint,' we are officially informed* and we would warn all who wish to be in possession of this most valuable work of its kind, to shun the spurious edition and buy from the above firm. We have not yet seen the famous work, but that it is immeasurably superior to Cruden's or any other extant, we have been thoroughly assured.
