The i%apid flight of time gives us so little rest between the Notes about Home, that should they all be written in one key, it will be because the vibrations of one have not died away, before it is time to begin the next. This bitter, cold weather is not conducive to many but shivering notes. While such intense cold, with little snow works so much mischief, we realize the wisdom of the Scripture which says, 'He giveth snow like wool;'' for surely with a heavy mantle of snow covering the earth we can so much better bear the Zero weather. Snow as an embankment about the house, closes many a windy passage, and also protects the water pipes; but 'It is an ill wind that blows no good.' The cold without snow gave us an early harvest of clear, good ice which was secured between Christmas and New Years. Thanks to Elder Oliver for considering the August 'Notes.' To his suggestion we heartily say Amen! When we will all agree to more nearly balance our material wants with our needs, we shall all find perhaps, a surplus fund, with'which to enrich the mind and spirit. Amelia J. Calver. South Family. Jan. 9, 1893. We all enjoyed Christmas very much; business was good and consequently we received many gifts for our comfort. These kind feelings were extended to all. Our Sunday school was nicely arranged and all had a good understanding of the old, old story, and that the new birth was to bring, 'Peace on earth, good-will to men.' Elder William Anderson has just had a call from Boston, and walked over the ice better than Pegasus. We hope his trip will be good luck in the temporal line, if not in the spiritual. We are all trying to remember that 'An ounce of prevention is worth (more than) a pound of cure.' The hills are bare and grey, and the sleighs are tucked away. The children are all waiting for a sleigh ride, but we have not foi'gotten, that one year we had more snow in March than we wanted. The snow may come before winter ends. Sarah A. Collins. Center Family. Jan. 13, 1893. Januaby nearly half gone, how the time flies, it seems hard to keep pace with it and yet we can not help ourselves from moving on even if we would. We are busy with the aid of hired help drawing wood and logs and caring for the cattle, sheep and other animals. Ice was harvested by our family in Dec. We stored about as much again as we have been in the habit of doing. The quality was very good and the weather was superb for the occasion. We are sorry to be obliged to part with so many of our number and yet they are all advanced in years the last one to go hence, Br. John Eoss, being nearly seventy-four years old, a sturdy, scotch highlander whose memory we are pleased to hold dear, as he was a true man and Brother. This is not the season of year to make material improvements in external things, but a good time to cultivate and improve home talent, this the Brethren and Sisters are striving to do in a limited way, holding gatherings for learning the songs of Zion, some of which are very beautiful. We appreciate the new book recently published by our dear Canterbury friends. I consider it a nice contribution to our musical store. Timothy Bay son.
