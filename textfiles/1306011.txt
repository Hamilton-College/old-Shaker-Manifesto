TREASURES. MARIA WITHAM. In this selfish, world-engrossed age, how many do we see laying up for themselves treastires, where moth and rust doth not corrupt, and thieves break not through to steal? The great mass of humanity are bending and toiling over heaps ot clay, or dust, glittering with gold, and charming the eye, but not satisfying the heart. They toil, ever grasping more and more eagerly, the implements of feverish labor. They strive with commendable industry and patience, but the end over which they strive is that over which angels weep. 'The things which are seen, are temporal, but the things which are unseen are eternal.' And in being careful and troubled about many things, is it the part of wisdom to forget the better part which can never be taken from us ? , A crown of life stands in infinite contrast to all earthly treasures. Earth-bought honors and distinctions often bring sorrow to the possessor. Earthly pleasure wreathes herself in flowers to captivate willing eyes, and unsanctified learning would persuade the seeker after worldly treasures that there is no glittering crown for the true Christian.
