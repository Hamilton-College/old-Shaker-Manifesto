Portland, Me., May 21,1873 Elder John B. Vance. Friend and Brother : Through the brotherly love of some one, whom I suppose to be yourself, I have, for several months, received the ' Shaker and 8hakeress.' It is a welcome visitor, in several respects. The articles by the Brethren and Sisters are beautifully expressed, and abound in good common sense and true sentiments. It has helped me to appreciate and better understand the basis of your organic system of community. Your doctrine of celibacy in a regenerate plane, I consider favorable to spiritual growth. But this is a great subject. I only intended to say, I thank you for sending me the little pure-minded monthly, and herewith forward 50 cts. to pay for it. I am not afraid to allow my sons and daughters to read it. It is good. Truly your friend, L. F. Pingree
