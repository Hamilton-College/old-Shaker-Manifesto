A Methodist society in Mendon, Vermont... A Methodist society in Mendon, Vt,, has put up about a dozen good horse-sheds at the church. That is practical religion, and worth a dozen exhortations on 'falling from grace ' or sanctification. A man who will hitch his horse to a fence on a cold winter day, and do it for years, while he goes inside the meeting-house to talk aboiit 'faith' and 'love' 'sanctification' and 'election,' lacks some essential feature of the fgospel of Christ. The world wants Â¦more of the Christianity which builds horse-sheds, pays one hundred cents on the dollar, treats the horses kindly, cares for the stock, and is not domineering in the family.
