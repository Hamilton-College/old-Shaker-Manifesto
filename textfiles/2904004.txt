KEEPING BUSY. By Joseph A. Wilson. IT is a peculiar part of human nature for the mind to be continually active. No matter how indolent, improvident or careless an individual may be, if he or she be possessed of a healthy brain,his or her mind is continually employed, either for good or evil. The mind is never dormant, like time, it keeps moving on, and unless properly busied, it will find its way into mischief. A very prominent gentleman once said, on being asked how he managed to be successful and happy, that he always managed to keep just a little more work ahead of him than he could comfortably do during any given time. He kept employed. The moment one becomes idle the brain still works on, and, unless better employed, will find its way into difficulties. Under such circumstances, and at such times, one dreams over real or fancied troubles,broods over the dead past, or sees and points out the faults of others. By keeping busy one must not necessarily be employed at some manual labor. Not at all. A good book or some errand of mercy will do as well. But anything that enables one to rise above the petty jealousies, and refrain from the annoying gossiping that often mars life, and ruins its sweetest charm, is good. A closer communion with the Holy Writ, and keeping well employed are commendable. White Water, Ohio.
