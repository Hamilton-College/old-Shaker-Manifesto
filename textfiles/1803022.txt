JEALOUSY. It is said 'Jealousy is as cruel as the grave,' but by further thought we see that in another sense, can it be thus compared. Jealousy is as sure a tomb for the soul, as is the grave for the body. No growth no life can enter the heart of those thus entombed, but buried in their mental dirt, they are disturbed only to be offensive to surroundings. A. J. Calver.
