ROOT OUT OF DRY GROUND E. MYRICK Had the earth been prepared this root to conceive, And Moses and Jesus had both been believed. Nor sought to uproot, this dear plant from above, Instead of the sword we'd have brotherly love. This root being dual must wait for the plan— Heaven and earth to develop — the counterpart man. Now the earth helps the woman in her extreme need, While the heavens are peopled with her righteous seed; The true heirs of heaven rejoice in glad song, While these joyful tidings are telegraphed on ; This root has found soil and more commonly appears, As branches expand in the cycles of years. ' Why wert thou here, O rival of the rose ? I never thought to ask, I never knew ; But in my simple ignorance supposed The self same power that brought me here, brought you.' Let the arrogant and bigoted, the foes of free thought, reflect on the application and exchange despotism for human, brotherly love.
