HAVE CHARITY. If we knew the cares and crosses, Crowded round our neighbors' way; If we knew the little losses, Sorely grievous day by day, Would we then so often chide him For the lack of thrift and gain Leaving on his heart a shadow, Leaving on our lives a stain? If we knew the clouds above us Held by gentle blessing there, Would we turn away, all trembling, In our blind and weak despair? Would we shrink from little shadows. Lying on the dewy grass, While 'tis only birds of Eden Justin mercy flitting past? If we knew the silent story Quivering through the heart of pain, Would our manhood dare to doom it Back to haunts of vice and shame? Life has many a tangled crossing, Joy has many a break of woe, And the cheeks tear-washed are whitest, And the blessed angels know. Let us reach within our bosoms For the key to other lives, And with love to erring nature, Cherish good that still survives; So that when our disrobed spirits Soar to realms of light again, We may say 'Dear Father, judge us As we judged our fellow men.'
