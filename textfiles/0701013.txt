Hands to work, and hearts to God While unto our daily labors, We with diligence attend, We may fix our thoughts on heaven, Let our musings still ascend. Though our toils be hard and irksome, Taking all: our strength to ply, It will make the burden lighter, If our thoughts we place on high. Often when we're working hardest, All our thoughts are wandering far; Proves not this, that labor, seldom, To reflection is a bar? 'Tis a lesson that our mother, Taught and practiced when on earth; And to every true believer, All her teachings are of worth. Often did her weary toiling, Stretch from morn far in the even; But with holy thoughts inspired, Dwelt she on the things' of heaven. Let us then be ever striving, To obtain a good reward, By observing her example, Hands to work, and hearts to God. Shakers, N. Y.
