Many argue that the Bible is in every part infallible... 'Many argue that the Bible is in every part infallible and quote St. Paul to sustain them. But this citation from Paul as read in our churches, is very misleading. Comparing the original we find that it is not written : 'All Scripture is God-inspired and profitable,' but 'All God-inspired Scripture is profitable.''Dr. Rylance of N. Y. No one would care to dispute the point that all God-inspired Scripture was profitable for admonition and instruction in righteousness. The Scripture received from that source must inspire the soul with heavenborn truth and make of those who accept it, sons and daughters of God. Dunlavy says :'The belief of the existence of God, of his charac ter and the revelation which subsists between God and man is the foundation and spring of all religion.' It would be expected of a religious Community to accept this belief in order to promote harmony of thought and action. To be godly, means to be like God : good, pure and true. The aim should be to reach the Apostle's conception of God when he says ;'God is Love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.' The simplicity of the formula is readily accepted and supersedes the necessity of all the more modern theological combinations. It is quite consistent for a Trinitarian to advocate the Trinity, and equally as consistent for a moslem to advocate the divine mission of Mohammed, but those who have accepted the faith of Believers in Christ should be careful to teach that faith and no other.
