THE CHURCH OF GOD. Zion, arise, break forth in songs Of everlasting joy; To God eternal praise belongs, Who doth thy foes destroy. Thou Church of God, awake, awake, For light beams from on high; From earth and dust thy garments shake, Thy glory's drawing nigh. To raise thee high above the earth, God will his power employ; He'll turn thy mourning into mirth, Thy sorrow into joy. In shining robes thyself array, Put on thy garments pure; Thy King shall lead thee in a way, That's holy, safe and sure. He'll bring thy wand'ring children home, And gather those without; And with a wall of jasper stone, Will guard thee round about. He'll feed thy little ones with food, And their protector be; And nothing, that is for thy good Will he withhold from thee. In thee, the Lord shall place his name, And make thee his delight, And place on thee a diadem, Divinely fair and bright; And thou shalt be the dwelling-place, Of him that reigns above, Yea, thou shalt be adorn'd with grace And everlasting love. The joy of nations thou shalt be ; A bright and shining light; For God is in the midst of thee, To keep thee day and night: His arm shall be thy sure defence, That thou canst never fall, And shining saints shall pitch their tents Within thy glorious wall. Arise, O Zion, praise thy king. And make his name thy trust; With joy and triumph loudly sing, For he is true and just. O Zion, sing with thankful voice, Thy great redeemer's praise; In his almighty power, rejoice Throughout eternal days. Harvard, Mass.
