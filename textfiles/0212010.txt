Christian Spirit BY CHAUNCY DIBBLE Being in Saratoga, I was accosted by one who thought that the very chaste life the Shakers live, renders them too docile, unspirited, unfit for social life or its enterprises. We disprove this fact, by enjoying the largest amount of innocent socialism of an}' class on the earth. We believe it to be a Christian enterprise, to cultivate love, peace, economy and industiy, untinged by lust, wars, extravagance or laziness. We are professedly nonresistants—this was a specialty in the character of the author of Christianity, and will be in his humble followers—but is not copied by those popularly called Christians. If the indulgence of the lustful propensities is a necessary stimulus to active life, such cannot be Christian life; and we abjure the enterprises that spring from such a source. Thousands of instances daily occur, that are specimens of the motor of animal, generative life; and while these stain the pages of civilized journalism, we will be content, in being called spiritless by the world, if we can only be brimfull of the living spirit of Christ.
