PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY. Some months since, two young men, members of the Episcopal church, in the city of New York made a profession of the vows of 'poverty, chastity and obedience' for the purpose of more fully and freely living a life of Christian usefulness to the poor and needy in that modern Babylon. This act was approved and accepted by their ecclesiastical superior the Bishop of New York, who was thereupon remonstrated with by the presiding or senior Bishop of the church in the United States. And against what was this remonstrance made? Against following practically the teaching and example of Jesus, lie said, 'foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the son of man�Jesus�hath not where to lay his head.' Was not that poverty ? He said, 'they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead�sin�neither marry nor are given in marriage. ' Was not that teaching chastity ? He said, 'Father, not my will but thine be done. ' Was not that obedience ? And yet this practical Christianity, this actual following the life of Jesus, causes this Christian Bishop to express his ' astonishment and distress *' at what he calls an '' unexampled act, ' and one which he says must create '' anxiety and alarm' in the Episcopal church. If he is correct in this opinion as to the effect upon the church of which he is the official head, we can only say, what a church to call itself Christian. He further says that ' the purpose of the novice (which designation he affixes to each of these young men,) is to devote himself to a religious life�so-called. He forever surrenders all that he possesses or of which he may hereafter become possessed. He promises to continue in the virgin state for the remainder of his life. ' A lofty purpose, an unselfish surrender, a holy promise; and yet this Christian Bishop reprobates such a purpose, such a surrender, such a promise. Does he forget that Jesus set an example of ' poverty, chastity a^d obedience to his followers? If so, had he not better remonstrate less and read his Bible more ? We think that the worthy example set by these young men if followed and lived faithfully, would produce results befitting the name ot Christian. It would tend to elevate and purify the mass of humanity now sunk in lust, selfishness and greed. There is work enough of this nature for thousands of other young men in this broad land, work of purity and self-denial which will be approved by the great Teacher of right living even though it be disapproved by an Episcopal Bishop. Any church calling itself Christian, and any minister professing to be a follower of the '' meek and lowly Nazarene' ought to offer peans of praise and thanksgiving that there are yet those whose love for God and man has prompted them to enter into such a work. Such young men as these, seem to have some of the elements of Shakerism, and if they do not reach the goal to which others have attained, we feel that at least they are on the right road. The world would be better for more such as they are and feioer such as he who condemns them. A. Canterbury, N. H.
