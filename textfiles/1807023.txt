War PEACE AND WAR. If all Christians clearly saw the lovely beauty of Peace and the criminal horror of War, as they really are, they would all believe fully that Peace is the blessing and the glory, and War the curse and the disgrace of nations and mankind. They would see that Peace is always right, and War always wrong; they would see that any Peace to avoid any War is always infinitely better and more glorious than any War can be; they would see that to stand up meekly and firmly for Peace to loss of property, and even unto martyrdom, in the spirit that Jesus manifested all the way from Gethsemane to Calvary is always a holy offering to God; and to die voluntarily in War, for any cause, is to die entirely outside of the requirements and spirit of Christianity. It is vain to look for the day of millennial peace and love until the church, as one grand body, shall see that Peace is always right and War is always wrong, and that it is the duty of the church, as a body and as individuals, to 'follow Peace with all men,' be the temporal consequences what they may, ever keeping in mind that even defeat and suffering in Peace is immeasurably better and more glorious than the grandest triumph in War. The Christian has nothing to do with murderous weapons in maintaining or defending or overturning human governments. For such things let the unregenerate children of Adam fight and die, if they will. The Christian's mission on earth is like as was our Divine Master's : Peace and goodwill to all mankind. Blessed be God for the gift of a Savior so ineffably peaceful and lovely. Not a thread of military glory, so magnificent in the eyes of many who call themselves his followers, was woven into his seamless garment. The more the Christian studies meekly the character of Christ, the more he will see the beauty of his sublime title : 'The Prince of Peace.' Christians, do you wish, in your endeavor to make War truly agreeable to the life and teachings of Christ, your Saviorï¿½do you wish that he would henceforth take the title: 'The Prince of War?' No, you shudder at the thought. If such could be his character for the eternal future forever, vain would be all your hopes of Peace for time, of Peace for immortality. Let all our bo-oms bound with holy and eternal joy that Jesus is, and forever will be, ' The Prince of Peace;' and let us all labor that he may be the Peace of all nations as well as individual souls. Let us move forward with the beautiful branch of Arbitration in the blessed name of philanthropy, praying that its precious ' olive leaf' may be accepted gladly by all individuals, classes, and nations, as the healing for all the disagreements, contentions, and wars of fallen man, and to the ' very God of Peace' be all the glory forever and ever. And when the banner of Arbitration shall wave in peaceful triumph over the world, then it may in truth be said the sun of millennial day \s at its dawning. in Messenger of Peace. T. H.
