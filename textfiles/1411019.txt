Dear children; Keep your hearts with... Enfield Conn. 1884. Dear Children ;�' Keep your hearts with all diligence. ' Guard your inner lives against the approaches of sin. Watch your thoughts, your appetites and passions. Without constant watchfulness you cannot subdue wrong. 'The careless soul invites the vigilant foe. ' It is wise to be on the watch-tower, faithful as a sentinel. How much discipline you need to enable you to be true. Travel upward as well as onward ; choose good instead of evil; grow better not worse ; seek the kingdom of heaven, not the kingdom of earth. The choice is with yourselves. Keep your lives virtuous, your aspirations holy, your thoughts humble, and the fruits of the Spirit will be your durable treasure. Never begin a sinful course, and you will never regret it. Sow the seed of truth and purity, watch and cultivate it, guard it from every destructive element, and you will reap a good harvest. If you sow tares, (evil passions,) they will produce only vices. ' Gather thistles� expect prickles. ' ' Blessed are the pure in heart. ' Peace reigns with the pure. Shun sinful by-ways, is good counsel. Follow 'the high path of duty, ' for ' it leadeth to the Heavenly City, whose maker and builder is God. ' Your brother. Daniel Orcutt.
