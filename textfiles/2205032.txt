Green was master, which was aboard a hundred or more of ye heretics and malignants called Quakers, with W. Penn, who is ye scamp at ye head of them. Ye general court has accordingly given secret orders to Master Malachi Huxtell, of ye brig Porpois, to waylay ye said Welcome as near ye Coast of Cod as may be and make captives of ye Penn and his ungodly crew, so that ye Lord may be glorified and not mocked on ye soil of this new country with ye heathen worshippe of these people.

Yours in the bowels of Christ. 'Cotton Mather.'
