NOT WORTH MINDING. There are persons who deem it best to treat the questions of doubters and the arguments of unbelievers with silent contempt. They say that they are not worth minding. So a farmer might say that foxes and mice were not worth minding; but what if he finds his poultry and grain disappearing through the agency of these despised marauders? What if he finds that he must make war upon them', or abandon his produce and his property to their ravages? Anything which leads men astray from God and into darkness and sin, is worthy the attention of Christians, and if we were disposed to be astonished at anything in these days, we should look with amazement on the inaction of professed followers of Christ, while infidelity sweeps in around them like a flood. For one or two persons to attempt to stem this torrent, seems like undertaking an impossibility. Individuals can only hope to do their own personal work. This work we propose by the grace of God to accomplish, whatever may be the neglect and indifference of others. And while many who bear the name of Christ are building their dividing walls and separating and scattering the flock of God, thus laying stumbling blocks in the way of sinners, regardless of the dying petition of Him who prayed that they all might be one, that the world might know that He was sent of God; we hope to do our little to oppose t!:ese evil tendencies, by convincing gain-sayers, and seeking to turn the wicked from the error of their ways. Of course a few single-handed workers without wealth or influential connections can hope to do but little; but if those who have means and opportunities neglect the work, those who see the need must do what they can to meet it, and ask the Lord to raise up others who can do still more. Pray ye the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into his harvest, and to make his people willing helpers in this great and important work. In Armory.
