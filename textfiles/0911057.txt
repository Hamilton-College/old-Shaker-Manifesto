HOW TO MAKE GOOD APPLE DUMPLINGS First procure good, sour, juicy apples, pare and core, leaving them in halves. Get all your ingredients ready before beginning to mix your dough, sugar, soda, milk, lard, salt flour and apples. Now make a dough as for soda biscuits, only adding a little more lard to make it shorter. Take a bit of dough out on the kneading board, and after kneading, roll this as for pie crust. Then cut in pieces long enough to cover an apple, allowing for lapping the edges. Put in two of your apple halves, sweeten according to taste, and cover apple and sugar with dough. Lay your dumplings in your bread-pan, the smooth side up, first having your pan well buttered. Proceed in this manner until you get your pan well filled (be sure it is a large-sized pan, for they will go off like hot cakes) then place a small bit of butter on the top of each dumpling, sprinkle a handful of sugar over all ; then place in a moderate oven and allow them to bake one hour. Serve (not^too hot) with pudding sauce or with cream and sugar. Dumplings made in this way are really delicious.
