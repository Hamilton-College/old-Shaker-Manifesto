Drunkenness. Things are no doubt bad as regards the vicious indulgence in stimulants, and seemingly worse they grow as the means of expenditure become more plentiful, and the more idle time is at disposal. But in such ind.ulgence there is no particular novelty. Excesses in gindrinking became alarmingly prevalent in England about 1735, followed by agonizing poverty and wretchedness. Listen to what Smollett says of the period: ' The populace of London were sunk into the most brutal degeneracy by drinking to excess the pernicious spirit called gin, which was sold so cheap that the lowest class of the people could afford to indulge themselves in one continued state of intoxication, to the destruction of all morals and order. Such a shameful degree of profligacy prevailed that the retailers of this poisonous compound set up painted boards in public, inviting people to be drunk for the small expense of one penny; assuring them that they might be dead drunk for two-pence, and have straw for nothing. They accordingly provided cellars and places strewed with straw, to which they conveyed those wretches who were overwhelmed with intoxication. In these dismal caverns they lay until they recovered some use of their faculties, and then they had recourse to the same mischievous potion; thus consuming their health and ruining their families, in hideous receptacles of vice, resounding with riot and execration.'
