Watervliet, N. Y. June, 1894. The poem, 'Watchman, What of the Night?' in June Manifesto is truly a remarkable production. Its literary style is of a high order, and the spiritual insight that it shows is indicative of the fact that the author was in close concord with those powers that are revealing to human life the result of conditions that to the mass of humanity are a sealed volume. - On the 26th of May, we were favored with a social call from our beloved Sisters, Lucy A. Shepard and Emeline Hart of East Canterbury, and on the following day the Sabbath, we enjoyed, in our Society Service, their blessed ministration. The heavens opened and holy angels descended to hold communion with those who weie striving for, and some who had attained unto sainthood here. It was truly a communion of the saints, and we have naught but pity for any one who could not be uplifted by these heavenly powers. The latter part of May gave us an exuberance of moisture, while the me nth opened dry and cold. We have not suffered from devastating floods, as many of our fellow mortals in different parts of the country have, for which we are thankful; and extend to the afflicted our sympathy. If not able to assist in a material sense, it is certainly right for us to sympathize with our fellow mortals, and pray to God for our neighboi s as for ourselves. Success to the Manifesto. June number full of excellent ideas. Editorial, splendid. Hamilton DeGraw.
