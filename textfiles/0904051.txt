Harnesses should never be kept in the stables where manure is... Harnesses should never be kept in the stables where manure is constantly generating large quantities of ammonia. This ammonia is rapidly absorbed by the leather, and the effect upon the leather is about the same as would result from saturating it with strong lye. In a word, ammonia rots leather, and hence, keeping a harness in the stable is sure to result in its damage, more or less.
