CONFESSION AND EXCUSES One honest confession is worth a dozen plausible excuses, but it is harder to get one confession made than twenty excuses. Confessing faults leads to forsaking them. Making excuses often leads to lying to hide faults ; and the road is a very short one from excuses to evasions, from evasions to deceptions, and from deceptions to downright falsehoods There are some men who seem to start out with the supposition that they cannot do wrong, and hence, no matter what they have done or are doing, they must find some sort of excuse or justification for it. It wouldbe far wiser for them to start with the supposition that they cannot do right, except by special help from the Lord; and that the wonder in their case is not that they have sometimes done wrong, but that they have ever done anything but wrong; then, with this understanding, they have only to confess their faults, repent of their wrongs, and pray God to help them do better for time to come. A wrong confessed can be forgiven, but a wrong that is patched and plastered over with evasions and excuses only excites our disgust and contempt for the man who will not see his faults, or, if he sees them, will not own them. Especially is this true when men make great professions of righteousness and purity, while at the same time they are guilty of acts which a decent sinner would scorn to perform. For the sake of keeping up their profession and reputation for sanctity they will, after doing things that no honest man ought to do, evade confession and refuse reparation, until men lose all confidence in their intelligence or their integrity. How much better it is in an honest, manly way, to say, 'I did the thing: I believe it was wrong; I am sorry for it,' than it is to go wandering around the point with all the flexibility of the crooked serpent, excusing what we cannot deny and evading what we are unwilling to confess, till our moral nature is corrupted and we become so accustomed to deceptions and misrepresentations that we are incapable of telling the truth as it is.
