LETTER BOX Dear teacher; As I have had the... Shaker Village, N. H. Jan. 1885. Dear Teacher ;--As I have had the opportunity to be at school a few weeks, I thought I would write you a short letter so as to let you see how much I have improved the time given to me to learn that which is intelligent and noble. I know I cannot be a good scholar unless I take pains to study for myself. As I have been at school four Summers, I think I should show improvement in all that I do. I feel very interested learning to draw maps and also learning to read nicely. I think we should spend our school days as the happiest days of our lives in trying to see how much we can learn. With much love. Your pupil, C. H. Age, 14 years. Dear Sister Josephine; Among all of your... Shaker Village, N. H. Nov. 1884. Dear Sister Josephine ;--Among all of your letters there is but one from me and that is not to be there any more, for this is to take its plact. Dear Josephine, I am very glad that I have such a nice older sister for my very own, I love you dearly. Are you not going to claim me for your little sister? I have no natural sister and I always thought it would be so nice to have a sister I could call my own. The next time you work in the Bakery, if you ever do, just please tell me for I want to help you make pies. Don't you think such spry folks, as you and I, can get them all made before school time? I will tell you how we do it. We'll roll it, and prick it and mark it with J. and toss in the oven this is the way. Good Night, L. H. Age, I'd years.
