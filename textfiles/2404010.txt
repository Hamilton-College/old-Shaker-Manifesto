West Pittsfield Mar. 1894. Oue present environments are mud and water. March took his temporary position as chief ruler, in a most bland and pleasing manner. Hope he may continue in this agreeable mood and display none of his capricious habits. The sun's golden rays, and the mild breezes that now fan the earth are fast diminishing the once lofty banks of snow. Should the present fine weather continue, Br. Charles Prescott, the racy writer, may soon be favored with an opportunity of resuming his rather forced occupation of tilling the soil. As mutation however is stamped on all things terrestrial, we know that changes are inevitable and must be met. A blizzard or cyclone may be next in order. What a happy change might ensue were a cyclone, or some other effective agency, to sweep from this broad country of ours, the oppression, wrong and consequent suffering and misery which exists and are daily increasingï¿½-and this in a land of boasted civilization and liberty. Our loved friends of Mt Lebanon and Canaan who wisely embraced the advanta-,, ges presented to enjoy pleasant sleigh-rides took the opportunity on some of these occasions to give us a call which was highly appreciated. Sisters Emeline Hart THE MANIFESTO. and Eliza J. Aiken of Canterbury, N. H., who tarried with us over Sunday a short time ago, were messengers of hope, love and cheer and we deeply regretted that their stay could not have been longer. Our family responded to the call from the St. Vincent De Paul Society of Pittsfield, by sending a large amount of clothing to be distributed among the needy suffering ones, also sent to the little ones of Tennessee who are unprovided with mental food, a well filled barrel of papers, magazines, books, etc. Our little folks, whose sympathetic hearts were stirred with pity, generously donated many of their valued toy treasures, some of them being useful as well as ornamental.
