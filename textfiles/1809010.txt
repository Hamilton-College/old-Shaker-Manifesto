Correspondence. My Dear Friend, Elder John Whiteley:--I am becoming a convert to... Preston, Ont., July 2, 1888. My Dear Friend, Elder John Whiteley :ï¿½I am becoming a convert to the Shaker view of the celibate life. When I see the evils in society, arising from the indulgence of the animal passions, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion, than that it would be much better if men would strive to bring their baser passions into subjection to the higher laws of their nature, and try to live a nobler aud a more spiritual life. On this we are all agreed, but the difficulty is to get men and women to exercise self-denial for the happier enjoyment of intellectual life. There is hardly a great crime committed ag-iinst society that is not traceable, directly or indirectly, to the indulgence of the animal passions, and the unhappy marriages, separations and numerous divorces, show how impossible it is to regulate this evil by law. Against the celibate life there is no law, and the advantages of such a life over the married state, in properly organized society, are sufficiently obvious. Even in the world it may be said that tlp whilst he who marries doeth well, he who doth not marry doeth better ;' whilst in community life it seems almost a necessity that men aud women should not marry. Where marriage has been permitted or lawless intercourse indulged in, it seems to have been fatal to all community organization, and such communities have sooner or later been broken up. Not that marriage of itself is sinful, but it has led to a diversity of interests, and the increase of selfishness to so great an extent, as to be destructive of the unity and concord so essential to the community interests, so that it is quite possible that the Shakers are right in their views on this subject. No doubt the enforcement of the celibate rule is a great hindrance to many who would otherwise join your order, but whether you could safely alter or modify the rule, or abandon it altogether, would be difficult to say. I should be glad if something could be done to make your order better known, and more acceptable to the religious world in general. To illustrate what has been said I will refer to the dreadful incidents connected with Mr. G. of Aylmer, Ont. He was a man of good standing, the owner of two flouring mills with an interest in a third one, was fairly wealthy, and moved in the best society. He was a Freemason, an Oc'dfellow, a Workman, and a leading member of the Methodist church, as well as a man of social and political influence. His crime was that of incest. He was arrested at his own mill and while taking him to prison he asked to see his family. Soon as he entered the house he seized a revolver and instantly destroyed his own life. And yet this man stood up in the church only four weeks before, and said he never was so happy in his life, and hoped that many would be brought into the right way. What will not the indulgence of this vile lust lead to ! ! I have to thank you for sending me the Manifesto. It is an interesting journal, but I do not agree with all and everything that I read in it, but the moral tendency is good and the whole tone religious and elevating. With kind remembrances to all my good friends. Believe me Yours very sincerely J. H. Walker. The power that sweetens every duty, and lightens every burden... The power that sweetens every duty, and lightens every burden in life is true religion. H. A. J.
