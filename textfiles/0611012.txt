Mount Lebanon, Oct. 10,1876 Geo. L. Richardson —Respected friend: In answer to the questions in your letter, I inclose a little tract that will help you about Prophets. A Prophet is a Man, or Woman, inspired by the Christ Spirit — not Jesus —from the Christ sphere. Ann Lee was a Prophetess, and more than a Prophetess. She was the Character of whom the Prophets wrote in the forty-fifth Psalm and other portions of sacred writ. She was not the Woman named in the twelfth chapter of Revelations. That was the Holy Mother Spirit in Deity. In the twelfth verse we have the Church, after being in the wilderness 43 months —1,260 days — when Ann Lee becomes the Church symbolized, or personified. Her history exactly corresponds with the Revelations. The Church and State Governments persecuted her. She fled, on Eagle's Wings —the American Ensign — to the wilderness of America. The 'flood' of lies and slanders came. The Earth — Infidel Government of America— helped Ann Lee by swallowing the flood — separating Church and State. Her seed bruised Lust — the Head sin of man's sensual nature. Joanna Southcot I know all about—have her books. She came up under the same elements that Ann Lee did. When Jesus came up, some thirty Jesuses came up too. The elements that produced Napoleon or Washington would have produced thirty, if one after another had failed. The wellbeing of the race does not depend upon One person. Had Ann Lee failed, another would have been raised up in her place. Christ is distinct from any human being. It is the baptizing spirit of the New Creation. Shakerism is pure, primitive Christianity. It is like a ' city set upon a hill that cannot be hid.' Community of Goods, Celibacy, Peace, Plainness in dress and speech, Yea and Nay, are distinguishing marks, not easily mistaken or counterfeited. Respectfully F. W. Evans
