Select A LESSON IN LAW BY GATH BRITTLE Sire and son, for many a year, The Browns had owned the mill On the bank of the limpid stream that flews By the foot of yonder hill. Hard by is the farm the Whites had tilled For three score years or more ; Success had blessed their peaceful toil, And thrift had heaped their store. For all these years the neighbors lived With naught to mar their peace; Their friendship grew, and as time sped Each saw his wealth increase. There came a change. Not long ago A hot dispute arose. About a narrow strip of land; And now the friends were foes. Neither would yield ; and White and Brown Forgot their former ties. To law they went, nor would they brook One hint at compromise. As climbing birds pick fattest grubs From rotten parts of trees, So from our faults the men of law Extract their richest fees. The farm belongs to Lawyer Green, Old Farmer White is dead. His sons and daughters, scattered wide, With strangers toil for bread. The mill, the miller's homestead, all Belong to Lawyer Gray; But Brown works as a miller's man At ninety cents a day. When friends fall out, they should not go To law ; it is not best. Of what they have they'll little save.The lawyers get the rest. N. Y. Weekly.
