A religious journal tells its readers, spitefully, that it costs the heathen Chinese #400,000,000 annually to run their religion, ' whatever it is.' That, the Chinaman might reply, is the strange part of this religious interest. The Christians, before settling among themselves what Christianity is, hasten over to conrert China whatever it is ; whereas, if they knew Christianity and Bhuddism as well as the Chinese know Bhuddism, they might perhaps admire the wisdom (politically at least) which liberally spends so much money on a system of religion that can keep three or four hundred millions of people whole centuries as a unit, without rebellion or schism, giving out of itself an educational system which faithfully reaches one hundred per centum of the population, and to which, to our sorrow be it said, the best Christian school system is but a feeble and as yet rather ineffective copy. It ought to be a good religion, which is worth $400,000,000 a year to keep up, and, no doubt, the Chinese are proud that no where but in China can a religion be found which is valued even half that high.â€”American Land and Law Advisor.
