OUR ROLL CALL Sophia Wayne Let us finish the work, we have nobly begun, Let vis cling to our faith, till the victory is won, O Christian Believers, our work is not done, We must gather more into the fold. Lead forth in the march, raise our voices in song, Remember the order to which we belong, Let us show the light path to the one in the wrong, And gather more souls in the fold. Against caste and monopoly our conscience must fight, For in heart and hand labor we know we are right, Our leaders are trusty, they walk in the light, And will gather more into the fold. We own all our dwellings, we are not oppressed, We labor with pleasure, and so earn our rest, From the north and the south, from the east and the west, We are gathering them into the fold. Ballston Spa, N. Y.
