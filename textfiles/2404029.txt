Books and Papers. WHERE SNOW IS RED WHERE SNOW IS RED. Snow is sometimes found in Polar and Alpine regions, whereitliesunmelted from year to year, smd the annual fall is small, colored red by the presence of innumerable small red plants. In its native state the plant consists of brilliant red globules on a gelatinous mass. Red snow was observed by the ancients, a passage in Aristotle referring to it, but it attracted little or no attention until 1760, when Sanssure observed it in the Alps, and concluded that it was due to the pollen of a plant. It was also noticed by the Arctic Expedition under Captain Ross on Bafflns Bay shore on a range of cliffs, the red color penetrating to a depth of twelve feet. Less frequent is a green growth on snow.�March Ladies' Home Journal. New England Magazine Rev. Philip S. Moxom is an interesting figure at present in our religious world. He is one of the battle grounds where the disciples of the old and of the new contend. His religious position has been the occasion of no more controversy at this time than his radical position upon social and industrial questions. His strong ai'ticle on Christian Socialism in the March number of the New England Magazine will attract the earnest attention of very many. It is not onl5' a comprehensive and striking presentation of the subject, but is one of Dr. Moxom's most energetic and characteristic utterances. It is accompanied by a line portrait of the courageous preacher who is just leaving Boston for his new Spring field church.-Warren F. Kellogg, 5 Park Square Boston.
