The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 27. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Re-written by Henry C. Blinn. Mother Ann felt extreme anguish from the cruel abuses of these men, and said to them, 'Must I give up my life ia your hands?' Regardless of her petition they thrust her into a room, where she sat down and cried like a child. The mob immediately surrounded the house aud refused to let any of the Believers enter. Elder William Lee insisted on going in, at the same time declaring that Mother Ann was his sister. Two or three of the Sisters managed to enter the house, and soon found their way to the room where Mother Ann was confined. In the meantime Grant aud his wicked court consulted among themselves to know in what manner they should proceed, and having settled the point, Mother Ann was brought back to the first house. Elder James Whittaker, during the time of this trial had been kept under guard, at the house, where the court was sitting. He was called in and a suit was entered against the two Believers for a breach of peace. They were accused of making disturbance and breaking the rest of the people, by singing and shouting at a late hour in the night. The Justice inquired of thsm, 'Did you not pass by Mr. A's house?' Elder James replied, ' I never saw the man in my life, that I know of; but I have sung and served God a great deal.'' They were then asked, 'Did you not pass Mr. B's house?' and received the same reply as before. Grant then made a pretence of bind* ing them over to the County court, and said�' You must be taken to jail or get bondsmen for your appearance.' David and George Darrow immediately offered themselves as bondsmen and were accepted. They then said, ' The prisoners are ours, and we have a right to take them where we please.' It appears, however, that the prisoners were not given up to their bondsmen, but all went out, and Mother Ann and two Sisters stepped into the carriage. The Brethren who were bondsmen considering themselves as having the right, attempted to lead the horse, but were prevented by the mob. The Justice of the Peace, came to the door and addressed them as follows;�u As a magistrate of the state of New York I desire that there may be no mobs, nor riots ; ' and then added, ktLay hands suddenly on no man.' These words he repeated several times, placing peculiar emphasis on the last two words,�'no man.' Grant returned to the house and was seen no more that day. The speech was evidently intended as a cloak, while it held a license to the mob to abuse Mother Ann at their pleasure as she was a woman. This was well understood by the mob, for they took hold with increased zeal, and separated Mother Ann from the body of Believers and would not suffer them to come near her. They now drove on with great violence, towards Albany, still keeping the Brethren back and threatening and abusing every one that attempted to go forward. Many of the Believers were inhumanly beaten and a like cruelty exercised upon their horses. After driving about seven miles, over a rough and muddy road, over stones and stumps and seeking the worst places, for Mother Ann's carriage, they reached Rany's tavern. The landlord hearing the tumult, and understanding the cause, came out and with authority of spirit and severity of language, reprimanded the mob for such shameful abuse toward an innocent and civil people. He threatened them with the utmost rigor of the law, if they did not immediately disperse. This severe rebuke from Ranv greatly embarrassed the mob, and finding that they were near the boundary line of the town, and night coming on, they gave this order ;�'' All who belong in Niskeyuna may pass on, while those who live in New Lebanon must go back.' The Brethren, however, would not consent to this, but determined to keep the company of Mother Ami and the Elders. After much wrangling among themselves, and the dealing o{' some blows upon the Believers they wildly dispersed. Mother Ann was very much exhausted and passed the night under great distress and sufferings. Several families of Believers lived on the road over which they had traveled during the day, but the mob would not suffer her nor the other Believers to stop for any refreshment. It was a long, sad and perilous journey. When daylight appeared, the Believers who had taken lodgings where they best could be obtained, arose as sufferers in the affliction which the cross of Christ is sure to bring. In all of this burden they made preparation for holding a religious meeting. They kneeled and wept with great sorrow. Elder James Whittaker made this remark, ' If the Believers should hold their peace, I believe the very stones would cry to God.' At the close of the service a supply of provisions was brought to them by some Brethren from New Lebanon, which was thankfully received, in a time of great need. Mother Ann wept as she related the abuse she had suffered at the hands of these cruel persecutors. ''So it has been with me, almost continually, since I left Niskeyuua day and night,�day and night, 1 have been in sorrow and persecutions.' In the P. M. they returned to the residence of Nathan Farrington where they remained about two days. At this place Mother Ann said, 'I feel now as though I could take some rest.' But the enemies of the work of God could never be at rest while Mother Ann was within their reach. In the evening between thirty and forty heathenish creatures, surrounded the house and from the savageness of their manners they were styled, 'The Indian Club.' They demanded in abusive language to see that woman. Nathan inquired what they wanted of her. They said, ' She is a witch and she shall not stay here.' Nathan replied, ' She is a woman of God, and you shall not see her in such a manner.' The mob then threw stones and clubs at the house, and threatened to break down the doors. Nathan commanded them to desist and threatened them with the penalty of the law, if they attempted to break into his residence. This for a moment checked their rage. Nathan endeavored to show them the wickedness and folly of such conduct. 'I have lived as a neighbor with you for several years in peace, but now because I have joined the people of God, according to my faith, and confessed my sins, as you ought to do, you come here to break into my house and abuse me and my family.' But the mob were determined to break into the building, and setting reason and humanity at defiance they continued with horrid oaths and blasphemies, to throw stones and clubs. Mother Ann now asked John Farrington if he could not go and send those men away. 'Yea, Mother,' replied John. 'Go then and shame them, and tell them if they will go away and come to-morrow peaceably, that I will see them.' In the strength of the gift John went down, and had no sooner passed out of the door, when he was instantly seized by two ruffianly fellows. 'Love' cried John. 'Love' replied the men in a sneering voice, and immediately griped him between them with such violence that it seemed as though they intended to squeeze the breath out of his body. John held his breath, and as they slackened their arms he cried, still louder, 'More love!' At this they renewed the grip, and cried out ' More love ! ' This was repeated several times till the men wearied themselves while John received no harm. 'Now, if you have got through,' said John, ' I want to reason with you, as you are reasonable men or ought to be. Why do you come here in such a manner, and in the night? It is a shame! I am ashamed of you, that men should behave so. Do for the honor of man withdraw peaceably, and if you will come again in the morning, when it is daytime, the woman that you are talking about will come and see you.' These words, spoken with such confidence, vanquished their rage. They immediately began to withdraw and soon all were gone, so that the Believers enjoyed the night in peace. The next morning, six of the company called at the house. John met them at the door and then introduced, to them Mother Ann, and three of the Sisters. ' This is the woman' said John, ' that you was so anxious to see.' 'What can you want of me,' said Mother Ann, ' I am a poor, weak woman, I do not hurt any one.' The guilty men had not confidence to speak nor to look at her, but hung their heads and soon excused themselves. John invited them to take breakfast, but they declined.
