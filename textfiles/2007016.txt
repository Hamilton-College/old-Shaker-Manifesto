MY CLAIM. Agnes E. Newton. At earthly shrine I cannot bow, My trust it is not there; For I have felt the love of God And found an altar where, His spirit meets the needy soul And clothes anew with power, To overcome the world of sin And nearer brings the hour, When I may say, I truly live For Christ has full control; The tempter comes and findeth naught, And life's rough billows roll. But sweet the spirits inmost calm Where rest in God is found; The soul is by still waters led And pastures green abound. This is the goal for which I seek The height I would attain ; So at the shrine of truth I bow And urge nc foreign claim. Canterbury, N. H.
