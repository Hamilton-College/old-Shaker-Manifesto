Beware of evil thoughts... Beware of evil thoughts. They have done great mischief in the world. Bad words follow, and bad deeds finish the progress. Watch against them, strive against them, pray against them. They prepare the way for the enemy of souls. Is there, in truth, any blessing of Heaven which is more beautiful, more worthy of our warmest gratitude, than the possession of a home where goodness, kindness and joy are daily inmates ; where friends, not merely by words but by actions, say to each other, ''Thy goodness, thy sorrow, thy hope, thy prayer, are also mine?' â€”Frederika Breme'.
