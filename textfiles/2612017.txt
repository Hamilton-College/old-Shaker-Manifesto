In remembrance of Sister Kate Rankin, who passed away Oct. 11, 1896. By Anna Goepper. After being afflicted for two years, she has passed to the higher sphere of being, completing a sojourn on earth of seventyeight years. She has borne her burden of suffering with the cheerfulness characteristic of her bright and hopeful spirit; ever patient and more solicitous for the happiness and comfort of others than for herself. While loving hands anxiously sought to make reposeful the conditions of transition, she looked up, with a smile on her 198 THE MANIFES7 0. face never again unclosing her lips in speech. Our Sister was born in Liverpool, Eng. and has been a devoted, quiet, peaceable Sister for many years. I have known her from my childhood and feel perfectly justified in saying she was a brilliant star, an example of patience, a thorough Christian, and an accomplished scholar. It was entertaining to me as a child, to hear her repeat poem after poem, and long lectures from memory. Indeed, she was an extraordinary individual. I felt that I would really be out of my line of duty to refuse to contribute a few words of love to one possessing such a beautiful spirit. 'Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.' 'Rest in immortal realms above, Must be forever more as here; 'Tis but the Ministry of Love, In this and every sphere; The only rest from care and strife Is Love's sweet harmony with life.'
