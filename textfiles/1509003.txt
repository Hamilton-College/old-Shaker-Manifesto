A WORKER'S PRAYER FRANCIS RIDLEY HAVERGAL Lord, speak to me, that I may speak In living echoes of Thy tone ; As Thou hast sought, so let me seek Thy erring children, lost and lone. O, lead me, Lord, that I may lead The wandering and the- wavering feet; 0 feed me, Lord, that I may feed Thy hungering ones with manna sweet. O, strengthen me, that while I stand Firm on the rock and strong in Thee, 1 may stretch out a loving hand To wrestlers with the troubled sea. O, teach me, Lord, that I may teach The precious things Thou dost impart; And wing my words, that they may reach The hidden depths of many a heart. O, give Thine own sweet rest to me, That I may speak with soothing power A word in season, as from Thee, To weary ones in needful hour. O, fill me with Thy fullness, Lor-I; Until my very heart o'erflow In kindling thought and glowing word, Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show. O, use me, Lordï¿½use even me, Just as Thou wilt, and when and where, LTntil Thy blessed face I see, Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share. The Catholic.
