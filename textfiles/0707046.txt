VOICE OF THE SPIRIT O. C. Hampton Union Village, Ohio. The regions of peace and pure love Are not for the giddy and vain, But those who will wait for the wisdom above, And order and quiet maintain, And prudence, that virtue divine, And patient endurance withal, The fpirit from all that is low to refine, And banish the wormwood and gall. 2. And thus saith the spirit to me, From out the bright heavens serene, In wisdom, O walk with the pure and the free, In the vale of my love ever green. Thy future O scan and fore-see, â€¢And hide from the evil to come Be thoughtful, and silent, and turn unto me, And safely I'll gather thee home. 3. O hide from the tempest and storm, In the temple of Wisdom and Love For there I will ever protect tliee from harm, And fill thee with peace from above. No arrow that flieth by day, ' Nor death-dealing meteor by night, No pestilence walking in gloom and dismay, Shall fall on thy heavenward flight. 4. And those who my discipline bear When the tempest is dark in the sky, In the hour of silence, repentance and prayer, My presence shall feel ever nigh. And when your probation is o'er, To the bright Summer Land you shall go, Where pain, and disease, and despair are no more, My glory supernal to know.
