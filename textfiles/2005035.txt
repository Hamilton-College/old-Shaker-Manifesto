LIFE. Martha J. Anderson. O Life, thou breath of the vast Oversoul, And pulse of creation's innermost heart. Dreaming I wonder, and waking, I start, To know I am part of the infinite whole. Glorious lessons thy pages unroll; Increasing knowledge thy true laws impart; Upward like newly fledged bird I would dart, Inspired to attain thy loftiest goal. God's gift, existence immortal and free, 1 prize thee, I bless thee, forever and aye! Heaven's mirrored delights are pictured in thee Perfection outreaching perfection's day. For soul knows no shadow or blight of decay, When God is the life-spring and hope of its way. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
