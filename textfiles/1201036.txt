DEATH IN ICED DRINKS The story of the sudden death in Canton, O., of the 'healthy young tinner' who drank ice-cold beer, is a warning to men, women and children who swallow tumblerfuls of ice-water on every occasion. No one who reflects for a moment can but believe that the introduction of zero frost into the body is dangerous as well as unhealthy. It was not the beer that killed; it was the ice that paralyzed the stomach, and before the beer became of a proper temperature for absorption into the system it fermented, causing a gas that overpowered the heart, lungs and brain and produced death. People drinking ice-cold water, or rapidly eating anything of an ice-cold nature, must be careful that they have not eaten just be- fore material capable, of fermentation. Our candid opinion is that the general habit among Americans of drinking ice-cold fluids is the cause of dyspepsia and other diseases that so generally prevail in this country. We know that until this habit was introduced into Paris by Americans living there dyspepsia was unknown to Frenchmen. New York Commercial.
