Books and Papers. Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly A special fiction number is Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly for August. There are seven complete stories, all illustrated, and all are bright and clever, the one by Margaret E. Sangstev being particularly noticeable for its sweet simplicity. But the number is not given up entirely to fiction. There is an attractively illustrated paper entitled A Grandee of the Fields; in which Martha McCulloch Williams chats entertainingly of tobacco, its history and cultivation. The University of Virginia is the subject of an article by Richard Heath Dabnesr, forming the tenth paper in this magazine's popular series on American Universities and Colleges; it is illustrated with good portraits and views. Harvey Rowell describes Summer Logging in Wisconsin ; there is a most interesting account of a visit to Japan, under the title In the Land of the Mikado; by Dr. J. Simms, with capital halftone cuts; Colonel Alexander E. Sweet tells of an exciting German student duel of which he was a witness; Beasts of Burden; is the subject of an article by the well-known traveler author, Frederick A. Ober; the department for young people contains a story, a paper on stamp collecting, and the continuation of Horatio Algier's serial. Then there are illustrated poems, talks about books, comments on pictures, and the Leslie Portfolio.ï¿½Frank Leslie's Pub. House, New York.
