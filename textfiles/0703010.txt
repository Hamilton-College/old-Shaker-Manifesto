Death is but the Passage into Higher Life JULIA JOHNSON Adown the stream of time we go, On mingled wave of weal and woe. Into the silent land. As years recede, we near the goal, Which usher into life the soul, Where death has no command. In youth, we look with solemn dread On winding sheet, and sleeping dead. And fain, would never know The restful quiet of the grave; But rather those excitements crave, Attached to scenes below, As hoary locks of age appear, We smile to see the crossing near. Which reaches to our rest; With quickened pace and joyful tread, We hail the boundaries of the dead, As sacred soil, and blest. For there the angels watch and wait, To ope ajar the golden gates, Of cities bright and fair; Through which resound the welcome songs, Of the victorious happy throngs, At our glad entrance there. Roll swiftly on, remaining years, Though robed with joy, or washed with tears, We ask not further stay; To earth, and all her shifting scenes We bid adieu for holier themesâ€” Allied to endless day. We yearn to reach the gladsome goal, Where body separates with soul, As she mounts up on high; To dwell forever there, in peace, Where true attractions never cease, And love can never die.
