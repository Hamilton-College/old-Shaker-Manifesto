Watervliet, N. Y. North Family. Feb. 1894. It gives us unalloyed pleasure to see the hearty support given to sustaining The Manifesto. Its excellent appearance does credit to the Editor, also to the worthy printers. We were lately blest with a special privilege while in our Society service to hear the wise counsel from one of the Elders, urging the importance of laboring for a spirit of charity and forgiveness. To enter the New Year with the resolution to leave old things and press onward and upward into an ever increasing spiritual growth. We enjoy the ministration of, and our communion with our beloved Ministry, also the gospel relationship of Brothers and Sisters is more fully understood and deeply appreciated than of yore. May we walk with an humble and pure heart that the divine Spirit may abide with us. Winter, while we have had some stormy days, has not been as cold, nor has as much snow fallen as during the previous winter. At present it is very unevenly distributed. Large drifts in some places and in others the earth may be seen. We conclude there is much good sense in the remark of our colored friend that he 'ought to be thankful for any kind of weather.' We are striving to keep our lamps trimmed and burning that our light may shine that all men may see it. By a spirit of consecration and strict loyalty we shall aid the cause of Eight. Hamilton DeGraw.
