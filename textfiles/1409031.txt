It is very singular that... It is very singular that just at the time when the Bible is under a severe criticism, when the professors and profane are analyzing and comparing passage after passage through the hope of finding their origin or of solving the mystic doubts by which the Bible has been surrounded.�that some one should draw from the mouldering archives a document that bears the wonderful name of ' The teaching of the twelve Apostles.' So far the work has fared much better than many other papers that have been rescued from the tombs, although they also put forth the claim of genuine. Defenders of the faith are not wantinjr � to surround this treasure and to assure us that ' the genuineness of the document can hardly be doubted. ' That it belongs to the second Century and not farther from the birth of Christ than one hundred and sixty years. We Avonder that such a care should be exercised over those few pages of the octavo volume that was so fortunately brought to the light, while the other articles are but feebly noticed. That the Apostles teaching is a good moral lesson and well worthy of our attention, is readily admitted, and whether written in the first, second or third Century may not be of so much consequence as that it teaches the principles of righteousness. This passage in the fourth chapter is peculiar, 'My child, him that speaks to thee the word of God remember night and day, and thou shalt honor him as the Lord ; for where that which pertaineth to the Lord is spoken there the Lord is. ' This harmonizes very pleasantly with the advice that Paul gave to the P'phesians. 'Children obey your parents in the Lord ; for this is right. ' Eph. vi., 1. This illustrates a consistent Christian separation between the parents of generation and those of the regeneration. All may be teachers and demand attention, may be faithful and honestly devoted to the order in which they belong, but while one points toward the kingdom of God and its righteousness, the other gathers its blessings among the earthly treasures. The attempt to serve two masters has not proved conducive to spiritual interests. The only safe course for the Zion traveler is to ' seek first the kingdom of God, ' and this instruction whether found in the New Testament or in the supposed teaching of the Apostles will be quite safe to follow. We shall hope that other writings may be found which will prove of value in making many wise unto salvation.
