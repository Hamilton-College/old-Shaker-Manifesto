Shaker Station, Conn., Jan. 1894 Dear Children:â€”A Happy New Year is the salutation. Look over the resolutions you made last year and see how many were kept. Think of the mistakes you made so often. Begin the year with holy aspirations and let them call forth selfdenying work. Avoid repeating past er- rors. Perform your whole duty and a whole year of happiness will be yours. Your goal on the sea of life is purity. Truth and purity are a sure foundation. Be pure and true, is the warning voice to you. A pure character is capital earthly riches can not represent, and happiness nothing but a pure life can give In character building do your best work. All may walk in Wisdom's path. Ho w delightful is the way! Subdue evil before it gets a firm hold. Firmly resist the allurements of sin, and strive for the prize that is worthy to win. Sin is attractive, but delusive. Too often you pay for simple pleasure in grief. The first step in sin is the hardest. Don't take it. Sin brings trouble, sorrow and pain, 'the path of duty' is pleasant and plain. Conscience has a reproof for every wrong. Perform humble service for the home life. Overcome self. Watch continually, for otherwise there is no safety. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt
