I find no rest in thee; 2. Farewell, vain world, I say once more, I'm bound for Canaan's land! 3. He can command the roaring tide And silence all my foes; 4. Tho' shining millions sailed before, Who gained the port above; form a hell Too dark and sad for me. world before Prepared at God's right hand. I can ride Thro' ev'ry wind that blows. Babel's store, That they could prize or love. Thy greatest pleasures I see a happy With courage safely Found nothing in old Alas, alas! I have too long Prefered thy sinful crowd, On life's ternpestuous sea I sail, While countless billows roll, Then as I daily homeward steer, Toward the land of peace, That everlasting glory bright,Will tarnish all below, I listened to your siren song, While mercy called aloud. But Christ, my pilot will not fail, With Him I trust my soul. This world does less and less appear, And all its charms decrease. Just as the sun's meridian light, Forbids the stars to glow.
