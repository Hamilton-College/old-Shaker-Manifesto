South Union, Ky August 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½The August Manifesto was a very interesting number. Eldress Anna White hit the nail square on the head. Elder O. C Hampton's 'Soliloquy' was good. The Editorial, and in fact I might name them all, are good. From a wheat field that was fertilized they obtained 19 bushels per acre, while from one without this extra care they obtained 8 bu. pr. acre and from another 10 bushels, so the fertilizing paid well. This has been a great fly year and a fruitful year for rabbits. In the evening the rabbits are running around the yards almost as tame as cats. H. L. E.
