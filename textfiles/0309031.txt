SAVE, LORD! As Jesus was rock'd on the breast of the billow, And roused by the voice of despair from his pillow, When fierce raging tempest left no hope to cherish, Came the entreating cry, ' Save, Lord, or we perish.' At his word the wind ceased, and the storm was allay'd, Then the raging sea, hush'd, in still calm was array'd, The faint-hearted marvel'd at his power of will, Who stretch'd forth his hand with the mandate 'Be still.' While they stood around him, all trembling and tearful, He gently reproved them with 'Why are ye. fearful?' And look'd on them with pity, and ask'd for their faith. Is not that the sure safeguard in life and in death ? 'Save, Lord, or we perish;' wild torrents are streaming, And o'er the dark waves the red light, too, is gleaming. Lord, send forth thy Spirit, thy creatures to save, And rebuke the destroyer abroad on the wave. O, save from the perils of passion now raging, For sin unto mortals a great war is waging; O, impart to their hearts a new faith to cherish, And teach them the prayer, 'Save, Lord, or we perish!'
