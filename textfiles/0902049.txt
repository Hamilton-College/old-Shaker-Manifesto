I am a farmer, and I recognize... 1 am a farmer, and I recognize that my lands belong to the Lord. The corn and wheat are his, the horses are his, the cattle are his. ' For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.' (Ps. 1, 10.) I am a merchant; all my goods are the Lord's, and I am his. I am a banker; all my silver and gold are the Lord's. ' The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, said the Lord of hosts.' (Haggai ii, 8.) All I have is thine, and I am thine ; I am thy steward. Dost thou call for thy money 1 Here it is Lord. Pardon my past neglect. In the future I will give back that which is thine. To this I pledge myself in thy name, O Lord.
