NOTES Jesus was our great teacher... Jesus was our great teacher, His lessons were full of instruction. He wasted neither time nor words, nor neglected a proffered opportunity when he could impress the minds of his disciples with a spiritual truth. They were able to foretell that the harvest would be in the course of a few months, and to them it would be a special season for the gathering of God's bounteous blessings. Jesus would inspire them with a deeper thought having reference to the gathering of souls into the Kingdom of God. Lift up your eyes, said he, and look on the fields for they are already white to harvest. While the disciples, as natural men, were thinking only of the harvesting of the wheat fields of Palestine, and of their well filled garners, Jesus changed the conversation to a religious form and told them that the minds of men were now waiting to be enlightened with the spirit of Truth and to be harvested into the work of regeneration. It now became the duty of the laborers to stimulate themselves to enter upon their mission. They were to be sent into the world to preach the gospel of good news and to take therefrom those who heard the word of God and were able to keep it. Shall we not learn wisdom from these life lessons which have been placed before us? Admitting that our gospel has been vitalized by the spirit of the Living God, and that a testimony has gone forth which has been as the waters of salvation to many thousands, yet, is there not some danger of losing this precious gift while we are so very anxiously caring for the things of this world ?
