HINTS TO THE PHILANTHROPIC A lady in Roxbury, having little money but much time, told beggars who came to her door that they must need more than she could give, but if they would leave their names and addresses she would go to see them and make some arrangements for their relief. She did not succeed in getting a single address, and finally no more beggars came, though her neighbors were still called upon. At a house where tramps often came for breakfast or supper, it was decided that each should be required to do some work —pulling up grass in the sidewalk, cutting grass, sawing wood, or doing any of the minor things that always need to be done about a small place. At once a change was perceptible, few tramps came,' and of those who called there was seldom one unwilling to work for a meal. The unworthy knew the house and avoided it. In both of these cases the beggars had not the false and frequent excuse that the societies to whom they were sent would not or could not aid them; and both prove what the societies have always claimed — that no beggar should be helped at the door even to food which he eats then and there. Gifts in that way help to create the class of persons who live upon the community. Mrs. Mumford of Philadelphia, in an excellent article on ' Cold Pieces ' (a form of charity which argues much against our domestic economy), tells of a tramp who said : THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 261 ' Why should I work? The women folks on my route take good care of me. Some gives me my victuals, some gives me my clothes ; the city furnishes free lodgings in winter and the country in summer; and why should I run my constitution down with hard labor and get no thanks?' A child's plea for help touches most of us at once, and the clothes or the money are freely given ; but ought we not to consider that the child learns faster than her elders, and that she is storing up for her maturity a lesson of dependence on strangers?
