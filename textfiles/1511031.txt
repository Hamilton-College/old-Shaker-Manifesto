THE GOSPEL. [Contributed by Harriet Shepard.] Considers differences with a cheerful face, and pleasant words : it throws a mantle of peace around dissensions ; it sweetens life, and molifies its cares ; it begets consideration, accommodation, respect and love. It enables us to be truthful in all our dealings with each other, and to be lenient. It enables us to be cheerful under all circumstances.
