All things perish save virtue BY All Things Perish Save Virtue. EPAMINONDAS. Sweet Morn—so cool, so calm, so bright, The bridal of earth and sky, The dew shall weep thy fall to-night, For thou must die. Sweet Rose—whose fragrance new I crave, To glad my sense and joy mine eye, Thy root is ever in its grave, And thou must die. Sweet Spring—so full of shine and showers; It makes the weary spirit sigh To think, with all thy herbs and flowers, That thou must die. Sweet Music—e'en the lovely song, Which from my harp, in window high, Is floating on the breeze along, E'en thou must die. And all the bright and glittering train Of stars that stud the deep-blue sky, Must they all perish—none remain To glad the eye? And vales, and fields, and rushing streams. And mountains that invade the sky, Are they as baseless as our dreams t And must they die? And all that's beautiful and fair On nature's face—love's melody That makes sweet music of the air,— All—all must die! And man, frail form of senseless clay, Though now his glance is proud and high, Perchance upon this passing day He, too, may die. But the bright soul—that shined within The quenchless light in mortal form— Though dimmed by misery and sin, Defies the worm. When all the stars shall fade away, And suns in their own blaze expire, And trackless comets cease to stray With wand'ring fire, The soul shall ever live, nor know The lapse of time, but dwell on high, And share in endless joy or woe. Eternity.
