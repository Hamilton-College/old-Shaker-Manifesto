Dear Youth;--'Blessed are the meek'... Shaker Station, Ct. April, 1895. Dear Youth;'Blessed are the meek.' Meekness is one of the characteristics o God's people. You are exhorted by precept and example to have a submissive, meek and resigned spirit. How much happier you might be if you would learn more Christian patience, and receive with meekness and humility all chastening necessary for your purification as coming from your heavenly Father for your eternal good. Jesus was patient, pure, submissive and meek. Walk in his footsteps. Humility and meekness are beautiful ornaments of refinement and culture; it is a mistaken idea of refinement or a false culture that ignores either. One of the fruits of the Spirt is meekness, and you are encouraged to walk in the heavenly pathway 'with all lowliness and meekness' and to 'put on mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, and to follow after righteousness, love and patience.' You can not be too humble and meek. Clothe your soul with humility. Those who are humble are like Jesus, in that respect. Increase in every virtue that will fit you for heaven. Purity is a lovely ornament and very much you need it. Scorn improper conduct. Be guided by truth and keep clean within. 'Blest are they who seek in their youth, With spirit meek the way of truth.' Daniel Orcutt.
