PARAPHRASE. Oliver C. Hampton. / and my Father are one. Jno. x., 30. And now, 0 Father, glorify thou me with the glory which I had tvith thee before the world was. Jno. xvii., 5. Vast Presence, O glorify me In fullest at-one-ment insphered With the glory which I had with Thee Ere suns, stars or planets appeared. Shekinah, O give me to know That I and the Father are one, In unison ever to grow With the sentiment � 'Thy will be done.' I ask not thy gifts but Thyself, With conscious identity still As ocean consists of the pelf Of every bright river and rill. Attraction eternity's own O energy constant of love Still harvesting blessing alone From regions below and above. Draw oceans and rivers in one, With separate identity still; Draw sweetly by glow of thy sun And all evolutions fulfill. Bring clouds and the rainbow serene To bless the fruitions of earth; And Faith�and Hope's prismatic sheen My emblem of spiritual birth. Gyration from lower to higher For higher and highest prepared. Nirvana, to thee I aspire In love universal insphered. Christ thought it but proper and meet To call himself equal with God; In Deific oneness complete Attracting all else at his nod. So men are but embryo Christs Destined to all glory on high; Not representations or castes, Mere images, sapless and dry. I said ye are Gods, is the word Declared by the seer of old, In rapture and ecstasy heard Of glory and power untold. So man's an equation for God Of Deific fire composed; With energies endlessly broad In endless progression disclosed. O prodigal�wandering star, Arise and thy mansion descry, Whose realm is no region afar, Whose oneness with God brings it nigh. Thy inmost Divine is the home Of God the eternal serene; Then cease thou forever to roam O'er the cinders of sorrow and sin. Take note of thine infinite powers Eise out of thy sickness and sin; Dwell not with the fugitive hours Where shams and delusions begin. O lusts of inferior things Degrading and d.....g to man; Defiling both beggars and kings With feculence, blasting and ban. O selfish proclivities all, Depart ye forever from me; Your pleasures so suddenly pall And crumble to dust and debris. O let me forget that I am, From love to my friend and my foe; In soothing with heavenly balm, All sickness and sorrow and woe. In mercy O let me be lost To all that is selfish and mean; Old self to perdition be tossed With sickness, corruption and sin. Xo feverish yearning for such, No sorrow or sickness or pain The soul or the body can touch, Or spirit can possibly stain. So is the great mystery solved Eternal vitality here; Even life all immortal evolved A future eternal to cheer. As in the beginning we read The Word was both with and was God. So man as an infinite need Evolved at the infinite nod. So rise man immortal and claim Thine endless estate in the word; Thy glorious nature and name, At-one-ment complete with the Lord.
