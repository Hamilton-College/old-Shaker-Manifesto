Enfield, Conn. We should not be easily discouraged We would always be down in the valley of despair if we did not constantly exert ourselves to rise; it is only the faint-hearted who are kept down. Truly noble minds overcome all things, but it requires effort. Perseverance is essential to success. 'Joys and sorrows alike are sent To give the soul fit nourishment.' Let the winds blow cold and chill as they may, we can still cherish the warm sunshine of God's eternal love in our hearts, and bend willingly to the duties that lie in our pathway. We should be social and spiritual beings, and we must benefit others all we can, for we shall be sure to receive as much good as we give. Poultry is a subject which will never be exhausted by those who like the business, but how to make it pay is a question that everyone is not able to answer. Economy is one of the foundation stones on which to build success. There must be a close attention to details, a constant looking after the little things which seem at first almost too insignificant to notice, if one would be successful in poultry raising. A little neglect here and there, too much food to-day, and not enough to-morrow, count for a good deal in the long run, and always on the wrong side of the balance sheet. Warmth and cleanliness are as essential as food. Success in poultry means hard work and plenty of it, with a good deal of judgment. D. Orcutt.
