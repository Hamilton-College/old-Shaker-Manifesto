EARTHLY AMBITION E. T. LEGGETT Does fate or necromancy reign O'er all this world of ours, That pleasure only ends in pain, Hope's brightest stars go down again, And thorns are mixed with flowers ? See man each ghostly mine explore, Or breast Old Ocean's wave; Here fighting for the shining ore, And there to crown his golden store With glory or the grave. Yet when he's worn each glittering prize. And laurels wreathe his brow, Is heaven beaming from his eyes ? Does joy light up his sunset skies? Is hope fruition now ? No! passion holds him as her own; Sin has her empire there; His heart a desert wild has grown; Of hope bereft, his pride alone, Now battles with despair. His childhood thoughts, his dreams of yore, When heaven was on his brow; His mother's voice now heard no more, Save echoing from the shadowy shore; As ghosts but haunt him now. He knows no God but glittering gold, And worships at its throne; For this his faith, his hopes are sold — For thti, in death, he's growing old — Who lived for earth alone.
