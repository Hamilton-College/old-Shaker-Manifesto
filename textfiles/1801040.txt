LET IN THE SUNLIGHT Hamilton De Graw How that call already brightens all the hopes of the mind. Let in the sunlight. To the pale sickly plant striving to grow in the damp mildew lined cellar how refreshing and invigorating is the sunlight. Watch the gradual change from the faded and colorless tissues to the deep green and healthy look that has been wrought in its organism through the agency of the sunlight. As the sun is the material fountain from which flows the life invigorating elements that make the universe habitable to both animal and vegetable organisms, so from the fountain of Eternal Truth come those life inspiring forces that illumine the soul of man and enable him to grow in the spirit. O the wail that comes up out of the subterranean caverns where souls are pining in darkness. '' Give us the light! Let in the sunlight on our souls or we perish ! !' Wheu I see souls who should stand upright walking in the image of their Creator an honor to the truth and a glory on the earth, groveling in the lowest depths of those appetites and passions that completely shut out the sunlight and make the chambers of the soul only a fit habitation for bats and lizards, how I wish that some spiritual earthquake would shatter the walls of the imprisoned soul and open it to God's blessed sunlight. Refreshing showers are often needed in the spiritual as well as the physical world, moral convulsions, loud peals of thunder and vivid flashes of lightning to awaken the dormant sou.1; but after all it would be useless if the sunlight of God's love did not come to warm and inspire with new life the now quickened soul.
