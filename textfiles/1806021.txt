THE HOME 'OVER THERE.' Emma Train You may tell of the beauty of Heaven's fair shore, Of its flowers of richest perfume; Of its skies, where the sunlight is clear evermore, With no winter to wither the bloom. But to me there's a fact that is dearer by far In the midst of life's struggle and care, To my spirit 'tis ever a Bethlehem star, It is this; there are homes ' over there.' You may tell of the Temples of learning and art, Of the halls built for music so grand, Where the glory of wisdom descends to each heart, And the Cultured together can stand; But there's ever a story more precieus to me, And a truth that's more holy and fair, It is this; when from earthly conditions we're free We shall find real homes ' over there.' Real Homes, where we'll gather with those we have In the love of the sweet long ago, [missed Those who passed from our view by the death angel 'Mid our tears in the valley below. [kissed All the treasures of wisdom we've garnered on earth, All the beauties of soul, rich and rare, All the memories made up of kindness and worth We shall find in our homes ' over there.' We are painting the pictures, dear friends, every day, We are rearing the arches and walls, In the mists and the clouds of earth's shadowy way, W' are forming the parlors and halls; May we ever build broadly and grandly and well, With our spirits illumined by prayer, So that when we pass over those portals to dwell, We'll find joy in our homes ' over there. ' Better Way,
