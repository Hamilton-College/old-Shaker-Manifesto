THE FUTURE IS OURS. ANNIE R. STEPHENS I stand entranced upon the mount of vision, And watch the shadows ilowly disappear, I catch bright glimpses of that land elysian Where Truth hath triumphed in its grand career. The mists of time like darkening clouds impending Now vanish in the glow of morning light, I feel that God His heralder is sending, To usher in the glorious dawn of right. There have been those upon this earth of ours, Who still are here, though numbered with the dead, Their memories rise like softly breathing flowers, Whose fragrance lasts when life and beauty's fled. From sordid gain and honor backward turning, They sought on earth a higher joy to find, They nobly toiled, all selfish impulse spurning, They lived to God, to truth, and all mankind. And now we see 'twas no utopean dreaming, That fired their souls unto a holy flame, (ing, They saw the twilight through the midnight gleamWe see the sunrise, and the shadows wane. 'Tis now for those who feel earth's needs and losses, Unflinchingly to live God's laws divine, To raise Truth's standard through opposing forces, And speak the true word in the storm and shine. The sins of earth, of ignorance and error, That long have chained the soul in thraldom's might, Shall quell beneath Truth's conquering power with And flee before the coming golden light. (terror: O bright the future as it flows toward us! Diffusing glory, sweeping sin away; With radiant hope the heavens are beaming o'er us, Now is the sunrise of the perfect day. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
