TRUTH ROBERT AIKEN What is it ? I answer, the glory of time, and the daughter of eternity. A title of the highest grace and a part of divine nature. It is the life of religion—the light of love—the grace of wit—and the crown of wisdom. It is the beauty of valor, the brightness of honor, and the joy of earth. Her nature is pure gold, her time is right precious, her words most glorious, and her essence is God. His wisdom and her words redound to glory. Truth is honored in constancy, admired in patience, and beloved in charity. She hath a pure eye, and a plain hand; a piercing thought, and a perfect heart. She is wisdom in the way of holiness and taketh her rest in the resolution of goodness. Her church is without schism, her city without fraud, and her kingdom without vice. It is the perfection of nature, where God in Christ shows the glory of Christianity.
