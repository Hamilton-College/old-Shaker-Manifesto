A VERY ECONOMICAL AND WONDERFUL STEAM ENGINE. ENTITLED ' THE SHIPMAM ENGINE.' The Shakers of Watervliet, Albany Co., N. Y., have for some months been using a No. 2. 'Shipman Engine' rated at full one horse power, to drive from 7 to 8 Sewing machines; the power is ample, and, no doubt is sufficient to drive still more machines if desired. The engine works more than satisfactorly, t works most charmingly! requiring no engineer; is attended to by one of the sisters, a few moments, about four times a day, simply to supply the oil, and see that the water is duly supplied, without interruption by the engine's pump. The Compauy manufacture �three sizes of Engines. No. 1�];, to l-.j lorse power. No. 2, full one horse power. No. 3, full two horse power. Said Engine is a wonderful David of a Giant.�Its weight about 245 lbs. Extreme floor space 42 by 23 inches, height aoout 2)� ft. Pully 9 inches in diameter; 450 revolutions per. minute. Cylinder 2 inches in diameter; stroke 3 inches. Price $125.00. This includes crating and free delivery on Cars, from 'Shipman Engine Company.' No. 55, Franklin St. Boston, Mass. 'Description and explanation of the engine. This engine differs from all other Engines m the following particulars. 1st. It requires ao engineer. 2nd. It is absolutely free from iire or explosion. 3rd. It can be started in the morning and takes care of itself until night, with only a notice of a few moments two or three times. 4th. It consumes only the amount of fuel required for the power iaken. Our engine, No. 2, drives 7 sewing machines 10 hours, with 5 gallons of Kerosene Oil, at a cost of 32J2 cts. 5th. When the engine stops, instantly expense stops, as it puts out its own fire, and lights it again when necessary. 6th. The fire-box is surrounded by water, so that no heat is wasted t&gt;y radiation. 7th. The Oil tank is surrounded by water. 8th. The fire is formed by the pressure of air or steam flowing through an automizer which throws the kerosene in a very, fine spray into the fire-box, this causes an intense blast of fire, getting up steam in about ten minutes. The oil is thus consumed without any wicks, steam is often raised in five minutes. No smoke is made, no soot. A match puts fire in full blast instantly. 9th. There is a diaphram so arranged as to control the steam so that an even amount can be carried, according to the work required. Thus, suppose 100 lbs of steam is required, set the diaphram so that the pressure of steam will put out the fire at 105 lbs pressure. This diaphram is absolutely an automatic fire regulator, the first practical one ever invented. It is also an absolute safeguard against over pressure in the boiler. Besides this, for double guard, there is a safety, or pop valve. 10. There is an automatic water regulator, so that if the water supply is sufficient this regulator will always keep the proper supply in the boiler, being another safeguard against accident. 11. There is a. water glass, so that the amount of water can always be determined ; this is located close by the pump. 12. A very important feature is a practical automatic oiling apparatus, so that all parts of the engine are oiled without the necessary care otherwise necessary attending it. ' The Shipman Engine Co., aforesaid, have dealt so nobly and generously with the Shakers relative to the introduction of the aforesaid engine, (which, being among the first set up was attended with some difficulties, but which, at length, are all overcome,) that we publish this notice for the benefit of all who may see the same, and desire a small practical power. The same is published without the knowledge or solicitation of the company, by those who would desire to be true benefactors ! The Shakers, Albany Co., N. Y.
