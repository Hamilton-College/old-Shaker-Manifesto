USELESS STUDIES FOR GIRLS The other day a young girl of our acquaintance, who is pursuing a selected course of study in one of the collegiate institutions of the city, was examining the printed curriculum with reference to deciding what study she should take up next term. While consulting about the matter she read over the long list of text-books on science, language, literature and mathematics, when suddenly she exclaimed, 'I'll tell you what I would like to study— I would like to study medicine. I don't mean that I want to be a physician and practise, but to know what to do at home if anybody is sick or anything happens. I am sure that it would be more useful to me than'—and she turned to the prescribed course of study— 'than spherical trigonometry and navigation? But we can't run for a doctor every time anybody sneezes or coughs, and I would like to know what to do for any one who is a little sick ' Here is a matter concerning which young women need some simple but careful instruction. But who gives them any? As daughters in the family, they can repeat the dates of the Grecian and Roman wars, work out aa intricate problem in algebra, and give the technical names of all the bones in the body; but if the baby brother left in their charge burns his hand or is seized with croup, how many of them know the best thing to do while waiting for the doctor? And when, as wives and mothers, the duties of life increase, how many of them have any practical knowledge which will help them to meet calmly and intelligently the every-day experience of accidents and illness which are inevitable in every family?—Harper's Bazar.
