Weak eyes Weak eyes.—A very simple remedy for weak or sore eyes is recommended,as follows : Get a five-cent cake of elder-flowers at the druggist's, and steep in one gill of soft water —it must be steeped in bright tin or earthenware; strain nicely, and then add three drops of laudanum; bottle it tight and keep in a cool place; then use it as a wash, letting some of it get in the eyes. Follow this, and -elief is certain. If the eyes are painful or much sore, make small soft compresses, wet in the mixture, and bind over the eyes at night. I can warrant the above as harmless and sure, having tried it in a number of cases where other skill and remedies had utterly failed. If the eyes are badly inflamed use it freely; and a tea made of elder-flowers, and drank, would help cleanse the blood. Pure rock salt and water will strengthen your weak eyes if you bathe them daily in it. I would earnestly advise you to avoid mixtures or washes containing mineral or other poisons.
