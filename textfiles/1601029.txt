Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Sept. 1885 The Circulars, 'What shall I DO to Become a Shaker ' and ' Information for Inquirers ' are at hand. They are neatly printed and fully satisfactory. We have sent some into several of the states and have also sent some to England. We will circulate our leaflets and pamphlets and books to herald the Christian Invitation. Your Brother Giles B. Avery
