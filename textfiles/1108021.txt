WHEREFORE? That the Shakers and their peculiar life should appear novel in a professedly Christian country is entirely in favor of Shaker preeminence, and speaks badly for the simply professed, when comparison and contrast are drawn between Shaker life and ordinary, worldly life, and both compared with the life of the first Christian. We wonder, when people, calling themselves Christian, professing so great admiration for Jesus and His life, yet seeming to and really despising the thought of living like Jesus, and deeming those unworthy of recognition who, at great expense to selfishness, are trying to live like Jesus. We cannot account for the wherefore of so great inconsistency of professedly Christian people. That which we admire, we will strive to be like. How much strife is there on the part of the great body of professors, to he, to live just like the Jesus whom they profess so great admiration for ? Is it unreasonable for Shakers, both to attempt a practical admiration of the Christ, by as exact a following as they are able, and to feel a little censorious toward those who are content with a very distant and un truthful admiration ? Wherefore admiration for the Jesus of old by expression, and almost detestation for any who try to be the Christs of to-day ? Wherefore should Shaker life be a novelty, to those who claim such familiarity with New Testament writings, descriptive of Jesus and his immediate disciples? Our platform simply introduces anew the religion of Jesus, which was -CELIBACY; positive EQUALITY among Christian brethren ; PEACE at expense of every thing else; and unspottedness from every thing worldly.
