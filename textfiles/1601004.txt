CALLING THE ANGELS IN We mean to do it. Some day, some day, We mean to slacken this fevered rush That is wearing our very souls away; And grant to our loaded hearts a hush That is only enough to let them hear The footsteps of angels drawing near. We mean to do it. Oh, never doubt, When the burden of daytime broil is o'er, We'll sit and muse while the stars come out, As the patriarchs sat at the open door Of their tents, with a heavenward-gazing eye, To watch for the angels passing by. We've seen them afar at high noontide, When fiercely the world's hot flashing beat: Yet never have bidden them turn aside, And tarry a while in converse sweet; Nor prayed them to hallow the cheer we spread To drink of our wine and break our bread. We promise our hearts that when the stress Of the life-work reaches the longed-for close [less, When the weight that we groan with, hinders We'll loosen o'^r thoughts to such repose As banishes Care's disturbing din. And then—we'll call the angels in. The day that we dreamed of comes at length, When, tired of every mocking quest, And broken in spirit and shorn of strength, We drop, indeed, at the door of rest, And wait and watch as the day wanes on— But the angels we meant to call are gone !
