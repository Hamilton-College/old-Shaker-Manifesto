The Pansy. Published by I). Lothrop &amp; Co. Boston Mass. The number for January is filled with interesting stories for juvenile readers, and is made very attractive by many beautiful illustrations. $1.00 a year, The New England Magazine, Jan., 1886. enters an enlarged field with a display of resources and an outline of plans which seem to justify the expectation that it has before it a successful future, and will worthily bear its historic name. The number before us presents a most attractive appearance, within and without. It comes to us as an enlargement of the Bay State Monthly, a periodical which has worked its way into a large degree of favor in Mass, and has made wonderfully rapid advances in public favor. Upon its handsomely designed covers are engraved the seals of each of the New England States, and its pages are profusely illustrated with engravings of unusual merit, the frontispiece being a superb line engraving, on steel, of Chief Justice Waite. The contents include a most readable article on Brown University, by Reuben A. Guild, LL.D.; a choice little poem by Edgar Fawcett; a description of 'A Summer Day Outing' on the part of Daniel Webster, by John K. Rogers; an excellent article, descriptive of Attleboro', Mass., by C. M. Barrows; 'Art in Book Illustrated,' by Charles E. Ilurd, of the Boston Transcript; 'Richard and Gamaliel Wayte, and some of their Descendants/'� among them the Chief Justice of that name,�by Arthur Thomas Lovell; a sketch of Col. Christopher Toppan; a graphic presentation of '� Social Life in Early New England,' by Ahson Titus; a discussion of the Life Insurance problem, by G. A. Litchfield; some chapters of Frances A. Sparhawk's capital story, 'Elizabeth�a Romance of Colonial Days; and ably-edited departments, including History, Necrology, Literature, Notes and Queries, etc. This magazine appeals directly'to New Englanders, and we heartily commend it as worthy of their support. $3.00 a yr.

Some Noted Pkinces, Authors and Statesmen of our time, is the title of a beautiful book edited by James Parton and presented to the readers by the Henry Bill, Publishing Co. When it is said that in the long list of excellent articles we have a life picture of Arthur P. Stanley, Charles Dickens, Wm. M. Thackeray, The Prince of Wales, Charles Lamb, Thomas Hood, Henry Longfellow, John G. Whittier, Abraham Lincoln and many others and that among the writers we meet such persons as Cannon F. Farrar, James T. Field, Louise C. Moulton, Wm. H. Riding, James Parton, Mrs. John Lillie, Will Carlton and Ben Perley Poore, we need nothing more to assure us that the work is interesting, instructive and eminently profitable for all ages. As Thomas Campbell remarked in reference to his own writing's so may we of the work before us. ' It is an inexpressible comfort, to be able to look back, and feel that I have not written one line against religion or virtue.' The numerous illustrations in the work add very much to its value, both through pleasure and profit. The press-work is from the Office of Berwick &amp; Smith. The book is printed with a type of a beautiful face on excellent paper, and this feature, to those who are interested readers is a matter of no small consideration.
