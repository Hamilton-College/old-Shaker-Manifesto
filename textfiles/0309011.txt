TEMPERANCE In reply to a liquor dealer, who proclaimed, with an air of professional triumph, that he 'sold to decent people only, and that his business was highly respectable,' a Quaker said, ' Friend, that is the most damning part of thy business. If thee would only sell to drunkards and loafers, thee would help kill off the race, and society would be rid of them, But thee takes the young, the poor, the innocent, and the unsuspecting, and makes drunkards and loafers of them; and, when their character and money are gone, thee kicks them out, and turns them over to other shops to be finished off; and thee ensnares others, and sends them on in the same road to ruin.' Surely the good Quaker had the best of the argument, for he had facts on his side.
