PROGRESSION: A Sonnet MARTHA J. ANDERSON Eternal rounds ! the cyclic periods meet In grand succession, all replete, And in procession, spiral tower, Moved forward by an unseen power That veils the secrets of a plan Which moulds the destiny of man.

Thus, from the old evolves the new, From darkness light, from false the true, And life progressive onward tends 'Till infinite with finite blends.
