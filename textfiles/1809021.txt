TRUSTING GOD. [ Contributed by Harriet Shepard.] Christians might avoid much trouble and inconvenience if they would only believe what they profess, that God is able to make them happy without anything else. They imagine if such a dear friend were to die, or such and such blessings were removed, they should be miserable; whereas God can make them a thousand times happier without them. To mention my own case : God has been depriving me of one mercy after another : but as one is removed, he has come in and rilled up its place. Now when I am a cripple and not able to move, I am happier than ever I was in my life before, or ever expected to be; and if I had believed this twenty years ago, I might have been spared much anxiety. If God had told me some time ago that he was about to make me as happy as I could be in this world, and then had told me he should begin by crippling me in all my limbs, and removing me from my usual sources of enjoyment, I should have thought it a very strange mode of accomplishing this purpose. And yet how is his wisdom manifest even in this. Dr. Parson.
