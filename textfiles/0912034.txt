SEEDS C. G. Reed 1. We are sowing, daily sowing Countless seeds of good or ill, 2. Seeds that fall amid the stillness, Of the lonely mountain glen, 3. Seeds that lie unchanged unquickened, Lifeless on the teeming mould, 4. Thou who knowest all our weakness, Leave us not to sow alone! 5. Check the froward tho'ts and passions, Stay the hasty, heedless hands, Scattered on the level lowland, Cast upon the windy hill: Seeds cast out in crowded places, Trodden under foot of men; Seeds that live and grow and flourish, When the sowers hand is cold; Bid thine angels guard the furrows, Where the precious grain is sown; Lest the germs of sin and sorrow, Mar our fair and pleasant lands. Seeds that sink in rich brown furrows, Soft with heavens gracious rain; Seeds by idle hearts forgotten, Flung at random on the air; By a whisper, sow we blessings, By a breath, we scatter strife; Till the fields are crowned with glory; Filled with mellow, ripened ears Father, help each weak endeavor; Make each faithful effort blest; Seeds that rest upon the surface, Of the dry unyielding plain. Seeds by faithful souls remembered, Sown in tears and love and prayer. In our words and looks and actions, Lie the seeds of death and life. Filled with fruit of life eternal, From the seed we sowed in tears. Till Thine harvest shall be garnered, And we enter into rest.
