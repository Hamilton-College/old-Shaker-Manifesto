Couldn'n Stop —This is the way a great many get into difficulty—' they get a-going and they can't stop.' The boy who tells lies began at first to stretch the truth a little—to tell a large story—till he came out a full grown liar. Two boys began by battering each other, till they got a-going and couldn't stop. They separated with black eyes and bloody noses ! Did you hear about the young man stealing from his master's drawer ? He came from the country a promising boy. But the rest of the clerks went to the theater and smoked, and he thought he must do so too. He began thinking be would try it once or twice. He got a-going and could not resist the temptation when he knew there was money in the drawer. He got a-going—he will stop in prison. Some young men were, some years ago, in the habit of meeting together in a room at the public house, to ' enjoy themselves '— to drink and smoke. One of them, as he was going there one evening, began to think there might be danger in the way. He stopped and considered a moment, and then said to himself, ' Right about face !' He dropped his cigar, went back to his room and was never seen at the public house again. Six of the young men followed his example. The rest got a-going, and could not stop till they landed most of them in drunkard's graves. Beware, boys, of the first cigar or chew of tobacco. Be sure, before you start, that you are in the right way, for when you are going down hill it is hard to stop!
