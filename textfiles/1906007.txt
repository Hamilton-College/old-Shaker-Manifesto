PULLING UP STAKES. Alexander Y. Cochran. I hate been interested, very much of late, iu the published accounts of the thousands and thousands of people who are moving into the new territory of Oklahoma. Five hundred covered wagons on one line, and each wagon contained a family and possibly all they possessed of this world's goods. They were moving on to their anticipated Laud of Promise, to a new land. They are decidedly in earnest to improve their fortunes. They mean business, the acquisition of wealth, and all other matters are of secondary importance. They had moved off from their old earth territory, had in fact pulled up stakes, and were determined to occupy a new place. Are we who profess to be Christians as earnest in seeking the kingdom of heaven ? It would do us good to pull up stakes and start for a new spiritual territoryï¿½and be determined to own a right to a privilege in the kingdom of God. We too may find the promised Land, and this, like an earthly possession must be taken by violence, by persistent, individual effort. Let us all take a new departure spiritually. Do a little better than we have ever done before ; take new steps in the path of righteousness. Canterbury, N. H.
