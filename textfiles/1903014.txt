REPLY. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Jan. 1889. Mrs. Ada M. Bittenbender, Dear Friend :�Your favor of 14th. inst. received. Thanks for the document sent, proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution, to prohibit the manufacture of alcohol &amp;c. I have read it carefully, and endorse it fully. I enclose some of my articles, in addition to the one you ask for. As a religious order, we prohibit the use of alcoholic drinks ; have done so with good results for the last thirty years. Your Sunday legislation I do not approve. 'This is not a Christian Government,' Washington declared ; and I fully agree with him. It is for all peo- the inalienable rights of all. Every day of the week is a Sabbath to some religious order of people. Each religion has its prophets, its Bible, its creed. Do you not see that the province of government is to secure to all, what all have a right to, without interfering with the reserved rights of any one? And above all religious people should be just, and give to those whom some erroneously and slanderously call infidels� like Paine, Jefferson, Washington, and Lincoln,�the honor and credit of being the founders of our government and authors of our constitution. To use the powers of the government against those who were its authors and founders, would be high treason against Divine Providence and humanity at large. 'Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?'� Abraham asked in astonishment, the God of Israel; and I ask, shall not those religious people, who claim to be, of all others, the servants of the living God, be the first to do justice to the Rationalists, who, in the nobility of their souls, framed a constitution that secured even to their most bitter, fanatical enemies� the Christians so-called�the same freedom of faith and liberty of conscience that they themselves desired to possess and exercise without let or hindrance? If we love our religious enemies, and do right by them, will there be any danger of our wronging others? Shakers make as high a religious profession and claim to be as spiritual, as any other denomination. They live celibate lives ; own their land in common ; use no alcohol or tobacco ; will soon (all of them) eat no meat; do not fight; dress plain ; and labor to provide things hones: in the sight of all men. Yet they bless such men as Ingersoll. for the truth he holds, and the good he does, and the evil he refrains from doing: in other words, for the self-denial he practices, and because he loves his fellow men ; they judge him by his deeds not by his belief. Church and State governments generate Inquisitions. The highest form of human hate is when men and women� whilst tormenting their fellows with religious persecutions, and even killing them�think that they are doing God good service. Does the infidel believe in such a God, or love his worshipers? Will murder, in any of its forms, convert him? Is that overcoming evil with good ? I hope you Reforming women will 'make haste slowly,' and keep clear of Babel priests, and Church and State legislation. Respectfully, F. W. Evans.
