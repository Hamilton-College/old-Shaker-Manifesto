AGRICULTURAL 'Now try it,' in the Country Gentleman — the best agricultural journal in this country— gives us the kernel of success with stock, when he writes the following article. We keep cows for their milk, and to get the largest quantity of this, no reasonable pains should be spared. * COMFORT OF FARM STOCK. The idea of comfort, practically and intelligently regarded, is the key to success with all farm stock ; other things equal, the most comfortable animal is the best looking and most profitable. Acting accordingly, some ten years ago, in December, I devoted a half day's work, $2, to tightening up a stable for five cows, so that no manure froze in it afterward, and instead of having less milk every cold snap and more every thaw, it was more right along, in milk, comfort in milking, cleaning the stable, health of cows and thrift of calves, and only less in amount of feed required. One small Ayrshire coming in just then didn't vary three pounds from 35 pounds of milk per day, and 10 pounds of butter per week, for five months. Publishing my experience in the New England Farmer, led others to go and do likewise, and some years after, one correspondent said, that one item was worth more to him than the cost of the paper — and so gave the ball another push, as all should do. I found that with a properly constructed stable, the animal heat from a cow will keep a space five times her size above freezing temperature, and still allow good ventilation about her head, regulated at pleasure by an adjustable door in front. The winter profits of dairies may be increased a third, in saving of caloric and food, and increased milk and calf product, by remembering that a kind man is kind to his beast, and that disregarding their comfort ' costs money.'
