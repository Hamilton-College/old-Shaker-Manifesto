DISCIPLINE M. J. A. Covet thou the holy spirit of discipline ; that which controls the thoughts, directs the motives, bridles the tongue, veils the eyes, sets a seal upon the lips, reins the emotions, subdues the passions, guards the morals, c orrects the habits, governs the appetites, graces the carriage, lightens the footsteps,re fines the manners, softens the language, chastens the loves, quickens the Kpirit, expands the soul, moulds the intellect, and inspires to ever increasing goodness. Thus shalt thou through the perfective grace of Wisdom, be transformed from the animal and earthly into the divine likeness of thy heavenly Father and Mother. ML Lebanon, N. Y.
