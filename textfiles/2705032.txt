Word and Works Word and Works for April makes its Forecast for the month with all the assurance of a well directed mind. There will be no anxious waiting this time as the Editor says, 'a regular storm period is central on the 2nd day of the month, and that April will bring an unusual amount of rain and some violent Venus storms.' If there is not, on that day, a regular blizzard in our town, we shall make arrangements to enquire of the man in the Moon. April is to bring us storms of rain and hail and thunder, but the Editor says.�'Let no one be foolishly alarmed, as though we predicted unknown calamity, but let all calmly watch and provide against nature's regular visitations.' The articles on Temperance have a leading value for the paper, and the writers are the manifested friends of humanity. In the Department of 'The Word,' are to be found some very pleasant and timely religious remarks that must have been written by thoughtful minds. Word and Works Pub.

The Book of Daniel in the Light of the Higher Criticism The Book of Daniel in the Light of the Higher Criticism; by I. D. Steele. The object of the author of this little pamphlet, aided by the timely Notes of Br. H. L. Hastings, is to prove that the Prophet Daniel and the Book of Daniel are just what they purport to be. True to the man, and true to his writings. Sometimes the Higher Criticism makes sad havoc with the prophets anil apostles, an 'I ii they had it all their own way they would soon make the Hible smaller than a pocket testament. It is a good thing to see men zealously defending what they eonseien tiously believe to be right. One of the writers makes this remark, 'Everything concerning the world's so-called snere.l writings, is a proper subj' et for investigation. Their origin, authorship, date, claims, teachings and histo' ry, all must pass in review, and if we have been misled or mistaken in any of these particulars, we must revise our conclusions in the light of establisht facts.' This is J.ind ami considerate and the skeptical mind must so accept it. I'ublisht by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Bcston, Mass.
