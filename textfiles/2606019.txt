To the Dear Brethren and Sisters... [ We have received the parting blessing of a Brother in the faith who lived in the city of Philadelphia. He passed away on the 9th\of last March, at the age of 57 years. Ed ] To the Dear Brethren and Sisters: We are remembering with great pleasure the visit of Eldress Alvira to our family, and also the birthday of our blessed Mother Ann Lee, February 29. To the beloved Editor of The Manifesto we send hearty greetings and love for the many kind favors we have received. By this note I show my thankfulness, and not only for myself, but also our little family in the city of brotherly love, who have through your liberality been blest with copies, each month, of The Manifesto. I also remember with pleasure, and in all kindness, my privilege to visit the dear friends at Mt. Lebanon, at Watervliet, and at West Pittsfield, in 1882. Affectionately, August Meltzer.
