A GREAT WHITE THRONE. F. W. Evans. ' I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, before whose face the earth and heaven fled away, and there was no place found for them.' Rev. xx., 11. SHAKERISM. The great white throne is Shakerism�the Resurrection Order. In it and on it sits, rules, and reigns, the Christ spirit, in judgment. Its fundamental principle is, the duality�Fatherhood and Motherhood�of God. CHRIST HEAVENS. Christ heavens as the first materialization from Deity. It is the fountain of prophecy to earth and to all mundane worlds and when the harvest time of a world has come, a Savior appears, who is an incarnation of a Christ angel, as were Jesus and Ann ; and souls are reaped or cut oflf�resurrected�from the generative, propagative order ; they become Christians. DEATH AND RESURRECTION. They hate their own life as a natural, reproducing, animal man or woman ; become celibates, and forsake father, mother, wife and children�all generative ties ; there being in Christ neither male nor female. PEACE. The counsel of peace is betwixt them both ; male and female, they become equal in all forms of government, civil and ecclesiastical, in the new earth and in the new heaven. SELFISHNESS. The selfish, personal property nature�mine and thine�is ignored ; houses and lands are forsaken ; and community of goods is established, as a fundamental principle of the new heavens ; and co-operation in the new earth. EQUALITY OF SEXES. Wars will not cease to the ends of the earth, until the war-element is subdued in the individual. Peace or nonresistance is therefore a fundamental principle of genuine Christianity, and of the new earth, too. SALVATION. Salvation from the sins of the world pertaining to sexuality, property, wars and fightings, to ambition, love of power, to eating flesh�meat�to drinking, to tobacco, alcohol, and all lusts of flesh and mind. His name was called Jesus, because he would save his people from their sins. LABOR. Work consecrated ; 'hands to work and hearts to God.' All labor, from the Ministry and Elders to the children. 'He who will not work, neither shall he eat.' AMBITION. He who would be great among you, let him gain distinction by doing the most good to others. Labor is worship. KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. Faith that the Christ spirit has now come, the second time ; being manifested in a representative woman, Ann ; as it was manifested the first time through a representative man, Jesus. They are the Cherubim. The counsel of peace is between them both. The tabernacle of God is with man ; the kingdom has come. The above principles are in practical operation among the people called Shakers ; anJ thus is formed the white throne, upon which the spirit was seen to sit, by the revelation of John. White represents the righteousness of saints ; a sinless life. THE DEAD. '�And I saw the dead, small and great stand before God, and the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is tiie book of life. Aud the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.' MEMORY. 'The books' are the two lobes of the brain, wherein is recorded, as in tablets every deed done in the body, good aud bad. 'I take to witness the grace of the people to come, for they shall call their sins to remembrance, and acknowledge them !' JUDGMENT. As these books exist in each individual, the Christ spirit came to convict them of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, and that is their day of judgment, when the books are opened. CLOUDS OF HEAVEN. It is said Christ would be seen coming in the clouds of heaven. The earth-cloud is formed by the aggregation of individual drops of rain ; and the clouds of heaven�Shaker families, Societies�are formed in the same way. And Jude saith, 'Behold! The Lord cometh, with ten thousand of his saints to judge the world, and to execute judgment upon all; to convict all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, and of all their hard speeches. And when the enemy should come in like a flood, the Lord will lift up a standard of righteousness against him.' That standard is the testimony of Jesus, which Shakers live out. IMPERFECT. The testimony of Noah made not the antediluvians perfect; every imagination of their hearts being evil continually. Neither did it make Noah perfect, except in his generative life. He was perfect in his generations; not in getting drunk. THE LAW OF MOSES. The law made not the comers thereunto perfect. The dispensation was a stepping-stone, a schoolmaster; by it was a knowledge of sin. Sin is generation ; in agriculture, in physiology, in food and drink, in property, in usury ; and in wars and fightings with the heathen. The sins of idol worship ; and personal violence. 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH. Neither did that bring full salvation from the sins of the world. The disciples 'knew in part, prophesied in part, and saw as through a glass, darkly.' But, they united and groaned in spirit for that dispensation to come, that would make them perfect as God is perfect. SECOND CHRISTIAN CHURCH. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth ; for the first earth and the first heaven had passed away. And there was no more sea. The new heaven was the kingdom of heaven which Jesus set all people praying for. It has come ! NO MORE SEA. Babylon had fallen, and 'the great whore that sitteth upon many waters,' which constitute the sea�''peoples, and multitudes, and nations and tongues,' �Church and state adulterous mixtures of politics and religion�these will pass away, and no place be found for them. NEW EARTH. And the white cloud, formed by resurrection saints, constitutes the new heaven in which the Christ abides. CHURCH AND STATE GOVERNMENTS,- - -Are all founded in force, and maintained by fraud. The conqueror took possession by the sword, and then enacted laws by which the conquests are transmitted to posterity. AMERICAN REPUBLIC. Monarchy, aristocracy, primogeniture, national religions fled away, and no place was found for them in the American republic. The sovereign people have universal suffrage (except women,) and elect their own rulers from their own ranks. CHATTEL SLAVERY. This remained. It, too, has fled away, and uo place is found for it, legally, in the United States ; where all men are said to be born equal and free, possessed of inalienable rights to land, air, water, light, and heat, to sustain them and allow them to pursue after happiness. BLOOD. The quasi-religious governments of Christendom are all literally turned to blood. They exhaust the resources of the nations, in creating and supporting armies, navies, forts, and arsenals, and monitors�the munitions of war competing eternally with each other, in an endless struggle to each one exceed the other, even in time of peace. Thus it is war expenses and taxes, all the time ; and there is no place found for the millions of poor, landless people but in the army an 1 navy, and in the poor-houses and prisons of their ruined countries. WAGES SLAVERY. Food, clothing, shelter, the people must have, at aay cost, aud upon any terms, or die. They are in a slavery worse than chattel slavery, except a delusive idea of freedom. The system has come to its culmination ; capital and labor are at war ; where will it end ? In blood or bread. In a destructive revolution ; or in restoring the robbed rights of the people back to them. Then they would have land�bread� and wages. Slavery, with poverty, war, and bloodshed, would flee away, just as chattel slavery fled away. ROME. Roman prisoners were made to fight each other, in her immense amphitheatres, for the amusement of the people ; as did gladiators and savage beasts. Sometimes thousands of the prisoners were engaged, at one time, in these manoeuvres. 'War is a game that kings play at.' Here a republic played ut it in our Civil War. In Spain, 17, 000 heretics would be burned, or otherwise destroyed, for popular amusement, in their auto-de-fe exhibition of human wickedness. WAR TAXES. Every nation in Christendom is being eaten up by war-taxes, to raise and maintain armies and navies, to build forts, monitors, arsenals, an X in creating munitions of war. Millions of the best physical men, who ought to be married men, are kept iu idleness during peace, and for mutual butchery in war. It is war-taxes, all the time ; all the labor of the nations is turned to blood. Is not this Babylon? PROBATION IN THE SPIRIT WORLD. The sea gave up the dead which were iu it, and death and hell delivered up the dead which were iu them ; and they were judged every one according to their works. They were judged as were those in the flesh ; but lived according to Grod in the Spiritual Resurrection. And death and hell, which Antichrist lias created, and whicli are foundation stones in the temple in which the Man of Sin sits and reigns�were cast into the lake of fire�the fire of truth. Jesus said, 'I come to bring fire on earth''�the first earth and heaven ; 'and what will I if it be already kindled?' It will burn the world up. What man has created, God can destrcy ; but what God has created, man cannot destroy. Error and wickedness are temporary ; truth and righteousness, immortal. The world passeth away, and the lusts thereof; but the word of God abideth forever and ever. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
