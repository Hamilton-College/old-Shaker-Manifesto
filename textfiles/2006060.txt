Olive Walker Olive Walker, at North Family, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. May 11, 1890. Age 63 yrs. Twenty year ago sister Olive, unbeknown to friends and relatives, fled from them all leaving a beautiful external home with wealth and affluence behind, to find a heavenly home and a spiritual relation among Believers ; being naturally of a communistic turn of mind she soon found her lot and place among her new-found friends. Her course has been straightforward. Too soon for us, has this sweet spirit been transported from our home below, to the one above. 'Long has she carried the olive, From morn till set of life's sun, Wearing the palm and the laurel; Peace in its triumph is won.' A. W.
