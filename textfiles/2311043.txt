Phrenological Journal The rugged features of the Governor of Colorado meet the glance of the reader on opening the October number of the Phrenological Journal. The very interesting sketch of Charles Darwin's home life is concluded, and being by a lady who was an intimate acquaintance of the Darwin family, it is a specially valuable contribution to American literature. Dr. Oswald continues his Race Studies, concluding the paper on Italy. Prof. Sizer's fourth chapter on How to study Strangers is a profusely illustrated analysis of temperaments. The character studies No. 3 include Gen. Marshall C. Wentworth and Mrs. Wentworth, the portraits being of a line quality. Mrs. Wells gives condensed accounts of Mr. Isaac H. Julian, late member of Congress; Jonathan Kidwell and Silas Jones, all of Phrenological importance. The opening of the Institute sesbion is notable, abstracts of several excellent addresses being given. In department of Child Culture are several brief papers, while the Anthropological and Editorial section are filled. The Journal is published $1. 50 a year; 15 cts. a number. The last three months free to new subscribers for 1894. Address Fowler &amp; Wells Co., 25 East 21st Street, New York.
