CHRISTIAN FORGIVENESS. Nancy G. Danforth. ' How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him,- -till seven times?' note the reply ; 'I say not unto thee, until ?even times; but, until seventy times seven.' We sometimes sing, 'The power of our gospel is love;' love that forgives the erring, sorrowing ones ; a love that will not only forgive but forget past mistakes and grievances. If we say we forgive an offense, and then in after years refer to the same, can it be said that we really possessed the spirit of Christian forgiveness ? Is that forgiveness, which says without due thought, forgive, and then allows thought of the offense to fill the mind till the feelings become soured, and the general character morose and sadly in need of that charity, so grudgingly bestowed ? How lovely is genuine forgiveness. How it calms the troubled waters and soothes the soul to sweet peace ; when, like the child resting in parental love and care, all boisterous, conflicting passions are hushed to rest. This is the mission of the gospel of Christ, in this his second manifestation, wherein a Mother's spirit is plainly seen and felt. As wayward erring children, we may come near to that spirit, wherever we find it placed for our salvation, freely unburdening our souls,ï¿½all our griefs and afflictions, then how sweet and consoling the words, ' Ye are freely forgiven !' It is in such blissful moments that the enemy, who is ever on the alert, will seek to destroy souls by lulling them into a fancied security ; making them believe that the whole warfare is accomplished, the whole victory won, when the strife is not completed until the whole of nature is met and conquered, step by step. Then we may say, 'I have overcome the world.' Doing the best that we are able, we shall often stand in need of this forgiving love, therefore, we should ever be willing to extend the same to others, and still heed the injunction, 'Watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation.'
