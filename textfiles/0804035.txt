PROGRESSION Abraham Perkins Enfield, N. H. 1. I must live, must have my being; 2. Heaven invites me, conscience prompts me, Faith Ev and conscience must be free: Deeper, wider, ery die tate of my soul Urges onward, broader, higher, Every act and upward, heaven ward, Where pure inspi feeling be. Creeds and forms do but oppress me, rations roll. Ope' the golden portals wider, Burdens weighty adding more; Life alone, a Fuller explorations come; More to courtly living substance, All affliction bears me o'er, chambers lead me, Where progressive laws are known.
