SHAKERS The Shakers' church was overcrowded Sunday, when Elder Lomas delivered one of his best discourses— upon 'True Freedom''—reviewing the various governments, and the growth of liberty today in America. He said ' Washington was a father, as Lincoln was a saviour to his country; but back of each was a power that has fathered and saved our loved country, and this will continue so to do while the spirit of our constitution remains in force, and church and state are kept forever apart.' At the close he delivered an original poem. Albany Everting Times.
