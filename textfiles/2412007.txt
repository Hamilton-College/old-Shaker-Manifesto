Universality is the watchword... Univeesamty is the watchword of the age. If 'God hath made of one blood all the nations of the earth,' then shall mankind eventually become one brotherhood. The easy communication between the countries of the globe makes it possible. The exchange not only in the commodities necessary to physical life, but in thoughts, ideas and religious experiences, seem to be the moulding or leavening process. Intelligence grows apace, and the barriers of narrow sectarianism, and the monopoly of God and heaven, must give way to the broader ideas of enlightened reason and soul expansion. God is love, and when man grows to divinity of character he too will be loved, and will enlarge the sphere of his activities.
