WORDS OF TRUTH. Jennie C. Williams. Nothing good shall ever perish ; Only the corrupt shall die; Truth which men and angels cherish, Flourishes eternally. Not a mind but has its mission. Power of making woe or weal, So degraded none's condition That the world his might may feel. Words of kindness, words of warning, Deem not these may speak in vain ; Even t'ioso thy counsel scorning, Oft shall they return again. Words of kindness we have spoken, May, when we have passed away, Heal perhaps, a spirit broken, Guide a brother led astray. Not one act but is recorded, Not a word but has its weight; Every virtue is rewarded, Outrage punished soon or late. Let no being then be rated As a thing of little worth; Every soul that is created, Has its part to play on earth. Light on the Way.
