Harvard, Mass. March, 1895. Another month has fled, with its record of good or ill, its duties done or unfulfilled. But one thing is certain, Feb. has very nearly fulfilled its forecast for it gave us the severest storm of the seaon. It compares very unfavorably with a year ago. Then we were making maple sugar and honey. Now the snow is deep, and more is falling; the mercury low and no signs of spring. Such inclemency is enough to make one dream of Florida, or some other genial climate. Br. Andrew gives us glowing accounts of their Florida place. We hope it will prove as disirable as he anticipates, and may prosperity attend the movement. Accounts of Florida are as varied as the people who go there. Those who have prospected the state say some parts are fine, others worthless. Feb. 24th our good Br. Ezra B. Newton celebrated his centennial birthday. He had many relatives come to see him, also five reporters. In the afternoon we had a spiritual service, attended by about forty of the towns-people. Wood is being housed as fast as weather permits, that all may be in readiness for spring work. According to an old saying the prospect for a fruit crop is small. 'A snowy March, no fruit; but a dry, dusty March, plenty of fruit.' We hope for a bountiful harvest from the farm to replenish our loss of last fall. When we hear reports from Newfoundland and Nebraska, we feel our hearts overflow with sympathy for the sufferers with thanksgiving that our condition is no worse. Marcia M. Bullard.
