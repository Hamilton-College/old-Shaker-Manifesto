TRANSPLANTING MARY WHITCHER Behold the care for the transplanting Prom pots of earth to earthly sod! But what from earthly life to growing Into the spirit of our God ? Who watches here the chills of evening ? Who hides the scorching sun at noon ? None less than Saviours of Mt. Zion, And such the need in Zion's home. First let us bear our earth transplanting, As household plants to natural soil ; The atmosphere of every duty, Where man is placed to daily toil. If men and women, then, who need shield us 1 Shall other hands of earth, as ours, Be left to earn the bread to feed us, . And we make dormant equal powers ? Nay, heaven forbid. The call is equal; Gome up and do each with his might, And earn the blessing of the faithful, The joy and peace of doing right. Canterbury, N. H.
