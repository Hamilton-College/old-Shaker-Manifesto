ALL HAIL! WATSON ANDREWS. .All hail! All hail! the world awakes, Trm h spreads her mighty wings and error quakes; Old systems lose their creedal thrall, Their end subserved, they totter to their fall. As forest oaks with age decay And falling, open up the light of day To younger growths,ï¿½so weeds and forms Though standing through a thousand creedal storms, Succumb at last to Fate's decree, And leave the franchised world more wise and free; Being wiser grown we see the right, Being freer turned irom darkness unto light; See virtue as the narrow road, Leading from sin and sorrow up to God. Behold transgression of his laws Of all earth's woes the source and only cause, And that the heavenly paradise Lies in obedience and sacrifice. This being the sacrificial test, Obedience to God made manifest In truth, in purity and love, As seen in one anointed from above; First born of many brethren, He The first in meekness, love and charity, And since most meek, most loving and most kind, Obedience to him his subjects find To be an easy yoke indeed; A burden irom all sense of burden free, And now as then 'tis still the test, Obedience to God made manifest; In those who Walk the narrow road, The self-denying path that Jesus trod.
