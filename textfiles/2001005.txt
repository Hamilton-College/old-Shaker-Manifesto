CAUSE AND EFFECT Chancy Dibble A spark of Deity, divine, In every intellect doth shine. In meditation's calm review, The conscience speaks in accents true, And points us to a reckoning day, Where righteous deeds aloue bear sway. Endeavors, efforts, motives, aims, Will be the test of wisdom's claims. Vice brings remorse and bitter gloom, While virtue yields a sweet perfume. Whichever element we breathe, The impulse we in turn receive, To correspond with our desire ; Vice leads lower, virtue higher. The fruit we cultivate will grow, In quality, just what we sow. No power can righteousness impute Or change the nature of the fruit. If we our higher light obey, / There's purer joys along the way, Given by unerring laws To all who work in wisdom's cause. For higher life the soul aspires, A uuion with the angel choirs ; Step by step the race is run, Until the victory is won. By years of toil in virtues field A rich increase our lives will yield Of patience, wisdom, meekness, love, As in these graces we improve. Take courage toiling pilgrim, on, The prize is sure to every one. A sympathizing parent's care Assists our progress, hears our prayer, And will not, for true mercy's sake, Ooe contrite spirit e'er forsake. Watervliet, N. Y.
