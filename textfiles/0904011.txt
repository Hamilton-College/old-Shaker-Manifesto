100 With this issue of The Manifesto we complete our round number of an hundred. To those who have filed copies of all the volumes, it will be seen that we have held our own ground persistently, and how successfully. We aim, simply, through our pages, the illustration of the plain, undraped purity and unselfishness of genuine Christian life. Let none think that we hold a bigoted position in this ; for, being human like the rest of our fellows—having the same perversities and deficiencies to deal with religiously—we feel the power of the Christian's cross, to cut us off from the world and its pleasures, however inviting and pleasing to the senses ; yet are repaid, and more, by an elevated dominion over self and the world. We would not urge upon all the full cross of the Christian, knowing1 full well, how unable many are to endure it; but in this crowning, hundredth number, would call the special attention of believers and lovers of Christ to that question, treated upon elsewhere, which has come up for consideration with many, and may with thousands more: ' Ought I to be a Shaker.'
