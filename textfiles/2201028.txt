Sonyea, N. Y.. Dec. 1891. 'Tis time to remember Our notes for December, The last of the year ninety-one. The moments we're noting Away they are floating They scarcely arrive ere they're gone. ''Tis losing anil grasping, Our time so unlasting, The time no mortal can stay; Time's onward flowing, Forever 'tis going, 'Tis here, then away, far away. Fakm work, generally, seems to be advancing as effectually as is consistent with time and circumstances. We meet in the various conditions of life the class who believe in letting their moderation be known to all men, such a type of beings dot this planet from pole to pole. The wells drilled during the past montli are not finished. Well No. 1 contains sixty feet of water with an odor of gas every thing but agreeable. Well No. 2, records seventy-five feet of water with gas in abundance, (Groveland must be noted for its natural gas.) Mr. Dixon is in favor of shooting the wells with dynamite cartridg- es, arguing that this method will produce a greater and better flow of water. The wells will not in any case be flowing ones, as Mr. Cook was so sure they would be. It would be well for him to visit his flowing well. Plowing and soil preparing for another year's crops continues. Work of some kind must ever be the motto of the laboring community. One hundred and twenty-five acres are now in readiness for the growing of future fruit, a few more days will find a larger territory of newly turned soil. The summer days of December are just delightful, work indoors and out can be conducted with no concern for cold contracting, the tax on fuel and raiment is much lightened since the wonderful moderation in our winter weather. Perhaps the seasons are becoming mixed, a little of all in each. G. D. G.
