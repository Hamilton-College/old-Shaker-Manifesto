CHARCOAL FOR FOWLS There is one thing which nature does not supply, and which civilization renders quite necessary to fowls. It is charcoal. Charcoal of wood does not answer the purpose. But if any one will put an ear of ripe corn into the fire until the-grains are well charred, and then shell off the corn and throw it to the flock, he will see an eagerness developed and a healthy constitution brought about which will make a decided improvement, and the average yield of eggs greatly increased.
