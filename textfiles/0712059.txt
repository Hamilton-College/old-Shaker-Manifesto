The communications of farmers are always the most valuable matter in any paper; they deal with practical details, familiar to the man who comes face to face with difficulties and overcomes them. The editor can select such items of news or general interest as he thinks will be interesting and useful; but to build up a truly useful and practical paper, must rely very largely upon the assistance of practical men. â€”Mass. Ploughman.
