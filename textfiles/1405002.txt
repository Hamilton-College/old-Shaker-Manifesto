PRAYER. EMILY OFFORD. A POET has thus very correctly defined prayer: 'Prayer's the soul's sincere desire. Uttered or unexpressed; The motion of a hidden fire That burns within the breast. Prayer's the simplest form of speech That infant lips can try, Prayer's the sublimest strains, that reach The Majesty on high. ' ' When Jesus Avas on the earth he exhorted his disciples to pray without ceasing, but how many of those who profess to be his followers today regard this admonition, though so very important? The object of prayer is to free the mind from earthly care and lift it above the din and confusion that distract the sense, into an atmosphere that is pure and clear, a region of peace and serenity, where the soul may enjoy a foretaste of angel communion and gather a spiritual influence around it, that shall be as a wall of protection when storms of temptation and trial arise. The human heart is insufficient of it- self to withstand these, even the Stoutest and bravest at times quail beneath the rod of adversity. Therefore Wisdom teaches us to rely on the guidance of the Infinite Hand, and listen to the still small voice of God, the conscience, which is best felt and best heard in the sacred and silent hour of prayer. Ah ! who can estimate the good done under the influence of a prayerful spirit? But alas! how often is the hour of prayer spent in mere ceremony, leaving the heart untouched aud the soul as barren as before. How many precious opportunities passed by unimproved, golden moments wasted that can never be recalled. One of the first Believers said, 'every breath is continual prayer to God. ' Sincerity of heart and fervency of spirit are always well rewarded. God is ever 'ready to pour out His blessings upon those who earnestly seek never with-holding from souls that which is for their best good. If we ask in faith bowing in sweet submission to His will, we are sure to receive. Good angels are ever near and ready to aid those who are striving to rise in the resurrection of Christ. Our blessed Mother Ann, when on ï¿½earth, many times spent whole nights in fervent prayer and soul labor to gain the gift and power of God to enable her to overcome evil, by which means she gained complete control over her own spirit, and could at times silence her opposers. Blessed victory ! there is none greater than that of self-conquest, and this is gained only through humiliation, watchfulness and prayer. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
