GOOD RULES FOR EMERGENCIES Professor Wilder, of Cornell University, gives these short rules of action in cases of ac- cident. For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing, dash water into them; remove cinders, etc., with round point of a pencil. Remove insect from the ear by tepid water; never put a hard instrument into your ear. If any artery is cut, compress below. If choked, get upon all fours and cough. Smother a fire with carpets, etc. Water will often spread burning oil, and increase the danger. Before passing through smoke, take full breath, and then stoop low, but if carbonic acid is suspected, walk erect. Suck poisoned wounds, or, cut out the part without delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne to a hot coal or the end of a cigar. In cases of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling the throat, or by warm mustard. For acid poisons, give alkalies ; for alkaline poisons, give acids ; white of an egg is good in most cases. For apoplexy, raise the head and body ; for fainting, lie flat. If in the water, float on the back, with the nose and mouth projecting. For slight burns, dip the part in cold water ; if the skin is destroyed, cover with varnish.
