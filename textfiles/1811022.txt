Editorial. THE CHRIST LIFE. It is well to keep before our readers ' the reason for the hope that is in us,' and to present this so plainly that there need be no mistake in the forcing of a correct understanding. ' By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.' The interest which we manifest in the keeping of the laws of God will go far in determining the depth of our honesty. There is among the professors of Christianity and, indeed, among all other classes of men, a general understanding of what sin is, and the duty devolving upon mankind to suppress it, 'for sin is a transgression of the Law, ' or a transgression of the light which has been received into the mind. As it was the mission of Jesus to preach a system of righteousness, more exalted toward the realms of spirituality than was ever before known, so it was within his mission to publish a new commandment and at the same time, zealously to stimulate his followers to fulfill in their lives, the Mosaic commandments, and the God given testimonies of the prophets. As a faithfulness in this work of self-discipline was necessary to lead the soul to God, so it was equally necessary to establish the soul in the Christ Life. A state or condition where one can with confidence say as did the Apostle. 'I am persuaded that ueither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' A good Jew was a man blessed of God, and the Psalmist has made this observation, ' I have been young, and now I am old ; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging bread.' This testimony, so full of comforting assurance to the '' follower after righteousness' has reference to a people who lived under the Law. After an experience of 3000 years and the claiming of a greatly advanced position in all that pertains to a religious life, the Christian Church, of to-day could not, in confidence, say so much in favor of its own disciples. Jesus was more than a good Jew. He was spiritually baptized into an element of righteousness, that made him superlatively, a man of God, and a Redeemer of mankind. In accepting this position before men ; 'dealing honestly and loving mercy,' a course so at variance with the Jewish Church of his day, that it is said of him, 'He increased in wisdom and statue, and in favor with God and man.' Referring to his gospel work, he says, 'Think not that I am come to destroy the Law, or the prophets : I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.' 'Follow me.' Those who lived under the law and in the power of the prophets, were judged by the Law and compensated, ' in basket and in store,' agreeably to the promise of that dispensation of God's light to man. Had the Jews claimed the right to live as did the antediluvians, by bringing into the Jewish Church all the defilements of that sensual people, they would have done no more than is claimed as the right of the Christian church of the nineteenth century. The new commandment from the spirit of God,ï¿½''Follow me,' mast have a vital, spiritual significance, a divine baptism of the Holy Spirit, that will save us from the sins of the world, and give to us that power which will enable us to subdue the selfishness of our own hearts, or it becomes of less value than 'sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.' The Christ Life is a life of self-denial and a renunciation of the life of the world. All must be consecrated to God. It is the crucifixion of the man of sin and the resurrection into spiritual life, where peace and righteousness shall form the foundation upon which man shall live and work.
