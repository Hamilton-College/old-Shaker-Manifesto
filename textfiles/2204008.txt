In Memory of Elder H. L. EADS. Mary C. Settles. Death loves a shining mark, and found one in our good Father, Elder Harvey, whose spirit, on the morning of Feb. 13, 1892, returned to the God who gave it. Of him it may be said,his entire life was spent with Believers. At a tender age his natural mother, consecrated her boy to the Lord. Elder Harvey was a grand man. Intellectually, he had few peers. He had in his youth many temptations to go forth into the world, to enter college, and fit himself for a minister of the gospel, but when he was called to the work of Christ he dashed away all ambition for worldly distinction, and inclined his ear to this command, 'My son, give me thine heart.' Very sacredly has he kept the trust reposed in him, steadily and unflinchingly treading the pathway of duty prescribed for him, even to the sundering of hometies and local attachments, to go to a distant society, thereby showing the obedience that was better than sacrifice. He occupied many positions of trust in bis long life, and worthily acquitted himself. Let us all remember that we are human, prone to err, and as we have been admonished to say some of the kind words to our friends in life, I can say that he was a father and friend to me individually and no less to the whole household of faith. How much we shall miss him, even though he was so advanced in years. We shall miss his bright, cheerful letters, and good counsel. The evening of his day was made peaceful by loving hands and willing feet. Dearest friends smoothed his dying pillow, and did many things for his comfort. One only of his associates in the ministry, survive him,Eldress Betsy Smith; may her path be the path of peace during her declining days, is the wish of her many friends. I trust that those who remain will be 'faithful even unto the end,' as has been our loved Elder Harvey. Let us remember his many virtues, and Be to others' faults a little blind, Be to their virtues, very kind. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
