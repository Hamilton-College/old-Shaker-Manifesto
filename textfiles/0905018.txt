Home Mission Work While The Manifesto is the intended medium of evangelizing the world, according to Shakerism, and to be a missionary athwart our United Societies, we would kindly inform these that recent communications to this office, from genuinely sin-sick souls, are burdened with the inquiries pertinent to ' the broth erly love and bonds of faith' among us. Unless we can present the most convincing proofs that we have something better to live for than can be found anywhere else among the churches ; and give positive assurances that we are ' raised from death unto life, because of our love to the brethren' it were better we ceased the circulation of The Manifesto until home missions were in the most sucessful operation. Brethren, we are being watched ; and let the result of the watching result in the conviction that we have the love of God manifested in our love for each other.
