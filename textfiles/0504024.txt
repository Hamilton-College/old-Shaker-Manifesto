CROSSING LIFE'S TIDE The loved, and the dear ones, are passing from me, One by one they are crossing life's tide ; They're borne from my vision like ships on the sea, To the shore on eternity's side. The spring time of childhood, and bright years of youth, Were blest by their kindness and caxe; Their spotless example, of virtue and truth, Gave strength every conflict to bear. 0 precious the memories, twining my heart, Like tendrils of summer's fair vine! A new thrill of life to my soul they impart, For sweet recollections are mine. The faces that beamed with the sunshine of love— The hands that with mine were employed — The feet that were wont in my pathway to move, And hearts that life's pleasures enjoyed. Though now in the immortal regions beyond, And toiling in new fields above, Yet sacred and precious I hold the pure bond, That links me to kindred, in love. For heavenly communion, my spirit oft yearns, I'll draw from an angelic sphere; 1 know there's a land whence the trav'ler returns, To gladden our pilgrimage here. Then come,O ye dear ones, who love as of yore, Add strength to the faith that we hold ; Bring gifts that are new from the evergreen shore And treasures that will not grow old.
