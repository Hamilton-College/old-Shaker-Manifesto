DR. BARTOL'S PROTEST AGAINST THE IRREVERENCE OF OUR YOUTH. Rev. Dr. C. A. Bartol, pastor of West Church, yesterday spoke upon the topic, 'The Country's Dinner from its Irreverent and Ill-mannered Youth.' He took for his text the words in the story of Elijah the prophet, 2 Kings, ii., 23; 'Little children mocked him.' In the by-ways and suburbs of Boston, and, as I am told, also of New York and other cities, are gathered year after year, especially on leisure days, of which Sunday is chief, awkward squads of boys, to disport themselves among other ways with insults to their elders passing by. It is strange that amid all our schemes for educating the young such a spectacle, which can have escaped no observer's eye, should not have drawn more attention as the most alarming sign of the times. Wherefore are missionaries sent to far coasts and savage isles while there is here an unsubjugated piece of barbarism blotting our civilization on every page? The American Board quarrels about terms of salvation to the heathen of Africa. We try to interdict the Roman Catholic parochial schools and to occupy the whole ground with our system as alone fit and right to instruct American citizenship at thfi public expense. But the wide increasing irreverence, which is essential irreligion, in our midst, neither Rome, nor Andover, nor Cambridge, nor any Protestant ministry-atlarge seems to be able to reach. There is a growing unthrifty scapegrace element of insolencfc, which no chapel for the poor gathers and no home for little wanderers can win. If my hearers imagine any art of oratorical exaggeration in my discourse, let me say that being mostly a humble pedestrian in my mode of daily exercise and not lilted in a close carriage above the shot of these Yankee and Irish arabs, more bold and saucy than any Paris gamins, I have myself for many seasons been hooted at, scorned for my looks or dress, called names, affronted for being old, in winter snow-balled, and sometimes from a dark nook struck by one or another small coward, who would instantly, for concealment and protection, retreat into the intrenchment of a dozen scamps of his own color, obdurate against all expostulation, who if their victim said a word or made a motion as the injured party, were ready to renew and rub in the affront. 'Best, ' says a gentlewoman of my acquaintance, ' not to notice them at all, as it only makes them worse.' One might be tempted to follow this prudent advice if consulting personal comfort alone. But do we not selfishly expose others to the same effrontery by such apparent consent to any crin.e against ourselves? Besides, it is not of themselves that experienced elders think under this battery of juvenile contempt; but of the community and country, of the ill augury and dark horoscope for a land they are about to leave, where liberty can be abused into such license and nobody care to interfere? For, on such occasions of mockery by boys�in which, I am glad to say, girls, in haunts however low, seldom join�I have noticed that grown-up men across the way would look on and laugh. Where were the police? you may inquire. I know not; only they were not there! Perhaps like Baal, as Elijah ironically told the worshipers of that false deity, they were 'talking, or pursuing, or on a journey, or peradventure sleeping and must be awaked, ' ^or which there was no time ! If they had been present they would probably not have considered the saucy taunts a violation of any statute law rendering their shameless unblushing authors liable to arrest. We talk of the low Irish; and such there are. But these half grown and ill-begotten offenders are not all of the Celtic race, I have known not a few sons of Anglo-Saxon reputed gentlemen, whom their proud parents had from childhood put out to pride for a nurse, to be taught and trained to think themselves better than common folk, and so entitled to look down upon and maltreat from a safe distance whomsoever they took a notion to jeer or throw stones at. What cure can there be but reverence, mutual respect practiced and instilled. Fear is natural to the child. Reverence must be acquired. It is humility expressed in our manner, posture, motion, behavior and speech; root and essence of religion, which we are told must not be inculcated in our public schools because religions are so many. I deny the proposition. There is but one religion, many as are the forms. ' I am of the religion of all men of science,' said Alexander von Humholdt, meaning, I suppose, a lowly bowing before the glories of the creation, which it was his life and joy to explore. That, without sect or dogma, is enough. If the Romanist ties religion to the worship of saint or virgin, or the Orthodox to a trinity, or the Unitarian to one person, or the Baptist to total immersion, or the Episcopal to an apostolic or priestly succession, they are all confounding their several ceremonies and definitions of religion with the fact of that adoring attitude before the Most High.
