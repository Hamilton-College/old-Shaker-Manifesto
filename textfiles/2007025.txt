The followers of Jesus can do no better than to... The followers of Jesus can do no better than to learn of him who has said, 'Come unto me all ye that are weary and I will give you rest.' His life work among men is well defined and his words are simple and easy to be understood. No better foundation for 'peace on earth' can be laid than wras enunciated by him, in his sermon on the mount. 'Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness.' Those who study, anxiously, to do right toward all men, need have little fear of being left without a sure guide, or the solace of the divine comforter. The extremely slow progress that has been made in establishing the Christian principles on the earth, leads us to this conclusion ;�that the millennial age, when the kingdoms of this world are to become the kingdoms of our Lord, may be placed, very safely, in the far distant future. On this point the Christianity of the churches, instead of representing the 'sun of righteousness' in whose light all may walk on toward God and be saved, rather invites its hearers into a labyrinth which ultimately leads them to a theological mystery. Jesus very plainly taught the principles which led to a Christian community, and then entered into the practical workings of the order with those who became his disciples. Other religious teachers had faintly anticipated the same form of society, and in harmony with the light with which God had illumined their souls, worked for the good of humanity. A remarkable instance of this will be found in the march of the Israelites from Egypt to the land of Canaan. It is certainly one of the wonders of the age, and doubly so as it occurred at such an early period of the history of man, The call that was extended to the twelve who accompanied Jesus on his mission, is fully illustrated in the remarks he made concerning himself. �'The son of man hath not where to lay his head.' He had no selfish home, nor any property with which to buy one. His little, wandering company of twelve persons was the first living Christian community thathad ever been established. To encourage his hearers to enter into this community, this kingdom of God among men, he promised them an hundred fold of earthly gifts, and an assurance in the world to come of eternal life. There is also a corresponding force in the life of Peter as he remarks,�'Behold we have left all to follow thee,' and although the promise is still based on the acceptance of this word, 'Except a man forsake all that he hath he cannot be tnj disciple,' modern Christianity passes lightly over it, and rests satisfied among the letters to the Corinthians. In the work which inspires the brotherhood of man, we find more or less, the direct influence of the life of Jesus as the Son of God. He accepted the growing light among men which had been increasing for four thousand years, and clothing it wTith a more exalted inspiration, it became most emphatically, the voice of God, through his beloved Son. It was not only a system of religious belief but it embodied the beautiful principle of goodness, which must be diffused in the world. The sons of Adam would become the sons of God, and this new creation, the resurrection order, would include all who chose to follow Christ in the regeneration. It is singular that many of the orders of Christians and socialists and communists, assuming to be the followers of Jesus, still hold with great tenacity to the selfish, generative order, which includes the whole of a worldly life. Generation belongs wholly to the children of this world, but regeneration is the doctrine of Jesus. The cultivation of the 'vine of the earth,' the relations of the private family, is God's work in the natural order, while the 'true vine' the family of Christ, is God's work in the spiritual order. Christian socialism may harmonize with the former plan, but Christian communism must find its relation with the latter. 'Not where to lay his head' is as potent now as it was in the primitive church. If all is dedicated to God, stewards only can take charge of the Lord's goods, and although in this relation they may possess an abundance of the blessings of this life, they can have no personal, selfish claim on that which has been devoted to the church.
