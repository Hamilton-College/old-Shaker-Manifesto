UNIVERSAL LOVE Canterbury, N. H. Whose source in God is found above All narrow human claims. The principle which purilies And elevates the race. O'er earthly loves and tendencies, In action, word and way. As towers the lofty mountain top Above the distant sea, The love which seeks the good of all, In ev'ry land and clime, Then let us join this noble band And seek the joy, the hope, So stand the merits of this lore In its divinity. Which vitalizes, cheers, forgives Andrenders life sublime. The freedom which this love will bring, Found always 'Higher up.' 1. Blest be that universal love For which the Christian aims; 2. Be lifted up O virgin throng, With open hearts embrace 3. Its real subjects, grandly rise Superior in their sway
