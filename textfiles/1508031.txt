KEEP THE CHILDREN PROFITABLY EMPLOYED. AGNES E. NEWTON. The activity of childhood requires a variety of employment to meet the demands of mind and body. The duties imposed upon children, whether of a mental, or physical character, should be made as pleasant and attractive as possible; and the healthful, needful plays of childhood should never be ignored. Manual or mental labor should not be assigned as penance for some unwise speech or act; because it creates a dislike for the tasks, from unpleasant association. If the offence be a serious one, fifteen or twenty minutes of quiet reflection, seated by parent or teacher, is, we think, the better remedy. To know how the children are employed is the duty of parents and teachers. We recall the satisfaction expressed by a mother that her daughter, an active girl of twelve years caused her so little trouble during the long school vacation, consoling herself with the thought that the girl was so contented to remain at home, and spend hours alone by herself with her books. Had the mother accompanied the child and investigated the reading, as she should have done, she would have found it to have been from Magazines and Ledgers, which were the property of an older brother, who, upon the false theory, which is now rapidly losing ground, that boys can be allowed to read, and engage in many pursuits, that would be considered morally detrimental for their sisters was the possessor of many such books. The effect of light reading is to unfit the mind for study requiring close application. It requires years of careful guidance under religious influences, to eradicate the taste which should never have been acquired. 'Peed my lambs,' was the injunction of the great Teacher whose precepts and life proved that he loved the children. Both soul and body require to be fed from the wells of superior intelligences resulting in salvation from ignorance and sin. Canterbury, N. H.
