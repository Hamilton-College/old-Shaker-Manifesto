SALVATION. NANCY G. DANFORD There seems to be an idea, prevailing in many minds, of saving the soul independently of the body. This is erroneous, as it can never be done while we dwell in clay tenements. When the soul is saved from all sin, the body will also be saved from the indulgences of low passions, and appetites. Not only will it cease to be an instrument or medium for the worst vices, but every wrong habit will be laid aside. With this view of the subject, it will readily be seen by every one who realizes how hard it is to leave old practices, which may have been strengthened by the growth of many years, how impossible is instant salvation. The conviction that some favorite pleasure is wrong, may be, and often is, instantaneous; but the power to leave it forever, comes by slow growth attained through sacrifice, attended by constant watchfulness and prayer. When we have gained power sufficient to keep us from falling into temptation, this may be called salvation, but not redemption. This is only obtained when we have so far overcome the world, that we cannot be tempted of evil. When Satan cometh and can find nothing in us, whereby he can excite evil desires, then shall we become like our Lord and Master. When the love of God reigns supremely in the heart, it will manifest itself by love and kindness to those around us, thus inspiring them to love and good works. In this way shall we see salvation wrought out through the organism of the physical body. Hence our faith in the resurrection of the body from all evil and wrong habits, pertaining to the laws of this life, and through this medium, can the soul be resurrected to that which is higher, even unto life eternal.
