Shakers, N. Y.. North Family. Nov. 1893. The admonition of Elder O. C. Hampton in the Oct. Manifesto is timely. It is a call to duty that should be heeded by every one that has the interest of the cause at heart. Our Beloved Ministry came on the 21st ult. to their Valley home laden with the gifts of the Spirit for their children. O ye weak kneed and trembling ones, do ye not hear the sound of the 'Conquering Legions' as they are marching to the support of those loyal souls who have held and are still holding the fort against the powers of darkness? If not, quicken your spiritual perceptions and you will realize that like an 'Army with Banners' they are marching on. On the 17th of Oct. we had our first heavy frost that destroyed tender vegetation. The month has been very pleasant. It has been one of the old-fashioned Indian summers. An ancient work of some 600 pages on 'Gardening and Greenhouse Management,' published in Dublin, Ireland, in 1784 has lately come into our possession. It formerly belonged to Br. Proctor Sampson. It is interesting to review and compare it with modern works on the same subject. While reading in the Nov. Manifesto the beautiful tributes to the memory of those dear Mothers who have passed away, we thought of the counsel of Mother Ann, to live as if we expected to live a thousand years and as if we were to die to-morrow. We want to whisper courage to our own souls and to our comrades and when called to walk in tribulation may it be that which worketh a spiritual cleansing of the soul. The invitation to our Beloved Editor will never be cancelled. We have a goodly number here of those who have not merely viewed Mt. Zion but are standing thereon. Our trio of Elders are interested in maintaining the testimony, and it is ministered to the dividing asunder of flesh and spirit. We will say 'let the testimony roll.' Hamilton DeGraio.
