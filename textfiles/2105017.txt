NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Center Family. April 10, 1891. Beloved Eldeb Henry:�I read your Editorial this morning, in April Manifesto, and it seemed meet for the times, as Manifesto Editorials always seem to me. The average temperature of March for Mount Lebanon and the mean temperature of the same for Canterbury, as given in April, makes a difference of seven degrees, between the two, which makes me think there is a difference between the mean of two extremes and the average for the month, since Canterbury is only about fifty miles further north, according to the maps, and an average of seven degrees colder, than we had, must be severe. The merry singing of birds this morning, the first I have heard this season, seemed homelike, because they tell of genial skies and vernal blooms, and agreeable warmth, arrived to clothe the earth again with her mantle of green, of multiform texture,-� also to renew her friiitfulness with producDSTortli Family. April 15. 'No time to lose, the moments have a voice, Calling to duty as a lasting choice. Swiftly they're fleeing and bear a record clear, Of deeds good or evil in this earthly sphere. Scatter the seeds of virtue day by day; Embody the truth, it will not pass away. And to labor for others is of virtue to thee, Increasing thy treasure in eternity.' Of all the seasons, spring is the most important. If the farmer, or gardener fails in duty now, he will have affliction and trouble all through the summer; at harvest time vexation, and for winter, unpleasant reflections. tions that reward industry, and gladden the hearts of all living creatures. Since April came in, snow has fallen to the depth of twenty inches, so reported, and though it melted fast, and has continued melting, about six inches remains. Our farmers put several acres of grain into the ground before the last snow. It is having a cold bath and perhaps it will make a quick start, after its white shroud departs. Brother Henry and the men are improving the time at trimming apple trees. With the return of mild weather, our people are getting better of their coughs, colds, influenzas and rheumatics, which are being relegated to limbo where they belong. What is home, if it is not where all rational needs are supplied, and all proper wants, physical and moral, intellectual and spiritual, are satisfied. And where, when duties are all performed in their season, we feel peace and rest, in harmony with environment. A wise attention to the little duties, ten thousand times repeated, each in its proper connection with the daily routine, never neglecting the greater ones, fertilizes life's garden and feeds the fountain of content within, while all unnecessary, superficial and transitory wants are denied and banished, by the satisfaction which flows from industry and a justified conscience. Saturday it rained and snow is going fast. ' * The season appears to be opening very satisfactorily. Have just commenced to work the land. On the 3rd we had the greatest snow storm of the season; there fell about eighteen inches. It has now about all disappeared. Elder Frederick, who on the 1st fell upon a very sharp axe, cutting a terrible gash in the calf of the left leg, is doingvery nicely. However it does not at all agree with his active life habits to be so closely confined. The tendency seems to be to develop the nervous system. 'There are no accidents in Christ.' Truth. And our gospel travel is not yet complete. What a glorious sight it will be upon this earth, a body of people living in a section of country where the weeds are all subdued; where there are no destructive animals or insects; where the seasons come in perfect harmony and wh ere all the people not only have complete control of their spirits, but of their bodies too. No accidents, no sickness, no premature deaths and no burdensome old age. The battle against dirt, moth and rust, is now being fought by our valiant Sisterhood, and things look favorably for complete victory. Our Ministry are expected at their mountain home to-day. In kindest love. D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. April 1891. The month of April has arrived and also the time for house cleaning. This is the time when some of us would like to go on a visit, where house cleaning is not known. This wrestling with contrary stove pipes, beating dusty carpets and kalsomining the walls is not very conducive to peace of mind. The only consolation is, that two or three of the good Sisters are generally near, and impart so freely their advice, that one would think they understood the whole business, and of course it will not do to get excited. So we put on an extra amount of pressure on the safety valve of patience and all goes well. We have not done any ploughing as yet. Snow remains on the ground and it freezes every night. We are making fences. Are selling some of our potatoes at three dollars and twenty-five cents a barrel. Our tomato plants look well. We shall have about six thousand plants to set this spring. We have closed the sawing of logs at our mill, this season, and think the business has been profitable for us. J. B. Second Fainily. We have not much to write at this time. The latter part of March was warm, and the wood for the coming season was sawed and stored away. We commenced ploughing, when lo! April stepped in and clothed the earth with a mantle of snow about twelve inches deep. This put a stop to ploughing for the present; but as there is other necessary work to be done we need not be idle.
