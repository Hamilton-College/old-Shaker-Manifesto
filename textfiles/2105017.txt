Watervliet, N. Y. April 1891. The month of April has arrived and also the time for house cleaning. This is the time when some of us would like to go on a visit, where house cleaning is not known. This wrestling with contrary stove pipes, beating dusty carpets and kalsomining the walls is not very conducive to peace of mind. The only consolation is, that two or three of the good Sisters are generally near, and impart so freely their advice, that one would think they understood the whole business, and of course it will not do to get excited. So we put on an extra amount of pressure on the safety valve of patience and all goes well. We have not done any ploughing as yet. Snow remains on the ground and it freezes every night. We are making fences. Are selling some of our potatoes at three dollars and twenty-five cents a barrel. Our tomato plants look well. We shall have about six thousand plants to set this spring. We have closed the sawing of logs at our mill, this season, and think the business has been profitable for us. J. B. Second Fainily. We have not much to write at this time. The latter part of March was warm, and the wood for the coming season was sawed and stored away. We commenced ploughing, when lo! April stepped in and clothed the earth with a mantle of snow about twelve inches deep. This put a stop to ploughing for the present; but as there is other necessary work to be done we need not be idle.
