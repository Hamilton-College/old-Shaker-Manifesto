The Truth Seeker Annual and Freethinkers' Almanac The Truth Seeker Annual and Freethinkers' Almanac, for 1884 is a work of nearly one hundred pages, beautifully printed and has eighteen full page Illustrations.

The writings of the most honored of American authors are at last made accessible to all readers, and in such varied and beautiful forms as to delight the most fastidious taste, and at prices so low as to be an astonishment to book-buyers, and a consternation to book-sellers, of whom the ' Literary Revolution ' makes no account. As examples, we have ' The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ' for three cents, ' Wolfert's Roost' ten cents, ' The Sketch Book ' 20 cts., these in paper binding but large type; in neat or elegant cloth or half Russia bindings, his ' Choiee Works ' are published at prices varying from 30 to 45 cents, and his complete works (excepting 'Life of Washington ') in the superb Caxton Edition, six volumes, over 5,000 pages, choice typography, elegant binding, for only $4. Specimen pages or large descriptive catalogue are sent to any applicant on request, and orders over $5 in amount are filled to be paid for after arrival and examination, on reasonable evidence of good faith being given.
