The Feet.— Many of the colds which people are said to catch commence at the feet. To keep these extremities warm, therefore, is to effect an insurance against the almost interminable list of disorders which spring out of a 'slight cold.' First, never be tightly shod. Boots or shoes when they fit closely press against the feet and prevent the free circulation of the blood. When, on the contrary, they fit with comparative looseness, the blood gets fair play, and the spaces left between the leather and the stockings are filled with a comfortable supply of warm air. The second rule is, never sit in damp shoes. It is often imagined that unless they are positively wet it is not necessary to change them. This is a fallacy, for when the least dampness is absorbed into the sole, it is attracted nearer the feet itself by the heat, and thus the perspiration is dangerously checked. Any person may prove this by trying the experiment of neglecting this rule. The feet will become cold and damp after a few moments, although on taking off the shoes and warming them they will ap- pear quite dry.—Exchange.
