MAKE FRIENDS Life is very critical. Any word may be our last. Any farewell, even amid glee and merriment, may be forever. If this truth were but burnt into our consciousness, and if ruled as a deep conviction and real power in our lives, would it not give a new meaning to our human relationships ? Would it not make us far more tender than we sometimes are ? Would it not oftentimes put a rein upon our rash and impetuous speech ? Would we carry in our hearts the miserable suspicions and jealousies that now so often embitter the fountains of our lives ? Would we be so impatient of the faults of others ? Would we allow trivial misunderstandings to build up a wall between us and those who ought to stand very close to us ? Would we keep alive petty quarrels year after year, which a manly word any day would compose ? Would we pass old friends or neighbors on the street without recognition, be. cause of some real or fancied slight, some wounding of pride, or some ancient grudge ? Or weuld we be so chary of the kind words, our commendations, our sympathy, our comfort, when weary hearts all about us are breaking for just such expressions of interest or appreciation as we have in our power to give ? â€” Christian at Work.
