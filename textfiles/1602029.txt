IN THE MORNING. HATTIE J. RAY. The darkness shall disperse, all-gloom depart; The dismal sounds that float through woodland scenes, That cause the shrinking soul to start With dread alarm, Shall silent be when morning light shall gild With golden glory nature's vernal bower To bless the hour. The air is filled with want and pressing need, Uncertain lights arise to-lure us on, The soul knows not to what they lead, For darkness reigns. Where will we stand when morning light reveals The path our feet have trod through this long night Bereft of light? Do angels guide our footsteps through the gloom, Fair silent messengers, by God ordained To cheer us onward to the tomb Where all must go, Where we shall find the morning of our dreams, Eternal sunshine, light forever more At Heaven's door?
