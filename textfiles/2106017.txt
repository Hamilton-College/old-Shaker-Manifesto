Groveland, N. Y. May 10, 1891. Timb on the wing, May ends the i-pring. Always we find something of interest in the boundless realm of thought from which to indite a good matter for the pleasure of the ready reader. We can announce with May notes the success of farm work in every branch; farmers are plowing and preparing ground for planting Sweet and Indian corn, should Providence with suitable weather cause it to grow, yielding of its bounty, fruits, bushels by the hundred. Oats and barley sown a few weeks previous are thriving nicely. 'But who can tell what the harvest will be? ' No one can tell, by waiting we'll see. It may be rich and it may be poor. But a harvest of either one we are sure, Not quite sure either; perhaps none at all, Will mark the spring sowing at the coming of fall. But this we are sure of tlw seed that is sown, At present 'tis thriving and nicely has grown. We are deep in the ways and means of house cleaning, taking practical lessons in the fashionable art, the school that our foremothers graduated from in the days of long ago. We have no remembrance of how they conducted their house cleaning, but we do not believe they hunted bugs in their rugs or were ever bothered with such an unmitigated nuisance as the modern carpet beetle. We have tried every ordinary and extraordinary remedy as a means for destroying them but they live and continue to live growing more and more numerous each year. The cold wave and snow storm that swept by here last week failed to injure the fruit buds as many predicted it would. The pear, cherry and pe*ach trees are weighted with their blossoms of sweetness. Honey-bees and bumble-bees Find refuge in the trees, They live and thrive and grow and hive, In spite of snow or breeze. Hay pressing and shipping continues the same as before adding a mite to the needed funds, that go to make up the great sum of earthly wants. Still, 'We need but little hpre below, Have little time to learn.' G. D. G.
