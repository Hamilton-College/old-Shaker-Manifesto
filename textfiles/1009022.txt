unitary home A very appreciative and interesting letter will be found in our ' Correspondence' department, from a people who are determined to curtail human selfishness considerably, by one of the many forms of community gatherings. Regardless of theological isms which these communities enchain to their spirit of equality for all, of God's blessings, they are worthy of extensive encouragement. We reciprocate the beautiful, almost affectionate allusions of the writer for our people; and pray for the full dawn of the spirit of truth, which will dispel all error from all associations bound Godward, and unite us in a Unitary Home where Purity and Love and Truth will be the bonds of our Union.
