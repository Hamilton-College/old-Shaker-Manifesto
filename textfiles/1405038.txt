Sanitary HOW COLDS ARE TAKEN. A person in good health, with fair play, says the Lancet, easily resists cold. But when the health nags a little, and liberties are taken with the stomach or nervous system, a chill is easily taken, and according to the weak spot of the individual, assumes the form of a cold, or pneumonia, or, it may be, jaundice. Of all causes of ' cold, ' probably fatigue is one of the most efficient. A jaded man coming home at night from a longday's work, a growing youth losing two hours' sleep over evening parties two or three times a week, or a young lady heavily ' doing the season, ' young children over-fed and with a short allowance of sleep, are common instanees of the victims of ' cold. ' Luxury is favorable to chill-taking; very hot rooms, soft ehairs, feather-beds, create a sensitiveness that leads to catarrhs. It is not after all, the ' cold ' that is so much to be feared as the antecedent conditions that give the attack a ehance of doing harm. Some of the worst ' colds ' happen to those who do not leave their house or even their bed ; and those who are most invulnerable are often those who are most exposed to changes of temperature, and who by good sleep, cold bathing, and regular habits preserve the tone of their nervous system and circulation. Probably many chills are contracted at night or at the fag-end of the day, when tired people get the equilibrium of their circulation disturbed by either over-heated sitting rooms or under-heated bed rooms and beds. This is specially the ease with elderly people. In such cases the mischief is not always done instantaneously, or in a single night. It often takes place insiduousty, extending over days or even weeks. It thus appears that ' taking cold ' is not by any means a simple result of a lower temperature, but depends largely on personal conditions and habits, affecting espeeially the nervous and muscular energy of the bodv.

[Hall's Journal of Health.] We have always maintained that the most important agent for the preservation of health and the cure of disease is a full and constant supply of pure air for the lungs. All the plans for systematizing exercise by combining it with proper pleasures should be encouraged. Horseback-riding, walking, bicycling, foot-racing and athletic sports are hardly less valuable for the increased quantity of air that they compel us to consume than from the exhilarating and healthful effects produced in our minds. In order to be of real value, exercise should be regular, and, if possible, in the open air, and sufficient each day for the wants of the system ; but never excessive. Extremes are always dangerous. Gymnasiums have caused the breaking down of hundreds of young men. Fearing to go out in inclement weather is a vain fear. There may be a day occasionally during the Winter when it might be prudent to remain indoors, but with proper attention immediately afterward no well person -- while exercising is likely to be the worse for v; a thorough drenching or wet feet. Air is the best of all blood-purifiers, and the more thoroughly the lungs do their work, the purer the blood, and the less liability will there be to disease. I believe that the chief cause of pneumonia is breathing impure air, and next to this over-eating. Both tend to befoul the blood. The victims of this disease are principally among ' good livers, ' who do not take sufficient exercise in the open air. The disease seldom attacks those whose occupations require them to spend much of their time out of doors. The main object of exercise, then, is to compel the breathing of as much air as is required for the elimination of effete matters from the blood, and the reward is an almost certain immunity from all forms of disease.
