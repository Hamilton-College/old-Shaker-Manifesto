The old-blooded Puritanism of the Centennial managers in closing the Exhibition on Sunday... 'The cold-blooded Puritanism of the Centennial managers in closing the Exhibition on Sunday is utterly insufferable, and one more marvelous incident to go down in history to the account of stupid and intolerable bigotry. Greeks will be there whose holy day is Monday. Persians will be there whose holy day is Tuesday. Assyrians will be there whose holy day is Wednesday Egyptians will be there whose holy day k Thursday ; and Turks will be there whose holy day is Friday ; and Jews whose holy day is Saturday. And Scientists, Infidels, Atheists, Freethinkers, Materialists and Spiritualists who have risen above the mountain of holy days.' Common Sense
