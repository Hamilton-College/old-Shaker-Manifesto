Harvard, Mass. Dec. 1895. We are now standing upon the twelfth steppingstone that makes up the year's eir THE MANIFESTO. 19 cuit, ready to take another step when Father Time presents it to us. The past month little has transpired of interest but to the actors No more burglaries with us, but much work of the kind in towns adjoining, so much so that it is not safe to leave a room unlocked for five minutes. Winter preparations completed, and the farmers are busy cutting fuel, fine days, and husking corn when stormy. Winter is upon us with its pains and pleasures, and we are peacefully enjoying its comforts with 'malice toward none and good-will toward all.' Health of society excellent. Marcia M. Bullard
