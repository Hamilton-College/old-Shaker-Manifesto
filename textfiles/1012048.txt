Recently patented German process A recently patented German process for making rancid butter sweet is to knead it with perfectly clear lime water. After a few minutes' kneading the lime water is poured off, and the butter is thoroughly washed with water. The rancidity is caused by the presence of certain free acids, which are neutralized by the lime.
