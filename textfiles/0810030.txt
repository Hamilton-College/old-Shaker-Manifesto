Disinfecting Foul Places The Boston Scientific News calls attention to the importance at this season of getting rid of all vile smells about dwellings, and make this practical suggestion: The article commonly used to disinfect foul places is chloride of lime, but in reality it is not of much value. It may, and generally does, remove bad smells, but the cause still remains, as the chloride simply destroys the gaseous emanations. The much advertised disinfectants are usually catchpenny nostrums and unworthy of notice. One of the very best known disinfectants is old-fashioned 'copperas,' or sulphate of iron, which can be had very cheap. A barrel of copperas would weigh probably 300 pounds, and can be purchased at wholesale price at a cent and a half per pound. And every family ought, especially in warm weather, to have a supply of it on hand. A couple of handfuls of copperas thrown into a bucket of water will soon dissolve, and it can then be used freely, and is a valuable disinfectant. The best plan is to fill a half barrel or keg with water, and suspend within it a moderate sized basket full of copperas. In this way it dissolves more rap idly than when thrown to the bottom of the wooden vessel, and thus a supply is always at hand ready for use.â€”Boston Courier.
