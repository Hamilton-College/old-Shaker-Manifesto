The first effect of tobacco taken in any manner... The first effect of tobacco taken in any manner, is upon the mucous membrane of the lip-*, mouth and throat, which soon impairs their healthy condition, and creates a desire for other narcotics, especially alcohol. Most drunkards commence with tobacco. From these the disease extends upwards into the nostrils, and down into the stomach and also into the air vessels of the lungs; these membranes become thickened, their secretions are changed, and the first stage of digestion which should begin in the mouth is seriously interfered with ; if continued, dyspepsia, or chronic inflammation&gt;.ei1sues. The cure for all these is abstinence from the poison. Let it alone and you will get well. Henry T. Childs.
