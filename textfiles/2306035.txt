Night's silvery stars melt in morning's soft blushes, Her dark spectral shadows glide noiseless away, While nature, enwrapped in her deep silent hushes, Awakes to the call of the beautiful day. The light-hearted songsters mount upward in gladness, And trill their sweet music all blithesome and gay. What heart could respond with a feeling of sadness? [day!

From flowers, the honey-dew fragrance ascending Is wafted along by the breezes at play; Creations of beautv around us are blending In praise of the glory of beautiful day! We gratefully share of life's bounties external, Which come like a day-dream, nor yet come to stay; [nal. But still look beyond to that region superWhere beameth forever a beautiful day! The forms we are wearing, the scenes we're beholding, [decay; Are subject to change and the blight of But germs of the spirit, God's light is unfolding, To bloom in eternity's beautiful day. Mt. Lebanon, iST. Y.
