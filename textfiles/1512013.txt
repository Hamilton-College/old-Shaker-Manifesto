PATIENCE. SARA A. UNDERWOOD. Swift-beating Heart, in patience curb Thy eager throbs, thy wild desire; Nor let opposing foes disturb Thy aim, nor quench thy steadfast fire. Patience, stern Will! Though sluggish moves The event which thou wouldstfain control, Forget not wheels that form new grooves In virgin soil .ire hard to roll. Patience, bold Brain ! the startled crowd, Who ' think in herds' ne'er yet did greet New truth with acclamation loud, Until crowned victor o'er defeat. Patience, 0 Conscience ! do not haste Vainly to hurl indignant jibes At those whose sense of right is based On laws which popular rule prescribes. Patience, proud Soul! e'en though the few Who ought to know misunderstand The unthanked work thou'rt called to do, So that thy work bear Wisdom's brand. Patience, brave Toiler ! Duty asks Thy isolation. Fear not thou ! In loneliness, the grandest tasks Were ever wrought, and shall be now ! The Day Star.
