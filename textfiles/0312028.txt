CURIOSITIES FOR THE CENTENNIAL... CURIOSITIES FOR THE CENTENNIAL. The Centennial, at Philadelphia, will be a celebration for which every patriotic man must desire to insure the greatest possible completeness. Especial attention would he desire to have given to that twilight period of our history which the Centennial is intended so largely to commemorate, and which indeed concentrates in itself so much of what is interesting and romantic in American annals. The readers of our Sunday's issue must have been gratified to read of a contribution from Maine to the Revolutionary Department of the Exposition, whicn opens to its managers an entire new field of curious and delightful interest. At the town of Alfred, in that State, an old lady has been discovered whose singular and happy fortune it was to be born on the 4th of July, 1776. She is a Shaker, and her name is Lucy Langdon Nowell. It is another of the virtues of this venerable lady that she has been in a railroad car, and it is proposed to send her in a Pullman car to adorn the opening of the Centennial on the 4th of July, 1876. It is urged that nothing could be more appropriate or significant at a festival designed to celebrate the completion of our first century of national existence than the presence of one whose birth is exactly coeval with our nation's birth, whose life has shared the vicissitudes of the nation's life, and who has lived to see the career begun, like her own, in doubt and utter weakness, finish in the most exalted power.
