''THE WEALTH THAT ENDURES.' There's a clink in the chime Of dollars and dime, A musical sound to the ear, There's a magical hold In the color of gold, A mingling of awe and of fear; But back of all this Is an exquisite bliss, A power that conquers it ail, 'Tis the spirit's true health. The inner life's wealth That answers humanity's call. There's a charm and a grace In a beauteous face That conquers and governs the sense; But more wonderful still Is that masterful will, Yielding to right its just recompense. There's a glamour in fame, In a wide-spreading name, That feeds the ambition of earth , But above trappings of state Or pomp of the great, Is the honest heart's absolute worth. There's a spell in the years, Unshadowed by fears, And crowned with the pleasures of ease: But more strength-giving yet Are the saddened hours set To the sorrows of pain's stern decrees. There is infinite worth In this grand human birth, Though the days fleet on toward the change. There's a voice in the soul Commands the control Of a future's measureless range. Ella Dare
