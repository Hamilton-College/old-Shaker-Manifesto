SOLICITATION. CALVIN G. REED. Why do yon not write for the good Manifesto Ye scribes and philosophers claiming the truth? Why hide ye your light ? The world is a presto All seeking the fountain of immortal youth. Speak out! let us hear you, ye gifted and God-wise; Fear not lest the truth lose its value when weighed; We might as well think that the smilighted skies Will be lost, ever lost, when by clouds overlaid. If you have but a spark of celestial fire, Make a flame, by addition of fuel and breath; At length it will spread its bright light wider, higher, And warm into life those who're sinking in death. The worst of all states, all conditions, e'er found, The incubus state of indifference is van; We may hunt the whole, earth and the universe round For meanness,�'twill prove �n indifferent man. Then come up yc brave to the help of the Lord ! Bring into his treasury offerings pure, And see if rich blessings are not your reward, Far more than you have ample room to secure. Throw out strong inducements to get new subscribers. We want a round thousand and more, and still more Of radiant readers, to be the imbibers Of truths pure and glorious that we have in store. O ! is it not pitiful, with a vast world full Of noble, intelligent, truth -seeking minds, That not one in a million, has yet had a rightful Conception of blessings obtained at our shrine. Then let me beseech 3 ou to work for the good, The faithful Expositor! Send it abroad Into every hamlet, for surely it would Be to them, a rich blessing dispensed by the Lord. Don't let us grow faithless and faint by the way, Nor think our good messenger can't be sustained; If we as a people intend to bear sway In the tho'ts and opinions as now entertained, Or any that rise to enlighten mankind, We need an Expositor stating them clear Then don't let it fail, men and women of mind But keep the craft sailing the honest to cheer. And then the good laborers surely should share, Of the bountiful harvest, from seeds they have sown; O, let us remember their patience and care; Then we all may rejoice when the harvest is grown. Mt. Lebanon, N~. Y.
