'THE RASCALLY GODS.' PRENTISSIANA. — What a text for a Sermon ! All nations have their Gods—some, pretty fair—some, no better than they should be. The Gods are, generally, not much unlike their people—or the people are not much unlike their Gods. Which is the Creator, we will, if you please, leave an open question ? Some years ago, the Persians had a lot of Gods that lost caste with the people. The people got an idea into their heads that the jealousy and perpetual bickerings among the Gods had an effect upon the weather. When the weather didn't suit, they'd say : ' The rascally Gods are giving us a bad day.' We are not disposed to resolve our self into a high court of jurisdiction for the trial of the Persians, nor their Gods, nor any other people whose Gods are 'jealous'— ' angry with the wicked every day,' ' laugh at their calamity'—' mock when their fear cometh.' If any people can derive any benefit from such Gods, they have our full consent to do so. For the Holy Eternal Parentage—wisdom and love—we have high respect, bordering on adoration—too high respect to bore them with toadyism—idol worship. In their paternal wisdom and maternal sympathy, we find panacea for all the wouldbe ills that beset our path. We turn the little rascals to good account. We don't let would-be-grievances tip us off our balance, to say naughty things of evil doers. 'Speak kindly to the erring,' is not a bad motto, for men, nor for Gods. To cultivate, to unfold, the germ of divinity—our birth-right inheritance—to come forth, in likeness of our Holy Eternal Parents—to deal kindly with all, is the legitimate purpose of our incarnation.
