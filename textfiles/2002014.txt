Beloved Ministry:--Your letter asking our views of the expendiency... Alfred, Oct. 6, 1889. Beloved Ministry :ï¿½Your letter asking our viewo of the expediency of introducing instrumental music to our meetings for worship, I found on my return trom Boston, Thursday eve. I have referred the matter to the Ministry Sisters, to the Elders, and some of the leading members of this Society, and we are unanimously of the opinion that instrumental music ought not to be introduced into our meetings for worship under auy conditions; as certain conditions would soon mean all conditions! As you were anxious for an early reply, we have not referred the matter to the Society at New Gloucester, as I was quite sure their views would be the same as ours. I shall probably go to Gloucester in a few days, and if I find any of the older or leading members with a feeling in favor of introducing instrumental music, I will inform you. As we have not yet taken advantage of the liberty given to have organs for school purposes, it may be said that we are not sufficiently informed, practically to give an intelligent opinion on the subject. If our knowledge was bounded by our own experience, in most matters, it would, indeed, be quite limited. Fortunately we are privileged to learn by the experience of others ! One hundred years ago, there was hardly an instrument of music admitted into an evangelical church in this country ; now, there are but few, if any, without them. Tv hat is the result? In a large majority of the churches, congregational singing is done away with entirely, and in the others, it is coufined to the singing of one or two pieces, while an educated choir is relied upon to give such music as will please the ear, and affect the nerves of the worshipers. In many cases, the hired members of the choir make no profession of religion ; and what need is there of it, if harmonious sounds are all that is desired? Who should say that the experience of those churches would not be ours, after a time, if the door was once opened for the introduction of instrumental music to our meetings for worship? The tendencies of human nature are not changed by attaching to them the name of 'Shaker !' The writer has always considered singing to be an essential part of our worship, not merely listening to singing or other music. Ofttimes the deepest emotions of the soul are voiced, while singing the beautiful songs of Zion ; for that reason, all have been encouraged to unite in the song when not exercising. Anything that would tend to deprive the body of worshipers of their right to praise God in the song, and to confine the singing to a select and educated few, should be discouraged. For this reason, singing in score, or harmony^ should be confined to the narrowest limits. These ideas may seem to be behind the times, and yet be correct. If they are extreme in one direction you will, doubtless, get enough that are extreme in an opposite direction to balance them. The soul of tlie writer is grieved over the drifting of Believers toward those things which the world delight in ; and the christening it progression seems uone the less conforming to the world, and, in most cases, the gratifying of that prido which the Gospel of Christ and Mother was intended to crucify. But I forbear. You know that our feelings are as yours, to have that only admitted into our families which will help to lift souls into a new life, above the world, with its lusts and vanities. Anything that would pander to these, delays that resurrection. With these few lines we send you our heart-felt love. And, while we pray that you may be sustained under all your burdens, we ask your prayers that we may be blest with wisdom to do that which will be for the best interest of our holy cause.
