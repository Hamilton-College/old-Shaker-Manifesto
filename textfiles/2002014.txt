Correspondence. Beloved Eldress J--;--To-day, I have been looking backward... Enfield, N. H. Dec. 25, 1889. Beloved Eldress J� ;�To-day, I have been lookiug backward, counting the milestones I have passed, and trying to forecast the horoscope of the future. As we take these glances, how small the trials of life appear ; and how unsatisfactory is the recollection of the moments spent in those shady arbors where we tarried to cull the flowers of self-pleasure and folly, unmindful of the demands of our gospel call. 1 do uot believe in needlet-sly regretting misspent hours, but find it profitable frequently to recall my own failures, that I may have charity for those who, perchance, may find themselves on the edge of the flower-crowned chasm and have uot even the power of resistance that I possessed. Is not this one of the purposes of life that out of our own strength or weakness, we gather that which serves some other life? Thus in part fulfill our mission. As we are not called to bear the burdens of those on the natural plane, should not all our strength be given in support of the higher life? I would rather be known as one who stoops to raise the fallen, than to belong to the class whose attitude is, 'Stand by thyself, come not near to me for I am holier than thou.' Dear Eldress J� I send you these rambling thoughts, knowing that you will read between the lines and there find that my courage is strong, my purpose true, to endure the testing and honor Z;on, as I have been favored to be one of her inmates. 1 enclose love and kindly greetings for yourself and Order. May the blessings of the Christmas-tide and the joys of a happy New Year be yours to a fuluess. Lovingly, Your Sister, Mary Basford. My Dear Sister M--:--I was most agreeably surprised with... East Canterbury, N. H., Jan. 1, 1890. My Dear Sister M- - - - - -:�I was most agreeably surprised with the reception of your good and interesting Christmas letter which came duly to hand. Good, because of the kindly impulse which prompted a si.-stcr's greeting to tin.- absent�interesting, as I traced through every line, the comprehension ami consequent appreciation of tlie gospel graces, so essentially requisite to all who are aiming toward the perfection of a Christian character. The proper development and symmetrical giowth of mind, from the plane of nature into the spiritual atmosphere of light and love, has ever been one of peculiar interest to me. Th're are many stepping stones by which the height attained can be correctly measured ; and when the eminence is gained, even above one selfish inclination, by obedience to the effective principle, which underlies all patient effort, we are thankful to give the honor due. So with 'Hope the anchor cast within the vail,' Faith combined with living works, Charity or Love, the greatest gift of all constitutes the mainspring which coutrols the life purpose. Whoever is blest with this incentive, paying no more tribute to worldly honor, approbation or pleasure, cannot fail in duty. Their success is insured. This power can only be gained by culture ; and as one writer aptly expresses it, 'There is nothing by which culture cau be wrought out and made effective, except practice. And practice, though the steps be slow, can lead us to the accomplishment of almost anything.' Then let us keep the soil of our hearts uuder such cultivation, enriched by our life experiences that we. can say with the poet, 'My mind to me a kingdom is.' This royal kingdom even a peasant may inherit. Now my dear M� wishing you all the happiness that the New Year can bring, and who can estimate its possibilities, by the fulfillment of the beautiful promise conveyed in your letter, I close with the united love arid thanks of our Order, for the entire household in our Valley Home. Kindly, Your Sister, J. J. Kaime. Dr. Caroline B. Winslow of Washington, D. C., very kindly writes us... Dr. Caroline B, Winslow of Washington, D. C, very kindly writes us,�'I am deep in the 'Precepts and Testimonies of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders.' I am nearly through the book and deeply interested. Poor woman, how terribly she was persecuted and what sufferings she endured for truth and righteousness sake. It strikes to my heart�I feel that she suffered for me. For without her faithful testimony I never could have pursued my Alpha work openly and boldly for thirteen years. How much I owe to her Godly inspiration and her steadfast faith and courage. How the world hates any truth that rebukes its secret sins ! I have had a taste of its persecuting spirit, enough to know its bitterness and its cruelty�But oh, my sufferings were not a flea-bite, to what that blessed woman endured. I know something of the power of the Spirit of God, for I have had experiences. I believe every word of the record I am reading. Tell Eldresses J- - - - - - and D- - - - - - that this blessed book, their gift, will cause me to do more and better work, as the fruit of Mother Ann's sufferings and tribulations. She was the first inspired woman to preach that all sin and defilement must be purged from the heart, before we can enter into our Eternal inheritance; and lust is the deepest and most damning sin of all. Let us praise God continually for his mercies.' Lovingly Yours, C. B. Winslow. Beloved Ministry:--Your letter asking our views of the expendiency... Alfred, Oct. 6, 1889. Beloved Ministry :�Your letter asking our viewo of the expediency of introducing instrumental music to our meetings for worship, I found on my return trom Boston, Thursday eve. I have referred the matter to the Ministry Sisters, to the Elders, and some of the leading members of this Society, and we are unanimously of the opinion that instrumental music ought not to be introduced into our meetings for worship under auy conditions; as certain conditions would soon mean all conditions! As you were anxious for an early reply, we have not referred the matter to the Society at New Gloucester, as I was quite sure their views would be the same as ours. I shall probably go to Gloucester in a few days, and if I find any of the older or leading members with a feeling in favor of introducing instrumental music, I will inform you. As we have not yet taken advantage of the liberty given to have organs for school purposes, it may be said that we are not sufficiently informed, practically to give an intelligent opinion on the subject. If our knowledge was bounded by our own experience, in most matters, it would, indeed, be quite limited. Fortunately we are privileged to learn by the experience of others ! One hundred years ago, there was hardly an instrument of music admitted into an evangelical church in this country ; now, there are but few, if any, without them. Tv hat is the result? In a large majority of the churches, congregational singing is done away with entirely, and in the others, it is coufined to the singing of one or two pieces, while an educated choir is relied upon to give such music as will please the ear, and affect the nerves of the worshipers. In many cases, the hired members of the choir make no profession of religion ; and what need is there of it, if harmonious sounds are all that is desired? Who should say that the experience of those churches would not be ours, after a time, if the door was once opened for the introduction of instrumental music to our meetings for worship? The tendencies of human nature are not changed by attaching to them the name of 'Shaker !' The writer has always considered singing to be an essential part of our worship, not merely listening to singing or other music. Ofttimes the deepest emotions of the soul are voiced, while singing the beautiful songs of Zion ; for that reason, all have been encouraged to unite in the song when not exercising. Anything that would tend to deprive the body of worshipers of their right to praise God in the song, and to confine the singing to a select and educated few, should be discouraged. For this reason, singing in score, or harmony^ should be confined to the narrowest limits. These ideas may seem to be behind the times, and yet be correct. If they are extreme in one direction you will, doubtless, get enough that are extreme in an opposite direction to balance them. The soul of tlie writer is grieved over the drifting of Believers toward those things which the world delight in ; and the christening it progression seems uone the less conforming to the world, and, in most cases, the gratifying of that prido which the Gospel of Christ and Mother was intended to crucify. But I forbear. You know that our feelings are as yours, to have that only admitted into our families which will help to lift souls into a new life, above the world, with its lusts and vanities. Anything that would pander to these, delays that resurrection. With these few lines we send you our heart-felt love. And, while we pray that you may be sustained under all your burdens, we ask your prayers that we may be blest with wisdom to do that which will be for the best interest of our holy cause.
