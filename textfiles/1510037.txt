ENTREATY. Canterbury, N. H. 1. Lead me, lead me, angels, lead me To the fountain never 2. Angels wait on thy entreaty, Sweet responses greet thy dry; Heed me, heed me, angels, heed me, Do my thirsty soul supheart; We will kindly act our mission Teach thee of the better ply. Teach me duty, teach me beauty, In the new and living part. Wisdom's valley is the surest, Safest refuge from the way; To the surest and the purest I would give my life away. storm And her fountains are the purest,ï¿½Make it thy abiding home.
