By their fruits ye shall.... ' By their fruits ye shall know them. Matt. vii. 20. In this way do we know from what we see around us in the physical world. We know a tree or plant by the fruit which it bears, and thus our lives are and will be known. If young persons bear in their lives the fruits of gentleness, honesty, and kindness we say of them they are striving to be pure in spirit and to live virtuous lives. I will pray that my life may bear some semblance to this fruit. I will strive to cultivate all the beautiful Christian virtues that my friends may feel that I am cherishing, carefully in mind their kind teachings. Jennie E. Loude. Enfield, N. H.
