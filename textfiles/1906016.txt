Correspondence. Dear Manifesto:--You are ever a welcome visitor in our home... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Mar. 1889. Dear Manifesto :�You are ever a welcome visitor in our home. A source of comfort and joy as month after month we grasp each number and eagerly feast on the good things therein, kindly bestowed upon us by dear, beloved, gospel friends from the several Societies. The Editorials are able, instructive and highly entertaining. Personally, I have found encouragement and strength, and oftentimes much comfort in the perusal. I was much pleased with the March Number. It came replete with goodness and blessing, illumined with bright hope bearing tidings of good cheer to all. The letter from our Sister, A. C. Stickney is a model of kindliness and true-hearted Christianity, and the doubting heart may well be strengthened after perusing the article from the pen of Br. Louis Basting. To sum it all, there is the deep, Fatherly wisdom, sweet Motherly love and counsel, the sturdy compaoionship of youth combined with the precious utterances of childhood, to be found in the March Manifesto. For twelve years or more, I have been an interested reader of the beautiful and encouraging articles from Br. Daniel Orcutt, and long ago anticipated sending a word of thanks for the same. But oh! procrastination, the thief of time, stole away the opportunity, and lo ! in the March No., I find a kind and appreciative soul has heartily responded. I gladly join with my unknown Sister in far away Kentucky in t! e tribute of love and thanks for the good Brother's untiring zeal in behalf of the youth. Dear Manifesto, may your light ever continue to shine brighter and brighter. I believe the ties of brother-hood and sister-hood are strengthened through your pages and can be more and more. There are those in every Community that I love and most eagerly are the articles read when a familiar name is attached, and when there is no signature we feel that it comes from some beloved co-worker in the field of action. The other day I asked a Brother, 'have you read a certain article in the Manifesto ?' He answered, '1 have not yet come to it. I always begin at the beginning and go through it.' May this interest in the Manifesto increase. With the new year came new hopes, and new promises, and one of my resolutions was to cheerfully perform every duty that presented itself. I felt that it was my duty and indeed a pleasure to address these few lines to you, dear Manifesto, and will conclude in the words of a song. 'Oh praise ye the Lord And rejoice in his goodness, Bright, living souls who in Righteous works abound, 'Tis your right to be joyful And sing holy praises, And glorify Him For the prize you have found. Oh sing hallelujah, glory and honor be To those who have brought the Gospel on earth, We bless the pure source And we'll drink the sweet waters That fill us with joy, Thanksgiving and mirth.' Ever yours for truth, Lizzie A. Kidd. Much Beloved Elder Henry;--We have quite lately been... [The following beautiful letter from the pen of our beloved gospel father, Elder Daniel, is placed before the readers of the Manifesto, that all may share in a treasure which is made precious to the Believer as we remember the consecrated life work of our aged parent. Ed.] Watervliet, N. Y., May 2, 1889. Much Beloved Elder Henry ;� We have quite lately been favored with the perusal of a very interesting and pleasant communication, from your ready pen, addressed to the traveling ministerial delegation who have, and will pass a limited sojourn at every Society in the west and south. Elder Giles forwarded said notice for the edification and attention of the remaining half, who 'are now at home,' in the midst of surrounding Brethren and Sisters. We are indeed made very happy and comfortable in the full knowledge of charitable considerations extended to us. As the stiff right hand of your aged Brother can only hold or move the pen with much difficulty, we trust that charity may pass over an indefinite multitude of ill-shapen pen-marks. It is only uni- versal, interested gospel love that causes the pen to move at the present time. After imparting the special love, kind thanks, and affectionate remembrance of Kldress Ann, to all the dear souls at Canterbury, the remainder of this small sheet may be more personal. This day, the second of May, is the birthday of your Brother of 85 years ; being born in the year 1804, in Logan County, Ky., you will perceive that the count is correct. In taking a retrospective view of the past, I am led to reflect on what has been well done, with pleasure ; but some good things that have been left undone, cause a little uneasiness. In my declining years I have received numerous tokens of love and respect from various loved Brethren and Sisters. May these pen-marks give evidence that all of them have been fully appreciated, and now, heart-felt thauks are here presented to every ISister and Brother at loved Canterbury. Even a highly prized letter written by request, (and a very good sample by the way,) was duly and thankfully received, but not responded to. Many thanks and kindest love, is hereby extended to the writer thereof. We left Mt. Lebanon on the 24th ult. Left Societv at that place, in common health, and busily engaged in making or earning money, cleaning house and door-yard. Farming and gardening nearly a month more forward than usual. Here at our valley home, we find usual health, but do not realize sickness to be a very 'strange' or uncommon thing. Vegetation at this place more forward than at the Mount; cherry and plum trees in full bloom. Of late we have been favored with a lovely rain, which makes us still more thankful, as the rain was much needed. Now good Elder Henry, we tender to you, and kind Sisters of the printing department, our most hearty thanks, for your kindness aud promptness in forwarding the Manifesto,�for the extra one sent to this place. Eldress Ann sends a thousand and one, thauks. Ever yours in love, Daniel Boler. To the Manifesto;--When I was quite young... Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. April, 1889. To the Manifesto ;�When I was quite young, my mother was called from earth, to explore the unknown country from whence no traveler returns. After her death, I had no easy time, as my father was poor, yet he strove honestly and faithfully to support a large family of children and of course when our mother was taken it was with us like sheep without a shepherd. We were scattered. I chanced to get with a man who promised to pay me five dollars per. month. He worked me in the field, aud at everything that came along, but ten dollars was all I ever l'eceived for my time. After leaving him, I worked for a man by the name of G. A. Brown. This good man was very kind, and advised me to go to Pleasant Hill, Ky., and join the Shakers. This good man also had a son, who is now Elder Napoleon D. Brown, of Pleasant Hill, Ky. On, or about the fifteenth of February, one day at ten o'clock, I started for Pleasant Hill, a distance of twenty eight miles, but before reaching the place it was late in the night. In the afternoon it began to rain and soon darkness was spread over the earth. I tried long before dark to secure shelter and something to eat, as j had fasted since early in the morning. I was refused at every place, and when asked where I was going, they would say, 'Oh, you can soon get there, it is ouly two or three miles.' Some of them would advise me not to go there, although they refused me a crust of bread. The last house at which I stopped after being refused, I tried to hire the man to let me come in and rest on his floor. I told him I had no money but would give him all my school-books, which consisted of several readers, a geography, slates and such things, but he told me some member of his house was sick and he could not let me stay. He showed me the lights, and said, 'There is where you want to go.' After asking how far it was, he said, 'three miles.' It was then very dark. I started on, for though I had been denied charity from the children of this world, I felt sure that when I reached Pleasant Hill, I should find friends. After climbing over many high cliffs, and deep ravines, I reached, in safety, the street in front of the East House. Although it was late, some of the good Sisters were up sewing and knitting, and just about that time the clouds parted and the full moon shone out brightly over the beautiful city of God's chosen people. Most of them were slumbering in peace. As I stood there viewing the place, I exclaimed aloud, 'Praise God for this beautiful home, the blessings of which I can so freely enjoy.' I intended going to the Central House, but as I knocked at the front door of East House one of the Sisters was coming to bar the door for the night, she asked, 'Who comes there?' I said, we, and she thought I was one of their own boys, but on opening the door she found who I was. I was invited to walk in. Refreshments were given me, and it reminded me of Christian when on his heavenward journey, as he stopped at the house of the Interpreter. Since then, nor before, have I had such kindness shown me. I wish 'o have it known, that although I departed from the place, I hold the people in kindest remembrance. The Shakers have done more good than they will ever know on this earth. The contrast between the Christian, and those who are not interested to do good, I have tried to show in this piece. The Shakers are doing more now towards educating children than when I was a boy. At that time public school was not taught there, and I did not have the chance that many others have now. I have obtained my education as best I could, and that is not much. I now tender my thanks, and pray the blessings of a merciful God to rest and abide with the Shakers wherever they ma;y be. Respectfully yours, Thomas Benge.
