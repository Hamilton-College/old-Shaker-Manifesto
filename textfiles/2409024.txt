Watervliet, O. Aug. 1894. We have had very dry weather making the crops very backward, but we can not complain, as we have been blest with many gifts from God. We number thirty individuals in our Society at the present time. It seems to be a hard m atter to gather souls to our flock who are willing to become thoroughly baptized with the Christ spirit, and who are willing to give up the world and its so-called pleasures, but we intend to keep right on in the good work and do the best we can, for God will not let his children suffer. Our crops are turning out pretty fair. Wheat has yielded about 25 bushels and oats about 50 bushels to the acre, but the price does not yield very much. Wheat is 45 cts. and oats 31 cts. per bush. We have put up about 50 tons of Timothy hay and about the same amount of clover. We have recently been blessed with the company of our gospel Br. Charles Sturr, of White Water. Henry W. Fredrick.
