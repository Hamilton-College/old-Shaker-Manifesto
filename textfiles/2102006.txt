Beloved Elder Henry:--It is almost 1891 and this reminds us... Alfred, Me., Dec. 28, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½It is almost 1891 and this reminds us that something is needed to keep our little paper in the land of the living, so we enclose the needed check. We are just as well pleased with the paper as ever, and hope it may continue to go op its errand of love and mercy for many years. Are glad you are to give us a history of the 'Kentucky Revival' that all may be reminded of the danger of forgetting that there is a power superior to that of mortals, which did not cease to exist 1800 years ago. Christmas found us with so much of Christian love that there was no room for unkindness to a Brother or Sister. We send a goodly store to all our Brethren and Sisters at your home. Your Brother, John B. Vance.
