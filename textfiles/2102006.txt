Correspondence. Dear friend:--This will inform you that we are all well... Kidds Land, England. Nov. 1890. Dear Fjriend:�This will inform you that we are all well and were deeply interested in your homeward journey. We hope you arrived all right and safe into your family, as they would all feel very happy to see you again among them. You will, evidently, be engaged in your daily duties before this reaches you. Dear friend, allow me to use the term, I am writing in the name of the whole family. We cannot assign the reason for it, but your meekness and modesty and simplicity of manners left an impression on our memories that is growing in our household every day. Not a day passes but that you are spoken of with expressions like these. 'I wonder what uncle Kobert will be doing now?' 'We would have kept him, father, if he would have stayed with us.' Your name, sir, has become a household word; and as the weeks pass along it seems to become more and more permanant in the mind. Your sojourn among us, although very short, yet in that short time you left your wise counsel and your blessing, and with these you have left your impression upon our memories which time will serve to strengthen. Kate and Mary speak of you with the deepest reverence and kind care. So, dear friend, although your body is in America, we have a part of you here, in spirit. I must confess that for a few days after you left us, I felt a blank, as the conversation we enjoyed was very pleasant to the ear and did good to the heart. Your graphic sketch of your life-work may have an influence on some of the rising generation, in the making up of their future destiny. It shows plainly that no one need try to shape their own future to their own mind or will, as in trying to do this without the aid and guidance of the All-seeing Eye, it would only result in failure. The power is in God's hand. Hoping this will find you enjoying the blessing of health is the wish of us all. Your sincere friend, James Scott. [Since receiving the above, our beloved Elder, Robert Aitken, has been called to go on another and more interesting journey, from which it is said, by some, 'no traveler ever returns.' The very kind spirit, however, in which the letter is written, and to acquaint the readers with the pleasant spirit that Elder Robert loft uaiong the people while in England, even with the children, has prompted us to publish the Utter, trusting that through it much good may be enjoyed by all who read the communication. Ed.] Beloved Elder Henry:--With our allotted assessment for the Manifesto... Watervliet, O., Dec. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�With our allotted assessment for the Manifesto we send our love and thanks for the kind and continuous endeavor you are making to have the Manifesto useful and interesting to its readers, not only to our Community, but to all who may receive it. The concept of our doctrine and life -as opened to us by the gospel of Christ's second appearing is surely and steadily increasing among men. Its divine truths will prevail and I feel much encouraged. I believe there are many souls that have been awakened by the sound of the seventh trumpet, mentioned in Revelations, when the mystery of God should be finished. God manifest in the flesh was the mystery begun in Christ's first appearing and will be finished in his second appearing. I greatly desire an ingathering of honest, prepared souls who will help in the building up of God's work in this day. That his kingdom may come and his will be done on earth as in heaven is my prayer. We have many precious blessings and much to be thankful for, which has been our blessing the past year. A happy new year to all our dear gospel friends, in all the Communities. Your Brother, S. W. Ball. Beloved Elder Henry:--It is almost 1891 and this reminds us... Alfred, Me., Dec. 28, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�It is almost 1891 and this reminds us that something is needed to keep our little paper in the land of the living, so we enclose the needed check. We are just as well pleased with the paper as ever, and hope it may continue to go op its errand of love and mercy for many years. Are glad you are to give us a history of the 'Kentucky Revival' that all may be reminded of the danger of forgetting that there is a power superior to that of mortals, which did not cease to exist 1800 years ago. Christmas found us with so much of Christian love that there was no room for unkindness to a Brother or Sister. We send a goodly store to all our Brethren and Sisters at your home. Your Brother, John B. Vance.
