SWEET HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. My weary heart hath found a resting place, My feet no Ionger roam, For in the blessedness of perfect love I've a home sweet home. I've a' place to lay my heavy burden down, A refuge when the wild storms come. O happy thought! The hope of life fulfill'd, In a home sweet home.
