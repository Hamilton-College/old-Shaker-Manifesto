GIVE HIM A LIFT Give him a lift! Kneel not in prayer Nor moralize with his despair; The man is down, and his great need Is ready help, not prayer and creed. 'Tis time when the wounds are washed and healed That the inward motive be revealed; But now, whate'er the spirit be, Mere words are but a mockery. One grain of aid just now is more To him than tomes of saintiy lore : If you must pray, pray in your heart, But give him a lift! pray give him a start. The world is full of good advice— Of prayers, of praise, and preaching nice But the generous souls who aid mankind Are scarce as gold, and hard to find. Give like a Christian—speak in deeds; A noble life's the best of creeds; And he shall wear a noble crown Who gives men a lift when they are down. Cornwall Reflector
