CREED I believe in God, the Father and Mother, in whose likeness Man will be when they grow to it. I believe in Jesus and Ann, and in all who, like them, do right because it is right, irrespective of cost. I believe in the Communion of Saints, and in courtesy and kindness to Sinners. I believe in the Resurrection of Body and Soul from unphysiological diet, habits and appetites — from low ambitions, carnal desires and misuse of reproductive powers — and from their use by such as aspire to Life Everlasting. Amen. O. P
