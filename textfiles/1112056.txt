OLD KNICKERBOCKER JUSTICE Governor Wouter Van Twiller's mode of administering jnstice in the action of account between Wandle Van Schoonoven and Barent Bleecker: 'The two parties being confronted before him, each produced a book of accounts, written in a language and character that wTould have puzzled any but a High-Dutch commentator, or a learned decipherer of Egyptian obelisks. The sage Wouter took them one after the other, and having poised them in his hands, and attentively counted over the leaves, fell straightway into a very great doubt, and smoked for half an hour without saying a word; at length, laying his finger beside his nose, and shutting his eyes for a moment, with the air of a man who has just caught a subtle idea by the tail, he slowly took his pipe from his mouth, puffed forth a column of tobacco-smoke, and with a marvelous gravity and solemnity pronounced, that having carefully counted over the leaves and weighed the books, it was found that one was just as heavy and as thick as the other; therefore it was the final opinion of the court, that the accounts were equally balanced; therefore Wandle should give Barent a receipt, and Barent should give Wandle a receipt, and the constable should pay the costs. This decision being straightway made known, diffused general joy throughout New Amsterdam, for the people immediately perceived that they had a very wise and equitable magistrate to rule over them. But its happiest effect was that not another lawsuit took place throughout the whole of his administration; and the office of constable fell into such decay, that there was not one of those lousel scouts known in the province for many years.' â€” Irving.
