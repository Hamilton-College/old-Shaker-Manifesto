East Canterbury N. H. Sept. 1896. The breath of the Lord has again touched the forests of New England and they are being arrayed in 'new robes of beauty.' The song birds have all flown to their southern home for the winter, and we sorrow for their departure. The frost line has reached central New Hampshire, and many of the fruits and flowers tell the sad story. The apple crop, although not abundant is much better than last year. The building of another silo, to contain some seventy-five tons speaks favorably of that form of securing food for the stock, during the winter months. Beautiful fields of corn are now being cut down, with a machine, drawn by two or three horses, and taken to the barns to be passed through the 'ensilage cutter' before entering the silo. Portions of these beautiful fields of corn had reached the height of fifteen feet, and the ears of corn were higher than the ordinary man could reach. The fairs in the several towns, have been visited by some of our Sisters, with their fancy work, and the sales have been quite satisfactory. Many blessings still rest upon tis. Henry C. Minn.
