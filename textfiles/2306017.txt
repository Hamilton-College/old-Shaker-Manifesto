There are some things that create a wonderful interest in the mind, that awaken in us a thought of being or of doing something above and beyond the present, and that swells our hearts with emotion as we hold them in contemplation. It gives tone to our daily prayers, inspires us with zeal to sing the praises of the God of our salvation and increases our testimony in the work of redemption, by the absorbing of new life and by the making of us as new creatures in Christ Jesus. Our Christian work urges us to put off that which belongs to a lower degree, which belongs to the relations of the Adamic life and to put on those new and spiritual relations which lead more directly to the kingdom of God. We may denominate this as a work of inspiration, or as a new revelation for the souls of men, and indeed, in its life-work, it can be no lessAwakened to the interest of this gospel mission, the Revelator pens his gift of inspiration on the subject and shows what may be received at the hand of God by the earnest, self-denying worker in the cross of Christ. 'He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment.' And he passes from degree to degree in his spiritual ministration till he enumerates for the overcomer a fulness in the wonderful blessings of God's love. A white garment or a garment of this special order may not have been coveted by some classes, as a purple robe was the much desired prize of rich men, and this was a part of the inheritance of those who dwelt in the great and powerful city of Babylon. White was the symbol of righteousness, and for this treasure the disciple would endure all things. It was the exchanging of a worldlyworn garment for one that was pure and unspotted. Other promises were given in con- THE MANIFESTO. 141 nection with this which made the faithful Believer doubly anxious to maintain his position by the side of the cross. His name was to be engraven in a white stone and written in God's book of remembrance, from the day that he had turned his face toward the Holy City. It was a new name and belonged to the new kingdom. There is no doubt but that it was written as are our names to-day,�for an eternity. Here is where 'Hope keeps the heart alive,' through the anticipated security of that name in the Lamb's Book of Life. It is no wonder that the breath of inspiration, sings in the fulness of its eloquence,� 'O that these names may be written where the hand of man can not defile them.' Then comes the assurance resting on faithful obedience to that light which has so wonderfully beautified our path. 'I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life.' It may require the positiveness of a Job to declare the position we have taken, as he declares,�I know that my Redeemer liveth ; and we should be able to say with as little hesitancy, I know that my name is written in God's kingdom. We should be assured of this fact, because we have turned from darkness unto light;�because we have left the life of the worldly-minded and have entered a life of righteousness and peace. Leaving the world ! What a powerful significance this has to the Christian. 'I pray not,' said Jesus, 'that thou shouldst take them out of the world,' away from mankind, 'but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil,'�from the relations that make the life of the world. Jesus could not consistently pray against his own work, and his work was constantly among men, to lead them on toward God's kingdom. The world, the cities and villages are the harvest fields, and they are already white and ripened for the reapers. While the Believers are to be separated from the sins of the world and from all that defiles the spirit of a Christian worker, their great mission is among men as spiritual teachers of the resurrection order. Inasmuch as they fail to make this of the first importance, they fail to meet the object of their special call from the ranks of the world. It is not that we should interfere with the form of government under which we live ; but our duty is to be loyal, law-abiding citizens, allowing the civil rulers the privilege of managing their own business, while we attend to the spiritual mission of Jesus the Christ. This agrees with the words of our spiritual teacher, Mother Ann Lee, and on which we may do well to meditate, lest our zeal to build upon a wrong foundation may bring us to untimely sorrow. 142 THE MANIFESTO. 'In addressing an assembly she spoke as follows :�You may think that you will yet subdue and overcome the nations of the earth ; but you are mistaken; they have that work to do themselves. They will build up ; but God will pull down, until they can build no more, but vou will have nothing to do with it.' That Mother Ann's words are as essential for our guidance and protection, as they were for our gospel fathers and mothers, there can not be the least doubt. Our mission is clearly defined. God has given us a light for our path, a testimony for our safe-guard, and the sword of truth by which to conquer sdn in our own hearts. Let us awake to the duties of our day and to the, work of God among men.
