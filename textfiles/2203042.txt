Nazar Rhodes Nazar Rhodes, at Pleasant Hill, Ky. Feb. 10, 1892. His former residence was in Tenn. He was in the eightieth, year of his age. From toil he wins his spirit's light, From busy day the peaceful night, Rich from the very want of wealth, In heaven's best treasures, peace and health. J. W. S.
