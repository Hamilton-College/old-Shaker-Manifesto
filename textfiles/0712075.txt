BOYS' RIGHTS I wonder now if any one In this broad land has heard, In favor of down-trodden boys One solitary wore ? We hear enough of 'women's rights,' And 'rights of working men,' Of 'equal rights,' and 'nation's rights,' But pray just tell us when Boys' rights were ever spoken of? Why we've become so used To being snubbed by every one, And slighted and abused, That when one is polite to us, We open wide our eyes, And stretch them in astonishment To nearly twice their size! Boys seldom dare to ask their Mends To venture ia the house! It don't come natural at all To creep round like a mouse. And if we should forget ourselves And make a little noise! Then ma or auntie sure would say, 'Oh, my! those dreadful boys.' The girls bang on the piano, In peace, but if the boys Attempt a tune with fife and drum, It's 'Stop that horrid noise!' 'That horrid noise!' just think of it; When sister never fails To make a noise three times as bad With everlasting 'scales.' Insulted thus, we lose no time In beating a retreat; So off we go to romp and tear, And scamper in the street. No wonder that so many boys Such wicked men become, 'Twere better far to let them have Their games and play at home. Perhaps that text the teacher quotes Sometimes—'Train up a child'— Means only train the girls, And let the boys run wild. But patience, and the time shall come When we will all be men, And when it does, I rather think Wrongs will be made light then.
