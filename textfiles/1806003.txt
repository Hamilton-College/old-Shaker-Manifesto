A KIND WORD. Jessie Evans. A loving word in kindness given Oft cheers the weary heart, And oftener still leads wayward ones 'To choose the better part.' What though 'tis met with ill return I'll not disheartened be, Since in the ultimate of years Its fruit shall gladden me. As dew upon the thirsty earth Renews both plant and flower, So loving words, the failing heart Restores to conscious power. Let me withhold no kindly deed Which seems but trifling now, Its future might, some needy child, In saving power may know. And thus may no unchristian word Upon my lips e'er rest. I'll choose the nobler, purer one Of blessing; and be blest. Canterbury, N. H.
