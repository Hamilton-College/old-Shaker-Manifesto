GONE. ADA S. CUMMINGS. Composed for our dearly loved Eldress, Mary A. Gilleipie. Gone, our Mother, to the gleaming shore And reached the shining goal; To meet the loved ones gone before, A bright redeemed soul. The Eeaper's hand outstretched in love, Gave her a welcome free, A happy home in heaven above : Her robe is purity. The bitter cup we cannot shun, Our heart must feel its woe. 0 God, Thy holy will be done, Our sorrows Thou dost know. Upon the wings of peace she sped, Bidding adieu to time ; By angel guardians she is led, Into a holier clime. Gone where the chilling storms of earth, Pierce her frail form no more; Her spirit from its heavenly birth, On freedom's wings doth soar. Her dearly loved with whom she toiled, Will not be left alone ; The loving one from whom she's called, Still claims her as her own. But she has traveled on before, A mansion to prepare ; A glorious home on that blest shore, So wonderful and fair. Still she will be our loving friend, Help us our victories win; And she will lead us by the hand, Until we enter in. We all shall miss her precious voice That cheered in times of need. When on the waves of sorrow tossed, It proved a soothing mead. We would not call her back again, Into this world of care ; We'll go and meet her, free from pain, And greet her spirit there. Still, gentle mother, be thou near, Still lead us in thy ways, And feed us from thy loving hand, As in the former days. 'Gone' yet we know that all is wel,l Enjoy thy tranquil rest; For laurels rare, and gems of worth, Are with thee, pure and blest. West Gloucester, Me.
