MORN ON THE HILLS. By Albert Hopkins. It breaks, the morn; bright bannered on the hills, Speeds west, with flaming chariots, the dawn. He is arisen again, the sun of God; He is arisen again, the Son of man. Morn on the hills,�dawn of the rolling world And dawn of Christ's white peace. Break brightly fair, And blossom full, glad day of 'Peace on earth, Good-will to men.' His 'cloud and glory' fill The morning sky ; his flower awakes in the Bright blue, herald of Peace and Victory. Sing to the dawn�the morn is on the hills. Danton, South Dakota.
