A stronger temperance sermon will never be told than the old one which an unfortunate woman of Cape Girardeau, Mo., delivered before her husband in a bar-room. Setting a covered dish, which she had brought with her, upon the table, she said : ' Presuming, husband, that you are too busy to come home to dinner, I have brought you yours,' and disappeared. With a forced laugh he invited his friend to dine with him, but on removing the cover from the dish, found only a slip of paper, on which was written : ' I hope you will enjoy your meal; it is the same your family have at home.'
