Ill-Temper. A single person of sour, sullen temper- -what a dreadful tiling it is to have such an one in a house ! There is not myrrh and aloes and chloride of lime enough in the world to disinfect a single home of such a nuisance as that; no riches, no elegance of mien, no beauty of face, can ever screen such persons from utter vulgarity. There is one thing which rising persons hate the reputation of more than all others, and that is vulgarity ; but, trust me, ill-temper is the vulgarest thing that the lowest born and illest-bred can ever bring to his home. It is one of the worst forms of impiety. Peevishness in a home is not only sin against the Holy Ghost, but sin against the Holy Ghost in the very temple of love. Theodore Parker.
