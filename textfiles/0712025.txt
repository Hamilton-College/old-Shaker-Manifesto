Honey from the Scriptures Do not think it enough if you learn to spell and read, and to say the words of the Scriptures, but seek to learn the truth of the Scriptures. Do is the bees do. A bee, when it sees a flower, does not fly round and round it, and then fly off' again, like foolish, idle butterflies. It settles on a flower and sucks the honey out of t. You should do as the bees do ; you should settle your thoughts on what you read, and :ry to suck the honey out of it. Almost every verse in the New Testament has its honey. Almost every verse contains a spiritual truth, fit to nourish some soul or other.
