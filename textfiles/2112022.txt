West Pittsfield, Mas Home Notes for West Pittsfield, Mass., written at Shaker Station, Conn. Dear Editor :ï¿½The busy finger of time significantly points to the date of present month, reminding us that 'Home Notes' should be forwarded to your ever interesting periodical. We have been sojourning the past four weeks with dear gospel friends in the beautiful Conn, vale, the land that teems with luscious fruits, golden grains, and flows with milk and honey. Spiritual blessings abound in profusion and our extended visit here, has been restful, satisfactory and highly beneficial to soul and body. May the heavenly powers continue to sustain, bless and prosper the consecrated souls in this portion of our Zion whose hospitality is proverbial, and whose labors of love are unceasing. Br. Ira, and Sisters accompanying him, were two weeks in the state of New Jersey; then returned home as financial business demanded Ira's attention. As he began to realize the beneficial effects of the climate, it was deemed advisable for him to return, consequently the same company journeyed thither, and remained another two wTeeks. The conclusion now is, that he is improving in health and strength. May the power that assists to shape the destiny of human beings, still uphold and grant to him and others the boon of health. Later reports from home state that Br. Ira is now transacting business in New York City. Crops of all kinds yielded fairly and are secured for Winter. Apples were more plentiful than was anticipated earlier in the season. We were much interested in the account of 'Harvest Home'' in Nov. Manifesto. J. L. S.
