EDITORIAL NOTES There would be very much more genuine religion in this world if people would say before our faces what they speak behind our backs. To be sure, they would afifear less beautiful, but, really, they would be as pretty. Just such hypocrisy, commonly practiced in feelings, words and actions, is the main cause of so much irreligion and blackheartedness, so prevalent in this world. When we shall appear just as we are, we shall know our real friends and enemies. But when the cloaks are removed, beyond the possibility of recovery, how awfully silly a great many people will act who have practiced deception successfully (?) in this life! t What a monument of philanthropy is a genuine Shaker! Every Shaker in this land has a thousand and more gospel parents, thousands of brothers and sisters, thousands of houses and lands, and millions of dollars' worth of money ! And yet he is not only willing to share parents, brothers, sisters, houses, acres, and money, but goes abroad variously trying to get any or many to share these as freely as he does. With no issue by nature to leave these to, he anticipates the congregations of those who are utter strangers to him now, and trusts them with all he ever possessed, to be used by these successors for the same gospel purposes, and transmitted to others in like manner !
