CURE OF DIPHTHERIA Dear Friend â€” The recipe for prevention of bronchitis (spirit of wine and vinegar), twice published in The British Friend, I have patronized, and keep it always by me in winter, and have recommended it to many. Yesterday I saw another recipe, which I now inclose. It is cut out of a St. Louis paper, America, dated Jan. 16, 1879. If it be as it is stated, it might prove a boon to many. Thy friend, P. P.
