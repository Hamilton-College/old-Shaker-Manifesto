There is but one thing you have to fear... There is but one thing you have to fear on earth or in heaven,ï¿½being untrue to yourself, and therefore untrue to God. If you will not do the thing you know to be right and say the thing you know to be true, then, indeed, you are weak. You desert God, and therefore cannot expect him to stand by you.
