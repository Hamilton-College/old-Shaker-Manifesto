Correspondence. Dear Sister Jeannette:--Your letter at hand speaking in praise... Augusta, Ga.. Aug. 9, 1889. Df.ar Sister Jeannettk :ï¿½Your let ter r.t baud speaking in praise of the articles on the Sunday School Lessors in the, 'Christian Standard.' Yes, I hope to put them in book form next year. Dec. next will make four years of them. It is hard to recommend any one book on Sun. Sch. Lessons. I am I teacher of 30 bright pupils and i cannot find anything satisfactory as a help and out of an effort to help myself, the preparation of these lessons began. I also prepare them for the 'Christian Oracle' 415 Dearborn St., Chicago, 111. That paper gives my work considerably fuller than the 'Standard.' I have read with much interest the Manifestos and 'Mother Ann Lee's Life' for which you have n.y thanks. My grandfather and mother were both 'Dunkarls' and many things are held and practiced alike by the Duukards and Shakers viz. Jst. Refusing to go to war. 2nd. Refusing to go to law. 3rd. Uniformity of dress. 4th. Taking care of the weak and poor. 5th. Meek and quiet lives. 6th. Abstaining from liquors, tobacco, &amp;c. In all these things I have followed the teachings and practices of my grandparents. Fraternally, Calvin S. Blackwell.
