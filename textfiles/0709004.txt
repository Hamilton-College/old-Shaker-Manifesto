HUNTING FOR THE SUNBEAM E. T. LEGGETT Of all life's recreations, There's none so dear to me As hunting for the sunbeam, Wherever I may be. I find it often hidden Down in the mourner's eye, Or glistening from the cloud-bank Beneath a winter's sky. It blushes in the rose-bud, And wakes it into bloom ; It gives the heath its beauty, And violet its perfume ; It rouses Spring from dreaming Of fragrant buds and bowers, And starts the harvest teeming With golden sheaves and flowers. Earth has no grand specific For hearts that throb with pain, Like pouring in the sunbeams Till smiles come back again. Oft when my heart is burdened Beyond what heart can bear, I gather in the sunbeams, And all is happy there. Would all my j'oung companions Who list to me to-day, But gather in the sunbeams And store them all away; They'd find this world so beautiful They'd only wonder why So many seek for heaven Beneath a clouded sky.
