CROWN OF MOTHER'S LOVE Dear Shaker and Shakeress: In newspapers, as in houses, are corners. If you have a little corner left—unoccupied — please insert ' Crown of Mother's Love ' — if you deem it worthy of such a privilege. Receive our best wishes for your prosperity. We, here at White Water, are deeply interested in your welfare. Through your aid our views of Shakerism are being expanded. Shakerism never appeared more beautiful to us, than at the present time. Take all the jewels earth can boast; Its diamonds and its pearls so bright; Search southern sea and northern coast — Bring all their treasures to the light; Collect them — call them all thine own; Display to all the eyes that see, Yet will they not befit the crown Which Mother's Love hath set on me. The jewels in my crown that shine, That sparkle in bright glory there, Shed on my path those rays divine, Which make life beautiful and fair. Thine were from mount and ocean, brought, And won by risk of other's life; With mine own heart's blood, mine I've bought And paid for in the gospel strife. O, glitt'ring crown of Mother's Love, I press thee to my joyful heart What'er befall — where'er I move, Dearer than gold to me thou art. Earth from my sight thy gems remove; They do not shine for one like roe ; For mine's the pearl of heav'nly Love, The sparkling gem of Purity! C. A. Emil Fickeyson White Water, February 1, 1875.
