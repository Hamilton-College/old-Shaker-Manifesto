A PURPORTED COMMUNICATION FROM A SHAKER SPIRIT Olive Stebbins [The following encouraging spirit communication was received through the mediumship of W. L. Jack, M. D. :] : Let there be light. These words were spoken by one who came before us, and who taught us, through our Mother God, of love, of purity and peace, those principles that we are now teaching and making so visibly manifest unto the world's people. Ye are my people, saith the Lord, and of a truth I perceive this to be ever so. And I would have ye, brethren, not be ignorant of the fact that your labors are not in vain. Be ye not discouraged, for lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end. Ye have the promise of the life which now is, and of a THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. truth ye do enjoy and possess it, and the godly inheritance of the life to come is thine forever. Verily, verily I say unto you that which you have aforetime been told shall be granted unto all. And may the love of the Father and Mother God, and the light that shone in the heart and life of the meek and lowly Jesus, and His teachings and principles, abide with you all forever, and uphold you with its precious promises in all your undertakings. To my friends at Enfield, Conn., of the different Church families. Dec. 2. We have taken some pains to investigate whether our honored Haverhill medium was acquainted with Eldress Olive or not, and found he was not. We also investigated whether this communication was received by or through any request of any earth friends, and found it was not, but was one of those simple and pure outflowings of attendant surroundings for which Dr. Jack has become somewhat notable. Those desirous of our evidences can have them on application at this office. Ed. Manifesto.
