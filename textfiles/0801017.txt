The Lord's Prayer Did you ever think, short though it is, how much there is in it ?—Oh lit is beautiful! And, like a dia' mond in the crown of a queen, it unites a thousand sparkling gems in one. It teaches all of us—every one of us—to look to God as our parent—'Our Father.' It teaches us to raise our thoughts and desires above the earth—'Who art in heaven.' It tells us that we must reverence our Heavenly Father—'Hallowed be Thy Name.' It breathes the saints'reward—'Thy Kingdom come.1' And a submissive and obedient spirit—'Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.' And a dependent, trusting spirit—'(Jive us this day our daily bread.' And forgiving spirit—'Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.' And a cautious spirit—'Deliver us from evil.' And, last of all, an adoring spirit—'For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever Amen.'—Nature'* Arcana.
