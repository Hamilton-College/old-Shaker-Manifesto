Enfield, N. H. The robins are selecting their homes among the maple trees in the old church lane just opposite our windows, which presages, that before many weeks elapse, the goddess of Spring shall bestow her mantle of green, on mountain and valley, making our home a veritable paradise, in-as-much as local scenery is requisite in accomplishing this end. Surely, with the revivifying of all external things, every active soul, will make new resolves, 'to be good and do good,' thus forming for the mind also a fresh adorning. (We sisters) from East to West, from North to South, know that with this season of the year, comes the much needed, much dreaded, (by some) house-cleaning, and right here, let me whisper a word of caution to my companions, whom I might presume to teach in this line. Have we learned a wiser, safer way to house-clean than that practised by our sainted predecessors, of turning everything up side down at the outset, taking out windows when the weather is unsuitable, and thus inviting the grim angel by taking sudden colds? Let us, judiciously, care for the degree of health we are blessed with, and add to our stock if possible, for health is a priceless treasure. Our sugar harvest was rather above the average, not more barrels of sap, butagreater percentage of the sugar producing element in a given quantity of liquid, if any one wishes to study cause and effect, this is a practical question ; what causes this difference? We are pleased to say that we have been blessed with a visit from the Central Ministry. They were to us angel Ministers of the good things of God's Kingdom. In mental vision, we could see, Beloved Elder Daniel, and Eldress Ann, so well do we know their parental anxiety for every branch of the household. May they be comfortable in health, for a long time yet, to bless those who come under their influence is our prayer, which is not a selfish one. E. B.
