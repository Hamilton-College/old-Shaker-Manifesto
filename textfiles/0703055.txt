Spade and the hoe The Spade and the Hoe. A spade within a farmer's shed Leaned by the wall his empty head, And spying on the ground below Spake proudly to an humble hoe : 'Yours is but surface work, while I Deep into hidden treasures pry.' The hoe raised not his lowly head, But meekly to his brother said : 'The master in his industry Hath need alike of you and me.' The servants resting in the shade When to their task the farmer bade, Took one the hoe and one the spadeâ€” And unpreferred, where all were good, Each took the tool that near him stood, And in a common cause allied Toiled in the vineyard side by side, So the great master, without need Of human pride or human creed, Can make a profitable tool Out of a wiseman or a fool, And each at last to show will bid Not what he was, but what he did.
