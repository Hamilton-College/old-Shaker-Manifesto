APPRECIATIVE. Helen A. Stone. I have mentally many times written a few lines for the Manifesto, expressive of love to Gospel relation far and near. My appreciation of the constant labor, anxiety and patience attendant on the preparation, printing and circulating of our monthly, which always brings much that is good, interesting and instructive. 1 feel grateful to beloved Elder Henry and to all of our Canterbury Brethren and Sisters who so honorably bear this responsibility. I owe kind thanks to all contributors who have the interest, and spare the time to help fill its pages for the edification of its subscribers. While I commend those who have acted creditably in this respect, I admonish myself for enjoying so much the productions of others, without adding my mite, and only offer as an apology that I am aware there are many more capable. As I have had the privilege of visiting the Societies of Believers, East and 'West, with the exception of South Union, I am always pleased with the 'Home Notes ;' they renew my limited acquaintance, and carry me to the homes from whence they come, with sympathy, when there is aught that disturbs and troubles, or pleasure and rejoicing when comfort and success abound. The visits I so much enjoyed, the kindness I have with others so bountifully shared, the order, beauty, cleanliness and godliness manifested in the lives and homes of the pure in heart, ever awaken in my soul gratitude to the giver of all 'good and perfect gifts,' and a realization of my and our indebtedness to gospel Parents, who suffered physically and spiritually, that they might lay a foundation on which to build,ï¿½the principles of eternal life. I have recently had the opportunity of visiting nearer home in company with Elder Joseph and Eldress Harriet. We spent New Year's with the Canaan family, and were much pleased with the lively interest manifested in all that serves to make a home for the soul, as well as for the body ; mental culture not being neglected. Not long since we were at the North Family a few days, the former home of Eldress Harriet, where she served faithfully many years previous to moving to Watervliet; but to me it was quite equal to going abroad, as I never spent many hours there before, since the first four weeks that I was in the Society. Elder Daniel, Br. Walter, Eldress Anna and Sister Martha are awake to all that secures to the home pleasant, attractive and protective conditions, and the inmates are constantly striving to develop intellectually and spiritually. Jan. 22nd we spent with them and at 2 p. m. had a heavenly meeting; 84 THE MANIFESTO. many of the members expressed their faith, and love and blessing circulated freely. We were also noticed by the spirit of beloved Elder Giles, in the following poem, spoken by one of the Sisters with uplifted hand. Feeling that we want all the household of faith to share in this blessing, who have known his care and interest in our Zion, we ask to have it inserted in the Manifesto.
