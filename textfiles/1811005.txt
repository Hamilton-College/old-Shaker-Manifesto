Correspondence. My dear friend, Robert Aitken: I received your favor... Philadelphia, Fa., Sept. 1, 1888. My Dear Friend, Robert Aitken : I received your favor of the twentyfifth yesterday and am glad to hear of your happiness and that of the friends of Shaker Station for all of whom I entertain sympathy and affection. I hope to visit them and you sometime when I can know more of your community life. It has always been an ideal life to me ever since my Concordium experience, although it was very imperfectly carried out at Ham Common. The difficulty in Community life however, is in drawing the line between individual responsibility and freedom of conscience, which are essential to true manhood, and the will of the community. SwedeMborg says, 'The Lord preserves the freedom of the human will as 'the apple of his eye,' or the highest importance. Yet this freedom must be limited to some extent in civil society and still more in community life. There is no such thing as perfect freedom in imperfect conditions. Yet the higher the spiritual condition the more perfect is the freedom. In fact the sooner we can give up our self-will and accept the divine guidance the sooner shall we enjoy true freedom. Self-love is slavery. Love to God and man, although requiring the sacrifice of self, is the highest liberty. But liberty is the beau ideal of humanity without which there can be no responsibility and consequently no manhood. I thank you for sending Greaves, although the book has not yet arrived, I presume it will iu due time. The chief idea of Greaves I think is submission to the divine will. It seems a paradox that man is free only in proportion as he gives up his own self-will, and yet it is true. Our self-will enslaves, the divine will exalts and makes free. I believe I could accept practically a life of celibacy, but it has always appeared to me to be a duty to provide for the future generation. Our own existence is due to the performance of this duty parentally, and does not the boon of existence conferred on us, rightly and justly include the duty of transmission of that boon to others, although it may involve us in some anxieties and even spiritual disabilities ? There are spiritual sacrifices as well as material sacrifices and our obligations cannot be fully discharged if we neglect to use any of the functions conferred upon us. Of course we cannot judge for others in this matter. It must be for each one to do as he receives the light to do. It may be wisdom in one to live a life of virginity while it may be unwise for an- other. I cannot see that a universal rule can be set up which it would be right for all to follow except the rule of individual conviction. My friend Edmunds asked me if you had consented to 'prepare a place for him.' He thinks well of the Shaker life. He is very fond of children, and I do not know whether he would find such attraction with you. We must have something on which love can ultimate or it is apt to die. If I were with you I should miss the children more than anything else. We are passing away and the hope of the world is in the coming generation. It seems to me that this is where Shakerism fails of universal application, one hundred years of Shakerism will leave this earth desolate if you apply it universally. The creation of man includes propagation as au important function, and if that is abandoned, existence of the races of mankind ceases and the eartli becomes again a wilderness. Do the Shakers believe that a new creation is to supply the place of natural generation and that regeneration includes recreation? lam not asking in the spirit of opposition but for the sake of information. There is no doubt but a ceasing to generate would abolish human wars, but it would be at the expense of abolishing the human race and leaving this beautiful world to be inhabited by wild beasts alone and they would devour one another. There is something sublime in the effort to live a pure, chaste life, but to abolish marriage seems to me contrary to divine order and in some cases it may be an avoidance of duty and responsibility not altogether justifiable. But this is a great question and cannot be settled by letter. Perhaps you do not claim Shakerism to be universally applicable to mankind r With love to all the friends I remain, Sincerely yours, Henry S. Clubb. My dear friend Henry:--Yours of Sept. 1st. is received... Shaker Station, Hartford Co. Conn. Sept. 9, 1888. My Dear Friend Henry :ï¿½Yours of Sept. 1st. is received in thankfulness for the kind sympathy expressed for us. In your letter you have touched on points that it might, as you say, be difficult to clear up by letter. It is in your case as well as my own, when we once get a taste of community life we never can forget it. Could I have found it outside of Shakerism it is not likely you would find me a Shaker to-day ; i. e. had I found community before I found Shakerism. It must always be puzzling to the generative man and woman, as long as they are unable to view the entire distinction between the order of Adam and the order of Christ. In not viewing the Adam order as distinct from the Christ order there must always arise a confusion of ideas. The order of Adam is wholly generative, the order of Christ is wholly regenerative, and for 'hose who follow Adam it is right and proper for them to generate; and I should say with you, it is their duty, as it is the duty of those who follow Christ to cease generating and follow him in the work of regeneration. Generation belongs to the Adam order of the world, regeneration belongs to the Christ order, which is the order of the kingdom of heaven : the one being wholly natural, the other wholly spiritual. Here is where confusion of ideas comes in, viz., the blending of the natural with the spiritual. When you speak of sacrifice of freedom in either the natural, generative or spiritual regenerative order, I can conceive of none in either when both are perfectly lived out free from sin. It is the siu life that destroys all true freedom. It is true, indeed, as you affirm, that all true freedom comes from renouncing our own self-wills to do God's will. In regard to the perpetuation of the race ; that can safely be left in the hands of Him who created it. If God gives me light that it is my duty fo leave the works of generation behi-jd and follow Christ in the regeneration, no one can be at all responsible for what becomes of the race of man, as in that case it is wholly in the hands of Him who is able to do as He wills in this matter. It must be evident that nothing that man can do can alter the purposes that God has decreed, and it is for us to obey what light is given us of God irrespective of results. God, in the order of his providential processes, has given me light that it is my duty to follow Christ in the work of regeneration: herein is where I am held responsible to that light,.but as you have not that light yet, you caunot be held responsible. It stands the same to-day as it did when Jesus uttered the saying, 'He that is able to receive it, let him receive it;' here is perfect freedom for all cannot receive the saying. You kindly ask me, 'Do the Shakers believe that a new creation is to supply the place of natural generation ?' The Shakers believe that he that is in Christ is a new creature, i. e., a new spiritually born man, and so becoming new he lets the natural entirely alone in God's hands to do with it as he lists, and being born anew his work is to propagate spiritually, that is, to propagate spiritual children, as the apostle Paul said Timothy was his beloved son, certainly not naturally but spiritually it must be. You are so well employed in doing good where you are that I do not feel as yet it is the purpose of God to call you into the regenerative work that I feel called to obev, not but it would be very pleasing to me to see you come up into a work that is higher and better, than for you to remain in your present sphere of action. In respect to your friend Edmunds, as a candidate for our order of life, I scarcely know what to say, uot having had any previous acquaintance with him, nor what opportunities he has had to acquaint himself with our life. It is well to count the cost, lest he should find that, upon a trial, he is not able to build. I can appreciate his dietetic views full as well as any in this Society or perhaps any other, but those views can go but so far as preparation. It very much depends on what ground he holds them as preparatory for oar life. If he holds them merely as for health or economy, without reference to the divine end, they would not help him much into our life ; indeed, they would rather retard as he would be in danger of enforcing his views on others ; thus producing conflict and inharmony in the body. In respect to his fondness for children, it would very much depend how far that went, to qualify him to be an inmate with us. You are a man of experience, and you will at once perceive that there is a risk in taking any one into a social relation without a previous acquaintance. If he is sincerely convicted that it is his duty to forsake a worldly life, and if he is sincerely desirous of finding salvation from sin and a sinful life, and if he is willing to lay himself on the altar of self-sacrifice and to yield himself up to the guidance of experience then I should say he had better pay us a visit and see for himself, before any permanent steps be taken for admittance as a novitiate in our order. I am prompted to write as well as I know for his good and the cause of good. It would be very pleasing to us all when you can come and make us a visit. I think a closer acquaintance with the life we are living will convince you that it promotes perfect freedom of the will and conscience, and is the only way whereby the human will can be brought into submission to the divine will. J. P. Greaves will find this to be truth before he can realize of what lie wrote. In love to yourself and family and friend Edmunds I am Yours as ever Robert Aitken.
