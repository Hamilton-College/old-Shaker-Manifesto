WHAT TIME IS IT? What time is it? Time to do well� Time to live better� Give up that grudge� Answer that letter� Speak that kind word to sweeten a sorrow ; [morrow. Do that good deed you would leave till toTime to try hard In that new situation ; Time to build up on A solid foundation, Giving up needlessly changing and drifting, Leaving the quicksands that evev are shifting � What time is, it? Time to be earnest, Laying up treasure; Time to be thoughtful, Choosing true pleasure; Loving stern justice�of truth being fond; Making your word just as good as your bond Time to be happy, Doing your best� Time to be trustful, Leaving the rest, Knowing in whatever country or clime, Ne'er can we call back one minute of time. The Catholic.
