White Water, O. North Family. May 1894. The month of May is to my thinking most beautiful of the spring months. For it is at this time 'Dame Nature' awakes fully from her long winter's sleep, puts on the brightest and most fascinating garb of the year. What could be more pleasing to the eye, than to look at the woodlands the meadows and broad fields of various grains, all having that peculiar mark that distinguishes one from another. But at the same time they blend harmoniously with nature. Methinks one would have to be an Infidel not to see the hand of God in all this. THE MANIFESTO. 145 We, as an agricultural people rejoice in the prospect of a bountiful harvest, we derive most of our income from the productions of the soil. The Center family sustained quite a loss last month by the burning of one of the tenant houses. With a great deal of labor, everything inside was saved, but the building burned to the ground. They began rebuilding at once and at this writing, have a very handsome two story frame standing on the old site. Will be complete about the 15th inst. Whitewashing barns, fences etc., is being done in a very neat mannner by Br. Charles Dixon, assisted by our three boys. The old saying is,ï¿½'A thing of beauty is a joy forever.' We are trying to do the work that is intended for us, by putting our shoulder to the wheel; every one doing whatever he can. In this way and no other, can we gain that love and union that is so essential to Believers. J. O. Tyler.
