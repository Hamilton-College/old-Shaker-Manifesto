V. Gifford &amp; Co., Kokomo, Ind. Phrenological Journal and Science of Health An excellent portrait and phrenological description of the Earl of Aberdeen, the new Viceroy of Canada, leads in the August number of the Phrenological Journal and Science of Health, while the textual matter is noteworthy. Following this a graphic article on the importance of phrenological information to the managers of public institutions will arrest close attention because written by Mr. Stead, the editor of Review of Reviews. An elaborate delineation of Ella Wheeler Wilcox, from an examination, accompanies a fine por trait of that very well-known writer of poetry and story books. A profusely illustrated discussion of the vital temperament forms the installment in the series on How to Study Strangers, and an Analysis of Approbativeness on a fresh line of thought will impress the reader. In the series of phrenological biographies two important names appear this time, Dr. Coxe and Dr. Gleason, the latter of water cure fame. These biographies show one feature sharply enough, that scientific men who were in advance of their fellows readily accepted the teachings of Spurzheim and Combe. Several finely written articles appear in the departments of Child Culture and Health the usefulness of which elicits general notice and the wish that all the world could read them. Only 15 cents a number, or $1.50 a year. Address Fowler &amp; Wells, No. 2i East 2Ut St. New York.
