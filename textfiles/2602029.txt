The Anti Tobacco Crusader The Anti Tobacco Crusader, is an interesting and no less valuable quarterly. It has reached No. 17, and should be the New Year visitor in all Christian homes, as a warning against one of the most unpleasant habits. Rum and Tobacco are generally classed as twin evils ami certainly they are quite often found in close companionship. Rum generally enters by way of the back door, while tobacco stands at the front. Christians take the tobacco with them even to the church and poison the air. And then the minister takes it into the pulpit as did the Rev. Solomon Spittle. Published by H. L.
