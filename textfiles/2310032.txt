In Memory of one of our most dearly beloved and honored Sisters, PATSY GREGORY. Nancy Rupe. Another transition, a gem from our circle, Hath passed through the portals of life's transient stay; A pure, sinless spirit, so loving and peaceful, Didst strictly all true gospel precepts obey. A pattern so Christ-like in all her behavior, From her early childhood for over four score, In humble submission, with this chosen people, Without ostentation, didst all things endure. O kind, loving Sister, thy presence was sunshine; We'll miss in our worship thy musical voice; Will see thee no more in thy beautiful casket, But lo! in thy glory, with thee we'll rejoice. By faith we behold thee in heavenly mansions The Lord in his majesty, surely doth reign. Though dark the perception of poor erring mortals, We feel that our longings will not be in vain. 'All flesh is as grass,' and we know it must perish; But where, O where is that immortal soul? Just free from its casket, to journey we know not, And yet it must have an immortal control. Vast millions have queried this; the all-important; Is life all to live? or is death all to die? O where our location? What our occupation? Come Science, come Knowledge and give a reply. The great heart is stilled, and talent so needed Is snatched from our knowledge, forever below ; We surely exist; but who shall decipher The source of our destiny; whither we go? Ah ! pure living faith, thou art pointing us upward And onward, to mansions where millions have flown. Come true inspiration and lighten our vision As swiftly we hasten to regions unknown. O may we improve the brief span here allotted To us to prepare for an immortal stay. In some boundless realm where no grief can enter, Come faith and triumphantly bear us away. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
