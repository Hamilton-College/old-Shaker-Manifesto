Occasionally we have placed before us... Occasionally we have placed before us an illustrated article referring to the cultivation of the mind, which appeals so directly and so largely to our best judgment that we take pleasure in making reference to it. In the American Phrenological Journal for July we have the portrait of a West African boy, a King's son, at the age of 15 years, and then another portrait of the same individual after a cultivation of six years by the missionaries of that country. The contrast is remarkably clear and withal very interesting. The change is, probably, no more than might be wrought out on the mind of a white boy and for this reason it should become a valuable lesson to all who are interested in the advancement of humanity. We all understand very well that a neglected garden soon becomes overrun with weeds and many of the valuable plants may be wholly or partially ruined, and yet this is no more apparent than it is that the neglected or undisciplined mind, in a few years, become careless, coarse and sensual. On the other hand the careful gardener destroys all the weeds and useless plants and makes his garden a place of profit and of pleasure. Two much cannot be said in encouragement of the care and culture of the mind ; to afford an education that will banish ignorance and superstition. It must prove very satisfactory to know that a change can be so effectually wrought, that even a few years of right doing will efface many of the marks of transgression, and that by faithfully living in the works of righteousness we may be redeemed from all wrong.
