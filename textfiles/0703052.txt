Culture Culture.—What plowing, digging and harrowing are to land, thinking, reflecting and examining are to the mind. Each has its proper culture; and, as the land that is suffered to lie waste and wild for a long time will be overspread with brushwood, brambles, thorns and weeds, which have neither use nor beauty, so there will not fail to sprout up in a neglected, uncultivated mind a number of prejudices and absurd opinions which owe their origin partly to the soil itself, the passions and imperfections of the mind of man, and partly to those seeds which chance to be scattered in it by every kind of doctrine which the cunning of demagogues, the singularity of pedants and the superstition of fools raise. —Arthur's Mag.
