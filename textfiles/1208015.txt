A GREAT EVIL There is one great evil in this country which we think the pulpit and the press ought to denounce more frequently than they do—that is the habit of getting into debt and making no effort to pay. Can a man be a consistent Christian and not strive to pay all his debts ? Can a man be a Christian and not be honest ? Is a man who does not try to live within his means and pay his debts an honest man? If so, we do not understand the Bible. Should men who habitually disregard their financial obligations be allowed to remain in the church ? We think not, and think that a man's being a member of the church ought to be a letter of credit in any part of the globe where the Christian religion prevails. But it is not the case. Far from it; and there are even some ministers whose sermons do no good because they are preached by men who are not considered honest even by the men of the world. Whisky is pronounced the great evil of this country, and it is a great curse ; but we doubt whether it does more harm to the cause of the church than the lying and dishonesty of sober church-mem ¦ bers, whose promise to pay is not worth the paper it is written on. The church is not the place for fraud and dishonesty. Selected.
