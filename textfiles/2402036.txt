Dear Children:--'Time waits for no man.'... Shaker Station, Conn. Deae Children:ï¿½'Time waits for no man.' Time is always on the wing, you can not stop its flight, as each moment comes to you, labor with your might. One moment is all the time you can have at once. Use it as though you appreciated its value. It is sinful to waste time. There is happiness in every moment spent for God. Spend your moments well. Patient continuance in right-doing is sure to win. Time spent in gaining lasting treasures is well spent. To-morrow you say you will perform neglected duties, and when to-morrow comes you still say, to-morrow. Duties neglected for a time accumulate and become burdensome. A good to-day is the preparation for a good to-morrow. Perform today's duty, fight to-day's temptation. 'Draw nigh to God in your warfare and He will draw nigh to you. Correct the faults in yourselves that you think you see in others. You will spoil your happiness if you spare your sins. Days spent in doing right, no need to wish them back again. Make every day bright with good deeds and kind words. You will have none too much time for repentance. Consider the brevity of life. Swift your moments pass away, make your heaven while you may. Wisely improve your time and you will have time enough. So live that you can make others better, and there may be more good people. 'Let no one miss the road to heaven for lack of help you might have given.' Commit yourselves to God for instruction and guidance. Add a jewel every day to your spirit's shining crown. Cultivate heavenward thoughts. Gain wisdom of mind and virtue of heart, from the high path of duty never depart. Daniel Orcutt.
