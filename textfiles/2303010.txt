''GATHER UP THE FRAGMENTS.' Annie R. Stephens. This beautiful injunction of the lowly Nazarene is full of significance: we are all well acquainted with the miracle, that when ten thousand persons followed him to the desert to catch the living words of truth as they fell from his lips, how through the agency of his spiritual powers he fed them all with five loaves and two fishes, and then bade his disciples 'gather up the fragments that nothing be lost.' Although several centuries have elapsed it still retains a vital import, and teaches our souls a spiritual lesson. To those who are earnest and intent to do all the good they can, this world will not seem like a desert place; but rather its sunshine and shadow, its joys and sorrows will all appear as fragments of the Divine Mind, preparing our spirits for higher realms of thought and action. Who has not watched the unfolding of a bud, how it gathers into its being the warmth of the sunbeam, the moisture of the dewdrop, also the breeze and shadow are requisite to unfold it to the perfection of beauty. There are many golden treasures of good scattered along our pathway, that too frequently we pass by, unheeded ; the circumstances of daily life, its crosses and trials ; the look of sympathy, or the kind word of a friend ; the good that we can derive from spiritual intercourse with others, do we fully utilize and absorb into our interior beings the boundless wealth of these things? Perhaps we have failed to attain some cherished object, thus our hopes are blighted, or, in the hours of weakness we have been led astray by some temptation, we become sorrowing and downcast and our hearts are thus unarmed to meet the battles of life; when such conditions sur- 66 THE MANIFESTO. round us we may feel assured that we have not beeii diligently 'gathering up the fragments' to fortify our souls against the encroachments of evil. We are continually weaving the tissues of our lives, by our daily thoughts and actions; the good that we do, the beam of gladness that we send into another's heart, and the soul aspirations that we cultivate, these things will never be lost to us, but will yield a blessed fruition of joy in time and eternity ; if, on the contrary, we yield to the promptings of our lower selfhood and vanquish the power of conscience, these things will also bring their legitimate reward and darken our spirits with the shadow of evil; the aggregate of life is made up of fragments. Oh, let us color our lives with the beautiful tintings of soul aspirations and right doing. A scientist would tell us, that nothing is lost;ï¿½ 'The drop of dew that trembles on the leaf or flower, Is but exhaled to fall anew in summer's thunder shower.' We may draw an illustration from the fading leaf; it falls to the ground withered and lifeless, yet still it conserves a purpose to decay and nourish the tree that gave it life. In all the vast universe the same law of economy is in constant operation, and it would seem that God had written on the earth, the sea and the sky,-'Gather up the fragments that nothing be lost.' There are many that we might mention who have attained great good in various ways, by improving the precious moments of time and never allowing a day to pass without b ing able to record some attainment, some good stored away for future use. Let us be diligent, therefore, and keep our hearts open to receive, then we- shall have no vain regrets over wasted moments or lost golden opportunities; but our accumulation of wisdom and knowledge will be a constant incentive to still 'gather up the fragments that nothing be lost.'
