Enfield, N. H. Jan. 1899. New Yeab's day dawned bright, 16 deg. below zero, yet, despite the frosty air our morning Service was well attended. With the new resolves given to be and to do what duty demands the Service was more of a memorial, sacred to the memory of our arisen, noble, gifted coworker, Eldress Joanna Kaime, who for THE MANIFES TO. 29 about thirty years, was closely connected with our Society's welfare. To give full recognition to so complete a life of righteousness, no poem or eulogy could tell the half of her richness of character and worth to the cause of human regeneration. A life, so fruitful of good virtues, qualities and thoughts, all forming a noble, intellectual and strong individuality, can not be minimized to 'Well done good and faithful servant.' Eldress Rosetta Cummings and Sister Nancy A. Morse, carried to our sorrowing kindred at East Canterbury, our wreaths of respect, fastened with the bow of fellowsympathy. Personally, I think that if articles were inserted in The Manifesto, referring to the experiences, capabilities and graces, acquired and cultured by the truths of the Christ spirit, of such souls as Eldress Joanna Kaime of East Canterbury and Eldress Ann Taylor of Mt. Lebanon, and others who have honored our Church, they would scintilate sparks of spiritual encouragement to the young people of our Societies. We commenced Christmas festivity the evening before, with a social gathering, the unlading of a well-stockt tree of gifts, for the young people, and a supper of fruit, assorted cake, ice-cream and coffee. Sabbath morning's Service was rich with messages of the Spirit of Christmas, telling of the beauty and benefit of the Christ spirit and mission, also that spiritual and industrial action are the culturing forces of life, as well as the means of spreading peace and good-will to man. In the evening, a concert, appropriate for the day, afforded profit and pleasure to invited friends and home relations. To all our friends who dwell In torrid or frigid sphere, We send a New Year's message; May you have a glad New Year. . George H. Baxter.
