THE LITTLE QUAIL By Richard McNemar Traveling once along the way, Thinking of this latter dayHow much progress we can make, Since our lives are not at stake. Ancient saints could little gain, Still by persecutors slain; Now protected from the foe, Saints can have full time to grow. Next I thought, If sinners knew That we thus our safety view, Would they not yet try to kill ? Could they not our vitals spill? Through my mind this thought I cast, While a log I closely passed, Where a little quail did sit Fair and easy to be hit. Instantly I made a stand, With a stick I raised my hand ; Thrice I struck with all my skill, Rut no vitals did I spill. (. noe my stick just grazed his tail, But the well-protected quail, Sound and nimble took its flight Through the forest, out of sight. Instantly the spirit spoke, ' As this quail escaped thy stroke, So the wicked strike in vain In the great Messiah's reign.' O, what wonders I did view As the little creature flew! Every flutter of its wing Seemed to cry, ' The Lord is King.' Had I then an army seen, Full of rage and cruel spleen, I should felt no more surprise Than amidst a host of flies. While the cross of Christ I bear, Under his protecting care, Every danger I shall shun, Till my work is fully done. He who gave this striking sign Hasstretch'd out his meas'ring line : Persecution's at an end ; Now we may with Christ ascend. Blessed day how bright and clear! O what fruits the saints can bear! Righteousness through every stage, Now can grace this Golden Age.
