Shirley, Mass. Jan. 1894. It takes some philosophy, faith, hope and trust or whatever else you may choose to call it, to say or sing, as I have recently readï¿½ 'Whichever way the wind doth blow, Some heart is glad to have it so; Then blow it east or blow it west, The wind that blows, is always best.' I think, however it is a very good way to try to make the best we can of things as they come, for sometimes I have been made sensible that the thing very much dreaded was the one thing needed to bring the best result. I am glad that in New Hampshire and Massachusetts there seems to have been so much union of feeling in regard to our Centennial, and am surprised to find the interest there is in the reports published of the meetings held in commemoration thereof and take it as an earnest of good for the future. If no man comes to Christ except he is drawn by the Father, the Father must have helpers through whom to do the drawing; and it would seem that the united effort of souls consecrated to God and in whom Christ has taken his abode, as an ever flowing spring of gladness, even in the midst of storm and tempest, are among the most efficient means he can make use of. In this connection I esteem the kindly breathings of love and good-will in 'Home Notes as very effective. We do not want to be heard every-time, but are very interested listeners every-time, and would want to bless every wind that blows good tidings at least. Since commemorating our Centennial we have had Christmas and its duties in which good Believers have special interest. The day was ushered in by some of the young who are with us, in songs of joy and gladness, breathing peace and goodwill to all mankind. Our usual meeting in the a. m. was very interesting and well supported. In the p. m., the gathering about the finely decorated tree, was much enjoyed, accompanied by music, dialogues, and stories. All were calculated to foster the kindest feeling and good determinations. Health with us is much better so far than during last winter, though there has been much sickness around us, of which our dear Harvard friends have had a portion, but at this writing there is marked improvement. Now as I am thinking of the many dear friends, among Believers and outside too, whom I would like to take by the hand and say, 'God bless you! and give you a Happy New Year,' I would wish they might accept this as a personal offering to them, and as I this day have had my Commission renewed to extend love and kind feelings wherever I desired on behalf of the Brethren and Sisters I would again say, 'God bless you all!!' Amen. John Whiteley.
