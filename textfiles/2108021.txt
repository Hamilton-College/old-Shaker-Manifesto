Harvard, Mass. Again our little messenger of glad tidings comes to us freighted with the choicest of inspiration. Each month we wait with patient feelings to hear from the dear ones in the different parts of our Zion home. Lessons of wisdom are written on every page, and as we glance over the words of truth and strong testimony we often find the initials of loved ones who have, hand in hand with us, fought the battles of life, and are now giving evidence of the blessed salvation they have found to the young and inexperienced, who are now stepping into the ranks and putting on the armor. Let us, Brethren and Sisters, give them all the courage we can, that they may have the true planting and be established in right principles. An aged brother once said to one caring for children:�'You must still love them with all their faults.' This, at times, may seem almost impossible, yet I believe it is the only redeeming quality of mankind. Without love life is scarcely worth living. With it the worst blows of fortune fall comparatively harmless. So long as we love and are beloved we can bear the whips and stings with stoical equanimity; but when love fails us or our beloved are taken from us, then we begin to feel as though our armor of defence was gone. This principle of love shone out brightly in the life of Ann Lee when establishing upon earth the everlasting gospel of salvation. Called to forward these principles to mankind at a time when the country was involved in the severe struggle for its liberty and rights of conscience, she was compelled to meet a class of minds whose whole theme was patriotism and love of freedom; and to meet these minds she found this God-given principle was stronger than the rifle or sword. Why should not this same spirit be as powerful to-day, in reaching the souls of poor humanity who are crying�Lord, what shall we do to be saved�and show them where salvation and a rest for their souls can be found? The three day's rain last week has done untold good. A7egetation has taken a new start and we are in hopes of saving part of our crops from early frosts. Haying has commenced, but the crop looks to be about two-thirds as large as last year's. On the 13th of June we were once more called to witness the departure for the spirit land a dear loved one, Sister Mahaleth Pratt. She has been one who has seen a long life in the work of self-denial and has proved its full benefits. She was a woman of strong faith and had the force of spirit to speak her faith under any and every condition. The pride and fancies of the natural mind never hindered her from living to her full convictions of spirit. A. D. B.
