Keeping poultry Keeping Poultry.â€”Our domestic animals, derived as they are from wild ancestors, require a certain amount of exercise to keep them in vigorous health. Poultry cannot be kept in large numbers in confined areas without detriment to their constitution. Colonel Taggart, of Pennsylvania, provides food and exercise for fowls at the same time. In his poultry yard are several beds about thirty feet square each, in which Colonel Taggart buries oats, several bushels to the bed. The grains begin, of course, at once to swell and germinate, and the fowls have free access, scratching and eating the tender sprouts to their hearts' content. While the fowls are thus busy on one bed, a new one is prepared, which is in readiness for them by the time it is required. The idea is a good one.
