AN ELOPEMENT. By Emma Rood Tuttle. Two little bugs in a basket Lived very cosy and snug. With a mass of wool beneath them, And o'er them a pretty rug. Until one day in the winter, When the world seemed frozen up, A bug of the world came buzzing by, And stopped to dine and sup. When lo! these bugs in the basket Began to quarrel and fight, And the bug of the world kept piping up, 'The little bug is right!' And the big bug said, 'You may buzz and chime And coax my bug, if you will, But the wool, and the rug, and the basket This bug will stick to still!' The bug of the world walked to and fro Over the soft white wool, And said that he knew that the little bug Would not be the big bug's fool! As long as the big bug crowded him And stole his food away, He guessed the big bug had best move out And he and the little bug stay. But the big bug could not see the point And said in a saucy way, The bug of the world and the little bug Could never drive him-away! So the bug of the world, he flew away, And the little bug flew off, too, But the big bug lives in the basket yet, And now my story's through. ï¿½Selected.
