ONLY MARTHA J. ANDERSON Only an acorn that fell by the wayside— Only a tiny seed hidden from sight— Only a crystal drop lost in the flowing tide, Only a star, gleaming out in the night. Lo ! the great oak a broad shelter is weaving; Many fair blossoms shed sweetest perfume ; Bosom of ocean are mingled drops heaving; Myriad planets the dark sky illume. Thus be our life into purpose expanding— Small in beginning, yet good in intent— Noble and useful, and truthful in standing, Spreading in blessing as days are well spent. Scattering here the rich, and the precious seeds ; Wild wastes shall blossom, and deserts shall smile; Meeting the lonely and desolate spirit needs, Reaping a harvest of pleasure the while. Better to swell the bright billows of gladness, Though we have only a little to give ; Rather than drain the last dregs of life's Only for love let us labor and live. If but a lesser orb in the vast galaxy, Still shall our glory be made -to appear, Ever with steady light, so may our shining be, God marks the orbit of each circling sphere. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
