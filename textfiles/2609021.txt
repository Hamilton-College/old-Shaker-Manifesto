Bread and fruits... Bread and fruits, in the larger sense of the term, contain all the essentials of a correct human diet, whether for flesh, blood, brain or bones. Unripe fruit proves more or less injurious to every one. Currants, gooseberries and apples gathered before they are half ripe and stewed or made into pies, are common. These cooked fruits contain all the noxious ingredients that the raw ones do. The sun in the process of ripening may change them to healthy ingredients, but cooking does not and can not do it. In this way a world of unripe fruit, so to say, is eaten and a world of disease and premature death is the consequence. Dr. Alcott.
