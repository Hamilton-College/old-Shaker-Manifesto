Select BOYS AND THIMBLES Girls' work and boys' work is not likely to be so separate as it has been. It is now recommended that girls learn to drive nails, to sharpen knives, prune grape-vines; then, sure enough, why should not boys practise with needles and thimbles? No man can, like the writer, live sixty years, without often wishing he had learned to use a sewing-thimble well in his early boyhood, especially if he has gone about the world much. Buttons will come off, stitches will break, and how handy it is for boys at school, for men at a hotel, at a friend's house, indeed anywhere away from home—often at home—to be able to whip on a button, stop a starting rent, and do many other little sewings, without calling on a woman, or perchance sending for a tailor, before being able to appear at a hotel table. One seldom if ever, learns to use a thimble, if this part of his education has been neglected in small boyhood. The writer has travelled a good deal, and at a rough guess he has broken threads at least five hundred times in attempting to work a needle through a button or garment without a thimble. Boys, take our advice, and every one of you learn to use a thimble well before you grow up. Do it this very Winter; it is not feminine to do so. Do it, and if you live long, you will many times thank us for this advice.—Am.Agri.
