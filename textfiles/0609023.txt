MAKE YOUR HEAVEN HERE REV. J. T. SUNDERLAND There is no royal road or short cut to Heavon. If you want a Ileaven for yourself in the world to come, prepare it for yourself in the life that now is. You have no reason to think you will enter upon tho next life in any wise changed in character from what you are when you leave this. ' He that is holy, let him be holy still. He that is unholy, let him be uuholy still.' And the character with which you leave this world will be the slow and natural growth of the years of your whole earthly life, and cannot be the result of any thing else, tho teaching of any theology or man to the contrary notwithstanding. The true conception of human existence doubtless is as one in this world and the next —this the rill, that the river; this the dawn, that the day ; this the bud, that the flower; this the blade, that the full corn in the ear. Heavon is not something to be won or got or bought, either by ourselves or somebody else for us ; but it is somothing to grow into. In the next world you are simply your own self, only moved on, and moved up. Swedenborg somewhere gives us a representation of persons who had died, and did not, for a considerable time, even know that they were dead. Their old thoughts and feelings and loves and desires of the earthly lifo remained, and the world which they had entered did not at first seem different from the one they had left, only it was spiritual instead of physical. Hence they went on with their old employments and ran the rounds of their old pleasures. Only by degrees did they perceive their change of states —and that as they themsolvos became, by natural processes of growth and development, capable of deeper seeing and higher knowledge.
