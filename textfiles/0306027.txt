Sign of the Cross. This much despised symbol, bears within it a weighty meaning. The hand presses the forehead, the throne of thought; then the heart, the center of the affections ; and then the shoulders, which typify manual labor. Thus, by a few motions, a full consecration is emblemized; and a prophecy is set forth; yet they who present it ' know not what they do.'
