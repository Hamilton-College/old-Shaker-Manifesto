Dietetic Reformer The 'Dietetic Reformer ' (Pitman, London,) is a twopenny magazine, issued monthly, which aims to render important public service by calling attention to the facts of our national food supply, and to questions affecting the diet, and therefore, the health of all classes. It appears in an attractive dress. Its contents are varied, readable, and instructive. Some eminent names occur among its contributors. In these days of high prices and luxurious tastes, and, in too many cases, of limited incomes, we should all do well to acquaint ourselves more fully with these primary matters affecting our daily food.
