CORRESPONDENCE Dear Children: A happy new year... Enfield, Conn., 1886. Dear Children :�A Happy New Year to you all. How swiftly the years pass away. Make the most of this one. Turn over a new leaf in the volume of your lives, and on it write virtuous deeds. Each new year seems like a golden promise, and may this one hold a germ of abiding joy for you. What of the past year's journey? Have you made progress heavenward, or taken steps backward? There is no standing still. The question is a serious one for you to consider. So many things left undone, so many neglected opportunities dropped along the wayside never to be recovered, you would gladly turn back and gather them up. But alas ! only the present is yours. In reaching for things that are past, you too often reap 'a harvest of vain regrets. ' It is time for good resolves, for better endeavois, and a purer life. Virtuous living is worth more than resolutions. It is not enough to mean well. Do well. 'Live unspotted from sin. ' Never put off vows of amendment. 'One moment today is worth two tomorrow. ' No day like today. If your today is well spent, lasting' happiness will be yours. Time well improved brings peace to the spirit, Cherish a noble ideal and strive to live up to it. Grow better today than you did yesterday; better this week than you did last; better tins year than you did last year. [n eternity you will appear in the garment that you have formed during your earthly pilgrimage. There may you meet, sometime, and there may you greet each other in the happiest of all New Years. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt. Beloved elder: Prompted by love as... Shaker Village, N. H. Dec. 1885. Beloved Elder :�Prompted by love as for a gospel parent, I in this express my gratitude for the sa:r,e. I never come into the presence of souls purified by the gospel without an impression is made which opens an avenue of thought in relation to my own condition and purpose. Our meeting of last evening was replete with testimonies against the spirit of the world in its every form. The one theme of thought that has occupied my mind since then, is that of the loveliness of young men and women, possessing the adequate faculties for every worldy pleasure, and who in obedience to light and conviction, are endeavoring to crucify every carnal propensity, that they may become true Brethren and Sisters in the virgin relation. I love this relation because of intrinsic value to the soul and I feel determined to square my life by the testimony which makes a separation between flesh and spirit. They are opposite elements and cannot coalesce and any endeavor that any one may make to combine them will not only prove futile, but if persisted in, will eventuate in the spirit of the world. I trust and have reason to believe that every one is endeavoring to do right, and yet my first and great concern should be and is, that I am trying, faithfully, to discharge every duty incumbent upon me both spiritual and temporal. Accept the love and gratitude of a gospel child, Arthur Bruce. My dear pupils: I chanced to fall... Shaker Village, N. H., Sept. 1885. My Dear Pupils :�I chanced to fall into a swarm of ' Do's, ' this morning, while inspecting an old paper, and as they all seemed to be addressed to the girls of the present age, I could not bear to destroy them, though just on the point of polishing the cook-stove with the paper to which I refer. I thought just then, however, of half a dozen sensible school girls that I once knew, who would not only be interested in reading and thinking about this family of ' Do's, ' but would adopt them as their own. You will percieve that there are nineteen petitions all introduced by the auxiliary ' do. ' Will you kindly read and re-read them. What Girls Should Do. Do answer your letters soon after they are received, and do try to reply to them with some relation to their contents; a rambling, ill-considered letter is a satire upon your education. Do, when you talk, keep your hands still. Do observe; the faculty of observation, well cultivated, makes practical men and women. Do attach as much importance to your mind as to your body. Do be natural; a poor diamond is better than a good imitation. Do try to remember where you put your gloves and card case; keep the former mended and the latter filled. Do recollect that your health is more important than your amusements ; you can live without onp, but you'll die early without the other. Do try to be sensible; it is not a particular sign of superiority to talk like a fool. Du be ready in time for church; if you do not respect yourself sufficiently to be punctual, respect the feelings of other people. Do get up in time for breakfast. Do avoid causes of irritation in your family circle; do reflect that home is the place in which to be agreeable. Do be reticent: the world at large has no interest in your private affairs. Do cultivate the habit of listening to others it will make you an invaluable member of society, to say nothing of the advantage it will be to you. Do be truthful; do avoid exaggeration; if you mean a mile say a mile, not a mile and a half; if you mean one say one, and not a dozen. Do, sometimes, at least, allow your Mother to know better than you do; she was educated before you were born. Do sign your full name to your letters.� Exchange. Let me hope that you will resolve to respond to each petition practically, that you become a practical 'salvation army' among the millions who need a saving influence so much. You may think my selection very plain and almost personal, but let me assure you that it is from a personal regard for each of you that the writer moves the pen, for you have been among my long cherished hopes for future usefulness. To-day finds you in the blackberry field, a most interesting pastime I daresay,�One that should inspire you with gratitude to God for the bounties received without the asking. The fresh, sweet breezes, the sunshine, the shade, the vines loaded with fruit, and anon the ripe clusters lying half concealed in brake and brier, show to you what welcome, luscious fruit, can be found in the deep recesses of obscurity^ apart from the varied confusions and influences of this big world.�So may you, like the more perfect fruits grow and ripen beneath the shelter of God's perfect law, on the enchanted soil of virtue, in the environments of modesty and innocence until the Christ spirit of purity and power, shall call you forth, to do and live for others, or in other words, till you are spiritually able to be as a sheltei and shade toother growing' minds. You are only a few out of the millions 01 your age and nation ! Is it not then oi some consequence how you think ant act? You who have in possession the knowledge of right and wrong. JDwell upon these mighty conceptions, my dear girls, and let all minor considerations be lost in your one desire to redeem your own souls, and help the grand army now lying encamped around you. Your Teacher and Friend, A. C. Stickney.
