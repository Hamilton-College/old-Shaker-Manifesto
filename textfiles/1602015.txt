My dear pupils: I chanced to fall... Shaker Village, N. H., Sept. 1885. My Dear Pupils :�I chanced to fall into a swarm of ' Do's, ' this morning, while inspecting an old paper, and as they all seemed to be addressed to the girls of the present age, I could not bear to destroy them, though just on the point of polishing the cook-stove with the paper to which I refer. I thought just then, however, of half a dozen sensible school girls that I once knew, who would not only be interested in reading and thinking about this family of ' Do's, ' but would adopt them as their own. You will percieve that there are nineteen petitions all introduced by the auxiliary ' do. ' Will you kindly read and re-read them. What Girls Should Do. Do answer your letters soon after they are received, and do try to reply to them with some relation to their contents; a rambling, ill-considered letter is a satire upon your education. Do, when you talk, keep your hands still. Do observe; the faculty of observation, well cultivated, makes practical men and women. Do attach as much importance to your mind as to your body. Do be natural; a poor diamond is better than a good imitation. Do try to remember where you put your gloves and card case; keep the former mended and the latter filled. Do recollect that your health is more important than your amusements ; you can live without onp, but you'll die early without the other. Do try to be sensible; it is not a particular sign of superiority to talk like a fool. Du be ready in time for church; if you do not respect yourself sufficiently to be punctual, respect the feelings of other people. Do get up in time for breakfast. Do avoid causes of irritation in your family circle; do reflect that home is the place in which to be agreeable. Do be reticent: the world at large has no interest in your private affairs. Do cultivate the habit of listening to others it will make you an invaluable member of society, to say nothing of the advantage it will be to you. Do be truthful; do avoid exaggeration; if you mean a mile say a mile, not a mile and a half; if you mean one say one, and not a dozen. Do, sometimes, at least, allow your Mother to know better than you do; she was educated before you were born. Do sign your full name to your letters.� Exchange. Let me hope that you will resolve to respond to each petition practically, that you become a practical 'salvation army' among the millions who need a saving influence so much. You may think my selection very plain and almost personal, but let me assure you that it is from a personal regard for each of you that the writer moves the pen, for you have been among my long cherished hopes for future usefulness. To-day finds you in the blackberry field, a most interesting pastime I daresay,�One that should inspire you with gratitude to God for the bounties received without the asking. The fresh, sweet breezes, the sunshine, the shade, the vines loaded with fruit, and anon the ripe clusters lying half concealed in brake and brier, show to you what welcome, luscious fruit, can be found in the deep recesses of obscurity^ apart from the varied confusions and influences of this big world.�So may you, like the more perfect fruits grow and ripen beneath the shelter of God's perfect law, on the enchanted soil of virtue, in the environments of modesty and innocence until the Christ spirit of purity and power, shall call you forth, to do and live for others, or in other words, till you are spiritually able to be as a sheltei and shade toother growing' minds. You are only a few out of the millions 01 your age and nation ! Is it not then oi some consequence how you think ant act? You who have in possession the knowledge of right and wrong. JDwell upon these mighty conceptions, my dear girls, and let all minor considerations be lost in your one desire to redeem your own souls, and help the grand army now lying encamped around you. Your Teacher and Friend, A. C. Stickney.
