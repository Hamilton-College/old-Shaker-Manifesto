This Number Our readers will observe the space given to notices of the demise of that once truly great man, Elder Grove B. Blancttard. For years he has patiently awaited his call to the better land, and now he has gone to enjoy a well-stored harvest of everlasting gains. On our cover is presented the picture of the earthly home of this beautiful man, so full of valuable historical incidents in early Shaker days. This was also the home of two other lovely souls Whose departures we chronicle this month. We wish we could give a true picture of their spirit homes. We are really surprised and sorrowed to note the departure in the west of G. W. Ingalls who has been such a prominent worker there. Our sympathies are with the people there. By reference to our Society Record, a ' New Departure' in the appointments of trustees will be observed. This is a good move, but let not such an arranged equality of the sexes be construed into the supremacy of either one.
