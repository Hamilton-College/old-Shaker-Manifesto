Living on Vegetables The number of those who think that vegetables constitute the only proper food for man has increased largely in this country during the past ten years. It would have still a larger increase but for the fact that reformers of every kind have to bear the reproach of being to some slight extent eccentric. Elderly people, who have suffered untold misery by submitting for years to the dictates of fashion, broken in health and utterly discouraged, are ready to try any system that has in it the hope of relief. What is needed is the enlistment of young vigorous men and women in the ranks of the vegetarians. Make it interesting to them to experiment with their appetites, and to discover whether life is worth living when the food supply is composed exclusively of vegetables and fruits. A correspondent says : ' The elephant and rhinoceros build up their mighty frames without the assistance of flesh food ; the horse, the ox and all the domestic animals whose strength is serviceable to man, are by nature vegetarians ; in short there are innumerable indications of the fact that the purest, most wholesome and most nourishing food for man may be obtained direct from the bountiful hand of nature, without any admixture of blood and slaughter. I myself can, after five years experience, bear witness to the immense benefit which the bodily health derives from this simple and frugal method of living, which has none of the exciting and stimulating qualities of flesh food, but induces a calm, strong and equable habit of body, together with far clearer and more vigorous powers of mind. In short, let those who have a will try for a month or two the reformed method of diet, and they will soon learn to smile at the admonition of chemists and doctors. ' Herald of Health.
