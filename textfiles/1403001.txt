RELIGION and SCIENCE HARVEY L. EADS. I wish to call your attention to this subject. Some writers base pure religion on a knowledge of the sciences. Not satisfied with the seven sciences of the ancients, given us nearly seven times seven to be comprehended and unfolded to the senses in order to form in us the bases of pure and abiding religion ; thus making true religion impossible to the human race, for no mortal c*an master them all so as to have ' the combined effect of these unfolded powers, in these grand departments of our being, on which to form the basis to sustain the temple of pure and abiding religion '( ! ) But none of them, nor all of them combined, can give internal religious light. It was St. Ghrysostom who said we should study philosophy in order to be able to contemn it, but I do not agree with him, as all truth should be received and revered wherever found. The study of philosophy, logic, etc., enables us to meet those who stand on that ground, but a lifetime is insufficient for any one to master the occult sciences, though his years should outnumber those of Methuselah. The simple one, the physical, so easily handled, still has doubts hanging over it after the labors of physiologists for thousands of years�so dark and obscure it still is, that none of them have been able to tell us with anything like a certainty what is the office or function cf the milt, or spleen, in the human body, and if so simple a thing as this is beyond our reach would not the man be a maniac who would undertake to master thiem all in 100 years? The same may be said of nearly all the divisions and subdivisions presented to us. Better it would be never to have learned our a,b, abs, than to endanger the intellect in such a strife. Yet I would not be understood to undervalue a literary education. All that is said on this subject may be well enough for the denizens of the underworld, as well as the religion based upon the sciences, as it is all theologica-moral, or a simple belief, without the corresponding works demanded by Christ, who said : 'If any will come after me, let him deny himself and seek first the kingdom ;' not seek first a collegiate education, but seek first the kingdom, and all necessary things (education included) will be given you. It is unphilosophical to say that the sciences are illustrative of the objective and subjective worlds ; in fact it is a contradiction, because the objective and subjective are not tactual�one is spiritual, the other material; and just as erroneous is it to use the words spiritual and intuitional as synonyms�spiritual pertains to the soul, touching not matter ; intuitional is human instinct; differing from the animal in that it may reach the intangible as well as the tangible, while the animal reaches the tangible only. The intellect being a faculty, and not a system, is for objective and not subjective purposes ; it takes cognizance of morality, but not of spirituality or religion only in an external sense, not in essentia. Morality is not religion. The external law may compel a man to be moral, but it cannot compel him to be religious. Environment and neighborly conditions may induce one to live morally who does not believe in a future life, but such one must be pronounced a moral man in the absence of every religious feeling. Every word in a discourse should have a distinct signification and application to prevent misunderstanding. Then what are spirit and intellect ? To speak philosophically and truly, the spirit is an entity, the ego, the inner and real person, the subjective me, in which the intellect is not seated. The intellect is not an entity, but a faculty seated in the brain of the objective ' me, ' which is only a little bark for the spirit to guide on the ocean of life. The intellect perceives by brain power, while the spirit perceives by the unfolding power of God in the soul. The province of the intellect is to judge, to know, to invent� look into and see to the fitting and fitness of material things. The province of the spirit is to scan the motive of the fitting, but not to judge of the material fitness. Thus we see their functions are as different and distinct as things can be, and the one cannot be made to do the work of the other. And every one who does not go behind nor beyond the intellect is to all intents and purposes a materialist and knows nothing about pure, spiritual religion ; for practical religion is obedience to the inward monitor. When this speaks, saying : Think or think not on this or that, speak or speak not, do or do not, then pause, give heed�listen not to passion, but obey, for it is the voice of the infinite God in the soul who cometh quickly, whose reward is with Him to give to every man according as his works shall be. (Rev. xxii., 12.) But I am still asked ; If the intellect does not aid the spirit, why do you preach ? Or why are books written ? The intellect must perceive the truth or falsehood of what is spoken or written. Answer�All that ever may or ever can be spoken or written to be effective must meet in harmonious rapport with the inner spiritual unfolding, or it will pass asso much idle wind. H�\v many millions hear and see incontrovertible truths who honestly see no necessity of their application to themselves. So the light without and the light within must harmonize or all preaching is vain. Thus I think the functions of the two are madeplain. If we look within, the spirit speaks ; if we look without, the intellect responds ; and it is :n this way the world strove to get religion and failed, until the illiterate Jesus, from teachings within, ' brought life and immortality to light' and introduced to the scientific world and world at large the only true, pure and abiding religion the world ever saw or ever will see : and it is worthy of remark that he selected no followers from the scientific circles, nor courted nor recommended science in any shape, for the simple reason that the sciences do not contain one iota of spiritual and pure religion. The same has now been re-introduced to the world by an illiterate woman, Ann Lee, and I doubt not but all Zion would be far better off to-day having in possession their spirit with the absence of all literary education than, to be master of all the sciences, with their spirits and example ignored.
