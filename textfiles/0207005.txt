A Temple which Hath Foundations.' BY E. H. WEBSTER Matt. vii. 24, and Hogged ii. 6, 7, 8. Tempered with sadness is onrjoy, And'prayers our thoughts employ, For avarice which walked on high, Whose temples almost touched the sky, Knows not, alas ! its doom is nigh, But vainly strives to build anew The temples oi' the past, And makes of earthly clay and dew A temple that will last. The glory of the latter day, Whose strength shall bear truth's keenest ray, Must be with broad foundations laid, With justice and with virtue stayed, And righteousness so long delayed; All else will surely sweep away, All refuges of lies, All shaken in that burning day, When grim oppression dies.
