THE SHAKER PROBLEM. GILES B. AVERY. In the article to which this responds it appears that the Shaker's correspondent, and the suggestions of the Shaker's responses, were directed almost wholly to the exoteric and tempora1 status of the community�to those points most interesting to the worldly side o: the Shaker problem�the numbers professing the Shaker name, and the fina disposition of the Shaker's property, when the last Shaker may have been entombed. The vital subject of Shakerism appears not to have received even a passing hint; and the Shaker's state of mind reminds a brother Shaker of the feelings of Peter at the eve of the judgment for the execution of Jesus. But, ' man is not keyed to the temporal alone, but to the eternal. ' Shakerism, though an hundred years old, is yet in its infancy, and struggling in its swaddling clothes, as did its foster father Church eighteen hundred years ago ! That which dignifiedly concerns the world relatively to Shakerism is its province, function, or business�the part providentially assigned it to act in man's career of salvation and redemption. Its humble origin, like that of its Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, who was the first great Shaker, has, in like manner, environed it during its advent of introduction, with neglect, and draped it in great obscurity, so that even those who, like John the baptist, are seeking the advent of the Kingdom of Heaven, and peering into the horoscope of God's future providences for man's elevation, look toward Shakerism as John did toward Jesus, and ask, ' Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another, ' and, the Shaker agency for man's salvation and regeneration, to the worldly eye, looks so meagre, the world is still looking for another ; and that other, in the world's estimation, must be some theme or project, consonant with worldly conceptions of greatness and grandeur ; and, withal, a system of religion that shall cater to man's worldly pleasiires, and minister to the gratification of his sensual appetites ; this is the charac- ter of the new religion that the agnostic, worldly element of society is clamoring for. But through inspired media, God hath declared that He ' hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty. * * * And things despised hath God chosen, yea, and things that are not [in the propositions of the worldly mind,] to bring to naught things that are.' 'That no flesh should glory in His presence. ' But all sinless followers of ' the Lamb on Mount Zion,'' who follow Him by ceasing from all the sins and practices of a worldly life, as Jesus did, thus crucifying the world in themselves aud overcoming it, shall become subjects of the Kingdom of Heaven, to go no more out, and, eventually, heirs of the Kingdom of God�the society of the redeemed in Heaven, and heirs of its bounteous heavenly inheritance. If such souls can be found among Shakers, Quakers, Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Catholics, or any other of the multitudinous cognomens of those professing religion, or those making no religious profession, such really are Shakers of worldly elements, principles and institutions ; they are the laboring agents whom God hath declared, by the mouth of His prophet Haggai, should shake the world and its old heavens of pleasure in unrighteousness. Thus, 'yet once it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea, and the dry laud ; and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come; aud I will fill this ''[Shaker]house with glory, saith the Lord of Hosts.' See Haggai, ii, 6th and 7th. A recent historian declares to the world that '' there is an universal decadence of all religions (so-called) among all people throughout the world, ' for we are living in an inquisitive and skeptical age, and, as all mankind are affinitively connected sympathetically, Shakers, as well as all other professors of religion, must feel the throbbings of the pulse of the status of religious life in the human family; and, as its blood at present flows languidly, and the religion of Shakerism requires the utmost fervor of religious life, even that degree of thirst for heaven that shall cause souls to cry out, 'Lord, what shall I do to be saved, ' not in Ingersolic sarcasm, but, in sorrowing necessity, therefore, Shakerism waits the progressed state of Society, or a portion thereof for the season of its advent. The work of Shakerism is the climatic process of man's strife for the Kingdom of Heaven; that state of happiness which all mankind are desiring, though millions so blindly, foolishly, and ignorantly seek it, abnormally struggling to purchase Heaven without paying therefore the legal price, as speculators in Wall street, New York, seek to gain wealth by lottery. Shakerism, while it recognizes and accepts all the revelations of God's will and purposes for man's elevation, salvation and redemption, in all the four grand dispensations of His grace to man,�those manifest to Noah to make man perfect in his generations ; those to Abraham, to separate him from the broad plane of a mere worldly life to become a nation of priests aud examplers ; those to Moseo, to introduce his church as scholars preparatory to the Christ order; those to Jesus, to inaugurate the Kingdom of Heaven upon earth; and those which should be manifest at the second coming of the Christ spirit, which should ''harvest' the earth� reap man from the earthly order, and fit him for the Kingdom of Heaven while yet upon the earth ; yet, it does not, in one Babylonish mixture, mingle the ordinances which were the laws of progress for man while under the ministration of each of these distinct and different dispensations, as do many �nan made theologies and creeds. And thougk at present the numbers progressing in this prophetic shaking dispensation are small, and for a time and times may decrease, yet the genuine Shaker's faith is consonant with the prophet's declaration : ''The desire of all nations'�the Kingdom of Heaven�'' shall come ' upon earth, (through the shaking, sifting process) and ' God will fill' (this prophetic Shaker house) ' with glory. ' The work of Shakerism is the work prophesied of that should come in the ''last days' of the progress of God's plan of redemption for humanity ; and of these days' works, God, through the mouth of His prophet, hath said, 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and nations shall flow unto it; and many people shall go to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths ; for out of Zion shall go forth the '� Law' and the 'Word of the Lord' from Jerusalem. ' The spiritual Zion of God is composed of souls ' who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. ' These will all be Shakers of all ungodly worldly systems. The present phase of 'Shaker' experience with regard to numbers professing the Shaker faith, as well as the experience of the other denominations of religious profession, is merely a halt in the march of religious progress. The true Shaker idea is : The march will be renewed ere long ; then, those who seek eternal joys and durable riches in God's Kingdom, will come out from the world and be followers of the Lamb on Mount Zion, for ' All creeds and forms shall pass for naught, When man is quickened by God's thought.' When names, and sects, and parties shall have passed away, true Shakers will be found to possess a kingdom eternal, while the world, and its elements, will be burned up by the fire of truth.
