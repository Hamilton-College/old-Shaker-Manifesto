ADVERTISEMENT NUISANCE Turn whichever way you may, and the printed or painted announcementof Squillgut's or some other eminent physician's syrup, purgative, or salve, greets the eye, in letters long, short, tall, extended or condensed, according to the opportunity the size of the fence-board gives for display. Every bridge in the town is plastered with the glaring advertisements of pills, balsams, lotions, remedies, oils,liniments and painkillers, utterly hiding the color the authorities thought appropriate for the structures, and making them frightful objects. Trees, stumps, rocks, and fences along every highway are em- blazoned with the names of bitters, plasters, ointments, purifiers, and cure-alls, and there is no place or no thing that the modest agents for these various compounds hesitate to appropriate for their purpose. The outer walls of our beautiful Academy of Music are pasted over with posters, telling the virtue of some windy decoction, and there isn't a rod of fence-board between the village and the cemetery that doesn't beg the mourning processions that go that way to use this, that, or the other relief from all the ills that flesh is heir to. We have nothing to say against the stuff advertised. It is one of the inalienable rights of the Yankee to get up patent medicines, and to sell them if he can find simpletons to buy them, but we do protest against this making such bad use of private or corporation property. We wish every fence owner, or owner of any other thing that is used for these announcements, would visit every paste brigade that uses them with the vengeance of the law, or compel them to obliterate their work. As for using the bridges for this business, we hope the selectmen will stop it at once, and make every offender hereafter feel the penalty which the statute provides. Pittsfield Eagle
