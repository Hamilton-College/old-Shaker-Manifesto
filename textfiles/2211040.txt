STEWARDSHIP. ' Give an account of thy stewardship.' Luke xvi., 2. Canterbury, N. H. Be lifted up, my soul, Till the heavens shine upon thee, And in the majesty of truth and love Thou art able to walk. Thou shalt set no bounds for labor, But as a steward faithful, In God's service shall thy life In unceasing measure flow.
