MY WORK. 'Everyman's work shall be made manifest, and fire shall try every man's work.'ï¿½l Cor. iii., 13. Enfield, N. H. 1. 'Tis lights and shades that pave my way, They teach me lessons 2. O beauteous resurrection morn! My spirit unto 3. No more of tempest, no more storm, No more outcast, no ev'ry day, And what my work shall be; Yea, what my work shall thee is born; Thy elements I love, Thy elements I more forlorn; The still small voice I hear, Continually I be. A swifter travel love. Thy air I breathe, in hear. Its whispers thrill my for the soul, A stronger pow'r life thee I live, The substance lost I heart and soul, And all the acts of to control; This is the life for me, now retrieve; Which opens heav'n above; life control; And thus the cross to bear; The chosen life for me. The worlds of light above. The yoke of Christ to wear.
