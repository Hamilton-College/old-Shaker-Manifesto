Shirley, Mass. Eeb. 3, 1890. If, 'Wh^re the heart feels most, the pen moves least,' will stand for a truth as well as of the 'lips,' the Brethren and Sisters at Shirley Mass, may perhaps be given credit for a great deal of feeling. We know there are a few faithful souls here who have a great deal of feeling for the welfare of all their gospel kindred, and would join gladly in kindest and heartiest greetings to them, in all the heights of Zion. Jesus said of his disciplesï¿½'If ye were of the world, the world would love his own, but because ye are not of the world, the world hateth you.' If the world of to-day, loves Believers, what does it mean? Has the world improved, or is the other result inferred, proved to be a fact? In any case we ought to love each other, and not neglect all opportunities of making it manifest. Hence these few lines. Winter thus far very mild, with slight exceptions, though from Jan'y 28th. to Feb. 1st. inclusive was well improved in drawing logs to mill. A large portion of next season's wood sawed, split and partly under cover. Apple Sauce, one of our specialties, in very good demand. Not more than one well defined case of 'La Grippe' among the Brethren and Sifters, while all around us, the people have suffered greatly. J. W.
