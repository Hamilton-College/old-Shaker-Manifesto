My dear little S.- Your very pretty letter is... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. My Dear Little S.- -Your very pretty letter is before me. I can rejoice with you that you have experienced that soul cleansing work of a Believer and that your twelfth birthday was the day you sought the holy baptism of the fire of truth which will consume sin, rather than the pleasures of an earthly character. How much more real and substantial are the things of the spirit, than are earthly riches which are but shadows, they perish with the using. If you hold on to the good you have received in the effort to consecrate your little self to a life of the Virgin Order, you will grow in all those lovely virtues which you can see in those who are older, and spend many happy years in living a good life. You will be able to pluck up the wild weeds of nature which grow without cultivation and in their stead grow the rare plants of beauty which need so much care, viz., purity, peace, humility, love and all the gospel graces which adorn the true followers of Christ and Mother Ann. As you grow older you will often need the same holy power which you felt on that memorable day, and if you are faithful and obedient, you will be able to call to your assistance help from the same heavenly source. As you have felt happy in taking up this cross, the like experience will be felt in future days. Every building must have a foundation to stand upon, some are solid and firm, some very poor and unsubstantial, so with souls in the gospel work, those who dig deep and uproot all the wrongs aud evils of their hearts, will lay their foundation on the rock of truth, they will be firm. Such we expect our dear little S. to be and on that twelfth birthday we hope you laid the corner stone for a true and noble structure, a good life. Our prayers and blessing shall be for our good child. Please give our kind and best love to your dear teacher and all your little companions. Lovingly and truly, Harriet Bullard.
