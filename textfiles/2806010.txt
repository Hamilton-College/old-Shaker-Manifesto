Shakers, N. Y. May, 1898. The effort that is being made to bring the different religious beliefs into a closer communion is a commendable one. The World's Congress of Eeligions, held in 1893 was an educator on the line of progressive thought, and the one to be held in India, the present year, will be a continuation of the work which is removing the angularities and overreaching the boundaries of that exclusiveness which for so many centuries has been the cause of the contentions that have arisen among the \arious beliefs. That the call should come from one representing a belief that antedates our own by many centuries is evidence that 'the world moves onward and the light grows stronger.' Certainly good must come by a comparison of ideas which will help remove the rust and mould that have collected through ages of exclusiveness. The workers on the farm and garden are renewing their activity and sowing the good seed. At present we are having a superabundance of rain which is retarding the progress of spring work; but before the close of the season we may be calling for rain, so we will accept what comes and be thankful. We enjoy the perusal of the home circle notes; it seems like a personal communion with our friends, and the thoughts exprest by those who are striving to sustain the publication of our Monthly are accepted with pleasure.
