PERSONAL EXPERIENCE The writer has lived with the Shakers, sixtyeight years—lived with those who believed under the ministration of Mother Ann, who was the same, in spirit, as Jesus, in his appearing. They gathered into Apostolic order— Community of interest. They carried out the Christ principle to the very letter. They who had wives, lived as they that had none. They who possessed houses and lands, as though they possessed not—for the fashion of the world had passed away. They were a noble people, strong in body and in mind. It was a great blessing to me, that my lot was cast with them, when I was young', away from the evils that are in the world, to learn to wear the Christian yoke, till it became easy and the burden light—to obtain the promised rest, to my soul—in this present time. Elder Simon Maybee, Hancock, Mass.
