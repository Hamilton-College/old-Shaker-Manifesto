THINK NO EVIL MARIA WHEELER The importance of speaking no evil cannot be too deeply considered. Yet to avoid evil speaking it appears necessary that we think no evil. We are so liable to be led by impulse, that we can hardly entertain evil and unkind thoughts toward any one, and constantly speak good and kind words of them. Some individuals may be very weak and erring, but to such we should extend that ' charity which covereth a multitude of sins ; ' and few if any are so perfect as to be faultless. Again, we may fail to understand, and consequently misinterpret the actions of others. If we practice judging the actions of others, by our preconceived ideas of their motives, we will unjustly, and often injuriously, ' bear false witness ' of them. Although six thousand years have rolled their slow lengths along since the command, ' Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy brother ' was first proclaimed, its justice and immutability have lost none of their force. And it declares its divine origin by its just and equita- 36 THE 8HAKEK. ble character. Nor is it more a commandment than the words of the wise and good man Jesus, written in the sands, ' neither do I condemn thee, go and sin no more.' Our obedience to these two commandments, the former to protect the innocent, and the latter to shelter even the guilty, would give us food for pleasant reflections, when we do as the poet beautifully says: ' It is good to talk with our past hours, And ask them what report they bore to heaven, And how they might have borne more welcome news.' This practice would make us lenient to the faults of others ; and often discover to us that much which we are inclined to call wicked in others is only unwisdom. Now, if we wish to speak no evil of any one, we must think no evil, lest unkind thoughts betray themselves through speech. If the heart is right, there is no need of a sentinel at the lips.
