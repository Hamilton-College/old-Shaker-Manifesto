Enfield, N. H. Nov. 1895. What exalted thoughts entrance our mind as we view a glorious sunset. Surely no picture of nature can be grander, unless it be the brilliant autumnal foliage. As the component parts of nature aid in beautifying and enriching the world, one season depending upon the other for its contributions; even so the varied qualities of the human mind are necessary to complete the perfect whole; and godly THE MANIFESTO. 283 patience is one of the essential powers to mature the strong, immortal life of Cliristliness, that can withstand, unmoved and unrelenting as a rocky ledge, the surging billows of ungodliness that heat against it. Under the ministration of perfect patience we endeavor to 'Strive well for every fair, adorning grace, For healthful growth of body, soul and mind; For love, in which all beauty is combined. In true self-culture, sin we may not trace, In lovely lives, it has no part nor place.' Human life is a pilgrimage, and it may be well to add to our zeal the leaven of Christian ambition, ever remembering it was the cheerful, devoted giver, endowed with a penetrating sight of the world's needs, of those minds who have caught the heavenly message of full resurrection from the soil of iniquity and founded our homes with the view of bettering humanity. May we work with as consecrated a purpose, and move with the inspiration that 'God helps those who help themselves.' With the ending of the harvest season, we realize a harvesting of good results, not only in the record of farm products, but our religious and educational services have yielded blessed fruits of strong faith and moral activity. Though the harvest season is past, there is still work for busy hands, and souls who seek for the graces of a Christ-like spirit. Fall ploughing, also the filling of our average contract of eight hundred corn planters is in active operation. There has been prepared for the market one thousand lbs. of beet seed, also fifteen hundred lbs. each of yellow dock and burdock root. Happy indeed are they who combine with willing service of the hands, full consecration of the mind and soul. George H. Baxter.
