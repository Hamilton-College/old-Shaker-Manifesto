SOUL FREEDOM As rolled the mighty river of humanity, On toward its goal—the ocean of eternity, I heard a cry, from hearts worn with earth's vanity Exclaim ' Oh Heaven ! (if such there be) our earnest plea ' Is for a knowledge and the power of liberty.' ' Not liberty from selfish independence grown, ' Nor freedom shown to galley serfs and slaves alone — ' Not liberty that knows no law—where passions roam; 'Nor that corrupt freedom which human hearts bemoan; ' But that victorious liberty, to sin unknown.' And then I pondered: From pride, from lust and war, the human heart made free, Thence God alone is served with angel purity. What earthly love and lust-enslaved, humanity May sing, Divinest love has saved, by Liberty — By freedom of the soul from all iniquity. And, as the glorious emblem of civil liberty Soars far beyond the clouds, in ether's azure sea; So may the chastened beings of blest humanity Kise to those holier realms where angel minstrelsy Joy in the light and growth and power of liberty.
