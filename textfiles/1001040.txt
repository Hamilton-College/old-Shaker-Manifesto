The Early Start —A person converted in youth is like the sun rising on a summer's morning, to shine through the long bright day. But one converted late in life is but as the evening star, not appearing till the day is closing, and then but a little while. The most matured, and useful and happj* Christians are, for the most part, those who early come to the Saviour.—James.
