WHAT IS A FRIEND? [Contributed by Maria Witham.] An English newspaper has recently offered a prize for the best definition of a friend. The prize definition was as follows i 'The first person who comes in when the whole world has gone out.' The following are some of the best of those which failed to take the prize. One who considers my need before my deservings. One who to himself is true, and therefore must be so to you. One who smiles on our fortunes, frowns on our faults, sympathizes with our sorrows, weeps at our bereavements, and is a safe fortress at all times of trouble. One who guards another's interest as his own and neither flatters nor deceives. A 19th century rarity. One who will tell you of your faults and follies in prosperity, and assist you with his hand and heart in adversity. ' One truer to me than I am myself.
