DUSLAP'S 'CHAMPION' STYLOGRAPHIC PEN. We have before us certificates setting forth the advantages and improvements made in Dunlap's ' Champion ' Stylographic Pen, patented November 18th, 1884. We have used for two years past a Stylographic Pen sent us by Mr. Dunlap, but this latest invented Pen, is endorsed unanimously by the trade as a great improvement and givTing perfect satisfaction to their customers. Many say, it is the only Stylographic Pen worth having at any price. The New England agent of the Union and Central Pacific II. K. writes : ' I have been a constant user of the Champion, after having tried several other makes. Since receiving the Pen and having become . accustomed to its use, it would be like a relapse into barbarism to return to the old style. I would not pan with my Champion Pen for $100, if I could not replace it. I consider it the best Pen in the market. ' This new Pen, which is rightfully called the 'Champion' contains valuable features never before combined in any Stylographic Pen, but the principal feature is a compound spring formed from a tube of hard rubber, while other Stylographic Pens, have fine gold wire or metallic springs, which soon rot and corrode. In order to successfully introduce to the public this new and valuable instrument the Dunlap Stylographic Co., 296 Washington St. Boston, Mass., (manufacturers of the Pen) have reduced the price to $2.00 each for plain, and $2.50 each for gold mounted. They will (for a short time only) send by return mail a Champion Pen, 6 months supply of ink, and a beautiful gold mounted pencil, on receipt of the price of a Pen. The Pen is the same in style and finish as Pens sold everywhere at $3.50 and $4.00 each.
