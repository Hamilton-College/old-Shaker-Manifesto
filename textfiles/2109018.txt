FOR THOUGHT. It has been suggested by some of our beloved Elders, that the writers of 'Home Notes' who have so faithfully represented the temporal interests of our Zion home, should occasionally add a little more of the spiritual, by giving an account of our religious meetings or of social gatherings. * In this, however, we have no need to forget, 'first that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual.' While we are on the earth we must keep an active interest in the affairs that help to make a prosperous and happy home. God, himself, planted a garden and then provided a man to take charge of it, and this was about all that man could do in that age of the world. At the advent of Jesus it was a higher call. 'Seek first the kingdom of God,' said he and then all these temporal blessings will be added to your store. In all that we do, wre must cultivate the spiritual and as the apostle says, whether we eat or drink or whatsoever we do, do all to the glory of God.
