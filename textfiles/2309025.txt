NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. Aug., 1893. There is evidently a strong feeling, prevailing throughout our entire Order, of desire to enter upon a work of self-examination and expurgation of all that is contrary to our principles and hinders our spiritual growth and usefulness Conditions are in many respects at the present time, unsatisfactory, but there is no cause for alarm. Ours has always been a progressive gospel, there is more wisdom, love and virtue among us, as a people to-day, than at any previous period of our history, with a stronger confidence in the value and importance of our mission and a deeper realization of our responsibility. The power that has inspired and sustained us hitherto, will still succour, guide and deliver, as we are individually prepared to take up the cress and move forward in the light of the present day. The call to us is, 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.' This will be a long travel but the end of our faith will be the salvation of our souls. It was suggested some time ago, that yearly, or every two years, a Convention be held to discuss and advise upon points of doctrine and practice. Has the idea dropped? Something needs to be done to engage the interest and enlist the enthusiasm of the progressive minds among us. Our good Sisters, Ann Offord and Catherine Allen have been away from home a little over two weeks enjoying the advantage of sea air. They have just returned much benefited. A company of our Sisters recently spent three pleasant days with Church family Sisters picking blue huckleberries on the mountain. They gathered five bushels. The berries were much appreciated, but the gospel union between the families, was better than berries. The last day they went up to 'Holy Mount' where many a gospel meeting has been held, and upon which a baptism of the power of the Res- THE MANIFESTO. 21') urrection Heavens has often descended. The company joined in song, admired the delightful scenery, and returned home feeling as happy as faithful Believers only can. The homes of Believers are much appreciated as training schools for the young. We have just accepted four boys. 'Cast thy bread upon the waters' is the injunction, and so we think that the good we do in this way is not lost. Health of family good. Crops fair and well harvested so far. Very dry season, and water very low in the brooks. Walter S. Shepherd. Shakers, N. Y.. Second Family. Aug., 1893. We have secured our hay and rye. Oats yet to gather. We have had a severe drought in this section. Corn and potatoes as well as young seeding and pastures have suffered for want of rain. We have now a refreshing rain, two and one half inches have fallen. Have canned some beans. Isaac Anstatt. North Family. Aug., 1893. In reading the testimonies of those royal veteran souls that were the founders of our Communal homes, that at different times have been published in the Manifesto, how puny our efforts seem to be in comparison. We can at least be thankful to be counted worthy to be among the least of the Brethren if thereby we can receive their ministrations. Although arisen, they are still ministering angels, and their blessing is descending upon the faithful ones in this the time of Zion's great need. We are having our first experience in a contest with that persistent foe to the gardener,ï¿½quack. It reminds one of the struggle with the elementary forces of the soul in the effort to bring them under the dominion of the higher law; both can be accomplished, but it requires energetic action. In our more than twenty years experience gardening, the most effectual means that we have found to combat that pest, the cut worms, has been in late fall plowing. Whenever we have faithfully followed that plan they were effectually suppressed. By the time these notes appear our new barn will be finished and ready for occupation. We wish to especially thank Elder Wat| son Andrews, for his clear elucidation and reasons given for upholding t!ie doctrine of the Second Appearing of Christ in the maternil order. It will be a true educator and enlightener of the people. Hamilton DeGr.nr. Shaker Station, Conn. Aug., 1893. Jesus said, 'If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.' How plain the injunction, and how pleasing it should be when we know that bearing the cross will ensure eternal life. To be a true crossbearer requires a crucifixion of all sinful elements. By the cross salvation is free. The true Christian traveler is sure to win, though long and severe be the c mflict. Our prayer should be thxt we may have courage to bear trials, afflictions, and crosses, and thus be better fitted for self, denying work. Crosses patiently borne, will make us strong in the Lord and build us up to a higher Christian standard. There is no promise of reward without the cross. We should live with noble aims in view, be virtuous, wise and true. Life is beautiful only as it is lived for a noble purpose. Ensilaged fodder is exempt from the influences of the atmospheric conditions that are so annoying in the management of dry fodder, and it is always ready for use when wanted. Fodder corn is growing in favor for summer feed and it would be more extensively cultivated for winter feeding were it not for the difficulty of curing it, particularly in wet seasons. The care of hens to produce the best results, demands intelligence, and a general 21(3 THE MANIFESTO. oversight of the owner, just as much as any other branch of business. There is nothing on a farm that will produce money more easily or more surely than a well cared for flock of hens. Eggs are cash, and always in demand; while eggs in winter are valuable. Daniel Orcutt. Enfield, N. H. North Family. Aug. 1893. 'God is too great to need a religious broker on earth,' as He is too great for finite mind to fully comprehend. The divinity of God is of individual growth. That God's work ever has and ever will be performed and advanced by noble beings whose minds have penetrated beyond the boundary line which encompasses and utilizes the generative life forces, is an indisputable fact. To believe that God's laws need or are developing a new type of a human being through whom his truths are to be revealed, we would consider ourselves like Peter of old, denying Christ and stultifying our spiritually enlightened consciences. God's work needs no new revelator, but more laborers, armored in godly nobility to wisely explain laws of health, of mental and moral purity. . True Christianity is not enshrouded in mystical signs, language, or based upon unscientific facts, any more than it ever has or ever will create materiality out of nothing, a god-man out of a mental emotion. We are blessed with health, which condition is a power. 'Prompting us unto kindest deeds, To love mankind still dearer; For by pure love, not man-made creeds, We draw to God still nearer.' Our hay harvest is over, and of finer quality than last year's yield. We have had our Dry House re-floored with eighty iron rods, thus making a fire-proof building of brick, iron and slate. As we read of the prosperity in our several homes, we fervently breath a prayer for continued blessing throughout Zion. George IF. Baxter. Canterbury, N. H. Weather Record for July, 1893.

My first duty is the pleasant one of recording our united thanks to God for the recent rainfalls which have done so much toward ensuring us a plentiful harvest, that had previously been so seriously menaced by the protracted drought. Our hay harvest was an average crop, on new land, very little rowen will be secured. Farm potatoes have not looked so promising for years, but garden potatoes were slightly affected by the drought. Up to present date, (Aug. 7,) we have taken from the garden 165 bu. and there will be, probably, 40 bu. more. Oats will be ready to cut the present week. The 6th of August is a day which every Shaker cannot but remember and celebrate as 'Mother's Day.' On this day, 119 years ago, Mother Ann Lee, the founder Oi this Church, landed in America with her little band of eight followers, after a most perilous voyage in an old, leaky and condemned ship. This voyage of nearly three months was taken consequent on special revelation; a revelation confirmed by signs, visions and extraordinary manifestations to individual members of the, then little Church in England as well as to Mother Ann herself. During a storm on the voyage, after the captain had told his strange passengers that they must all perish before morning; Mother expressed her faith and cheer after seeing two bright angels of God standing by the mast, through whom she received the promise that not a hair of their heads should perish. Such unusual spiritual communications from the powers on high were the fundamental pillars of this Church; a church not made with hands but it is eternal in the heavens. The 6th of August falling this year upon THE MANIFESTO. 217 the Sabbath day, the motto for our worship on that day was 'Mother's Day.' The service being of a retrospective character in the various testimonies. At six o'clock in the evening a number of our young Sisters, who last year had formed themselves into a 'Centennial Band,' to commemorate the organization of this Society one hundred years ago, gave an interesting and most effective dedicatory service, in which they were assisted by the girls and boys. A well arranged programme of about twenty items was organized, and the Brethren and Sisters of both families were invited to the meeting held in the church. MOTHER ANN LEE, Aug. 6, 1774. MOTHER'S DAY, Aug. 6, 1893. The opening address was a graceful statement of the anniversary celebrated, and stated that 'It afforded a fitting opportunity to renew vows of consecration to the noble cause espoused by every grateful member, to exalt the integrity of purpose which enabled 'Our Mother' to become an instrument through whom the light of God came into the world and so clearly defined the nature of sin that we are permitted to see with our imperfect vision and immature understanding that God is no respecter of persons. But one baptism, one cross, one sacrifice enables whosoever will to find one brotherhood, one family tie, even a spiritual home for soul and body. Those who are blest to associate as Brothers and Sisters in the virgin order, which is the legitimate fruit of the revelation of God through Mother, have a debt of gratitude to render for sacred protection and liberty, which no others can conceive. Its beauty and blessing have opened to our youthful minds to such a degree that with bowed heads we would repeat, 'Let us be there with the holy in heart.' We are not hero worshipers in any sense of the word. We trust in no arm of flesh, but in that Christ we have unlimited confidence which spoke through Jesus of Nazareth, giving to the world as much of truth as it was prepared to receive, and which was opened afresh and finally perfected through the agency of Mother Ann as a mouthpiece and represented through her personality. Only for this sacred feature connected with the journey, the landing of Ann Lee on the shores of America would be an event of no more moment to us, than the landing of hundreds of women before and since that memorable day. That she was English born, is too insignificant to claim thought, but that the Spirit breathed into her soul and that she conceived, thereby, a purely unselfish mission, to which she was ever faithful is beyond all praise and above all criticism. Even this little 'Centennial Band' have life to-day from the faithfulness of parents in the seen and unseen worlds. We have a peaceful, happy home, blest with more than the essential comforts of life. But best of all, below, above and beyond all for which we give thanks to-day, is the knowledge of Mother Ann's Christian mission, which lias opened its arms as a warm-hearted father and mother to this band of daughters, enabling us, if we choose, to stand in Gospel relation equal with our Brothers, to attempt the full cross and win and wear the full crown.' The programme consisted of the choicest offerings of singing, recitation and dialogues. The 'Twelve Christian Virtues' were an interesting and most telling item. A paper on 'Confession' was read, treating of that most important duty from a comprehensive, spiritual and thoughtful view. The meeting claimed the highest approval and appreciation from the Brethren and Sisters who were invited to the celebration, as it has endeared the younger members of the household to their older friends in, let us hope, an indissoluble tie of Gospel love and union. Albert Evans. [The above article having in it an interesting feature of home life, and especially as it was in remembrance of the 6th of August, we cheerfully admit it into the columns of the Manifesto, although quite beyond the length that was suggested for Home Notes. Ed.] Sabbathday Lake. Aug. 1803. We are having very warm days with little or no rain. The water supply is becoming short The reservoir for the Laundry is dry and we must resort to the oldfashioned way of pumping for our washing next week. We have enjoyed a refreshing visit with our Canterbury Sisters, Emeline Hart and Bertha Mansfield. They kindly gave us two or three days from a business journey and one of those days was the Sabbath. We united in worship; in the freedom of the Spirit and in the songs of Zion. All were especially glad to meet Sister Emeline as she is one for whom we gained great love in former days when her home was with us, and now our dear Sister Bertha will always be lovingly remembered after enjoying this extra privilege with her. Our barns are filled with hay and the cattle and horses will have an abundant supply for another winter. With these few lines we send our best love to all our Gospel friends both far and near. Ada S. Cummings. West Pittsfield. Aug., 1893. The temperate zone seems to have overstepped its boundaries and strayed into the tropical regions, as the mercury in the past few days has reached the altitude of one-hundred degrees in the shade. The earth in our section is extremly parched and a severe drought is imminent unless rain is forthcoming. On the evening of the 22nd ult. we were visited by another violent thunder shower accompanied by hail, and unusually sharp lightning. Fortunately our home was preserved from any direful effects, but it was found necessary to replace several broken window panes. On one of our small farms lying just over the line in the town of Richmond, is a field of six acres of sweet corn which was totally destroyed. It swept with terrific force through the section just south of us, laying waste everything in its path. Many of our neighbors in that vicinity suffered the loss of nearly all their crops. The following day was Sunday and proved to be a most propitious one, as a company of angel visitants, still in earth form came over from Mt. Lebanon, to unite in our worship and spend the day in sweet interchange of love and communion making the day seem doubly hallowed by their presence. Br. Benjamin Gates, Eldress Dorothy Wright, Sisters Mary Hazard, Eunice Cantrell and Cornelia French were the precious ones who thus honored us, and may the reflections of that interview be to them so pleasing that they may be induced to repeat it, and others come and do likewise. We are also especially grateful to the select company who attended the funeral of our venerated Sister, Lucy Jane Osborne and added so much interest to the occasion. Julia L. Sweet.
