West Pittsfield. Aug., 1893. The temperate zone seems to have overstepped its boundaries and strayed into the tropical regions, as the mercury in the past few days has reached the altitude of one-hundred degrees in the shade. The earth in our section is extremly parched and a severe drought is imminent unless rain is forthcoming. On the evening of the 22nd ult. we were visited by another violent thunder shower accompanied by hail, and unusually sharp lightning. Fortunately our home was preserved from any direful effects, but it was found necessary to replace several broken window panes. On one of our small farms lying just over the line in the town of Richmond, is a field of six acres of sweet corn which was totally destroyed. It swept with terrific force through the section just south of us, laying waste everything in its path. Many of our neighbors in that vicinity suffered the loss of nearly all their crops. The following day was Sunday and proved to be a most propitious one, as a company of angel visitants, still in earth form came over from Mt. Lebanon, to unite in our worship and spend the day in sweet interchange of love and communion making the day seem doubly hallowed by their presence. Br. Benjamin Gates, Eldress Dorothy Wright, Sisters Mary Hazard, Eunice Cantrell and Cornelia French were the precious ones who thus honored us, and may the reflections of that interview be to them so pleasing that they may be induced to repeat it, and others come and do likewise. We are also especially grateful to the select company who attended the funeral of our venerated Sister, Lucy Jane Osborne and added so much interest to the occasion. Julia L. Sweet.
