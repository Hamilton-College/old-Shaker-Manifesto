How to Make Tea Hard water makes the most delicious tea, as it dissolves less of the tannin and gives the cup a more delicate flavor. And even with bard water there is a wide difference between wells located near together. But given the same quality of water, and a difference in the manipulation will make to a sensitive taste a total change in the character of the beverage. There is not one city tea-kettle out of a hundred that in its present condition is fit to boil water for a cup of tea. Let our reader go home to-night and inspect his own outfit, and he will verify our statement. He will find the interior of his kettle encrusted with the mineral deposits extracted from the water boiling in it from morning until night of each succeeding day As the water is 'clean,' the cook but empties and fills the kettle, never thinking of the growing crust that must now be scraped off if the kettle is to be cleaned. Water that has stood after boiling will not make a good cup of tea, and yet how often the tired laborer, mechanic, merchant, doctor, or lawyer, has tried to solace himself with a beverage made from water containing the debris of that which has stood all day on the range, being only filled as often as any addition was needed. Take a clean kettle never used for anything else, fill it with fresh water, the harder the better, boil quickly over a very hot fire, and pour as soon as it boils upon the tea-leaves fresh from the canister. Let it stand four or five minutes, and then drink.
