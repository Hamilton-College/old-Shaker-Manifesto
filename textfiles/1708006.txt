EDUCATION. RICHARD BUSHNELL, Is not education one of the inalienable rights of human beings ? If society allows children to be born, is it not the duty of society to make existence a blessing? Good parentage, good care, food, clothing, lodging and good schooling- -education- -that shall develop all the self-supporting faculties of body and mind. When will society become rational, act rationally, in relation to the continuance of the race ? Was not Moses right upon this subject? He superintended propagation from beginning to end. Light and right is modesty. Lycurgus brought the same science to bear upon raising human beings that the moderns do in raising animals, t There are some sixty Shaker families, who have been taking and educating children for about one hundred years. Thousands of these children have gone out from among them when they became of adult age. But few of these ever became paupers or criminals. Being educated in a community they learn how to do a great variety of things. The boys learn to manage cows, sheep, horses, poultry ; how to work on the farm, garden, orchards, and how to turn their hands to almost every kind of mechanical work, such as carpentering, blacksmithing, shoemaking, etc. In a family of sixty people, almost everything can be done by the members, who have been educated in the family from raising and cooking the food, to plumbing the buildings. Why should not public industrial schools be self-supporting communities, like Shaker societies? War, pauperism and crime would soon be matters of history, with slavery and the inquisition. The suggestion of the '- -Tribune' to use the accumulating funds of the government to feed, clothe, house and educate the children of the country in industrial schools, is just what is needed ; not more soldiers, more pensions, more Monitors, more forts, and guns of large calibre.
