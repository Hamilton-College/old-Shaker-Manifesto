Blessed is the man who lives... Blessed is the man who lives in accordance with the law of God written in his own heart; he shall have wisdom and understanding, a strong brain, a vitalized spirit and vigorous body. There shall be depth of music in his voice, firmness and elasticity in his step, and bravery of heart to do right. To him will men look as one made in the image of God, who has not by indiscretion marred or blighted his perfect likeness. M. J. A.
