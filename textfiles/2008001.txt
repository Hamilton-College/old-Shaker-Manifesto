WITNESSES. Alonzo G. Hollister. 'He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.' La Salle, in a recent number of The World's Advance Thought, says 'Years ago it was communicated to me by High Intelligences, that perfect chastity in thought and act was an absolute requirement to those who would overcome earth conditions ; that the physical sex relations were of the generative plane, and belonged to lower conditions of consciousness. There is a higher, purer sex relation for those who can live above the physical sex plane. 'The higher law is affinity of mind and soul, which has nothing to do with physical sex, but has to do with qualities of mind, and may unite two men or two women, or any number of men and women, in a common purpose for the good of others. Only when cured of the love of carnal pleasures, can we realize what true happiness is.' Physical, worldly sense pleasures are as husks that are food for swine, but never can satisfy the soul. Many witnesses are rising up in different parts of the world, among advanced minds, who testify both in precept and practice that virgin chastity and continence is the only path to the perfect and cheeriest life. This discloses the 'narrow way' of Jesus' teaching, both to occult wisdom and to immortality. A way too narrow to admit selfishness and sensuality, but leading through straitness into spaciousness and unbounded freedom�a freedom which is to that of the sensualist, as the freedom of earth and sky is to a treadmill. A freedom to possess and enjoy the truest and grandest things in earth and heaven�to soar among the stars of intellectual and spiritual light, and gather the rarest jewels and richest fruits produced by every race and every clime, impossible to corrupt or decay. A freedom to dispense all good things to the needy and appreciating, as fast as they will clear themselves of sensual mud, and make place to receive and retain them. Because few are willing to be undeceived by the experience of others, mankind mostly feed on illusions, and must try every conceivable way, and invent every possible device to shun the 'narrow door' and grasp the coveted prize of eternal peace and rest, without parting from their delusions, and without divesting themselves of the environing protoplastic mud which imprisons and enslaves while it gratifies their love of pleasure. Immortality means deathlessness. It is not a- product of ' nature nor of evolution, but is the life from above, proclaimed by Jesus and his Apostles, and which it is the mission of all true disciples of his to communicate. They teach the 'secret doctrine' openly, together with the moralities, to all who will listen�to a mixed multitude of any and every degree of perception, and of understanding, well knowing that only those prepared and 'drawn by the Father' and Mother of spirits, having eyes and ears to perceive, and hearts to understand the truths of the perfect life, will be thereby induced to exchange an earthly for a, heavenly inheritance and eternal abode. Such will be drawn inward and upward to one primal center. They teach that God is light, and in Him is no darkness, and that direct light is life. Consequently, all who would come to Him, must come into the light, works and all, that is focussed in his messengers in whom He dwells. For there is nothing covered that shall not be uncovered, neither hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. That which is spoken in darkness, shall be heard in the light, and that which ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chamber, shall be published on the house-tops. This with reference to the hypocrisy of men in professing great outward sanctity before the world, Avhile within, they are full of extortion, excess, and all manner of uncleanness. 'For every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in a day of judgment.' 'And this is the Judgment, [Gr. kn'ms, turning point, separation,] that light has come into the world. And men loved darkness rather than light, because their works are evil. Every one doing vile things, hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his works .be reproved. He that doeth the truth, comes to the light that his works may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.' Here is shown the affinity between evil works and darkness, and their inhering antagonism to light, the presence of wiiich, produces separation between precious and vile, evil and good, falsehood and truth. Jesus speaks of a harvest at the end of the age, when the tares will be separated from the wheat. He will send forth messengers, and they will gather out of his kingdom all scandals and them that do lawlessness ; then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their Father. The kingdom of Christ, is in the hearts of his people, the same who, before they hear the gospel, 'constitute the world, or field of the householder, in which the good seed was sown, and afterward, the tares. 'The tares are the children of evil.' No one can reasonably deny that the sins which men commit, such as lying, thieving, adultery, fornication, murder, slander, fraud, lascivionsness, also, evil dispositions, such as, lust, envy, malice, lawlessness and revenge, and all false doctrines taught for true, are tares of the enemy, that have come from an evil source. These are gathered out in the harvest, which is tie krisis, or turning point and period or 'separation' from all that mars or hurts�from all that is rudimental, tentative and provisional, including the matrix of matter into which spirit is cast for a time, to gain experience and discipline and develop its powers. This is the season of judgment which comes in due time to every spirit that has matured its fruits in the psychic or astral body, and ultimately to nations, and the world composed of individuals. 'The reapers are the messengers.' The aonian gospel is preached in the season of judgment, to every natioa, kindred, tongue and people dwelling on the earth, by messengers that go forth from the midst of the one hundred and forty-four thousand who stand with the Lamb on Mount Zion. Rev. xiv., 7. This gospel of the harvest exemplified in the character of the 'redeemed from among men,' is for all who hear it, the rule of the perfect life about to become theirs, and the criterion by which all are judged, both dead and living. 'For this cause the gospel was preached to the dead, that they might be judged truly according to men in flesh, but live according to God in spirit.' (Fetor.) And all who thus live, write their names in 'another book, which is of the life' that abides forever. This judgment and preaching the gospel is on the programme of a thousand years, or day of the Lord, for the conversion of the kingdoms of the world to One Lord and his Anointed, as announced in Rev. xx., 4, and chap. xi., 15, where 'the end is declared from a beginning.' This is particularly affirmed to be the first resurrection. Blessed are they who have part in it. 'Over these the second death has no power.' Let Christianity be expounded by those who have entered 'the narrow door' and walked in the strait way of the judgment that removes the tares, and it will be found that only the moralities which constitute but the merest rudiments thereof, can be received or understood by those who continue the life and practices of the world. No matter how subtile their reasonings, how expansive their intellects, how soaring their imaginations, how versatile their talents, nor how fine their perceptions, they cannot rise above their chosen element or state, only as they make room for a higher to enter and elevate them. 'Whatever doctrinal matter they absorb for nutrition, will be either transmuted or translated so as to conform it to the life they are living, or it will be extruded and rejected as intractable, for this is the law of all living organisms. Hence the necessity of fixing our thoughts on the higher, endless and perfect life, and rejecting the lower with all its feeders, if we would escape its limitations and irritations, its immoralities and disappointments, its losses, fatigues and disease, and rise to that pure, emancipated state to which the whole truth in Christ, is the way. It is something more than a veneer and outside polish, or a set of rules for conduct that leaves the core of rebellion in the heart untouched, to 'accuse before God day and night' his would-be servants of sin and unfaithfulness. It is a remedy which if truly applied, penetrates to the most secret cause of evil, turns the light upon every dark corner, discloses every hidden transaction and the motives thereof, and floods the mind with the light of the new and endless life. After the covering is voluntarily removed by honest confession before a witness, a true messenger of Christ, and the cross of daily self-denial, which is the yoke of Christ, has been assumed, the Divine uplifting life thenceforth ever flowing from the inmost sanctuary within, like a spring of clear water pouring forth, carries all corruption, and soil and stain before it, purifying desire and cleansing the heart from carnal taint. Hence the Apostle testifies, 'If any be in Christ, he is a new creature. All old things [old loves, old desires, selfish motives, old social order and relations,] have passed away, and all have become new, and all of God.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
