Eliza Barber Eliza Barber , deceased, at Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.. August 6, 1874, aged 75 years. We've parted with a long loved friend, From this terrestrial sphere, Whose lowly soul was well refined, Through discipline and prayer. And on her banner is inscribed ' Meekness and patient toil; ' Peace was her motto, Truth her guide; Her life was free from guile. P. A. Jones, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
