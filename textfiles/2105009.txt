Take heed that ye do not your alms before men... 'Take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them, but when thou doest thine alms, let not thy right hand know what thy left hand doeth.'ï¿½ Bible. F. WORTHINGTON. There are many people who give money to some charity simply as a shrewd policy to better their business, or to gain public confidence, as the best means toward some selfish end, taking care always that their so-called charity shall be advertised as widely as possible. This fraudulent species of philanthropy is what Jesus sought to warn his followers against. Because the possible realization of the worldly end sought, is all the reward such acts can receive, either here or hereafter. 'Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.' But all good deeds, words and actions springing from a desire to aid others or comfort them, received the highest approbation of the Teacher. The giving of money is a great and powerful means of doing good, but there are many wa}?s without the giving of money. There are no souls so poor, but that they may become rich in good works for Christ and God. Society is composed of an infinite variety of natural characters. Some are rich, some are poor, thousands are paupers, thousands are helpless ; many are young and strong, many are old and infirm. And there are many grades of intelligence ; all having some useful quality in which they may excel if cultivated ; yet all are made of one flesh and blood, and all controlled by the supreme laws of the Infinite. But spiritually all souls are equal. The soul of the poor outcast is as valuable in God's eyes as that of the king. And both may become of equal value to God and society for good ; providing the Holy Spirit moves and tempers the action of each. In cases of great calamities, like a large fire or an earthquake, how quickly the race and caste prejudices of human nature are forgotten and all mingle together as one. The grave awaits alike high and low, strong and weak, black and white. Now all these varieties'of human life can be equally valuable in .God's service in their places and ways. Nature consists of infinite varieties unconsciously aiding each other. The oak gives support to the ivy. The woodpecker extracts insects from the growing trees, which otherwise might become numerous enough to destroy them. There is a strong tendency with many, in our day of newspapers and telegraph and rapid transit, to think that it is only now and then some very popular and highly gifted persons whom the world calls its great men, that can do much for God or humanity. At a casual glance, it indeed looks that wray. But if we consider more closely, we will see that these same great men have been dependent on the efforts of thousands before them. What of the teachers who taught them? Of the self-denying father and mother, and of others perhaps, of whom the world does not hear. These great men are doing the work God intended for them if they are actuated by his spirit; but not a more important one than thousands of the toiling, humble, unnoticed servants of the Teacher, unknown to the world, but not unfelt. They will be known in eternity. The flight of the eagle as it soars around the lone cliffs of the sea, or the rocky crests of the mountain, is sublime, grand, majestic. But the sweet songsters that enliven our woods and meadows in the spring and summer are remarkable neither for their size or gaudy plumage. The widow who cast in her two mites has been preaching charity to millions for centuries. Some of the greatest events of history for good or ill, have resulted from some apparently trifling occurrence. From the ranks of the humble and the fire of affliction have sprung some of the strongest Christian characters. Occasionally a brand is plucked from the depths of infamy and becomes a pillar of strength to others. Gough and Murphy, once notorious drunkards. Gough and Murphy the powerful temperance advocates. Baxter and Bunyan, once abandoned blasphemers ; Baxter and Bunyan, gifted and staunch advocates for righteousness. In a purely worldly sense, only the strong can succeed. But it is the will and desire of God to bless the weak and afflicted, to aid the strong; thus to prepare all who will desire and ask it, for a blessed eternity beyond. This blessing is open to all who may work for it. To the toiling laborer and grimy engineer; to the educated and the ignorant; to young and old ; to the wayfarer and to the sinful. God is able to save the soul even unto the uttermost. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
