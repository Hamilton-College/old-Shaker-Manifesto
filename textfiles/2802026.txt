TRUE TO LIFE The editor of the Murfreesborough (Tenn.) News thus accounts for hard times: 'We let our timber rot and buy fencing. We throw away our ashes and grease and buy soap; we raise dogs and buy hogs; we raise weeds and buy vegetables ; we catch five- cent fish with $4 rods; we build school-houses and send our children off to be educated, and, lastly, we send our boys out with a $40 gun and a $10 dog to hunt ten-cent birds.
