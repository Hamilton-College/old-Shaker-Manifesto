Shaker Station, Conn. Dec. 1897. North Family. 'I turn a page whereon to write, On which in future I must dwell; I find it spotless, clean and white, No shades of blight thereon hath fell. Oh in the light of love serene. How would my heart this fair page fill; How wonld 1 that no deeds be seen My soul to blight, my heart to chill. Oh that the pen of time may stamp Thereon the beautiful and true; Ah how in earnestness I plead, As I these stainless pages view.' The coming New Year! Oh that we may have garnered all that is precious from the days that are past. May the experiences of the faded year teach us to live better for God and humanity. Brethren and Sisters are still making improvements as fast as time and means will allow. We have succeeded in arrang. ing a chapel in the new building, and the former place of worship will be occupied as a school-room. Two large heaters in the basement moderate the cold air in the halls to an agreeable temperature. In a short time, our bath-rooms will be completed and we shall once more enjoy the blessings afforded by such facilities. Edith Shufelt
