Correspondence. Dear friend:--This will inform you that we are all well... Kidds Land, England. Nov. 1890. Dear Fjriend:�This will inform you that we are all well and were deeply interested in your homeward journey. We hope you arrived all right and safe into your family, as they would all feel very happy to see you again among them. You will, evidently, be engaged in your daily duties before this reaches you. Dear friend, allow me to use the term, I am writing in the name of the whole family. We cannot assign the reason for it, but your meekness and modesty and simplicity of manners left an impression on our memories that is growing in our household every day. Not a day passes but that you are spoken of with expressions like these. 'I wonder what uncle Kobert will be doing now?' 'We would have kept him, father, if he would have stayed with us.' Your name, sir, has become a household word; and as the weeks pass along it seems to become more and more permanant in the mind. Your sojourn among us, although very short, yet in that short time you left your wise counsel and your blessing, and with these you have left your impression upon our memories which time will serve to strengthen. Kate and Mary speak of you with the deepest reverence and kind care. So, dear friend, although your body is in America, we have a part of you here, in spirit. I must confess that for a few days after you left us, I felt a blank, as the conversation we enjoyed was very pleasant to the ear and did good to the heart. Your graphic sketch of your life-work may have an influence on some of the rising generation, in the making up of their future destiny. It shows plainly that no one need try to shape their own future to their own mind or will, as in trying to do this without the aid and guidance of the All-seeing Eye, it would only result in failure. The power is in God's hand. Hoping this will find you enjoying the blessing of health is the wish of us all. Your sincere friend, James Scott. [Since receiving the above, our beloved Elder, Robert Aitken, has been called to go on another and more interesting journey, from which it is said, by some, 'no traveler ever returns.' The very kind spirit, however, in which the letter is written, and to acquaint the readers with the pleasant spirit that Elder Robert loft uaiong the people while in England, even with the children, has prompted us to publish the Utter, trusting that through it much good may be enjoyed by all who read the communication. Ed.] Beloved Elder Henry:--With our allotted assessment for the Manifesto... Watervliet, O., Dec. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�With our allotted assessment for the Manifesto we send our love and thanks for the kind and continuous endeavor you are making to have the Manifesto useful and interesting to its readers, not only to our Community, but to all who may receive it. The concept of our doctrine and life -as opened to us by the gospel of Christ's second appearing is surely and steadily increasing among men. Its divine truths will prevail and I feel much encouraged. I believe there are many souls that have been awakened by the sound of the seventh trumpet, mentioned in Revelations, when the mystery of God should be finished. God manifest in the flesh was the mystery begun in Christ's first appearing and will be finished in his second appearing. I greatly desire an ingathering of honest, prepared souls who will help in the building up of God's work in this day. That his kingdom may come and his will be done on earth as in heaven is my prayer. We have many precious blessings and much to be thankful for, which has been our blessing the past year. A happy new year to all our dear gospel friends, in all the Communities. Your Brother, S. W. Ball. Beloved Elder Henry:--It is almost 1891 and this reminds us... Alfred, Me., Dec. 28, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�It is almost 1891 and this reminds us that something is needed to keep our little paper in the land of the living, so we enclose the needed check. We are just as well pleased with the paper as ever, and hope it may continue to go op its errand of love and mercy for many years. Are glad you are to give us a history of the 'Kentucky Revival' that all may be reminded of the danger of forgetting that there is a power superior to that of mortals, which did not cease to exist 1800 years ago. Christmas found us with so much of Christian love that there was no room for unkindness to a Brother or Sister. We send a goodly store to all our Brethren and Sisters at your home. Your Brother, John B. Vance. Beloved Elder Henry:--A very happy new year to all... Shirley Village, Mass. Jan. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�A very happy new year to all the dear friends at East Canterbury. I send you the assessment for Harvard and Shirley for 1891. The loss we all must feel in the death of our dearly beloved Leader, Elder Giles B. Avery, is inexpressible, if we should not say irreparable. My intimate acquaintance has tended to deepen my love and affection for him. Zion is passing through the fiery furnace, and who shall be able to stand? And the answer comes, the pure and upright. You may have heard of the death of my companion to England and Scotland�Elder Robert Aitken. An experience with him has increased a sincere love and affection for him, as a Believer, and a zealous advocate of all that tends to the true resurrection life. With kindest wishes Very truly, John Whiteley. Beloved Elder Henry:--Please send me some four or five more... Enfield, N. H., Jan. 5, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�Please send me some four or five more of the January Manifestos containing the obituary notice of Elder Giles. I am pleased to learn that the 'Kentucky Revival' is to be reprinted in the Manifesto. It must be very interesting to many of its readers. I enjoy with much interest the reading of the Manifesto. It contains some excellent articles, full of meaning and instruction to those in and out of our order. I was particularly interested in the article written by Eldress Anna White in the January number, and also in the article written by Elder Henry. I would not be without the Manifesto if we had to part with some of our earthly comforts which we now enjoy, and have had this same mind from the beginning, and hope we may be blessed to continue it for many years. With kindest wishes, Your Sister, Caroline Whitcher. Margarette Davis, My Gospel Sister;--Your kind and loving letter... Mount Lebanon, N. Y., Dec. 1890. Margarette Davis, My Gospel, Sistek ;�Your kind and loving letter of the 23rd ult. is received. It came just in time to enhance the pleasure of social and spiritual union which we all have a privilege to enjoy on Thanksgiving Day. Thank you for the timely gift. As it lay before me I thought I would like to reply in a communication of the thoughts that were then occvipying my mind, but time did not permit, however, I can do so now hoping I shall not intrude upon your busy moments. The main point in view is concerning this very day, (Thanksgiving Day) the inauguration of which was prompted by a worthy and religious sentiment but which appointment was dictated and controlled by civil power from the beginning. It was a God-in-the-Constitution power that was exercised; the same element from which so many in the early days sought to escape when they fled from their native countries, but which they unconsciously brought with them and planted in a new land. As you well know, Thanksgiving Day is chiefly an American institution. After the first harvest of the New England colonists in the year 1621, Governor Bradford made provision for their rejoicing specially together with praise and prayer. In 1623 a day of fasting and prayer in the midst of drought was changed into thanksgiving by the coming of rain during the prayers; gradually the custom prevailed of appointing such a day annually after harvest by proclamation of the governors of the several New England states, which though a good thing savored of usurpation. During the Revolution a day of national thanksgiving was annually recommended by Congress, the question is, to whom did their offerings ascend? Was it to the Jewish God of war? or Was it to the Christian God of love and peace? Surely, the true God of those noble men who made us sons and daughters of liberty, could not approve of battle and bloodshed, though He may have judged well of the intents of their hearts. Washington recommended such a day after the adoption of the constitution, an act of direct disobedience in the face of the great American charter Avhich in every point was intended to- enfranchise the conscience as well as the state of a new and prospering people. He did well in his day and time, but, as a civil officer had no right to dictate in religious affairs and on that account we do not feel to cast the least shadow upon his memory, for to him and his infidel cotemporaries do we owe our existence as Shaker Communities. I have never known that there were any penalties or punishments put upon those who did not comply, and all have had the freedom of assembling in their various places of worship as the different sects were wont to do. Some x'eople excuse and license the matter by saying that it is only a recommendation, but when it goes forth from the executive mansion phrased in the following manner: 'By the power invested in me, I do hereby appoint or designate Thursday' etc., it sounds very much like a command. Only since Lincoln's time has it become a fixed custom all over the country. Modern thought and agitation might correct the matter only for the predominence of Ro- man Catholic power which seeks to rule; lnxt they to whom the nature of such evils has| been revealed, work ardently if by any means the right may finally prevail. Another point in relation to this subject is this: instead of its being a day of praise, thanksgiving and beneficence as was at first intended, it has been turned into a day of physical feasting; and for some time previous there are preparations made, not for devotion to the Giver of all our blessings, but for gluttonous and riotous living, and instead of giving to the poor, much substance is wasted in the payment of doctor's bills consequent upon indiscretion in this direction; very much like Christmas celebrations which in their extravagance and alimentive gratification, teach very little of the birth and life of Jesus which they intend to commemorate, and impress the mind very little with the spirit and baptism of Christ. Whatever the church may do, it does not balance or hold in control the animal appetite. Festival enjoyments have become a custom of the ages, but to eat and drink to excess is a very crude expression of a moral sentiment. You refer to the gauzy mantle of snow barely covering the ground, that same Sabbath in this place it was solid drapery, eight inches thick, and beautiful beyond description. We had a little girl here at one time, four years of age, who went to the window soon after a gentle and delightful snow-storm and observing a lilac shrub, she turned to me and exclaimed: 'A splendid raisin pudding! don't you know?' It was a perfect and pretty comparison. I remember when I was a little girl and wondered where the snow came from, how they told me it was the old woman shaking her feather beds. I did not believe it because I thought they could not afford such a waste of feathers, even in heaven. It always seemed to me to be more proper to teach a child the simple truth as far as wisdom approved, and the child was capable of understanding it; thus save time and expense of eradicating false ideas in after years, no matter how poetical or pleasing they may have been to the childish fancy. I thank you for the cold proof love you sent me. I suppose it has in its formula the same combinations that the 'preventive ounce' has. I have faith in it and believe it will far surpass in effect all the pounds of cure that were ever weighed or measured. I believe in mind over matter, and in rising above physical ailments, but I find, too often, that in the contest between the two, mind becomes subservient to matter. The following is what we find in an exchange attributed to Dr. Lyman Abbott of Brooklyn concerning 'Faith Cure:' 'When I get sick I will show my faith in God by securing the best doctor I can find, getting the best human skill, and following the directions given me by a good physician. Faith does not consist in refusing to take medicine, but it is the using of all the means of cure which is given us to use, and medicine has been shown to be one of those means.' I positively disagree with him, I have little or no confidence in any of the medical systems, save Hygiene, plenty of water, bathing, pure air and simple diet. This is the right plan for preserving health or curing disease. Faith joined to good works and good sense will prove the greatest benefit. Yea, my loving companion, let us pray together and in each other's behalf, that we may form two bright links in the golden chain that will connect us with the heavens. Let us be true and keep the faith once delivered to the saints. Please accept the love of the Sisters for yourself and family, and many wishes for a Happy New Year. Your Sister, Lucy S. Bowers.
