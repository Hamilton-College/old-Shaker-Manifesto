Margarette Davis, My Gospel Sister;--Your kind and loving letter... Mount Lebanon, N. Y., Dec. 1890. Margarette Davis, My Gospel, Sistek ;ï¿½Your kind and loving letter of the 23rd ult. is received. It came just in time to enhance the pleasure of social and spiritual union which we all have a privilege to enjoy on Thanksgiving Day. Thank you for the timely gift. As it lay before me I thought I would like to reply in a communication of the thoughts that were then occvipying my mind, but time did not permit, however, I can do so now hoping I shall not intrude upon your busy moments. The main point in view is concerning this very day, (Thanksgiving Day) the inauguration of which was prompted by a worthy and religious sentiment but which appointment was dictated and controlled by civil power from the beginning. It was a God-in-the-Constitution power that was exercised; the same element from which so many in the early days sought to escape when they fled from their native countries, but which they unconsciously brought with them and planted in a new land. As you well know, Thanksgiving Day is chiefly an American institution. After the first harvest of the New England colonists in the year 1621, Governor Bradford made provision for their rejoicing specially together with praise and prayer. In 1623 a day of fasting and prayer in the midst of drought was changed into thanksgiving by the coming of rain during the prayers; gradually the custom prevailed of appointing such a day annually after harvest by proclamation of the governors of the several New England states, which though a good thing savored of usurpation. During the Revolution a day of national thanksgiving was annually recommended by Congress, the question is, to whom did their offerings ascend? Was it to the Jewish God of war? or Was it to the Christian God of love and peace? Surely, the true God of those noble men who made us sons and daughters of liberty, could not approve of battle and bloodshed, though He may have judged well of the intents of their hearts. Washington recommended such a day after the adoption of the constitution, an act of direct disobedience in the face of the great American charter Avhich in every point was intended to- enfranchise the conscience as well as the state of a new and prospering people. He did well in his day and time, but, as a civil officer had no right to dictate in religious affairs and on that account we do not feel to cast the least shadow upon his memory, for to him and his infidel cotemporaries do we owe our existence as Shaker Communities. I have never known that there were any penalties or punishments put upon those who did not comply, and all have had the freedom of assembling in their various places of worship as the different sects were wont to do. Some x'eople excuse and license the matter by saying that it is only a recommendation, but when it goes forth from the executive mansion phrased in the following manner: 'By the power invested in me, I do hereby appoint or designate Thursday' etc., it sounds very much like a command. Only since Lincoln's time has it become a fixed custom all over the country. Modern thought and agitation might correct the matter only for the predominence of Ro- man Catholic power which seeks to rule; lnxt they to whom the nature of such evils has| been revealed, work ardently if by any means the right may finally prevail. Another point in relation to this subject is this: instead of its being a day of praise, thanksgiving and beneficence as was at first intended, it has been turned into a day of physical feasting; and for some time previous there are preparations made, not for devotion to the Giver of all our blessings, but for gluttonous and riotous living, and instead of giving to the poor, much substance is wasted in the payment of doctor's bills consequent upon indiscretion in this direction; very much like Christmas celebrations which in their extravagance and alimentive gratification, teach very little of the birth and life of Jesus which they intend to commemorate, and impress the mind very little with the spirit and baptism of Christ. Whatever the church may do, it does not balance or hold in control the animal appetite. Festival enjoyments have become a custom of the ages, but to eat and drink to excess is a very crude expression of a moral sentiment. You refer to the gauzy mantle of snow barely covering the ground, that same Sabbath in this place it was solid drapery, eight inches thick, and beautiful beyond description. We had a little girl here at one time, four years of age, who went to the window soon after a gentle and delightful snow-storm and observing a lilac shrub, she turned to me and exclaimed: 'A splendid raisin pudding! don't you know?' It was a perfect and pretty comparison. I remember when I was a little girl and wondered where the snow came from, how they told me it was the old woman shaking her feather beds. I did not believe it because I thought they could not afford such a waste of feathers, even in heaven. It always seemed to me to be more proper to teach a child the simple truth as far as wisdom approved, and the child was capable of understanding it; thus save time and expense of eradicating false ideas in after years, no matter how poetical or pleasing they may have been to the childish fancy. I thank you for the cold proof love you sent me. I suppose it has in its formula the same combinations that the 'preventive ounce' has. I have faith in it and believe it will far surpass in effect all the pounds of cure that were ever weighed or measured. I believe in mind over matter, and in rising above physical ailments, but I find, too often, that in the contest between the two, mind becomes subservient to matter. The following is what we find in an exchange attributed to Dr. Lyman Abbott of Brooklyn concerning 'Faith Cure:' 'When I get sick I will show my faith in God by securing the best doctor I can find, getting the best human skill, and following the directions given me by a good physician. Faith does not consist in refusing to take medicine, but it is the using of all the means of cure which is given us to use, and medicine has been shown to be one of those means.' I positively disagree with him, I have little or no confidence in any of the medical systems, save Hygiene, plenty of water, bathing, pure air and simple diet. This is the right plan for preserving health or curing disease. Faith joined to good works and good sense will prove the greatest benefit. Yea, my loving companion, let us pray together and in each other's behalf, that we may form two bright links in the golden chain that will connect us with the heavens. Let us be true and keep the faith once delivered to the saints. Please accept the love of the Sisters for yourself and family, and many wishes for a Happy New Year. Your Sister, Lucy S. Bowers.
