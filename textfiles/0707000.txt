The Lord's Prayer WATSON ANDREWS A very popular preacher has said : ' No man can conscientiously pray that prayer.' ;' Thy kingdom come? Thy will be done on earth as in heaven?' ' No man can pray it; it goes crashing through a man's world of self-love, like a hundred-pound shell through a river steamer ! What; the will of God done on earth, as it is by the angels of heaven ! They ' neither marry nor are given in marriage.' They have no banks, no deeds, no mortgages, no money ; millionaires, paupers, nor fashion plates ! ' The above preacher seems not to have been aware that this prayer has been grantedâ€”by power being given to men and women to overcome the same world which Jesus overcame ! All carnal, unspiritual desires, and their gratification, are possibly overcome ; all sources of happiness, that aspire to make the physical senses superior to the spiritual, are capable of being dethroned. Those things that 'perish with the using' are far from being eternal. We ask those who are interested in eternal life, to read of Jesus, and study Shakerism. The prayer is accomplished. N. Union, O.
