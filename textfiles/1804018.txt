Editorial. ADVANCEMENT. Why should it seem strange to the Biblical student that a class of people should contend earnestly for a life of righteousness, and for the kingdom of God, which was the great mission of Christ to his disciples, and why thought strange that they should at the same time work as carefully for the health of the body. The divine approval of the work of Creation, and in particular after the creation of man, should not be lost from sight, as it was '�'�very good.' If man had been as careful to keep to the standard as at first manifested, as he was active at a later date to ' seek out many inventions' perhaps he might have been a much better representative of the gift of God than he now is. For a long period of time the best interests of both body and soul were sadly neglected, and an animal existence, in common with other classes in creation, was the only absorbing object in life. This 'very good,' as Adam the son of God was said to be, at the time when he appeared in Eden, must have become singularly transformed to very had when he became a wanderer in the world and descended to the level of an omniverous animal. Since that date many changes have occurred. Some races have gradually arisen to a more civilized state and to better moral conditions, while others have scarcely passed above the plane of the animal creation. It is anything but pleasant to bear witness of the life which man has sometimes led. Blest as he is, by the goodness of God, with the ability to become an angel, while on the earth, and to establish a home wherein should dwell righteousness and peace, it quite too often happens that he is only able to govern by force of arms, and by crude dominating passions. The march for the race, however, is onward and upward, and probably will be till all the kingdoms of this world 'become the kingdoms of our Lord,' and until peace on earth and good-will to all men and women, is permanently established in the heart. Quite early in the history of the race, societies for reformation were formed. Man could plead his case before a judge and justice was awarded to him. A better system of religious worship was established, and the subject of dietetics was brought forward. The 'very good' began to assert itself and those who had been buried more or less under an accumulation of violence, evil imaginations and lust, began to experience the power of a resurrection, which enabled them to look up and anticipate better things. Enoch, it is said, walked with God ; Noah was perfect in his observance of law, and Abraham instituted a radical change in the articles to be used for food. This work of reformation has been and is still going on. The world is growing better, and contending for a higher form of existence. Even by a careful analysis of facts, it will readily be seen that some very marked changes for the better have taken place, in every department of life, since the beginning of the present century. Wars and rumors of wars, and deeds of violence may follow in the path of the undisciplined man, as the legitimate fruits of the life he leads, but better classes are coming forward and establishing higher degrees of moral influences. The language, the habits, the inspiration of the mind, the dress, the food are all brought to the front, and judgment passed as having reference to the health and to the moral tone of society. Nothing can escape the investigation of the age. Every order must pass through this ordeal and whether religious or non-religious they will be judged by the advanced light of today. But should we return to an earlier age when '�every imagination of the heart was evil continually,' when violence filled the earth, and when the diet of man consisted of 'every moving thing that liveth,' we might well be astonished at the great change ! Religious people cannot exercise too much care in regard to the language they speak, and to the food they eat. The direct sympathy of the soul and body with each other, shows plainly the necessity of caring for them as a creative blessing from God's hand. Paul says,�'Ye are the temple of the living God.' What defiles the one may in corresponding measure defile the other, and it would be difficult to become spiritually minded unless the whole man is disciplined to observe the laws of God, that govern the health of the body, aud the laws of morality that lead toward righteousness, and on to God.
