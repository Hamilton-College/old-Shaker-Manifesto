JOHN POMEROY ROOT We copy the following tribute to a noble man from The Cleveland Herald : John Pomeroy Root was born in Pittsfield, Mass., June 28th, 1799. He was one of the early settlers of Grafton, Lorain county, O He was, by profession, a Methodist classleader, and served in this capacity with marked zeal. On the loth of March, 1825, he united with the Shakers in Warrensville, and became an active member of that community. His experience in pioneer life, and his avoidance of marriage while a Methodist, seemed to prepare him peculiarly to become a Shaker. He was soon appointed farm-deacon, and filled that place for about three years. When the church was organized he was appointed one of the trustees. In 1838 he was appointed first elder in the center family, and in 1858 became first in the ministry. In 1862 he was again appointed first elder. In all these capacities he served with a fidelity which won for him universal esteem. He abounded in good works. In the midst of all his official duties he found much time for the discharge of those gentler acts of kindness which so adorn a noble manhood. His death occurring on Friday, August 5th, was the consummation of a long, well-spent, and fruitful life. The Shaker community of North Union will not soon forget the eloquent example of this life of fifty-six years spent in consecration to their faith, and the service of mankind.
