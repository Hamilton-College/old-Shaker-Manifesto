TRUST IN GOD AND DO THE RIGHT Courage, brother! do not stumble, Though thy path is dark as night, There's a star to guide the humble : Trust in God and do the right. Let the road be long and dreary, And its ending out of sight, Foot it bravely, strong or weary : Trust in God and do the right. Perish policy and cunning, Perish all that fears the light Whether losing, whether winning : Trust in God and do the right. Trust no forms of guilty passion, Fiends that look like angels bright, Trust no custom, school or fashion : Trust in God and do the right. Some will hate thee, some will love thee, Some will natter, some will slight; Cease from man and look above thee : Trust in God and do the right. Simple rule and safest guiding, Inward peace and inward light, Star upon our path abiding : Trust in God and do the right. The Catholic.
