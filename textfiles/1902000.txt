A LETTER FROM ELDER FREDERIC. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., July, 1888. Elsie York and Jessie Evans. Beloved Gospel Sisters :�Your joint letter of the 17th. ult. came as a welcome memento of friendship from my dear Gospel friends in Canterbury. I may as well acknowledge that I have a latent desire to visit Canterbury once more, before I go hence. I want to come as a simple visitor, just to exchange kind greetings and gather union as a precious treasure to carry with me into the Church in the Spirit world. In all the visits�excepting one to Watervliet when quite a young Believer�that I have ever made to any Society heretofore, it has been as a preacher, a theologian, an expounder of doctrine to the world, in public meetings &amp;c. I was much burdened, and brought much burden to others. That phase has passed, for better or for worse. I acted my part. Now, I am putting off ihe harness, and coming down gradually� 'gracefully,' may be�to my individual selfhood. Like a tree-roosting turkey, at the close of the day, looking upwards, stretching its neck and measuring the distant height, until confidence is gained that it can accomplish the upward flight to its resting place, where neither ''the little foxes' nor the big foxes can reach it�so am I looking upwards, thinking and fluttering my spirit wings, awaiting the decisive moment to rise from earth and all its scenes, to my home in the spirit world. I do not run as uncertain nor go beating the air with my spirit wings aimlessly, but I feel as sweet an assurance of being met by kind, loving friends in the world to come, as I do that I shall be thus met when I make my last earthly visit to Canterbury. I also realize that, in both cases, I shall be an object of charity, dependent upon kind friends who feel that it is more blessed to give than it is to receive and that the less, the recipient, is of the 'better blessed.' To begin with, I am deaf! Do you know what that implies, what it means to be in meeting and see that your Brethren and Sisters are speaking and not hear what they say? To be hungry, siltiug at a table loaded with good things, of which all but yourself are freely partaking, and enjoying the social union from which you are shut out? In a word, I am dying of simple old age. Yet I am joying too, rejoicing in the race I have run. Was not that what I was born for, to grow old and go to my rest in other spheres? And to go to my work in the world that is above this world, as manhood and womanhood are above childhood? '1 have fought the good fight'�the battle of life, and accept the result cheerfully, joyfully and thankfully. Truly, have not 'the lines fallen to me in pleasant places,' as compared with thousands, yea, millions of my fellow human beings, who bad as much right to life, and to life as a blessing, as I had? So I am glad of all the days I have lived upon earth, and like a ripe apple, am ready and willing to drop into the hands of the Orchardist. Upon reading this effusion, you will exclaim 'Well! sure enough, Elder Frederic has become a querulous old man, but still, T wish he would come, for we should like to see him as a humanitarian curiosity.' Why not? All phases of liumau life are of interest to the Christian scientist and philosopher�the Believer. Jesus noticed natural children, as he did the lilies, and he loved them for their primitive though negative innocence. Vv hy should not Second Appearing Disciples be interested in the second childhood of those who have spent their lives in the Resurrection Order of which Jesus and his disciples could only prophesy. They have been working out a salvation that gives them a positive innocpnce of which the innocence of childhood is a beautiful type or symbol. Having suffered in the flesh, by ceasiug from sin, they are raised in thp likeness of Him who said, '1 am the resurrection.' 'Other sheep have I also that are not of this fold,' Jesus said; may it not be so at the present time? Are not the fields white unto the harvest? The last of the seven vials has been 'poured out into the air, causing voices, lightnings, thunderings and earthquakes, so great and mighty that the like has never occurred before since men were upon the earth.' The American Revolution was but the beginning of those earthquakes now convulsing the nations. The lower strata of humanity�the great mass�who have been governed by fear and pressed down by the despotic monarchies and aristocracies and by the capitalists and p'iesthoods, are being educated, beginning to think and to reason, causing a general upheaval. Capital and labor are contending for their 'rights,' but do not know what they are ! They will learn by and by. Between the axiom, 'The king can do no wrong' and 'the sovereign people' possessing 'inalienable rights,' there is a great gulf that is being bridged by education. The people are cursing their gods and priests and the governments which 'bear rule by their means' and are looking upwards, whence the light proceeds that is enlightening the earth. At present, all is war; anon, it will be peace. Sister Elsie speaks of 'articles' I have written, and mentions ' Cruelty to Birds.' That has been much copied. When I wrote it, 'The Sun' published it in New York ; then it appeared in the Albany, Hudson, Pittsfield and Boston papers. Being in New York a week or two since, 1 did not see the 'dead birds' on a single person. I suppose that article happened to come just as the fashion was changing, Sister Jessie sends love and blessing ; that it is appreciated, she may rest assured. I shall be pleased to see and wish I could hear, all the company of whom she speaks. It will not be my fault if I do not make at least 'the informal call' she suggests. With kindest love of our order to yourselves and as far as it will go before it is all spent, Your Brother, F. W. Evans.
