SUTTON - a subordinate on a railway train ' The conductor, ' ' sent him to the rear to flag another train coming up behind. On his way he fell on the track, and was run over by five cars and the caboose. His legs were completely cut off above the knee, but, remembering his orders, he cleared the track of the dismembered portions of his own body, and taking a flag out of his pocket, waved it until he had stopped the approaching train. Without this, a collision would have been inevitable.'
