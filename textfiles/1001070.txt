A NEW WEATHER THEORY The Eev. Henry Roe, P. R. A. S. (England), sends to the London Times a new theory of the weather. He claims to have determined by careful observations, covering nearly thirty years, that dry and wet periods succeed one another in alternate waves of nearly equal length. Not that this quality of duration is quite absolute, or that the wave of one period is exactly the same fac simile as that of a corresponding period at an earlier or a later time; but there is enough of regularity and uniformity about the waves to make the family likeness clearly discernible to any eye that looks for it. These periods extend over three whole years for each, and the following simple rules will enable any one to work out the several cycles of years for himself: 1. When the number representing any given year is even and exactly divisible by three, that year is the middle one of three cold and wet summers. 2. When the number representing the year is odd and divisible by three, then that year is the middle one of a triad of dry and hot summers. After testing by these rules the successive seasons of the past twenty-seven years, and finding fact to conform to theory, Mr. Roe predicts that 1881 will be the middle one in a triad of hot and dry summers. What relations these dry and wet periods have (if any) to the recognized cycles of sun spots, he has not made out; nor does an examination of recent seasons confirm the alleged harmony of theory with fact.
