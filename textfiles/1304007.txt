WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO. GUARD WELL THY HEART. By H. G. B. Guard well thy heart in youth's bright sunny hour, When sin's tempt atious come with force and power, And fain would load thee from the path of right, And blast thy prospects now so clear and bright. Guard well thy heart, and let not pleasure's charm Ensnare thy soul and lead thee on to harm; But seek the guidance of that Spirit pure Which leads to Him whose promises are sure. Guard well thy heart whene'er the Cros.4 appears, And be not influenced by groundless fears, But take it up and bear it meekly on, Over that path that many a saint hath gone. Guard well thy heart, and ne'er forsake the way That leads to peace, and never-ending day, Seek not for rest while o'er earth's path you run; True rest awaits you when your work is done. Guard well thy heart in every hour of life; Trust thou in God through all thine earthly strife; Let love impel thee in that glorious way, That leads to God and ends in nightless day. Shirley, Mass.
