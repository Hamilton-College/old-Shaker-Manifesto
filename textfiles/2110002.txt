HAVE FAITH. Lars Erickson. Watch for false prophets. They are all deceitful. It is only one faith that bringeth forth good fruit unto righteousness, and that is the blessed faith of Jesus Christ. No man can take that faith except it be given from the Father. True faith is founded on Christ only. He is the gift of God given to mankind. In him is hidden all treasure that is needed for man's redemption. The first thing that faith bringeth forth is life; next is light; next is righteousness and then full redemption. This faith never was known to fail in love from man to his fellowman. Many profess to have faith but fail to love God, and therefore they are false and the truth is not in them. They refuse Christ and have no love to their neighbor, therefore Jesus gave us this sign, 'By their fruits ye shall know them.' Pleasant Hill, Ky.
