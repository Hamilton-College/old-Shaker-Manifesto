Correspondence. Beloved Elder Henry;--The following... Beloved Elder Henrst;The following is a copy of an ancient document written sixty-four years ago, found among the writings of Elder F. W. Evans and addressed to his natural brother Geo. H. Evans, the great land reformer. I send it to you in hopes of seeing it in another shape later on, being confident that if published in our monthly it will be read by numerous friends of Elder Frederic, with much interest. In those days it cost something to send a letter weighing less than half an ounce, by mail. Twelve and a half cents is written with ink on the outside of the letter, as being the price that was paid for transportation. Now, we should stop and think, twice, before sending a letter costing that much to New York City. This was worth it then and did good; and if you consider the letter worth the printing, it surely is worth the reading. A. W.
