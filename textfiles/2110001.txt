THE SHAKERS AND THE CAUSE OF PEACE. Alfred Love, President of the Universal Peace Union, Speaks at Mount Lebanon. On Sunday, Aug. 23rd., at the usual Society meeting of the Shakers, held at the church in Mount Lebanon, N. Y., a number of visitors were present. Daniel Boler, first Elder of the Ministry, opened the meeting. After singing and other exercises, Elder Frederic W. Evans delivered a short sermon, taking for his text, Heb. ix., 28: 'Unto them that look for Christ, shall he appear a second time without sin, unto salvation.' He first sketched the history of the primitive church, with its cardinal doctrines. Jesus had preached and carried out with his disciples, community of goods. Another doctrine was that of a celibate virgin life; and his disciples were to take up the cross and follow him. And not the least of these great principles was non-resistance ; they were to be peaceable, and to take no part in war. Elder Frederic alluded to the persecutions of the early Christians and the 'two witnesses' down to the Quaker order, who were, he said, the most prominent of all the witnesses for truth. Then, in 1770, the Christ spirit appeared a second time on earth, to a woman named Ann Lee, revealed the Fatherhood and Motherhood of God, and taught that human beings must confess and repent of their sins, and work out their own salvation. That was the testimony of Mother Ann, who gathered round her a chosen band of faithful witnesses. That church has stood for over a hundred years. After alluding to the remarkable (and thus far accurate) prophecy uttered in 1803, by Joseph Hoag, a Quaker, he went on to show that the foundation of the redemption of humanity is laid on this earth, and that it will never be overthrown. That is where we stand today. There are many noble-hearted men and women in the Shaker Societies true as steel to the testimony, who have consecrated themselves to help to actualize true Christianity upon this earth. The Believers had with them that day a messenger of God, a man who had dedicated himself to the cause of, humanity, to abolish war from the nations ; he was the representative of earnest men and women corresponding with him from various parts of the world, so that a nucleus of power was now arising in Philadelphia, which was 'judging the nations.' He thanked God for such an organization, and for their faithful representative. * After some remarks from Elder Calvin Reed, Sisters,/Martha J. Anderson, Catharine Allen and a few other Brethren and Sisters, Br. Daniel Offord introduced to the meeting, as an 'apostle of peace/' the above-named messenger, Alfred H. Love, who delivered an address in substance as follows :ï¿½'What were they that their eyes those glories saw, and their ears heard the sound?' Which was the pew and which the pulpit, which was the spiritual and which the material? It was 'Communion day' with them ; not the communion day that they had in his neighborhood at Philadelphia, at one of their largest churches, where it was an outward communion, but a communion of soul-feeling and of spirit : and in the same manner he might liken it to their baptismal day, their dedication day and their consecration day ; because he felt that good people had all these good things at all times, without the calendar and without fixing a date. Reared as a Friend or Quaker, he was there not as a member of any religious sect outwardly, but as a member of all religious denominations in spirit, for his sympathies were with the good of every denomination. He had filled the pulpits of Universalists, Presbyterians and others; and why? Because there was a membership outside of the formality of a creed ; and in that spirit he was among them that day. Last evening, picking up a Bible before retiring, as was his wont, he opened it at that beautiful chapter of John containing the words, 'Wilt thou be made whole ?' The sick man thus addressed, after complying with the conditions, was healed, and he rose and walked; and it was the Sabbath day. So he retired with that upon his mind, and he thought, 'How fitting to be in the Shaker Community, and to reflect with the sick man of old, 'Can I be made whole?' No wonder that he had a good night's rest, and that he came with a cup overflowing with love and sympathetic regard for them. No wonder, too, that we should feel encouragement in traveling about in the world and seeing so much good that can be found there, if it can only be brought out of its recesses and utilized. In thirty-five years of traveling through the prisons, he met with a. great many who had lost their way, and wrhen he got to the secret recesses of their hearts, he found that they did not really wish to be bad ; they had missed their way; there was weakness and they needed strength. After conversing with them thus, he frequently induced them to make promises of reformation. By reasoning with them, one after another had been reformed ; and peace was produced in that direction. So it was in other matters. He had always been a peace man; it wras as natural to him as to take the air into his lungs. He could not but see that a peaceful condition was best for us all; the amiable and affectionate feelings of the heart, and all the facilities for being at peace would not have been given to us, were it not intended that we should be at peace. Therefore, when he met with a general or other military officer, he declined to call him by his title ; this was the case when he met General Gregory ; he saluted him thus: 'Friend Gregory, how dost thou?' The lieutenant prompted him aside, to 'call him general;' but he said,' I do not want to call any one by a name which signifies a man-killer, or one skilled in destroying human beings.' 'Then take my hand,' said the chief; ' 'I wish there was no war and no generals.' ' 'Well then, begin now ; throw off thy epaulets, and cast away thy title.' At a future time, 'the sword shall be beaten into a ploughshare and the spear into a pruninghook :' but the 'beating' has to be done; begin now, and there will be a prospect of their being transformed. At the Philadelphia Centennial, they held a meeting in old Carpenter's Hall to promulgate their testimony for peace. Mary Thorne, a Friend, had been delegated to have an emblem of peace suspended over his, (the speaker's) head as president, a dove with outspread wings ; but her humane feelings dissuaded her from having a bird killed and stuffed for the purpose; 'Thee can get along without any emblem over thy head.' But the speaker related how a friend from California arrived with a live, white dove in a basket, which he opened. The beautiful creature flew thrice round their hall, then out of the window, circled thrice round old Independence Hall; returned into their place of assembly, and perched upon the statue of Jefferson during the meeting. Three swords were brought to them, from Ireland, from Pennsylvania and from another state ; then Clayton Rogers said, 'I am a manufacturer, and will turn them into a plough and pruning-hooks.' These agricultural implements with so significant an origin, were sent to the Paris Exposition; from thence they were presented to Switzerland, and now, bearing an inscription, they are located in the Hall at Geneva where the arbitration took place between Great Britain and the United States. These little incidents he related to indicate how the work is going forward. They would be interested to know that not only did the British Government have to concede what the Quakers asked; but our own American Government had to concede the principle of non-resistance as applied to war. During the War of the Rebellion, a number of Friends were drafted and carried into the ranks ; but the general had to report, ' 'We cannot do anything with these men.' The governor expected them 'to change such foolish notions.' He (the speaker) positively refused to serve. His father and another man each offered to pay his three hundred dollars for him. A colored man said, 'You are a good anti-slavery man; I will go and serve for you as a substitute.' 'I cannot take you, my brother.' 'Then I will go out and get a white man instead.'' 'I cannot take a human being to be my agent; the agent is as bad as the principal.' A doctor said, 'Shall I put in 'Physical disability?' 'No, I am stout, strong, able to do military service.' 'You have spectacles; are you only carrying those to avoid the draft?' Another doctor examined his eyes, and said, 'We give you three days grace : come back, and we will see what we can do for you.' But of course he gave no promise to return, and the next thing that transpired was, he was brought back and told, 'It will kill your mother to hear that you will be punished as a deserter.' 'No, my mother is made of a better material than that, if her son is standing by a principle.' 'Well, what must be done with this man ?' 'He must be shot.' 'I am ready in five minutes' time.' But, ultimately, they gave him his exemption papers. Abraham Lincoln had said, 'Do not hurt those people ; they are my best citizens.' Stanton said, 'My grandfather was a Quaker, and I know they will not budge an inch from their point.' An act was passed through Congress, releasing the Quakers and Shakers from military service; also providing that the duty should devolve upon them of taking care of sick and wounded soldiers. So we got that enactment into the constitution of the United States. This resistance to compulsory military service was in the old spirit of William Penn, and upon that they stood. 'No human authority can interfere with the rules of conscience :' that is on the statute books of Pennsylvania ; and no human authority could take that away ; for it was in their bill of rights. Upon the Behring Sea difficulty, the Peace Union addressed both Salisbury and Blaine to this effect: 'Friends, do not interfere with the peace between the mother country and this country ; but arbitrate your difficulty, and see if you cannot settle it in that way.' Blaine wrote to Salisbury in the spirit that they wished ; and now the matter is in course of settlement. When Venezuela was threatened by the British with a war, the Universal Peace Union sent their representative Stollmeyer to negotiate with both countries : and at length a letter came from Salisbury, that if it was thought that the English were taking an inch of the territory, it should be left to the United States to decide; and that imbroglio, too, was in course of adjustment. We had done wondrously in science and art: but there remained other worlds to conquer ; the spirituality of our being was to be developed, and we had to diffuse the universal love of God and man. This was not an impossible task ; for the Creator did not leave us without the means to realize our conceptions. The ideal in this Community could be attained. There would not be a God of all goodness and of omnipotence, if he could give us a conception of a higher condition, and then tie our hands and leave us powerless to do the work. 'Righteousness and peace have kissed each other,' exclaimed the psalmist. The great poet had said, 'Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace.' If you go forth with a weapon, it causes a weapon tobe used in return; while, on the contrary, the open and friendly hand attracts ; it signifies welcome ; the open hand is peace. They would continue working zealously for the cause of peace, looking upwards to the God of peace for aid in their endeavors, and they would reverently say to him, 'O Lord! Forgive us, if too close we lean Our human hearts on Thee!'
