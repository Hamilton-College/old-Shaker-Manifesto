WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO. IS IT WORTH IT ALL? Life is not without its shadows, Smiles are not without their tears, And the one who mounts to glory Climbeth up through patient years. Tender are the threads, and tangled, In the warp and woof of heart, But the best of webs are woven From the many mingled parts. Ours is such a strange existence Such a chance of joy or woe, But small wonder that we ponder That we question, Why 'tis so? But small wonder that the query From the lips should sometimes fall THE MANIFESTO. 83 'What will all the gain amount to? Is the profit worth it all ?' Fate's and Fortune's wheels keep turning And whichever one controls Makes small matter in the final Summing up of human souls. Circumstance may lend a trifle, And surroundings form a part; But condition is the sought for By the fingers of the heart. We may fret awhile and worry Over ills we might well cure, And we learn in time with patience, Those we cannot, to endure. Could we see the sum in total, Cipher at a glance, the whole, We would count the cost more kindly Of this commerce of the soul. Younger scholars must remember Page by page, to con the book, Learn to take on trust and credit, Forward, more than backward, look. Learn that life is worth the living, Golden hours are not all past, God, in writing out His poem Leaves a sweet verse for the last.
