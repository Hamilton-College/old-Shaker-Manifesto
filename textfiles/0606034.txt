A CHARACTERISTIC LETTER Beloved Editor: I am too late with the article I did not write for June; but do not think it any want of interest in you. I am very busy; besides, as the tamed and trained buffalo has a tendency to relapse to its original condition, why should it not be so with me ? I was brought up on a farm, hate books. Agriculture is natural with me, learning is acquired; I soon relapse into my native ignorance. It is a task to tax my mentality, to study philosophy and the laws of rhetoric. I love to be in the garden, on the farm, in the apple trees. 'Music hath charms to soothe a savage ; ' it may split a rock, or rend a cabbage ; these will stay split or rent, but the savage wont stay soothed. I love the music of spring. What is the republic of letters, to the republic of nature ! I talk with the trees; I hear what the grass says; the water is eloquent, and the whole earth meditative. The jumble of ideas, the gabble of words, that so perplex the literary, are unknown to the simple and unlearned. Blessed be nothing, and 'ignorance is bliss ! ' True, when deep sleep falleth upon other people — when sable night has wrapped them in her mantle — I do have some thoughts that ask to be recorded ; and if I do not pen them down then, they are gone, and now you know what becomes of your (my) articles. Then I have a shrewd idea that the less said, the less trials. I live so much in the future, that the present is justly offended with me. I will, however, catch some good ideas, imprison them in a cage of homely words, and you may use them as you think is for the good of souls. Who knows but the discipline of my rough speech, may be for the health of some unprogressive member of the household of faith ! Love to you ever. Mt. Lebanon, May 10. F. W. Evans
