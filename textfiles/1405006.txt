THE CHASTENING ROD. MARION JOHNSON. I cry to Thee, my God, In hours of trial, that thy strength may be Made perfect in my weakness ; that thy word An anchor sure may be. Thou chastenest, but in love, Thine erring children, drawing them to Thee, That through the rod they may ascend above All earthly vanity. Baptized with sorrow deep, The spirit puts new life and vigor on; Though for a time it may in darkness weep, Joy cometh with the morn. Believing in thy word I would press on, and run the Christian race; Though rough and dark and thorny be the road 'Tis lighted by thy face. Inspire with zeal divine, The path of life to walk with purpose high; Not my own will to seek, but ever thine And on thy strength rely. No flowery path I ask, [spread With worldly honors, fame and wealth o'erIf in the sunlight of thy peace I bask, The lowly path I'll tread. Canterbury, N. H.
