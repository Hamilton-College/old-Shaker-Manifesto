By thy words thou... ' By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. Matt, xii., 37This text shows us the necessity of guarding our words. We should guard equally as well our actions and motives. Words, we know, are the expression of the thoughts and feelings of the mind; and if by these we are to be justified how many should be the truthful, honest words; if by these we are to be condemned how few should be the hasty or unkind words that fall from our lips. If we regard more carefully the maxim ' think twice before you speak' we should be less apt to wound the feelings of others by unkind, unjust words. We cannot recall the words once spoken though we may in a measure atone for the harm they have done. Let us who are young remember the lesson that this text teaches, to guard our lips from speaking words that would cause harm in the least degree; by so doing our lives and the lives of those around us will be made happy.
