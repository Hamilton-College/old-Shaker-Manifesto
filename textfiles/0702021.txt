The Book of Worship : E. H. S-aintey, 20 Cooper Union, New York. Is a Inelv printed book of hymns and anthems ised by The New Church (Swedenborgian) n their worship. It is very worshipful in sentiment, and wonderfully free from idola:rous sentiments relating to Jesus or any other human being. We observe that many popular hymns have been ingeniously invaded and improved theologically. The impress of music is scarcely anywhere equaled. It is certainly a good, great work. The Annual Register of Rural Affairs : Luther II. Tucker &amp; Son, Albany, N. Y., publishers of The Country Gentleman.

This article is alone worth many times the price of the book, which is only thirty cents.
