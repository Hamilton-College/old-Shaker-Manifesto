Watervliet, O. Feb. 1894. We wish to contribute something for The Manifesto, although not much. We are having some snow, about four inches fell a few days ago. Our winter has been very open admitting of a great deal of work that will help along when spring comes. We are putting up about one hundred and twenty-five rods of picket fence. We also had eleven hundred locust posts cut this fall. Eldress Hester Frost and Sister Harriet Snyder have made a short visit to Union Village, O. We had the company of Br. Lawrence Oscar for a few days from the same Society. We are preparing to put out 1,000 raspberry plants, 500 blackberry and some currants this spring. Health of Society very good for which we feel very thankful. Henry W. Fredrick.
