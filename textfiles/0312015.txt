'IN EVERY THING GIVE THANKS.' At this season of the year, when so many outward blessings are showering from the hand of the good Husbandman, we feel that ' praise is comely ' for all. And to us, who not only have found a Father but an ever-loving Mother, what measureless call for gratitude, that not only now will the strong and vigorous in the spiritual household find support, but the poor and oppressed share of her love and sympathy. Thanks for a Gospel that approximates to justice, and, while it acknowledges the universal brotherhood, is striving to reduce it to living practice ; that knows ' nor high nor low, nor rich nor poor, male nor female, but all one,' etc. ' Exalting the valleys ' by ' bringing the mountains down.' Thanks for a spot on earth where virtue and innocence can be preserved, and rank higher in value than stocks or exchange. Thanks for a home where labor is honored, and consecrated toil and uses are the gauge of honor and respect. Thanks for a love that is pure ; and for 'the hundred-fold' of brothers and sisters, which compensate the forsaking of the natural and earthly. Thanks for the ' banishing to the desert of forgetfulness,' which succeeds the washing in Jordan (the river of Judgment); and for the cheering of spirits from the unseen, and the hopes of re-union in the spirit world. And highest thanks that, for poor suffering humanity, there is such a way of becoming sons and daughters of God, without rebuke. Elizabeth H. Webster, Harvard.
