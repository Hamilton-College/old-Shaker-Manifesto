Girls can't throw Stones .—They often try but fail. Why is it so? Physiology answers the question. The collar bone in the anatomy of a female is several inches longer than that of a male, and is set several degrees lower down. This long, crooked bone interferes with the free and full action of the shoulder, and that's the reason why girl's can't throw stones. So it is ; but they can do some other things, quite as important, and can do them better than the boys ! —Enter-prise.
