DEPENDENCE UPON GOD. I know not what the day may bring Of sorrow or of sweetness ; I only know that God must give Its measure of completeness ; I reach for wisdom in the dark; And God fills up the measure� Sometimes with tears, sometimes with cares Sometimes with peace and pleasure For hours of grief and saddened face True wealth of heart I borrow, And heavenly wisdom oftenest comes Clad in the guise of sorrow; I know not which is best for me Of all his memory bringeth, I know his praises every day My willing spirit t ingitj. I know not what my life may yield Of fruit that will not perish, I know God gives both seed and soil, ind all the growth must cherish; How great His work ! How small my part! I wonder at my weakness, And His great patience fills my heart With gratitude and meekness. I know not what e'en heaven can give To bless souls who gain it; I know God's goodness it must show, For earth cannot contain it. And if eternity but rings With love, the same sweet story That earth is telling every day� 'Thine, Lord, shall be the glory.' Catholic
