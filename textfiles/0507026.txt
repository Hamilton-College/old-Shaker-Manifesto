Scandal. A woman confessed to a priest that she was guilty of circulating a scandal. He gave her a ripe thistle top, and told her to scatter the seeds, one by one, in every direction. She obeyed, and returned after her task was done. He then ordered her to go back and collect the scattered seed. She said it would be impossible. He replied it would be more impossible to gather up and destroy all the evil reports that she had. circulated about others. Blessed are they who walk uprightly and speak truth in their hearts. That back-bite not with their tongues, nor take up a reproach against their neighbors.
