Firm butter without ice Firm Butter Without Ice.—In families where the dairy is small, a good plan to have the butter cool and firm without ice is by the process of evaporation, as practiced in India and other warm countries. A cheap plan is to get a very large-sized, porous, earthen flower-pot, with a large saucer. Half till the saucer with water, set it in a trivet or light stand—such as is used for holding hot irons will do ; upon this set your butter; over the whole invert the fiower-pot, letting the top' rim of it rest in and be covered by the water, then close the hole in the bottom of the flower-pot with a cork; then dash water over the flower-pot, and repeat the process several times a day, or whenever it looks dry. If set in a cool place or where the wind can blow on it, it will readily evaporate the water from the pot, and the butter will be as firm and cool as if from an icehouse.
