Angelic Vedder Angelic Vedder, Dec. 21. at Church Family, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Age 86 yrs, 6 mo. and 13 days. Ah! 'tis the ripened sheaf, death garners now, A mind replete with gains of heavenly worth. Earth's law can measure not the growth of soulj. Its fetters oft may check the action here Of noble feelings, which inspire the heart; But from its clamps set free, the spirit's COUrse By true desire is marked in yonder sphere; Where pain and sickness ne'er our efforts blight. O! 'tis with joy the angels sing this morn And our dear .sister joins' the-strain divine, While swiftly gliding through the realms of space, Possessed of wealth w hlch gains admittence there, Assembled hosts proclaim the Welcome strain : ,V ell done, thou SCHaut true, entcr the joy Prepared for thee. The price is fully paid Which gives thee passport to Eternal.Life That life which finite power can measure not Else would it lose its hold on gems, which fade Like floating clouds before the morning light. Thy soul shall meet response in growing power, To all, thy eager mind would blaim of God. For all that hearts appropriate for use, In our celestial home, is free for all. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
