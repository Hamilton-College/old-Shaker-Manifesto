THE NEW SONG. John G. Whittier. Sound over all waters, reach out from all lands, The chorus of voices, the clasping of hands ; Sing hymns that were sung by the stars of the morn; Sing songs that were sung when Jesus was born ; With glad jubilations Bring hope to the nations. The dark night is ending and dawn has begun ; Rise, hope of the ages, arise like the sun ; All speech flow as music all hearts beat as one. Sing the bridal of nations with chorals of love, Sing out the war vulture and sing in the dove, Till the heart of the people keep time in accord, And the voice of the world is the voice of the Lord. Clasp hands of the nations In strong gratulations, The dark night is ending and dawn has begun ; Rise, hope of the ages, arise like the sun ; All speech flow to music all hearts beat as one. Blow, bugles of battle, the march.e s of peace ; East, West, North and South, let the longquarrel cease; Sing the song of great joy that the angels began ; Sing of glory to God and of good-will to man. Hark ! joining in chorus, The heavens bend o'er us; The dark night is ending and dawn has begun ; Rise, hope of the ages, arise like the sun; All speech flow to music all hearts beat as one. Selected.
