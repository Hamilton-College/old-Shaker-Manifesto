FOUNT OF LOVE 1. Uplifted to the realms above, Through living faith and prayer, Our souls can reach the fount of love, And find a blessing there. 2. Life's rugged pathway oft is drear, When sorrows deeply roll, And we would speak a word of cheer, To help each struggling soul; 3. Oh, let our lives be ever rife With kindly love and peace ! Through meekness banish every strife, And let all discord cease ; Though trials oft the heart oppress, There is a healing balm, A spirit ever near to bless. And shield from every harm. Then like the bread so often cast Upon time's troubled sea, It will return again at last, With blessing pure and free. Then we may chant the conqueror's song, And triumph in the right, Give praise to whom all praise belongs, When faith has turned to sight.
