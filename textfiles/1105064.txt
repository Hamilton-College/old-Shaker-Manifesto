NINETY AND NINE There are ninety and nine that live and die, In want, and hunger and cold ; That one may revel in luxury, And be lapped in its silken fold, And ninety and nine in their hovels bare, And one in a palace with riches rare. ***** Prom the sweat of their brows the desert blooms, And the forest before them falls ; Their labor has builded humble homes, And cities with lofty halls. And the one owns cities and homes and lands And the ninety and nine have empty hands But the night, so dreary, and dark and long, At last shall the morning bring ; And over the land the victor's song, Of the ninety and nine shall ring, And echo afar, from zone to zone, ' Rejoice ! for labor shall have its own.'
