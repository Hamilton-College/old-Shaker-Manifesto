GOD'S GOODNESS. Lucy S. Bowers. 'Sing unto the Lord; for He hath done excellent things- this is known in all the earth.''1 Isaiahs zii., 5. Yea indeed, and unthankful and unholy are they who know it not. God has been good to all the generations of the earth through all ages. His lovingkindness and unceasing abundance of good things have filled the earth to its uttermost parts; never has the sun ceased to shine for a day, nor the stars to light the ebon shades of night; nor vegetation to bloom and bear fruit; nor the waters to rise and fall in due time and appropriate season. Never has God forsaken the hearts of mankind, nor has his providence ceased to control their destinies. Deeply has truth in the soul been hidden beneath sin's heavy cloud, and man-made creeds and conceptions fashioned into hideous forms his holy and divine image, but still He is good, lovingly and in mercy pardoning, drawing and accepting the penitent heart, and even the persistent evil-doer He will not cast aside but with forbearance seeks to lead and help. Glory to God in the highest, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel j before the Lord our Maker, for He hath done excellent things, this is known in all the earth. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
