PUBLISHER'S ITEMS Our publisher asks for plainness of name and address of all subscribers. Let him have it. Our advertising patrons will only be happier to know we have had to enlarge our February edition by the thousand. We hope the happiness of every agent, who, like a lively, lovely one in N. H., secured 300 names in a few days. Ohio is also well spoken of. Telegraphic reports of a fire â€” a large barn and nearly forty head of stock, at Union Village, O. Recent letters from there state nothing of it. We hope it is false.
