'AT LAST.' To John G-. Whittier, Friend and Poet. Maktha j. Anderson. Entered at last 'the humble door' And mansions blest, 'The sheltering shade' and calm retreat From earth's unrest. And found beside the silvery tide Where strivings cease, The 'green expansions,' of eternal Love and peace. In strains seraphic heard 'the new And holy song;' And 'neath the healing trees,' Oh may Thy rest be long. The soulful lays of by-gone years Remain to bless; Sweet benediction of thy life Of righteousness. O poet-heart! through eons past Thy mould was cast, In full perfection's glory wrought To shine at last. The star of heavenly poesy, The peerless gem, That glistens in the world's Immortal diadem. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
