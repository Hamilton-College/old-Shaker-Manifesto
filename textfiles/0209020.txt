The Shaker Most radically religious monthly in the world. Organ of the societies of people called Shakers. Teaches thorough Christianity, unbiased by man-made creeds. Proclaims self-denial to be the efficacious remedy for sin. Declares that Jesus was baptized Christ, and thence became the pattern for all who name the name of Chribt, to follow. Gives information of Shaker life, habits, economy, success; theology, prophecy, inspirations, revelation and expectations. Deprecates war, either in the nation or in the household. Demands of all Christians, lives devoted to communion of interests. Certifies that celibacy is the or- der of heaven, and that marriage belongs to the earth only, and is not practiced by Christians. Testifies against all intemperance, lusts of the flesh, and worldly pride. Inculcates true love; separation from worldly customs, politics, etc. Claims God as Father and Mother of all souls—a duality, and therefore teaches the equal rights of their children, regardless of sex, color, race, education, circnmstances, or custom. Is a radical exponent of true SpiritualismShakers are Spiritualists. Objects to riches; poverty; slavery of either mind or body. Establishes the only true system of dietetics, and is a preserver of health. Guarantees salvation to all who will live as our great e:semplar, Jesus, lived. Believes all can be baptized by the same Christ Spirit, and thus become saviours to the lost or fallen, first being saved themselves. Is just the thing for the uneasy infidel, and bigoted sectarian. Loves all, means all shall be saved; teaches the way. Every individual expecting the re-appearance of Christ, should read The Shaker, and learn that the Shakers believe Christ's life puts an '• end to the world.' Price fifty cents per annum; costs, and is worth one dollar. Address G. A. Lomas, Editor, Shakers, N. Y.
