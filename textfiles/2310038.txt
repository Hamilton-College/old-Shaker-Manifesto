The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health, for September, contains many features of especial merit. The frontispiece is a striking and artistic portrait of Charles Darwin, which accompanies a finely-written description of the great naturalist's home, domestic habits, character, etc., by a literary lady who was for many years his neighbor and friend. Italy is the subject of Dr. Felix L. Oswald's brilliant installment of illustrated Race Studies. Prof. Nelson Sizer continues his series, How to Study Strangers, the Mental Temperament being the topic, which is also profusely illustrated. A phrenograph of the celebrated humorist, Bill Nye, by Prof. Sizer, is exceptionally interesting, being a stenographic report of a personal examination which Mr. Nye underwent incognito. To this are added an excellent portrait and biographical sketch'. Two venerable and eminent friends of the science are sketched by Mrs. Wells in her Phrenological Biographies, viz.: Drs. Joseph Hurford and Samuel Irwin. Following this is the second paper of a philosophical discussion of Approbativeness, with illustrations. The departments of Child Culture, Hygiene, and Anthropology are up to the usual standard, and the editorials are especially strong and comprehensive, the principal of these being the fifteenth paper upon Systematic Moral Education, in which the functions of Conscientiousness are ably considered. Only 15 cents a number, or $1.50 a yr. Address Fowler &amp; Wells, 27 East 21st street, New York.
