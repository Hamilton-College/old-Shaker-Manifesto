IMPERISHABLE. [Contributed by Harriet Sheparcl.] The pure, the bright, the beautiful That stirred our hearts in youth, The impulse to a worldly prayer, The dreams of love and truth; The longing after something lost, The spirit's yearning cry, The striving after better hopes� These things can never die. The timid hand stretched forth to aid A brother in his need, The kindly words in grief's dark hour That prove a friend, indeed, The plea for mercy softly breathed, When justice threatens nigh, The sorrow of a contrite heart� These things shall never die. The memory of a clasping hand, The pressure of a kiss, And all the trifles weak and frail That make up life's first bliss. 172 THE MANIFESTO. If with a firm, unchanging faith, And holy trust and high, [have met Those hands have clasped, those lips These things shall never die. The cruel and the bitter word That wounded as it fell, The chilling want of sympathy, We feel but never tell, The hard repulse that chills the heart, Whose hopes were bounding high In an unfaded record kept� These things shall never die. Let nothing pass, for every hand Must find some work to do. Lose not a chance to waken love, Be firm, and just, and true. So shall a light that can not fade Beam on thee from on high, And angel voices say to thee: These things shall never die. �Selected.
