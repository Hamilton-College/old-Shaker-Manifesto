BUDDHIST MISSIONARIES We hail with joy, the fact that Bro. J. M. Peebles has made arrangements with some Buddhists, well versed in the English tongue, to come to America and compare their isms with the Christianity sent them by Missionaries from America. Such hybrid, perverted, polluted Christianity as some missionaries make current in foreign fields, is a disgrace to barbarism. If we mistake not, these Brahmins will ask and demand an answer, as to what and wherein Christianity, as taught by the general Churches is an improvement on what preceded itâ€”Judaism; and unless more radical Christianity finds practice in these Churches, they will be unable to render a favorable showing.
