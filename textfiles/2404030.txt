The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for March opens with an interesting illustrated account of a petrified bust of a high born lady of the Eleventh Century. A phrenological love story is another new feature which will attract many readers. The Rev. Joseph Cook is the subject of a finely written phrenograph from a personal examination, by Dr. Edgar C. Beall. The series, 'How to Study Strangers,' by Prof. Nelson Sizer, contains in this installment appreciative sketches of several great inventors and other eminently successful men. The high opinions Horace Mann held of phrenology and his personal intimacy with George Combe are brought out in an enter taining manner by Mrs. Charlotte Fowler Wells. The departments of Health, Child Culture and Notes in Anthropology, show the usual variety of matter. The editor comprehensively reviews the career and character of George W. Childs, and in the Personal column character sketches are given of the Hon. W. L. Wilson, Sanford B. Dole, Jas. S. Blount, Minister A. S. Willis, Miss Elizabeth Peabody and Queen Liliuokalani. Price, 15 cents, $1.50 a year. Address the Fowler &amp; Wells Co., 25 East Twenty-first St. New York.
