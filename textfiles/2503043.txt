The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for February more than fulfills the promises made in the January number. In variety, solidity and attractiveness of matter, as well as typography, it is thoroughly up to date. The Hon. John W. Goff is the subject of the opening phrenograph from a personal examination, by the editor, Dr. Edgar C. Beall. As the new Recorder of New York is a figure of national interest this desciption of him will attract wide attention. A Psychological incident, by Jessie M. Holland, will appeal strongly to lovers of occult phenomena. Prof. Nelson Sizer gives a fine phreno-biological account of the late distinguished Prof. John S. Newberry, and contributes also six pages of excellent illustrated matter to the Child Culture department. Mrs. Charlotte F. Wells sketches the career of the eminent Spanish phrenologist, Don Cubi I. Soler. Spurzheim as Organizer and Teacher, by Dr. H. S. Drayton, is valuable phrenological history. The departments of Hygiene and Anthropology contain the usual variety. Character sketches from personal examinations, of Em ma Goldman and Marie Louise, two wellknown anarchists of New York, with portraits form one of the striking features in this issue. How to Prevent Dishonesty in Banks (illustrated,) with a lesson in the physiognomy of the eye, with two beautiful drawings, are among the leading editorials.
