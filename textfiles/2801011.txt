East Canterbury, N. H Dec. 1897. 'In duty enduring, in bearing believe, Forgiving if any my spirit should grieve; Rememb'ring at all times, as Mother did say, To set out anew and begin every day.' How anxiously we have desired that a voice from the unseen might speak a few words,â€”only a few words, that we might believe. It is in the above quotation that we hear the spirit of our worthy Elder Issachar Bates, and even at this date it gives forth no uncertain sound. It is the voice of the Christ, 'Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.' Accepting this voice of loving inspiration, let us begin the New Year with a clean record. Abundant cares confront us on every hand. The affairs that pertain to the hap- piness and prosperity of this life are imperative in their demands, and we must 'Provide things honest in the sight of all men,' during our pilgrimage on the earth. Nearly seven hundred cords of firewood must be provided for this Community from year to year. When Br. Andrew sees this statement he will evidently, rejoice in his Florida home. Our potato crop was a failure, but of apples we had a good supply. By and by 'seed-time and harvest' will come again, and then we may have reason to rejoice more fully. H. C. Blinn
