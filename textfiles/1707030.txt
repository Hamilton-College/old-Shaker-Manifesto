FROM DAY TO DAY. BY NELSIA BIRD The days go out and the days come in, A struggle for right, a battle with sin. A song half sung, and a prayer half said, A work unfinished and daylight dead. God knows the reasons- -I cannot know- - Taking His hand I will trustingly go-, It is better thus, and I only pray- - To be led by Him who knows the way, [complete, Till the fragments of work are each And the perfect song is sung at his feet, Till the broken prayer is a hymn of praise, And light and joy are not measured by days.
