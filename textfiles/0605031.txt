Genuine Shaker Apple Sauce Is made of sweet, dried apples and boiled cider. Reduce the cider, by boiling, one-half, when it first comes from the press skimming frequently. This may be set away, in wood, for any length of time in safety. In proportion of 25 pounds of apples, soak in 30 qts. of cider, 20 qts. of water, until fully swelled. When ready to make, add 25 qts. of the cider, and boil until tender. A few dried quinces improves its flavor. Sarah A. Van Wyck
