Farm and Garden A HOME-MADE ROLLER The Agriculturist gives the following description of a simple roller : Cut a log into sections, two feet long, that it may be more readily turned round. The log should be at least two feet in diameter, of heavy wood, such as oak or hard maple, and the sections should be sawed v ry true, so that the ends will work freely and not bind against each other. The sections are bored through the center with an auger an inch and three-quarters in diameter, and the holes should be bored from each end to the middle, where they should meet; they can be made more true in this way than by boring through from one end. The axle is an iron rod of one and a half inch diameter. Washers, half an inch thick, should be placed between the sections. The frame should be made of heavy stuff, at least four inches square, so as to gain weight and a driver's seat may be on. When built, the sections should be raised from the ground, and planed smooth and true. The Cows .â€”Treat them generously and kindly, but do not keep them fat unless they are to be turned off for beef. A cow is a machine, a laboratory for converting raw materials into milk. If little be given, little will be received. All animals should have exercise, especially those kept for breeding. Some of them are naturally lazy, but they will be the better for stirring about in the open air.
