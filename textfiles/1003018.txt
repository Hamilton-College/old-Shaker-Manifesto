RADICAL UTTERANCES There is some person connected with the Golden Rule, of Boston, Mass., that is, apparently, trying to outrival The Shaker Manifesto in its radical utterances. Of course it matters not who utters a truth, but that it is uttered opportunely, nevertheless we would pay homage to the conscientious bravery that puts plain, unvarnished, yet simple Christian facts where, and in a manner that professedly Christian folk must see and think of themâ€”apart from their moulded ehurch catechisms. Hear : When you hear a man, who holds up his head in society, confess in public prayer that he is a poor, miserable creature, unfit to live, you had better put your hand on to your pocket-book. A specially interesting service once a month for the benefit of the heathen is a good thing; but would it not be in the line of Christian duty to have a special service once in a while for the young men who do not attend the churches, but are at home in the drinking saloons ? THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. A religion that is eloquent Friday night and active on the Sabbath, but is left at the family altar for fear that it will be troublesome in the counting-room, will hardly convince shrewd men of the world that it is worth their attention. The bread-and-butter gospel to a family that are hungry will do more to lead them to love and trust God than a pocket full of New Testaments. When Christianity gives as warm a hand, as pleasant a face, and makes its places of worship as inviting as theatres, billiard halls and liquor saloons, there will be less poverty and crime charged to rum, and more credit due religion. Virtue, honesty, manliness do not need to be locked in a bank vault for security. A good character cannot be stolen by day or night. If any man has a character that can be stolen, the thief will get cheated.
