Sometime ago petitions were addressed to Congress, asking for an amendment to the Con- stitution of the United States, so that that instrument should contain ' an acknowledgment of Almighty God and the Christian religion.' These petitions were referred to the Judiciary Committee of the House, and last week that body presented an adverse report thereon. The Committee say that the matter was the subject of grave deliberation on the part of the framers of the Constitution, who finally quite unanimously agreed that, inasmuch as this country was to be the home of the people of all nations, pagan as well as Christian, it was inexpedient to put any thing in the Constitution which might be construed as a reference to-any religious creed or doctrine. The Committee are opposed to any change at the present time, and ask to be discharged from further consideration of the subject. This, we suppose, ends the matter for the present.
