In our leader of this number... In our leader of this number we use the terms 'Spiritist' and 'Spiritualist.' The suffixes are synonyms; but some Spiritualists, and nearly all eminent lexicographers, make a marked distinction between Spirit-tste and Spirit-iialists—one, Spiritists, determining merely the sensational phenomenalists,—who are content with table-tipping, raps, and all the physical movements made by spirit agency, but who do not strive to become pure and heavenly &gt;through its influence. In our leader we did not make this distinction as apparent as we might. Again, we intended to remark therein, that what is denominated modern Spiritualism, was, with us, a matter of prophecy thirty or forty years ago. Many eminent Spiritualists have seen the Shaker Societies in full operation in ' the better land,' before they knew of their whereabouts on the earth. Spiritualists take great pride in naming Robert Owen as one of their number; but the fact that he was converted to a faith in the unseen, by the mediumship of Daniel Offard, of Mt. Lebanon Shakers, is not commonly known, the details of which we hope to present at some future time. We give Spiritualism the largest credit for introducing Shaker theology to the attention of reformers, and we hope yet to admit that it has been the most successful medium for accomplishing the fruits that grow from real, Christian self-denial. *
