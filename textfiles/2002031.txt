NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Ja-. 6 1890. Bro. Henry George with some help from one of the young Brethren, finished trimming last week our soutli Orchard, it's appearance is improved ten-fold, the Brethren finished thrashing grain early in Dec, and in Nov. they improved the gravel walk between our family and the Church. I heartily agree with our zealous Bro. Daniel Ofibrd in having a board or commitee to look after public improvements, there have been some responses, let us have more of them and then carry our good resolutions into effect, � T. R. Beloved Elder Henry :�Tin New Year had rather a sad beginning with us Sister Ehoda Hollister fell in the hall fracturing her hip. Some of our friends well know the affliction that brings, and also the opportunity it gives for the exercise and development of the beautiful virtue, patience. We have recently put up a private telephone line through our village, and i\ aching to Canaan. All who will, (of the families) can now, hitch on and make our bond of union stronger. I have been thinking, that in the near fulure we should have a tangible line erected between this, our world, and the summer land we sing about. Spiritualism is the science of sciences, and will in due time unfold to our mortal vision some very wonderful things. No sleighing here, and only a little snow. Have had a few cold days, but to-day it was just like spring. January Manifesto arrived in good time and pronounced good. D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. Cutting fire wood is the work of the day. The Second Family have built a new house for swine, are also building a new ice-house, 20x40ft. They have commenced feeding ensilage from their silo, which, is 12x24 and 22 ft. deep. As this is their first trial they are unable to say much about it at present, only that it already turns out better than expected. Very little snow thus far, but plenty of mud and changeable weather, good for colds. Enfield, Conn. Shaker 'gilt edge' butter is in good demand. Thirty hundred pounds were soJd last year. The quality of butter depends more on the skill of the operator than on the plan of operation. If choice butter can be produced more easily in one way than in another, and at less expense, that is the way to adopt, regardless of the fact that the same butter can be made in other ways. We shall begin feeding ensilage in February. We should learn how to feed corn, including the stalks as well as the grain, to the best advantage. The silo is teaching us this, whether we convert it into ensilage, or cure it and feed it dry, after running it through the cutter. Care should be exercised in feeding poultry or they will get over fat and lay softshelled eggs. Poultry-men often think softshelled eggs come from a want of lime, but this is a mistake. Hens fed properly will not lay soft-shelled eggs. If there is trouble of this kind, feed bran, hay, chaff and a few oats. Squashes are excellent food for hens if given occasionally, with warm feed. The fquashes should be boiled and mixed with ground oats and cob-meal. This should be tried as it is something not generally fed poultry during the winter. D. Orcutt. Canterbury, N. H. Jan. 16 1890. Dear Editor :�It is our opinion that 'Notes about Home,' may add much that is profitable and pleasant to the pages of the Manifesto and thus fondly hope they are 'to be continued.' As often as we read the local names even, with their accompanying reports, we are reminded of a very beautiful custom practiced by the Alpine Shepherds on their native summits. It is stated that they send friendly greetings daily from one Alpine home to another, both at sunrise and sundown, either by the voice or through the Alpine horn, which seems to be their only available means of communication. The question naturally arises: Should we not send mutual greetings of good-will and gospel fellowship from one Society to another as from so many moral heights, as often as opportunity offers? We might substitute the Manifesto for the Alpine horn perchance. At present date, Canterbury thus reports herself: Health with the majority, good. Infirmary vacated�undergoing limited repairs�every member actively useful �no strikes�no feuds�crops harvested in season, now being enjoyed�buildings ready for Winter in good season�Winter, gone West. Latest arrival�'January 1890;' which comes to us mantled, (not vith snow,) but with good resolutions, from whence new energies are being evolved, and new spiritual gains sought, judging from what we realized in our New Year's morning service, after listening to various speakers. The leading sentiment to be cherished was to rule out of memory, the worthless by-gones of the past, with the old 'frog-in-the-well' method of progress, spiritually considered, and substitute therefor, a cheerful, active Christianity, the sincerity of which, no one can doubt. Let us note a very pleasant item from Harvard. On Christmas day, Elder Elijah was able to be with his people for an hour or more. Did not the visit of the good Brethren act as a healing balm? God bless the Union I Many of our friends who have visited Canterbury may recall a visit to the Worsted Church, so-called from the fact that the texts, mottoes and flowers upon its walls were wrought out of worsted. Said Church needing repairs, a literary entertainment was held and a little friendly aid asked from Shaker friends. Accordingly we responded with musical exercises and readings, such as are usually given in our family School. Good men and women as neighbors are a blessing which we can well appreciate. On Jan. 9th inst., Funeral Services were observed in memory of our Mother in IsraelSister Mary Whitcher, age 74 years. Our long-loved, noble Sister; noble we say, because unselfish in every phase of life. The season was a very impressive one, as �'Where the heart feels most, the lips move least.' Appropriate pieces were sung, and affectionate tributes written for the occasion were read, as in her presence, for no one could think of her, as absent. In the peculiar inspiration of the hour, we were comforted with the assurance that our mother, our Christian comforter, our nurse for the afflicted or feeble, was with us in spirit and in truth as of yore. We view her as a fair representative woman of the 'Friend who never fails.' May we, her survivors be so duly impressed by her life and example, that we may 'go and do likewise,' is our prayer. Enfield, N. H. Many of us have been and are doing battle with the influenza, with a French cognomen. I could wish it as far off as Paris, with a good relish. We do not care to entertain so disagreeable a visitor. E. B. Groveland, N. Y. Jan. 4. 1890. The winter here thus far has been very mild, with occasionally a few light showers of snow, the depth of the greatest measured two inches that remained only a few hours. December has been a month Of sun and rain and mist and mud, With trees and vines quite ready to bud, With grass and clover growing green, And robins too, quite oft were seen. Should the season remain at its present temperature we shall look in vain for that much needed blessing, Ice. But why borrow needless burden for who cm tell 'what a day may bring forth.' A heavy storm of rain accompanied with lightning and thunder passed over this section on the morning of the 2Gth. ult. followed by terrific winds, or miniature cyclone. A broad strip of tin roofing was removed from our large stock barn, s mie chimneys were left minus their full irumber of bricks ; forest trees were blown down, several peach and apricot trees were blown over, and at last we noticed the cyclone had blown over, leaving us thankful that we had been so fortunate as to escape greater damage. The last few days of the old year found us enjoying a bean sociable, every one who could assist has occupied the time handsorting our crop of beans, though but a fragment of what we hoped to realize from the amount planted. With favorable weather we might have secured of the Black Wax, - 400 bu., harvested 160 bu. Ivory Pod, - - ' ' ' 150 ' Boston Yellow, ' ' ' 64 ' New Kidney, - 30 ' ' 8 ' Three other varieties were not planted owing to the extremely bad condition of the soil caused by the heavy and continued rains.
