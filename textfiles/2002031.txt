Groveland, N. Y. Jan. 4. 1890. The winter here thus far has been very mild, with occasionally a few light showers of snow, the depth of the greatest measured two inches that remained only a few hours. December has been a month Of sun and rain and mist and mud, With trees and vines quite ready to bud, With grass and clover growing green, And robins too, quite oft were seen. Should the season remain at its present temperature we shall look in vain for that much needed blessing, Ice. But why borrow needless burden for who cm tell 'what a day may bring forth.' A heavy storm of rain accompanied with lightning and thunder passed over this section on the morning of the 2Gth. ult. followed by terrific winds, or miniature cyclone. A broad strip of tin roofing was removed from our large stock barn, s mie chimneys were left minus their full irumber of bricks ; forest trees were blown down, several peach and apricot trees were blown over, and at last we noticed the cyclone had blown over, leaving us thankful that we had been so fortunate as to escape greater damage. The last few days of the old year found us enjoying a bean sociable, every one who could assist has occupied the time handsorting our crop of beans, though but a fragment of what we hoped to realize from the amount planted. With favorable weather we might have secured of the Black Wax, - 400 bu., harvested 160 bu. Ivory Pod, - - ' ' ' 150 ' Boston Yellow, ' ' ' 64 ' New Kidney, - 30 ' ' 8 ' Three other varieties were not planted owing to the extremely bad condition of the soil caused by the heavy and continued rains.
