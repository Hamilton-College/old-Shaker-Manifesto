THIS LIFE IS WHAT WE MAKE IT . Let's oftener talk of noble deeds, And rarer of the bad ones, And sing about our happy days, And none about the sad ones. We were not made to fret and sigh, And when grief sleeps to wake it; Bright happiness is standing by— This life is what we make it. Let's find the sunny side of men, Or be believers in it; A light there is in every soul That takes the pains to win it. Oh ! there's a slumbering good in all. And we perchance may wake it. Our hand contains the magic wand— This life is what we make it. Then here's to those whose loving hearts Shed light and joy about them ! Thanks be to them for countless gems We ne'er had known without them. Oh ! this should be a happy world To all who may partake it; The fault's our own if it is not— This life is what we make it. Truth.
