REFLECTIONS. SIMON MABEE. 'First that which is natural then that which is spiritual.' Why is it that the inventive powers of man lie dormant for so many centuries*, depriving mankind of those useful inventions which are now in operation in all departments of business? Did they not lie buried under the darkness that covered the earth and the gross darkness that covered the people. In those dark ages men's minds were spiritually inactive being led by their own animal natures. The people would hear the priests preach Christ, who in their works practically denied him. Jesus said, 'If the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the ditch,' that ditch which has been filled with all the abominable deeds committed on the earth: but the power above all powers has caused light to shine so that many begin to see a little light and all that are honest and desire more light will progress, but it seems that some hate to leave the old ditch. Jesus said 'Men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.' The fire of God's truth will i-earch and burn them out of their darV places and bring them to the light where they will be seen as they are,â€”no hiding places. God said by the prophet Hagai lie would shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land, and all nations shall be shaken. This is now taking place both literally and spiritually. The old foundation of Anti-Christ is being shaken, but the foundation that has been laid by Jesus and Mother never will be shaken. All that build on the foundation that Jesus Christ laid, and come out from the old dark system, and confess and forsake all sin they will rejoice for their deliverance. They will feel as the children of Israel did when they crossed the Red Sea. They will shout and sing and dance in praise to God. If such souls continue faithful they will have a treasure in the spirit world where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. West Piitsfield, Mass.
