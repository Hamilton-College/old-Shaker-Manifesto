Harvard, Mass. May, 1895. 'The time of the singing of birds has come.' In the morning the early shrill notes of the robin awaken us to a sense of gratitude for the blessings of another day. At eventide, poor will takes a whipping; while the mosquito sings his harsh evening song in our ears, which we would prefer not to hear. Yet we are surrounded with beauty on every hand. 'This world is full cf beauty, As other worlds above, And if we did our duty It might be full of love,' which is the oil of gladness that lubricates the wheels of communal machinery that there need be no friction. Peach, pear, plum and cherry trees are in bloom, while the laborers are dilligently sowing and planting the seeds, in faith looking to the fulfillment of the promise that seed time and harvest shall not fail. We earnestly hope that nature's kindly conditions will be favorable to an abundant harvest. The family who have so lately taken possession of our South family have become quite well settled in their new home, and our centenarian Brother endured the move much better than we had anticipated. Sister Louisa Greene is now on a visit to Mt. Lebanon and Societies of that bishopric. She will be absent through the month of May. We are pleased to send so good a representative and hope she will have a pleasant visit and come home recuperated. Marcia M. liuUard.
