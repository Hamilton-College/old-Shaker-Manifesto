Shakers, N. Y. North Family. Sept. 1894. On the 23rd of August a delegation of twenty-three from the North family and eight from the Second family went to Albany and took the 8-30 steam-boat the 'Albany' and went down the Hudson river sixty miles to Rhinebeck. It was a very enjoyable ride as the day was fair, and everything favorable for a pleasant time, and it was especially so to westerners who had not seen much of the Hudson river. The passengers of the boat when they found out that we were Shaker Communists were very inquisitive and anxious to know something of our profession and practice. Some of them had never heard of such a sect. The writer was plied with numerous questions from people who seemed to be honestly seeking for light and before he was aware of the fact found himself surrounded by an attentive audience of nearly a hundred. They seemed spiritually hungry and many that we had private conversation with evinced an earnest longing for a conscious knowledge of the power that enables men and women to enjoy social and spiritual communion in community homes, in purity of life. We do not doubt but that good seed was sown by the Brethren and Sisters, and we also thought of the harvest,'it is great but the laborers are few,' but we will 'pray the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth more laborers into his harvest ' May we keep our inner temple clean that the ministrations that go forth will be uplifting. Since we came to Watervliet we have many times thought of the vision of the apostle John, when he looked and saw upon Mount Zion the mighty host who had their Father's name written in their foreheads. And 'these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.' There have been many of that number who have lived in this Society arid have' passed 'to'fl're Spirit land who are ministering angels bearing the truth to those who are willing to receive it. We have often realized their presence, and their testimony to the young is to hold the fort, to bear the standard high that was transmitted to us by our gospel parents: and this we will do. 'For the cause that lacks assistance, and the wrongs that need resistance, and the good that we can do.' We did not intend to preach a sermon but our heart is full and we must express it. Long may the dear Manifesto continue to make its monthly visits to cheer and strengthen the laborers in the field. The weather continues dry, with an occasional light shower; but when compared with the drought-stricken west we are very much favored. We just want to whisper to the editor, that 'the melons are ripe.' We have made an addition to our dry kiln so that the steaming, cutting and drying of the sweet corn will be done under one roof; a great saving of labor. Work has commenced on the water works that we intend to put in this fall; bringing the water from the quarry pond, forcing it up to a high point so that there will be head enough to throw it over any of our buildings. The motive power to drive the pumps has not yet been decided upon. It will give us a magnificent supply of pure, soft, spring water. Hamilton DeGrcnv
