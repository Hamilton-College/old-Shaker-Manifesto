Confession of sins Confession of^sins.—The N.. T. Indefendent speaks very correctly on the subject in the following quotations. We think that, ' whatever is inconsistent with a pure Christian life,' will include other practices and lusts not named herein by it.—Ed. ' Confession of sin is a chief test of repentance, and without repentance there is no religion. If we are sorry we have done wrong, we will be likely to say so, and will be sure to sav so to th«se whom we have wronged.1 The Bible very frequently insists on confession if we would be forgiven. ' Even better than confession is the evident putting away of the sins of an evil life, especially where it is at some cost to us. There is not much magic practiced now; but those who repent must put away their sins, of whatever sort. The Ephesian converts burned their books of magic. Nowadays a convert will destroy his liquors, perhaps his cards and tobacco, or whatever he thinks is inconsistent with a pure, Christian life. Thus he gives the best evidence that he is in earnest. It is likely to be a genuine repentance that will conquer our love of money, and will rule our pockets. 'A confession and repentance that will do such deeds as these done by the Ephesian converts will have power over the world. Such self-denial attracts attention, and the conscience of everybody approves it. Here is a suggestion to our churches to-day, ii they would be successful. Let them put away their sins and be in earnest.' Dear Editor—I do not know where I cut these lines from, but they are suggestive that permanent peace must rest upon right. f. w. evans.
