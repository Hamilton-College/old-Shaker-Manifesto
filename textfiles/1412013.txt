SEED-TIME AND HARVEST. HARRIET J. SHEPARD. In cloudy, cold November, when the rain falls, and the bleak wind blows, the farmer scatters seed over the fields A very unpleasant time he must have, but the sa:isfac. tion of knowing that it is done probably affords him much pleasure. The grain lies for many months in grave like furrows, beneath the frosty air, the curling mist and weeping skies, or buried in the snows, or bare to every wind. It grows in spite of thunder, rain, of cloud and blast, and beds of snow. Every roaring tempest strengthens it. Anon a kindlier s-eason shines, warmth and light, the Spring's soft signs dispels the frosty air; and the grain in delicate green spring up enchantingly. This brings to the mind the sublimity, grandeur, wisdom and goodness of God; and inspires the soul with reverence and gratitude to the giver of all good. The sunny months pass swiftly by;�The full grown ear is soon matured, and as the harvest approaches, the farmer prepares his implement for cutting the grain; then we behold the rich sheaves rearing their heads over the joyous landscape.�Sown in cold dreary weather; reaped in heat of summer days ; so in the dark and marvelous ways of destiny are the works of men.�Grief, frustrations, procrastinations and sometimes prostration for a time, like tempests that soften the grain, must prove the aspirants claim, and every virtuous, worthy endeavor of the heart. In the breath of contempt, the tempest of malignity, the obscurity of hope, lomj delayed; when all around shows desolate, the good deeds we havt done must slumber. Let us patiently toil,�suffer quietly,�be calm, be not in haste, our good deeds shall be made manifest. Though much perplexity and toil is endured before the harvest is complete that which was sown in cold dreary weather will bloom and mature in the warmth of Summer. ' Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. ' Ps. 1., 15. 'Many are the afflictions of the righteous : but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.' Pi. xxxiv., 19.�See also John xvi., 24. Let us be brave to work, firm and constant to endure. 'Wait on the Lord : Be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart: Wait, I say, on the Lord. ' Pi. xxvii., 14. i(Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. ' John, vi., 37. See J &gt;hn vi., 35. The soul that is honest and fiithtul will obtain the blessing of God. ' Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled.' Matt, v., 6. North Union, Ohio.
