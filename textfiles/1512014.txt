Strange Scenes at a Kentucky Revival On a sudden this community, that the preachers had often called Satan's stronghold, underwent a moral awakening such as this world had never beheld, says John B. McMaster, in his 'History of the People of the United States, ' writing of a Kentucky ' Revival. ' Two young men began the great work in the Summer of 1779. They were brothers, and preachers, and on their way across the pine barrens to Ohio, but turned aside to be present at a Sacramental solemnity on Red river. The people were accustomed to gather at such times on a Friday, and by praying, singing, and hearing sermons, to prepare themselves for the reception of the Sacrament on Sunday. At the Red river meeting the brothers were asked to preach, and one of them did so with astonishing fervor. As he spoke, the people were deeply moved, tears ran down their faces, and one, a woman, far in the rear of the house, broke through order and began to shout. For two hours after the regular preachers had gone the crowd lingered, and were loath to depart. While they tarried, one of the brothers was irresistibly impelled to speak. He rose and told them that he felt called to preach ; that he could not be silent. The words which fell from his lips roused the people before him 'to a pungent sense of sin. 'ï¿½Again and again the woman shouted and would not be silent. He started to go to her. The crowd begged him to turn back. Something within him urged him on, and he went through the house, shouting and exhorting and praising God. In a moment the floor, to use his own words, ' was covered with the slain. ' Their cries for mercy were terrible to hear. Some found forgiveness, but many went away 'spiritually wounded,' and suffering unutterable agony of soul. Nothing could allay the excitement. Every settlement along the Green river and Cumberland was filled with religious fervor. Men filled their wagons with beds and provisions, and traveled fifty miles to camp upon the ground and hear him preach. This idea was new ; hundreds adopted it, and camp meetings began. There was no longer any excuse to stay away from preaching. Neither distance, nor lack of houses, nor the scarcity of food, nor daily occupations prevailed. Led by curiosity, by excitement, by religious zeal, families of every Protestant denomination, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, hurried to the camp ground. Crops were left half gathered, cabins were deserted, and in large settlements there did not remain one soul. The first regular camp meeting was held at Gaspar river church, in July, 1800 ; but the rage spread, and a dozen encampments followed in quick succession. Camp meeting was always in the forest, near some little church, which served as the preachers' lodge. At one endof a clearing was a rude stage, and before it the stumps and trunks of hewn trees, on which the listeners sat. About the clearing were the tents and wagous, ranged in rows like streets. The praying and preaching and exhorting, would sometimes last for seven days, and be prolonged every day, until darkness had begun to give way to light. Nor were the ministers the only exhorters. Men and women, nay, even children, took part. At Cane Ridge, a little girl of seven sat upon the shoulder of a man and preached to the multitude until she sank completely exhausted on her bearer's head. At Indian Creek, a lad of twelve mounted a stump, and exhorted until he grew weak, whereupon two men upheld him, and he continued until speech Avas impossible. A score of sinners fell prostrate before him. At no time was the '' falling exercise' so prevalent as at night. Nothing was then wanting that could strike terror into minds weak, timid, and harassed. The red glare of the camp fires, reflected from hundreds of tents and wagons ; the dense blackness of the surrounding forest, made still more terrible by the groans and screams of the ' spiritually wounded ' who had fled to it for comfort; the entreaty of the preachers ; the sobs and shrieks of the downcast, still walked through the valley of the shadow of death ; the shouts and songs from the happy ones who had crossed the delectable mountains, had gone on through the fogs of the enchanted ground, and entered the land of Buelah, were too much for those over whose minds and bodies lively imaginations held sway. The heart swelled, the nerves gave way, the hands and feet grew cold, and motionless and speechless they fell headlong to the ground. In a moment crowds gathered about them to pray and shout. Some lay still as death. Some passed through frightful twitchings of face and limbs. At Cabin Creek so many fell that, lest the multitude should tread on them, they were carried to the meeting house, and laid in rows on the floor. At Cane Kidge the number was three thousand. The recollections of that famous meeting are still preserved in Kentucky, where not many years since, old men could be found whose mothers had carried them to the camp ground when infants, and had leU them at the roots of trees and behind logs, while the preaching and exhoi'ting continued. Cane Ridge meeting house stood on a well shaded, well watered spot, seven miles from the town of Paris. There a great space had been cleared, a preacher's stand put up, and a huge tent stretched to shelter the crowd from the sun and rain. But it did not cover the twentieth part of the people who came. Every road that led to the ground is described to have presented for several days an almost unbroken line of wagons, horses and men. One who saw the meeting when it had just begun, wrote home to Philadelphia that the wagons covered an area as large as that between Market street, and Chestnut, Second, and Third. Another, who counted them, declared that they numbered 1145. Seven hundred and fifty lead tokens, stamped with the letters A or B, were given by the Baptists to the communicants, and there were still upwards of four hundred who received none. Old soldiers who were present, and claimed to know something of the art of estimating the number of the great masses of men, put down those encamped at the Cane Ridge meeting, at twenty thousand souls. The excitement surpassed anything before known. Men who came to scoff remained to preach. All day and all night the crowd swarmed to and from preacher to preacher, singing, shouting, laughing, now rushing off to listen to some new exhorter who had climbed upon a stump, now gathering around some unfortunate who, in their peculiar language, was ' spiritually slain.' Soon men and women fell in such numbers that it became impossible for the multitude to move about without trampling them, and they were hurried to the meeting house. At no time was the floor less than half covered. Some lay quiet, unable to move or speak. Some of them talked, but could not move. Some beat the floor with their heels. Some shrieking in agony, bounded about, it is said, like a live fish out of water. Others rushed wildly over the stumps and benches, and then plunged, shouting 'Lost! lost!' into the forest.
