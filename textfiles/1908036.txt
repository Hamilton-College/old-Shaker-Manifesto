Dear Children:'Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation... Enfield Conn., 1889. Dear Children :ï¿½'Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation,' was the Savior's wise command. Watch the stealthy approaches of the tempter. As the Adversary watches for opportunities to destroy your souls, so should you watch, and by heavenly power, win victory. Watch for occasions of doing good; for storing durable riches ; for all means of increasing your purity and happiness. Watchfulness will strengthen you where you would falter, encourage where you might fail. You cannot progress heavenward without constant watching. Watch well what you gather and scatter again. Watch in little things. 'Avoid the appearance of evil,' is advice worth taking. Shun little temptations and you will resist great ones. The danger of evil beginnings is often overlooked. Take them in time. It is far easier to follow the seli-denying way than to retrace your steps after having swerved from it. But with every temptation there is a way of escape. The right path may be regained. Heed the counsel of the pure and wise and you will be saved from many wrong steps and much misery. Watch! This is the secret of success in the Christian warfare. Watchfulness is wisdom. Be ever wise. Learn valuable lessons for the world to come. Rely on God's unchanging guidance. 'Trust Him through the sunshine and the storm.' Oh, the comfort that comes from this. The whole life of Jesus was constant watching and prayer. How worthy of imitation. Copy as much as you can of his holy character into your own lives. He loves the little ones who deny self and win victories in his cause, for He sees the love in the heart that prompts the action. Be not discouraged because you are little. May the sweetness of an approving conscience be yours. May your years be many and bright with virtue and truth. May your ways be ways of pleasantness and your paths paths of peace, is the earnest wish of Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
