Juvenile. PROPER LANGUAGE. Dear Children :�Listen while I talk with you a few moments. Can any of you tell me what slang is? It is low vulgar language, often without sense in form of expression, although it conveys a meaning, coarse and base, which is generally understood by that class of persons who habitually use it; but it is never elevating to mind or morals. The English language abounds with choice words, which are capable of expressing the most beautiful thoughts and sentiments. We may judge of the refinement of people by the purity of their speech, which is an external symbol of thought and feeling. So if you would be chaste and cultivated, you must be very careful in speaking. You need not employ ambiguous words on any occasion; I mean those of uncertain or doubtful meaning; but simple, direct and truthful words that all can understand. There is another habit in speaking much to be deprecated, and that is, extravagant and equivocal expressions. You strain the smaller occurances to the proportions of awful, dreadful, terrible and shocking; when very, extremely or exceedingly would be much more appropriate; for if you use adjectives in the superlative degree for trifles, you will have no words to express great calamities or misfortunes. Now I want you to think seriously on what has been said, and see how much improvement you can make the coming week, month and year. You can all help each other to speak nicely, by a gentle reminder when any one of you are in fault. Your Friend, Martha J. Anderson. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Dear Children:'Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation... Enfield Conn., 1889. Dear Children :�'Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation,' was the Savior's wise command. Watch the stealthy approaches of the tempter. As the Adversary watches for opportunities to destroy your souls, so should you watch, and by heavenly power, win victory. Watch for occasions of doing good; for storing durable riches ; for all means of increasing your purity and happiness. Watchfulness will strengthen you where you would falter, encourage where you might fail. You cannot progress heavenward without constant watching. Watch well what you gather and scatter again. Watch in little things. 'Avoid the appearance of evil,' is advice worth taking. Shun little temptations and you will resist great ones. The danger of evil beginnings is often overlooked. Take them in time. It is far easier to follow the seli-denying way than to retrace your steps after having swerved from it. But with every temptation there is a way of escape. The right path may be regained. Heed the counsel of the pure and wise and you will be saved from many wrong steps and much misery. Watch! This is the secret of success in the Christian warfare. Watchfulness is wisdom. Be ever wise. Learn valuable lessons for the world to come. Rely on God's unchanging guidance. 'Trust Him through the sunshine and the storm.' Oh, the comfort that comes from this. The whole life of Jesus was constant watching and prayer. How worthy of imitation. Copy as much as you can of his holy character into your own lives. He loves the little ones who deny self and win victories in his cause, for He sees the love in the heart that prompts the action. Be not discouraged because you are little. May the sweetness of an approving conscience be yours. May your years be many and bright with virtue and truth. May your ways be ways of pleasantness and your paths paths of peace, is the earnest wish of Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
