Like Swans? A Scotch minister thus discoursed on the carelessness of his flock : ' Brethren, when you leave the church just look down on the duke's swans. They are very bonny swans, an' they'll be sooming about an' aye dooking doon their heads and laving theirsels wi' the clear water till the're a drookit. Then you'll see them sooming to the shore, an' they'll gie their wings a bit flap an' they're dry again. Now, my friends, you come here every Sabbath, an' I lay you a' ower wi' the gospel till ye're fairly drookit wi' it. But you just gang awa' hame, an' sit doon by your fireside, gie your wings a bit o' flap, an' ye're aa dry as ever again.'
