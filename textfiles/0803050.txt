A gentleman who circulates considerably in society... A gentleman who circulates considerably in society took it in his head to remark the adjectives employed by the persons—outside, of course, of his own family— with whom he came in contact. For a month he quietly noted, and a few months since he made up his report. The favorite adjective among all classes he found to be 'great' which he heard pronounced within the time aforesaid 167 times, 'Awful' and 'splendid' ranked second and third respectively,3 the former being repeated 142 and the latter 151 times; 'feai'ful'followed 150 times, and 'frightful' 140 times. 'Fine' he heard 138 times, 'gorgeous' 136 times, 'grand' 134, 'pretty'' 134, and 'beautiful' 133. Among the]ladies he found the word 'lovely' to be an adjective held in high esteem, and which was applied to everything. It fell on his ears 198 times, and four times he heard it expressed, by men. In comparison, the superlative degree was employed the most, 218 times, the comparative 143 and the positive 97 times.
