Beloved Brother Sullivan, my good and well tried friend:--You and I... Enfield, N. H., April, 1889. Beloved Brother Sullivan, my GOOD AND WELL TRIED FRIEND :- - - -You and I are slowly creeping along to the end of life's journey. Those of our class and age have mostly passed the wondrous river, while we stand waiting upon the banks for the boat to take us on board. A signal is not unfrequently given notifying me that the ferry-man is approaching the near shore for passengers. To embark, I am in no haste ; yet from the course of nature, I know the ;ime of my departure draweth nigh. You and I have had our day. Our battles in life are nearly at their close, our good fight nearly fought and our victories we can count upon with a degree of rejoicing. Our relations we have learned to value, and to us are very dear, and our treasures of immortality no one can take from us. However much we may realize we are not millionaires, yet our possessions are not trifling, the thought of which is very comforting. We are not ignorant of our burden and strife, and we know that our labors have rewarded us with life and being, bringing peace, love, and joy, with a home and a relation whose value is incomputable. Dear brother, for a long time my mind has been especi ,lly drawn to Canterbury, to old friends and to you in particular as one whom I have long loved, who has nobly faced the enemy, fearlessly braved the storms and terrors of the battle and com i out a victor. In your conquests, I congratulate you. As we sing the songs of triumph now and here, I am thinking how more exultingly we can swell the songs of the Lamb in that undiscovered land. And still we are marching on, with the expectation of a continuous journey which ends not with time, but extendeth on and on, until like Jesus we can say,ï¿½'The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me.' St. John, 14, 30. Then it must be that our coffers are full of blessing and love, and our ministrations will be devoid of any savor of earth, of self, or the powers of darkness. G-ood brother, please accept these simple lines as conversational, with my undying love. Your Brother, Abraham Perkins.
