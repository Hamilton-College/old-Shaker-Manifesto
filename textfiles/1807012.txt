CRITERION OF REVELATION. Alonzo G. Hollister. Christ is the true manifester of the Highest. Any spirit or teacher not in unison with Christ, does not manifest the Highest, but belongs to a lower order of manifesting intelligences. Peter, answering a question, said to Jesus, 'Thou art the Anointed, the Son of the living God.' Jesus replied, 'Blessed art thori Simon son of Jonas, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto the?, but my Father which is in heaven. Moreover I say to thee that thou art a rock, and upon this rock. 1 will build my congregation, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against her.' Matt. xvi. A rock is deemed a solid, unchanging and permanent foundation to build upon. What constituted Simon a rock, if not the gift of revelation from the Father? It certainly did uot mean his personality, for soon after, he is severely rebuked and called a Satan, (i. e. opposer,) and told to go behind for being a stumbling block, who was minding not the things of God, but things of men. It appears from the record that Simon was what in this day would be called a medium, inspired by a gift from heaven, or by influences from Hades, or by opinions of people with whom he associated, according to the direction of his thoughts, and the circumstances in which he was placed. He had not learned to discriminate different sources of inspiration, and therefore needed a mentor fo guide him aright, which office, Jesus fulfilled while in the mortal. But what relation have the gates of Hades to the congregation of Christ? Hades is a Greek word signifying the invisible, and was regarded by Greeks as the abode of the dead of all classes. In the New Testament, it means the temporai-y receptacle of unredeemed spirits who have left the mortal body. Temporary, because when all of those spirits shall have heard the voice of the Son of God, (Juo. v., 25 to 29,) through his messengers, and have come forth at the call to judgment, Hades will be abolished, as saith the spirit of prophecy, 'O Hades, 1 will be thy destruction !' 'And Death and Hades were cast into a lake of fire.' Gates are used to open or close passways through a wall or other barrier. In walled cities, massive towers were built over gate-ways, to contain soldiers for defending the city. There Governors and Judges held courts, and merchants displayed their wares, because of throngs of people passing to and fro, or pausing to transact business. A common figure of speech in eastern literature, includes defences and people, in the term 'gates.' The physical senses, or the vail of the flesh, constitutes the barrier which divides Hades from the visible world, so that there can be uo intelligent communication between the dead and the living, except through specially endowed persons called mediums. Hence, natural mediums, through whom unredeemed spirits communicate their knowledge and their wishes to mortals, may properly be called gates of Hades. The congregation, or church of Christ is in like manner, the gate to heaven of life eternal, and has rival claims to man's attention, belief, interest and trust. It is founded on a higher, purer, deeper and more permanent revelation, than any inspiration ever uttered by natural, unredeemed, and therefore earth bound spirits, whether in or out of the flesh. And though the latter may be jealous, or envious of the true Christian work and revelation,- ï¿½and though they may be averse to renouncing their petty eminences, boasted acquirements, selfish freedoms, and independent sway over the minds of mortals enlisted in their favorite schemes for perfecting human happiness without the cross of Christ, they never can close this gate of heaven, nor prevail against the congregation of Christ while it cleaves to its foundation. All divinely commissioned spirits must acknowledge the way of Christ to be the open avenue of superior wisdom, to which all must finally come and lay off their fancied greatness and self-importance, to learn the way of life from a beginning, as little children, or never attain to that perfection which alone completes the joy of the soul. It is evident from the New Testament record, that in the time of Christ's first appearing, necessarily so, because the Gospel of Christ, is the resurrection gospel, and when it is preached in this, it is heard in both worlds at the same time. Heuce Jesus declared, ' The hour comes and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they having heard, shall live.' They that obey become resurrected. 'The gospel was preached to the dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in spirit,' wrote the Apostle. Where-ever the true gospel is preached, there the resurrection and the judgment conjointly proceed. The gates of Hades having been opened to permit the return of the dead and satisfy the afore-mentioned purpose, some mediums set up for teachers, and not submitting to any authority but their own self-wills, brought in conflicting doctrines, some of which, Paul termed 'doctrines of demons,' which made confusion, and many divisions sprang up, causing parties and contention, among the professed believers in Christ. In view of these things, James exhorts, '' My brethren, become not many teachers, (i. e. of divergent doctrines) knowing that greater judgment we shall receive. For in many ways we all err.' Christ the true way is one. 'But if anyone err not in word, this I - a perfect man, and able to guide the whole body.' He is qualified to teach. John says ' Believe not every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are from God. Because many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the spirit of God. Every one which confesses that a Savior anointed has come in the flesh, is from God. Every spirit who does not confess the Savior, is not of God. And this is that anti-anoiuted which you heard that it comes and is already in the world.'' The confession which Jesus drew from Simon Peter, is here applied as a test. Of course this means acknowledgement and submission to the authority cf the anointed messengers who guide the body, and who make unity of purpose and concerted action possible to all its members. Many thousands of communications claiming exalted spiritual origins, are being received in this day, because Christ is again tabernacled in flesh, and the aionian gospel of the resurrection and judgment is preached, which brings the two worlds near together, as in Christ's first appearing. Without a true criterion or standard by which to test the various doctrines taught by spirits in and out of the body, we are liable either to reject all the wisdom advanced spirits can teach us, and close our eyes against the light which is flooding the world today, and grope with the blind, or like many others, become lost in a sea of error and speculation, because unable to separate true from false, or the things of God from things of men. The congregation of Christ is built by obedience of its members thereto, upon an ever present inspiration from the living God, and is a revelation to the world of the Divine character and purpose, diffusing to each age, in every cycle of its progress, the Divine illumination of its respective degree. Hence the doctrine and revelation of God made knorvn in the congregation of Christ, true to the principles of its foundation, furnish a valid criterion of judgmjnt whereby to distinguish true frcm false revelation. Any spirit coming to us, who does not acknowledge fealty to the doctrines and revelation of the church of Christ's Second Appearing, is to be instructed if it will listen, but not hearkened to as a messenger of Divine knowledge. Whatever his age, name, or pretensions, such spirit is from Hades, and his claims may safe'y be judged by the same rule that we judge a stranger in the body. That is, by the law of Christ in his church, and the testimony of his witnesses. If they speak not according to this, there is no light of the Divine life in them. It may be supposed an objection to the fore-going, that a false church, or a school of philosophy adopting erroneous standards, may proceed in like manner to suppress truth which cannot be construed agreeably to their false or imperfect criterion?*. But this supposed objection is not real, since no counterfeit can invalidate its original, and a false church is clearly by its fruits, distinguished from the true and focal center of Divine light to the world.
