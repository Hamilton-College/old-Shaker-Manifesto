SOLILOQUY LEWIS HORTON Have I a mansion there— Where on shining walls Hang fadeless flowers—symbolic emblems Of earthly good, of victories won O'er sin and worldly strife ? Have I the love That shines in all my Master's ways Peerless and sublime ? Blest Savior of my soul! O'er thee angelic legions held controlEncompassed thee about in tenderness and care, Breathing forth—like summer winds— Mercy, Love and Truth, from our Creator, God. O thou eternal Source of life! Help me to walk the path that Jesus trod; Help me to know Thy will Till in my soul Christ's kingdom comes And finds eternal dwelling. Enfield N. H.
