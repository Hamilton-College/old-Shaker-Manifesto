INNOCENCE O innocence, tliou spirit bright, Thy pathway we have found! And, guided by thy angel hand, We'll tread thy holy ground. We look with joy upon thy face, That hath no cloud or shade ; And pray thy voice may yet be heard Through every rank and grade. When shall we see thy temple fair, Adorned with souls in white, Who drink from thy eternal springs, With chaste and sweet delight. In them false honor is dethron'd, With all its glittering train; By them the tyrant's chain is rent, And truth has pow'r to reign. In Truth is found simplicity, And liberty combin'd, And whosoe'er will seek for her The tree of life will find. She leads through virtue's flowery path, To wisdom's quiet vale, And crowns with lasting life the soul, Whose courage does not fail. Betsey Maynard, Harvard, Mass.
