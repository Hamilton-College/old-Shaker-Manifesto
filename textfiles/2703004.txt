SPIRITUAL SIGHT. Alonzo G. Hollister. 'FAITH is a gift of God and without faith, it is impossible to please Him. _Jj For he that would come to God, must first believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them who diligently seek Him. Faith is sometimes said to be belief, trust. It is that and much more. It is spiritual sight. It is the spiritual eye of the soul. Animals of the cat family are born with their eyes so fast closed, that they do not get them opened for several days. So souls are blind and ignorant of spiritual things till that faith which is spiritual sight is bestowed on them by the gift of God. The natural, animal man receiveth not the spiritual things of God because they are foolishness to him ; neither can h ' kno v them, for they are spiritually discerned. He that is spiritual, s'earcheth all things, even the deeps of God, bat himself is discerned by none but those who are spiritual, like him. The unspiritual can know almost nothing about God and the great world of causes which lies beneath this world of effects. He knows nothing but effects. The visible world is the world of effects. The unseen world which builds and beautifies it with light and living forms, is the world of causes, and God is the Great First Cause of all. It may be clearly understood from these remarks, that unbelief, or disbelief in spiritual things is spiritual blindness, and that very one who makes a boast of unbelief in a spiritual world�in a life hereafter�who does not believe in spiritual gifts and manifestations,�we say such an one displays ignorance, narrow-mindedness and folly, before all intelligent people who know these things to be so. It is equivalent to boasting that one does not know how to read or write, and pluming himself upon his voluntary ignorance when he has had an equal opportunity to learn, with those who do know. But he threw it away on trifles. It is as if one blind should boast of his inability to see, after refusing the aid that would enable him to see. The boast is proof that he regards belief as voluntary, for if the will had no control over belief, there would be no ground for the boast, nor for praise or blame in the matter. People are endowed by nature with different powers or degrees of belief�but that is no reason why some should refuse to believe that which is true. It is the state of the heart, desire, or affection that determines belief. If the heart is pure and upright, it is ever ready to receive the good. It turns ever toward the good and drinks it in as the thirsty drink water, or as living forms absorb food to grow. If the heart be perverse or corrupt, it will reject the good which interferes with its worldly, perverse, and sensual attractions. This is why Father James taught that unbelief in the truth�in the word of God spoken by his messengers, is a damning sin. And those who sow unbelief, as opposed to the teachings of the gospel of Christ will reap ji double condemnation; perhaps ten or a hundred fold, according to the injury done to others. It will come back with all the increase to block the path of the Sower, when he begins to retrace his steps toward heaven. O then purify your hearts ye who would forsake tne wilderness of this world,�ye who would shun the paths of sin and folly,�ye who would become the children of God and of a heavenly Parentage,�ye who would become sons and daughters of Eternal Wisdom, whose ways are ways of pleas- antness and ail her paths are peace-,�ye who would become self-conquerors and rise triumphant over sin and sorrow and delusive snares of the world, to quaff never ending glories and joys of the redeemed in heaven. O seek this pearl of great price, this gift of faith. Yea, search for it as for hidden treasures. Wrestle for it in prayer, resolve every day and hour to obey the light as it comes to you. Persevere till you can say in truth, that you know God lives,�and that He has revealed his law and commandments of Eternal life, love and goodness to his servants who have sought him with singleness of heart and purpose that would not be denied, nor put off with a counterfeit. People are differently endowed naturally, and are not to be blamed for what they inherit of excess or deficiency if they will improve all opportunities to cultivate those good faculties in which they are deficient. Every one has the germ of every faculty possest by every other being, and there can be no excuse for not cultivating and strengthening those faculties that are weak, when the knowledge is given us. If the heart is pure, it will certainly have the desire that will inspire efforts in that direction. Unbelief never accomplisht anything good or great. It never accomplisht anything but the destruction of the unbeliever. All the best people of the world in all ages, all who are honored for their good deeds have been believers in the unseen Powers and ministering spirits who move and guide those who will seek their aid. They have been people of faith in God and in Revelation. Even the great in a natural sense have been so, because of their faith in the unseen and the strength they derived from thence. As soon as you begin to put forth a persistent effort to obtain this faith those conditions begin to form and to grow by the continued desire and effort, that will ultimate in producing in our souls a revelation and birth of the Christ Spirit. When you have received this revelation, you will know it. It will not be belief, but knowledge,�and you will know and own your spiritualMount Lebanon Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
