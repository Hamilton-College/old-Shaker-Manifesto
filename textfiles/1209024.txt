Dear Manifesto ;—Your sweet, little face so... Oswego, May, 1882 Dear Manifesto ;—Your sweet, little face so welcome to us, has been missed from our fireside since the Jan. No. came to hand, and we infer that our subscription has expired. Enclosed, please find am't. for one year's renewal, and consider us a life subscriber. You have entwined yourself around our hearts, and become one of the necessities of our earthly existence. And now a word to our dear brethren and sisters greeting : As John the Baptist preceded the first advent of Christ in the person of Jesus, and as the primitive Christian church gave promise, before its extinction, in the sec)nd and third centuries, of its permanent foundation in the 'latter days,' so do you as in organized body of harmonious and loving, n*actical Christians, give hope, and promise, that the time is at hand, when the leaven of rue Shaker principles, will leaven the whole ump of humanity. Ye are a light unto the world, therefore, 'Let your light so shine bebre men that they may see your good works ¦xnd glorify our Father which is in heaven,' and let the little Manifesto go into the hearts and homes of all God's children, who are eady to receive it, with its precious fruitage of joy, and peace, and purity, and 'the angels bright, from their homes of light' will SIIAKKIl MANIFESTO. 209 continue to aid you in bearing the burdens of its care and sustenance. We venture to say, that there are millions of people in this broad land, who have never heard of such a people as the Shakers, much less, are familiar with the principles of which they are the living exponents. How truly in this case, as in :thers, do the words of our dear Lord apply when he said, 'The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.' May our Heavenly Father bestow still more abundantly, the means whereby the 'Manifesto' can be sent all over this broad land, with the tidings that there is a happy, Godfearing, man-loving people, living above the . law of 'mine and thine' in fraternal unity and love. Where there are no Prisons, Almshouses, or Insane Asylums ; where there are no homicides, suicides, embezzlements, or adulteries, clearly showing who are the followers ot Jesus, for he said 'Ye shall know them by their fruits.' We would if time and space permitted, gladly enter upon the discussion of the analogy between the historical events of the time of Jesus the Christ and the events of these 'latter days.' For instance, we have our Pharisees, Christians so-called. Sadducees, called materialists, Essenes, and Nazarites in the garb of the Shakers, and those who have dealings with 'familiar spirits,' called Spiritualists. And our boasted nineteenth century civilization, with its concomitants Church and State, already past the zenith of their power, weak and enfeebled with the accumulated vice and crime, of centuries. Is it not like the ancient Roman Empire, tottering toward its down fall in fulfillment of the prediction of St. John in the Apocalypse? Do not the 'signs of the times,' point to this approaching advent of the 'True Church of the Living God,' as clearly as they did, at its first appearing? We have done. We have thrown out thes e few thoughts feeling quite confident they will not escape the attention of the 'children of light,' and now may the 'peace of God which passeth all understanding' prevail and continue at the homes of our brother and sister Shakersuntil noneshall say, 'Know the Lord : for they shall all kno.v me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and 1 will remember their sin no more.'
