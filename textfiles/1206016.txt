TAKE CARE OF YOUR THOUGHTS Sin begins in the heart. If you can keep 7our thoughts pure, your life will be blameess. The indulgence of sinful thoughts and desires produce sinful actions. When lust lath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. The )leasureable contemplation of a sinful deed s usually followed by its commission. Never allow yourself to pause and consider the pleasure or profit you might derive from this )r that sin. Close your mind against the suggestion at once, as you would lock and bolt your doors against a robber. If Eve lad not stood parleying with the devil and admiring the beautiful fruit, the earth might lave yet been a paradise. No one becomes a thief, a fornicator, or a murderer at once. The mind must be first corrupted. The wicked suggestion must be indulged and revolved in the thoughts, until it loses its heinous deformity, and the anticipated gain or pleasure comes to outweigh the evils of the transgression. Your imagination is apt to paint forbidden pleasure in gay and dazzling colors. It is the serpent's charm. Gaze not upon the picture. Suffer not the intruder to get a lodgment. Meet the enemy at the threshold and drive it from your heart. As a rule, the more familiar you become with sin the less hateful it appears; so that the more completely you preserve your mind from unholy and wicked thoughts, the better. Avoid the society where obscenity or blasphemy is heard. Cultivate the society of the virtuous. Read nothing unchaste or immoral. Make a covenant with your eyes. Familiarize not your mind with the loathsome disease of crime. Never harbor malicious or envious thoughts. Direct your thoughts toward pure and holy subjects. Contemplate the character of the spotless and perfect Son of God. Keep your spirit untainted, your thoughts uncontaminated. So shall your life be virtuous. As a man thinketh, so is he. Take care of the thoughts, and the actions will take care of themselves. Exchange.
