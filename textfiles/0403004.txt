MENNONITES 'Ward' says, 'The Mennonites are descended from the tolerably pure evangelical Waldenses, who were driven, by persecution, into various countries ; lived, simple, exemplary lives; in the villages as farmers ; in the towns by trades, possessing the most pure Christian principles, which they exemplified in a holy life and conversation. They fled to Flanders, and Zeland, in the 12th Century. There were then two sects of them, the one distinguished by the perfect, who held to celibacy and community of goods; the other, the imperfect. The greater part of them were the most pious Christians the Church ever saw. By the labors of Menno Simons, they obtained a regular state of Church order in 1536. They were formerly called Anabaptists, but subsequent to this arrangement, Mennonites. They are considered In Church Histories as the only Christian community which has stood on the platform of the Judean Christian Church, since the days of the Apostles. They plead for universal toleration in religion, debar none from their societies who live pious lives, and own the Scriptures as the 'Word of God. They object to the term Trinity, referring to God. They are utterly averse to oaths, war, and capital punishment, as contrary to the spirit of Christianity. In their private meetings every one has liberty to speak, expound the Scriptures, and pray. They decline salaries from Government for their priests. Their Church worship, at present, is conducted similarly to the Dutch Reformed. There are, already, in the United States, more than two hundred Mennonite Churches, some containing three hundred members.'
