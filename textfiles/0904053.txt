Book Table Religiously speaking, we do not like lawyers;... Religiously speaking, we do not like lawyers ; and yet, as a necessary evil, like doctors —whom we are afraid of—we are forced to respect ' Great Lawyers,' particularly when we are so fortunate as to stumble upon an honest attorney. Our father was a lawyer of Brooklyn, N. Y., and this opinion of legal lights may seem like filial ingratitude ; but we own to strong liking for lawyer ' stories ; ' and in a book published by The Law Journal of Albany, N. Y., entitled ' Short Studies of Great Lawyers,' we found a delightful and very instructive volume. The book is richly interspersed with anecdotes,amid much valuable information concerning legal subjects. Were we a lawyer, we should want this book on the shelf close by the Codes, and would frequently 'make a mistake on purpose,' by selecting and reading law in ' Short Studies,' rather than in the blue atmosphere of the more intricate Blackstone. The price is $2.00.
