A Good Test of the Purity of Milk A German paper gives a test for watered milk which is simplicity itself. A wellpolished knitting-needle is to be dipped into a deep vessel of milk, and immediately withdrawn in an upright position. If the milk is pure, some of the fluid will hang to the needle, but if water has been added to the milk, even in small proportions, the fluid will not adhere to the needle.
