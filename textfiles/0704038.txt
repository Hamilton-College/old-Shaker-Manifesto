Spiritual Eden Chorus. Zion,-— our Eternal home. No darkness, nor death, but life, light and Oh, what joy to be there in that bright land above— That beautifill love In that Spiritual Eden— our eternal home. 2. We are told of its seasons so fair,— Its eternal spring and its youth, No sickness—no pain, nor poisonous air, No slander—no pride, nor untruth. Of its bright 'sea of glass' we have heard— The pearls and the gems on its shore, No troublesome noise—the songs of the birds Are adding their joy evermore. Chorus 3. We are told that the spirit of war Is known in that land, never more, But halcyon love and union are there— A brotherhood scene evermore. We are told, would we reach that blest sphere, And earn an inheritance there, To labor with care for heaven while here— By living the life they live there. Chorus. 4. To the joys of a heaven made here, Add bliss of the angelic band, A heaven on earth, sure then will appear, A foretaste of that happy land. Let us press for the 'evergreen shores;' We'll make all its pleasures our own ; And be angels here, and there evermore— In Eden—our eternal home. Chorus.
