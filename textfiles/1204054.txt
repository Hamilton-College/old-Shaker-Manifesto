So much need have I to thank thee... Canterbury, N. H. So much need have I to thank Thee For thy mercy, care and love, That I have no heart to murmur, And no lips but to approve. Teach me how I best may serve Thee, Every conscious hour control; Then but little have I given For the wealth that greets my soul.
