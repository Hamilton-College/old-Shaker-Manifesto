Beloved Ministry:--Your favor received, and submitted to... Sonyea, N. Y., Oct. 30, 1889. Beloved Ministry :ï¿½Your favor received, and submitted to the Urethren and Sisters. The majority view it with suspicion, feeling that it would result in the loss of what spirituality there yet remains with Believers in our sacred worship. One or two, who have no real interest in the meetings, would be pleased to have the innovation. A few, are indifferent. The Elders, while in no way prejudiced against instrumental music, if it can be kept subordinate to the spiritual, unite with the gift of our Lead. But, seeing humanity is constitutionally lazy, spiritually, and is ever seeking to climb up some other way than laboring for a trae spiritual gift with which to feed their own and other sonls, we should look upon the introduction of instrumental music into our worship meetings with disfavor. When that wave of deep conviction which we are all looking for reaches mankind, and souls are made to feel their hungry and naked condition, will it be the foolish things that now agitate Believers they will ask for? Is it not the living bread and waters of life that they will be expecting? They have the fashions and pleasures of this world in perfection, as Believers in Christ and Mother's Gospel can never enjoy, as these will not satisfy the hungry soul. One soul who is trnhy baptized into the virgin life of Christ will bringmore conviction to the souls of men, than all the instruments of music the world ever saw. Zion had an Ordrr raid Lead, and still has. We would like to unite in deep souled prayer with the Household of faith, that the wisdom and blessing of God may rest on this Order and Lead, that, through tlr. m Zion may be prepared to do her duty ! Please accept the love of all the Brethren and Sisters. Yours in gospel love, riders of Sonyea, To Ministry of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
