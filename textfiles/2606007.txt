Self-culture is intellectual... Self-culture is intellectual, but never exalt the intellect above the moral principle. The first grand principle of intellectual progress, is to receive the truth no matter how it bears on myself. I must follow it no matter where it leads,, what interests it opposes, to what persecution or loss it lays me open, from what party it severs me, or to what party it allies me. Dr. Channing.
