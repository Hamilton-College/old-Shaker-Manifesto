MINISTRATION By Martha J. Anderson Part of the whole I find myself to be, Living and loving for all human kind, Rising in strength the lower self to bind, Heir to the hope of immortality, Glad in the truth that blesses and makes free. Soul currents leap the bound of sensuous mind, Pure ministrations holy service find, Unfolding life of true divinity. Yet thought vibrations on their mission sent, Have power to bless or curse in their intent, Uplift, or downward draw to sin and pain, Make free, or stronger hold the captive's chain. Be mine the heart where hallowed thoughts shall tent, From whence sweet messages of good are sent. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
