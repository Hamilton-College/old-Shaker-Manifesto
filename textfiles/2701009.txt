'Better to suffer wrong than to do wrong.... 'Better to suffer wrong than to do wrong.' Deliver my soul from hardness of heart; from bitterness of feeling toward others, however wrongfully they may judge me. All judge according to the evidence given and the conception taken of the evidence, and causes may be obscured from the sight of individuals so that effects may not be estimated aright, but time will make manifest all things, and all wrongs will be righted. â€” Elder Richard Bushnell
