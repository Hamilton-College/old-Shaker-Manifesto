Sabbathday Lake, Me. Sept. 13, 1891. 'Oh, the blessings, rich and many, Which are mine to share to-day; All the fountains of God's goodness Seem to open in my way!' To-day is one of the many days in which we are especially blessed for we have but to ask and we receive. The summer is over. Now all New Eng. landers must prepare for winter. Harvesting is going on in this section. Our grain has been gathered and threshed, yielding over 200 bu. Winter apples are not very plentiful. Of early apples we have an abundance. Have already dried 72 bu. Hope to dry as many more before we get through. On the 4th. inst. a company of ten Sisters went from this place on an excursion to the city of Portland. They took the steamer, E. S. Spring and sailed out to the Islands in the harbor, visited Greenwood Garden on Peak's Island and watched for the White Squadron which was to come in that day but did not appear until after they had returned home. Another company went to the State Fair at Lewiston on the 9th. inst. They had a very enjoyable day, started early and returned late in the evening. Health of Society generally good, but we are still in need of rain. Clouds threaten to-day yï¿½t 'All signs fail in a dry time' and we may not receive the much coveted blessing. A. S. C.
