Elder Henry, Dear Brother:--The Oct. Manifesto came to me laden... Milton, Or. Oct. 9. 1892. Elder Henry, Dear Brother : The Oct. Manifesto came to me laden with precious food. It is, indeed, this to the soul seeking righteousness by self-denial in a pure, or virgin life. The article by Br. A. G-. H. is a store of itself, also the article by our late Br. H. L. E. which cannot be set aside nor refuted. In fact every article in the October number breathes forth the inspiration of God to my soul, and to any soul sick of a sinful life. Jesus in speaking to his disciples, said: 'If a man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.' This is laid down as a criterion for each one of us, hence, I feel it a duty incumbent upon me, to take this line of life in a practical sense, in order to be entitled to an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ. Experience teaches that every victory gained over a depraved nature, brings us nearer to God. Light comes into the soul which will dispel all darkness, and the apostle instructs us to 'have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.' As I have not the opportunity of bearing a public testimony with my Brethren and Sisters in the hour of worship, yet I testify that I pledge myself to live in conformity to the Christ life, as now manifest in a Shaker life, and to this end I earnestly solicit your prayers. Your Brother, Wm. W. Bellmire.
