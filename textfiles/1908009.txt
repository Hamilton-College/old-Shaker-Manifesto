Dear Matilda:--Your letter bearing the tidings of the death of... Reno, Nev., May 14, 1889. Dear Matilda :�Your letter bearing the tidings of the death of Peter Boyd was duly received. I had seen the notice in the 'Star.' He was a grand old man. In his death, the Society lost one of its ablest, most honest and true friends. Intellectually, as physically, he was a giant. Only the opportunity was lacking, to have made him a power, in a greater field than the one in which his life was spent. He was almost born in the Society, with which he labored and devoted his life-work for three-fourths of a century. Integrity of character, honesty of purpose, fidelity to friends, were among his sterling qualities. Resides these, he had a strength of intellect, a power of comprehension, a will power that would have made him a leader in state or nation, had his ambition led him in that direction. He educated himself, or was educated to keep within the pales of his belief, to stand aloof from the world, to honor his people, to be a leader among their leaders. He reached the climax of promotion. His counsels were honored, where those of his chosen belief were found. The Society being a little world to itself, he reached the topmost round of honor in it. Among those with whom he lived, labored and achieved, he was a Napoleon in deeds, but unlike Napoleon he did not have to meet death an exile, his remains were not buried on other than his own lands ; but his ashes will rest surrounded by those who lived and died in the same cause, who were devotees to the same creed. About thirty years ago I first met him, for more than twenty-five, I knew him well. He was not only kind, but friendly ; he was sincerely, my friend. He accredited to me, honesty. lie appreciated and was proud of my partial success, and was sadly sorrowful when my reverses came. I had hoped to have had the pleasure to receive his kindly welcome, to look into that strong conscientious face once more, to tell him of my trials, the battles I have made against adversity, the partial victories I have won. He is dead. The patient ear will listen no more ; the encouraging smile is not to be seen ; the words of advice and wisdom no longer fall from his lips. He has gone hence,� 'rossed the river. We too will soon follow. Old age is following us fast. Its iufirmities are on our tracts. I regret your sufferings, but hope the worst is over and that you will regain your strength. That was too sad about Eldress Louisa. Give her my sympathies. 1 trust she will be able to joiu you soon. You will remember me to all my Shaker friends, and accept love from u� three. Yours sincerely, D. Allen.
