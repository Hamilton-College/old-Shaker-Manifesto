OH! REAPERS OF LIFE'S HARVEST. [This poem was a favorite with President Garfield ; it was a cause of great regret, he said, that he did not know the authorship.] Ho, reapers of life's harvest! Why stand with rusted blade Until the night draws round thee Ar.d day begins to fade? Why stand ye idle, waiting For reapers more to come? The golden morn is passing, Why sit ye idle, dumb? Thrust in your sharpened sickle, And gather in the grain; The night is fast approaching, And soon will come again. The Master calls for reapers, And shall He call in vain? Shall sheaves lie there, ungathered, And waste upon the plain? Mount up the heights of wisdom, And crush each error low. Keep back no words or knowledge That human hearts should know. Be faithful to thy mission In the service of thy Lord, And then a golden chaplet Shall be thy just reward. Selected.
