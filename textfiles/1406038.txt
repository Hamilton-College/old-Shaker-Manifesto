C. and L. M. Gould, Manchester, N. H. When an Editor can encourage truth and denounce error, fearlessly and consistently as we find it in the columns of the R. P. J. we may then look hopefully for a better phase of spiritualism to spring up in the land. We are interested laborers in this field of mystic influences, and accept with pleasure all that embodies light or increases our intelligence upon this most valuable subject. Dreams and visions and divers other gifts are among the blessings that have fallen to our inheritance, but they should be reported in all truthfulness. That there may be spurious or sham-demonstrations conjoined to the same company or that the credulous and over-anxious should sometimes be deceived by a false light, is not a subject of surprise. In the exposure of these spiritual magicians and their sham manifestations we most heartily commend the courage of the Journal as fair in its treatment, and as an able advocate for the truth.
