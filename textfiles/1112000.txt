BLIGHTED M. J. ANDERSON Just in a night they withered, Touched by a blighting frost, Their delicate nerves were shivered And all their glory was lost. Those beautiful flowers that bloomed Through spring and summer hours, And the balmy air perfumed, At the call of dews and showers. They are gone, our bright hopes perished And close to the eartli they lie, The sweet things that we cherished So quickly doomed to die. Oh! thus on our spirits' flowers May come some chilling blight, Though the germs, by heavenly powers, Were matured and brought to light. Sometime when the sun's fair shining Promises setting clear, And the clouds with golden lining Above life's hills appear. There may lurk in the coming darkness Some cold and icy breath, That swift in the sable darkness May hurl the shafts of death. It may be the frost of sorrow Will fall on the nightly air, To bring us a sad to-morrow And rob us of treasures rare. Or a sudden chill of feeling May pass over hearts once warm, A sadder wreck revealing Than comes of the passing storm. Of the coming days we speak not, Of the future who can know, Over our greenest earth spot Palleth the drifting snow. Where our choicest hopes are blasted, May some new life take wing, And the souls of flowers wasted Bloom in perennial spring. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
