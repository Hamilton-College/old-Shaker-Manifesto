LITTLE BY LITTLE. Little by little the time goes by,� Short if you sing through it, long if you sigh ; Little by little,�an hour, a day, Gone with the years that have vanished away : Little by little the race is run, Trouble and waiting and toil are done ! Little by little the skies grow clear; Little by little the sun comes near; Little by little the days smile out Gladder and brighter on pain and doubt; Little by little the seed we sow Into a beautiful yield will grow. Little by little the world grows strong, Fighting the battle of right and wrong; Little by little the wrong gives way,� Little by little the right has sway, Little by little all longing souls Struggle up nearer the shining goals. Little by little the good in men Blossoms to beauty, for human ken; Little by little the angels see Prophecies better of good to be; Little by little the God of all Lifts the world nearer the pleading call.
