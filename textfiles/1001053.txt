Care of farm wagons The Cake of Farm Wagons.â€” In the aggregate what an immense amount of money is annually lost by carelessness and inattention in regard to the ' rolling stock ' of the farm. There are the farm wagons and the cart, for instance, which look shabby enough, while the felloes on both are commencing to rot badly. They must go to the shop to be repaired, and then there is a bill of several dollars to be paid for out of the earnings on the farm ; perhaps j list at a time when cash is sorely needed to pay current expenses, when crops have not yet been harvested; while a couple of days lost with the wagon at the shop undergoing repairs may cause you to have a damaged hay or grain crop. By making it a regular duty to paint all your wagons, carts and implements, each fall, or every two years, according to the service they are required to perform, you will increase the years of their usefulness, besides always having nice looking 'rolling stock ' and implements. One of the most fruitful causes of decayed wagon felloes or rims, is keeping the wagons in a damp place, with the wheels on the damp ground, for two or three months during winter. If you cannot have a board or plank floor for them, let the wheels stand on short boards, which will answer the same purpose.
