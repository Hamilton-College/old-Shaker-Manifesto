Friend G. B.—Your letter of the 5th inst. is at hand... Mt. Lebanon, July I7th, 1879 F. W. Evans Friend G. B.—Your letter of the 5th inst. is at hand. We have no wish to separate man and wife. You can live together so long as you desire so to do in the outside world. Or, if you contemplate becoming Shakers sometime in the future, as a preliminary step—a preparation—you can provide yourselves with a small house near the society, and by attending its meetings, visiting, etc., gradually gather with, or away from the order and people. That you request to be admitted into a society, the fundamental principle of which is celibacy, making a proviso that you room with a woman, evidences your destitution of the simplest element of Shaker faith. We thought—still think, Oneida would exactly meet your wishes—just suit you. There you could maintain a social magnetic relation with each other and yet abstain from sensuality to the extent that you choose or its regulations demanded. What more do you want? They have no law against a man touching a woman. We think it not good. Why ask us to violate our own rules ? Should you at any time hereafter desire to become full Christians—to forsake father, mother, wife, children, lands and little houses to live together in, write me. At present, we can neither walk together nor live together, because we are not agreed. Without the faith of the Shakers, we can neither please God nor the Shakers by living with them. Your letter is well written and applies to a whole class who are seeking union with our order without separating themselves from the generative order ; therefore, do I publish it. If God be God, serve him ; if generation be the God of this World, cleave to it. His servants ye are whom ye obey. Respectfully,
