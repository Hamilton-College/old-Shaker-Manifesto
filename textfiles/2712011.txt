Narcoossee, Fla. Nov. 1897. The persistent, want to accomplish all things; nothing is impossible to it. It travels on the 'Get There' road and it always makes schedule time. It recognizes no failure. It is the conqueror of everything it undertakes, even to the making of a home in the wilds of Florida, where everything is ripe for testing a man's patience, from the tiny flea to the Palmetto and Pines which cover the land as far as the eye can see. [Not the fleas but the Pines.] An experience of three years has tested our integrity. Not only being 1300 miles from all our gospel friends and debarred from all our former associations, we have to meet the changes of climate, which told fearfully on some of us for the first two years. Patience and a clear conscience, have been the remedies for mental and physical sorrow. And they have workt wonders. Cold and rainy October has past, but it gave us a good opportunity to put in our fall crops. The lakes have risen 3 ft. 2 in. and that is one foot too high for cultivating the low muck lands. Our northern potatoes which were nearly all planted on these low lands, have rotted, but as the weather seems settled we shall replant them. In the past two weeks we have cleared another three acres of pine and oak land, for the spring crop of sweet potatoes. A good measure of health abides with us, and an occasional ride through the pine groves affords us some of nature's best remedies to keep off malarial troubles and may be other diseases. At this season of the year the pine groves of Florida are beautiful and fragrant. Thousands of flowers are in full bloom which nature has so bountifully given to this lone state. Andrew Barrett.
