FAITH OR WORKS ? Up to the death of Nicholas, Jews in Russia were not allowed to possess land, to give evidence in civil suits, nor to inhabit the holy cities of Kiew and Moscow. They were obliged to wear a particular garb, and out of every family, one child was taken by the State to be educated as a Christian at his parents' cost. Yet this is the nation that is prosecuting a relentless war in the name of religion. The Jewish religion is as much superior to that of the Greek Church as a philosopher's intellect is superior to that of the idiot. In barbarous Turkey, the Jew is protected in his religious liberty, while in fanatical Greek countries, it is thought to be no sin to murder men, women and children of the Jewish race. The doctrine of faiths instead of works has caused untold misery to the human race. The religion of mankind, in this particular, needs to be entirely reversed, and the people taught that their religion will be judged, not only on earth, but in heaven, by What they do, and not by what they profess.â€”Benison News.
