KIND WORDS AMANDA TIFFANY O the power of kindly spoken words ! Who can tell their priceless worth ; who,' but those who have been soothed and cheered by their sweet influence ! When the care-worn heart, oppressed by the toils and burdens of life, receives a kindly, sympathetic word, how quickly the drooping spirit will revive, and show its appreciation by that glow of pleasure which lights up the countenance, and brightens the whole being, manifesting its tranquilizing influence over the soul. When naught else with the erring avails, let us try the kind loving word of unfeigned interest, and see the effect. How often has the most hardened and unrelenting heart been led to feel sorrow and contrition for its wrongs through the influence of the timely, kind word. Be kind to the aged, those who have borne the burdens of life in the heat of the day, who have endured privations and hardships, that the rising generations might enjoy a quiet and peaceful home, and the many luxuries of life, which to them were unknown. We are enjoying the fruits of their labors, in peace and plenty. Do we realize how much we are indebted to them ? Dear young friends, let us be more thoughtful on this subject, and give to them the kind word, the pleasant smile and the helping hand, thus fill their few remaining days with the sunshine of kindness and the peace of loving, grateful hearts.
