Agricultural Making And Using Manure .—No man is a truly successful farmer who allows his land to grow poor while he is cultivating it. He may make money for the time and put it in his pocket ; but he does so at the cost of his successors. He takes something from the soil and gives nothing in return. This cannot be continued without beggary of both land and occupant. Writers and speakers tell of the 'inexhaustible' fertility of the West. I never hear that word without being annoyed. We might as well say that we can consume a part and still have the whole: not only that, but keep on doing so for an indefinite term of years, and still have the whole remain to us. This mistaken idea of an inexhaustible soil has already cost the West a great sum of money, and will inevitably cost many millions more. Much has already been done to put an end to this ruinous system of forever taking from the soil and putting nothing back. Much remains still to be done.— Tribune. Those who own orchards... Those who own orchards over twelve years or more of age will find a great advantage in applying a moderate top-dressing of old or fresh manure. It seems to have an almost magical effect upon the fruit. The trees will be more likely to bear every year; they will give heavier crops, and the fruit will be finer. It will do as well, nearly if not quite, to draw the manure out in the winter, and spread over the ground such manure as accumulates from the animals in the stables and barn-yards. On the first thaw or rain the earth will ab sorb all the soluble washed portions. The mistake should be avoided of placing the manure in heaps at the foot of the treetrunks or in small circles about the trees. Trees only twelve years old have already covered the whole ground with their network of their roots beneath the surface. Wood ashes are always useful.—Dirigo 'Rural.
