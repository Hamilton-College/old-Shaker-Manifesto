Those who own orchards... Those who own orchards over twelve years or more of age will find a great advantage in applying a moderate top-dressing of old or fresh manure. It seems to have an almost magical effect upon the fruit. The trees will be more likely to bear every year; they will give heavier crops, and the fruit will be finer. It will do as well, nearly if not quite, to draw the manure out in the winter, and spread over the ground such manure as accumulates from the animals in the stables and barn-yards. On the first thaw or rain the earth will ab sorb all the soluble washed portions. The mistake should be avoided of placing the manure in heaps at the foot of the treetrunks or in small circles about the trees. Trees only twelve years old have already covered the whole ground with their network of their roots beneath the surface. Wood ashes are always useful.â€”Dirigo 'Rural.
