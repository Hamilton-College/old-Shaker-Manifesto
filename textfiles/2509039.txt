Cosmopolitan Not since 'The Anglomaniacs' has there been so clever a society satire as Henry Fuller's 'Pilgrim Sons,' which is published in the A ugust Cosmopolitan. The problems involved in 'woman's use of the bicycle are so startling and so numerous, under the rapid evolution of this art, that one welcomes a careful discussion of the subject by so trained a mind and so clever a writer as Mrs. Reginald de Ko ven. The Cosmopolitan illustrates Mrs. de Koven's article with a series of poses by professional models. A new sport, more thrilling than any known to Nimrod, more dangerous than was ever experienced by even a Buffalo Bill, is exploited in the same issue in an article on 'Photographing Big Game in the Rocky Mountains,' before shooting. The idea that ten cents for The Cosmopolitan means inferiority from a literary point of view is dispelled by the appearance in this number of such writers as Sir Lewis Morris, Sir Edwin Arnold, Edgar Fawcett, Tabb, W. Clark Russell, Lang, Sarcey, Zangwill, Agnes Repplier, etc. Nor can we entertain the idea of inferiority in illusti-ation with such names as Hamilton Gibson, Denman, Van Sohaick, Lix, Sandham, etc., figuring as the chief artists of a single month's issue.
