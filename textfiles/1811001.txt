A VISION. Daniel Fraser. Of late I have been burdened with the conditions of Christendom. They are so snarled and twisted together, that to straighten them seeras impossible. In the natural fibre there are so many kinks, I see no other way of keeping things right than by every person smoothing out their own kinks. In this frame of mind a visitor, not of earth, approached me. He was clad as wayfaring men usually are, in clothes the worse for wear. I saw he had something to say ; he made a halt and scanned me intently. I motioned him to sit down ; he did so and dropped his bundle at his feet. He said, I perceive you are troubled as I am about the state of things among men. When I lived on earth I was thought to be somebody, now I am a tramp. The want and crime in your world distresses me ; to be at freedom to sit down and rest a little feels good. I have come to see what can be done to stop the flow of wicked men and women into the land of souls. There is no hope but in the extinction of the race, or in its amendment while on earth. Men and women give way to their animal emotions to the injury of themselves and others. You see the misery of earth. I feel the misery of dead millionaires. I was one of them. At first I felt destitute and horriblv alive. I had no rest; I was driven out of settled society ; I had to tramp. My feet got sore; a man gave me these old rubbers. Wherever I turn, the measure I gave unto men, is measured to me. I have not come to be delivered from being an outcast, for I have learned to rejoice that the wrath of God is against all unrighteousness. The object of that wrath is, that all may be just, kind and lovable. The talk of the glorious principles involved in the Declaration of Independence is hollow and out of date. The word is, ''Give over employing your millions in absorbing nil the elements of human subsistence you can lay your hands on�driving the landless to poverty, crime, and to the highways. Could you feel but for a season the condition of those who lived upon, and became rich at the expense of others, you would feel more than words can express. The presence of dead millionaires is unendurable. I would rather tramp forever than live with them. I pray that the time will come shortly when all will have equal natural opportunities to live. Of my own hard-heartedness, I am tramping out of it, ju^t as I got into it; only, I have to tramp backwards. I find great relief in meeting those who are righting their wrongs while in the body, and seeking the uplifting of humanity. The talk of doing unto others as we would be done unto is stale. Go to work with a heart full of loving kindness and the work is done. The lack of this in me makes me feel bad now. The law of the Heavens, and also of the Moral Universe, is 'Be happy in making others happy. There is a lack of honesty of purpose in society in seeking to suppress crime. Tts leading members do not want to go to the root in this m.itter. They are the ones who create crime and punish criminals. It is they who obstruct (as I did) the honest toilers in their eudeavors to reach, to improve and enjoy Godgiven opportunities. A case of this kind presented itself in one of the hells. It appeared that one of the leaders in society had been robbed, and that the robber had a family, and that his children were in want. Under the impulse to provide for them he stole some food. The results were, conviction and sentence of punishment. The robber appealed to Heaven's high court of Judicature. The decision of the lower court was set aside on the showing that complainant was the robber. He having taken away by legal force the poor man's access to the elements of human subsistence. The wants of the latter were provided for, and the legal robber and his gentlemen of the jury sunk back to their respective hells. The procedure of this court is not arbitrary; a sweet reasonableness pervades it, and both parties are benefited by its conclusions. When society honestly seeks to meet crime in the spirit of this court, poverty and its attendant, crime, will be reduced to their minimum. Humanity is a unit, hence the happiness of its substratum is the happiness of the whole. Your world is a world of effects ; of necessity there is a world of causes the forces of which are not material; even the impulsive forces of instinctive life are not visible. Man in common with animals feels these forces, but he is not the subject of the limitations of instinctive life. He manipulates and controls to a certain extent the inorganic elements ; and as he thinks, designs and materializes his thoughts, his sphere of action ever widens. He causes these elemental forces to do for him most toilsome service and in obedience to his will, new creations of beauty and use spring up before him, the fulfillment of his wishes. Again, there is a world open to him to which instinctive life has no access� a world of duties and of moral responsibilities. In the sphere occupied by man he is more of a sovereign than he is aware of. Man's place in creation is truly grand and full of possibilities. In his hands are the ever contending forces Good and Evil. At his will, either predominates. Fate and Destiny are in his hands. All the forces of heaven and earth are at his disposal. Hell exists because he created it, and wills it to be. But I must go ; my mission is to tramp, and tramp I will till humanity is elevated into physiological, moral and divine righteousness. Having closed, he lifted his bundle and disappeared. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
