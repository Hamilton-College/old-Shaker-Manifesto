CHANGE While earthly charms surround us, And all is bright and fair, That beautlfles our dwelling In this terrestrial sphere, For spirit is the power, And each material thing Is subject to the changes That hidden forces bring. Mayhap to search the future, Untraversed fields to roam, Or led by angel guardians, Revisit our earth home. 'We know these are but shadows, So, are our mortal dwellings, To mingle with our kindred, That, in the grand beyond, The substance without shadow Will to the soul respond. By spirit here controlled, 'Till silently we leave them For mysteries yet untold, Appear before their eyes, As, when we with them journeyed In earth's material guise.
