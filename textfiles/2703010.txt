Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1897. until the New Year had well advanced, could we say that we were having real winter weather. Mercury has fallen twenty below zero, and snow enough to afford good sledding for our hired help to draw logs from the surrounding hills to the amount of fifty thousand feet of lumber, also one hundred and fifty cords of fire wood. Yea, 'flowers are beautiful,' and they are not 'non-essentials.' God, through them speaks to humanity of things good and pure. Even the fine frost lace-work interwoven in the branches of the trees and shrubs remind us of God's creative power, also of the powers within, consistent thought and will-power that maketh beauty and fineness of life, like unto the exquisite work of the Infinite fiostmaker. We were pleased to read the remarks of Elder Giles in Elder Calvin's last note. Our spirit friends an 1 those of earth's inhabitants who have become spiritually illuminated know that before the brilliant curtain of human artificiality, life is dramatized in phases not real and pure. And should not professing Christians be as 'Battle Axes?' with voice, examples and pen, to cut away the evil that good may grow? Ah! if we would keep our sight upon the beautiful rain-bow of promise that spans' our life, 'Lo, I am with you always,' life's duties would be less irksome, and the halo of Christ's spiritual presence would prove sufficient strength to sustain through all burden and trial. Aye, if every soul burdened with grief Would seek in social communion relief, There would be less ingratitude and pain, Less censure, evil striving and disdain, In hearts where should exist naught but true love, As wise as the serpent, mild as the dove. George II. Baxter.
