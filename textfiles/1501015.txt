THREE TRAVELERS EMMA ALICE BROWNE Three errant angels, shod with starry light, Came thro' the gates ajar, at break oi day; And one was fair—clothed in celestial white; And one was dark, and clad in pilgrim gray: Pale rue and rosemary wreathed the locks of one— And one waa crowned with radiance, like the sun. And oue—the silent angel of the three— Was cowled, and shrouded close from crown to heel; Strange characters, in mystic blazonry. His palmer scrip and girdle did reveal; And weird devices, wrought in dimmest gold, (iliminered, or paled, upon his mantle's fold. Upon the rosy threshold of the dawn Their mingled shadows for a moment lay; And then, by some mysterious impulse drawn, They three went forth, on their appointed way; And ever farina: on, and hand-in-hand, They wandered far, thro' many an alien land. These errant angels, journeying day by day, Thro' barren wilds, or fruitful summer lands. Came to a low, green valley by the way Set in the midst of waste nnd desert sands: Beneath one stately palm a glittering shaft Of bubbling crystal water leaped and laughed. ' Oh! I am weary of the grievious road ! I faint beneath the burdens I must bear! Wild are the wastes, and thorns unnumbered goad My faltering steps : kind sleep awaits us there! ' Her listless golden head fell on her breast: ' Sweet comrades, let us tarry—I would rest! ' And Death, 1he sombre angel, turned aside With Life, the overburdened; fain was he In that dim valley evermore to bide; Butlo! the mute and shrouded, Destiny, With grim, resistless hand still led them on, To some appointed goal, yet far withdrawn! And Life, with bruised feet and failing breath, Bearing her heavy cross, still follows slow; Looking for rest and solace unto Death, When that far destined goal to which the,}go, That distant, unknown End, is reached at last, And all their toilsome wandering is past!
