RENOUNCING THE WORLD For three score years I've lived and toiled, Where selfishness has reigned supreme ; Where sordid hands have grasped and soiled All that was worthy of esteem. Like soldiers in their horrid strife To maim and slaughter all their foes, So men have struggled through this life, To gain its lucre crimes and woes. To heal the wounds of such a curse, Many have read, thought, preached and prayed, While still the world's been growing worse, Its downward course by nothing staid. After much study, now, the case To me seems like the Gospel way, Too plain for one of weakest race— Who loves the truth — to go astray. Can any live for self and others? Serve mammon, and his God as true ? Exalt himself, lift up his brothers ? Keep all he has — give to the poor? By aiming low, can we rise high ? Pursuing wrong, can we end right? Perceive the truth with double eye? Truly preach peace, and really tight? Such monstrous wrongs make fools and knaves, Crowding the road to endless strife, While simple views make moral Braves, Who lead the narrow way to life. As Bunyan writes, destruction lowers O'er all this silly reckless world; Why not then flee to the sweet bowers Where Christ is gathering all his fold ? Gladly I go to that sweet place, To that household of purest love, Renouncing all the world to embrace, And live and reign with Christ above. W. Perkins, Pleasant Hill, Ky.
