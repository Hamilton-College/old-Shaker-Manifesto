Br. Benjamin Smith made the following well-timed remarks in Sunday Service 'One of the speakers has very fittingly remarked that she desired to become a pillar in God's house. The thought occurred to my mind, that it was well for one to begin to act upon this resolve very early in life, before the result of a wrong course has left its impression upon the soul. We may liken the growth of a soul to that of a tree. When it is but a sapling it receives some serious injury, but it continues to grow until the mar is entirely concealed or outgrown : but finally a strong wind or tempest lays it low, and the broken trunk reveals the defect which it received when young, and rendered it unable to withstand the gale. I would that all of my young Brethren and Sisters would be wise aud shuu the unprofitable experiences of sin, which leave the soul so marred and scarred that one can never realize the satisfaction of giving unto God the full consecration of both soul aud body.' Canterbury, N. H.
