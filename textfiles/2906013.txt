Narcoossee, Fla. May, 1899. A better condition of things seems to be coming to the state of Florida. The present Legislature (styled the Iron Clad) have gone to Tallahassee fully clad in their armor, and determined to break down or make a change in the financial part of the Kailroad monopolies. The fare has been 5 cts. per mile and many think it should be only three. Express charges have been reduced. Now we think there is some hope for Florida. With all the floods and blizzards there seem to be ten righteous souls found to save the state. On the 17th of April, the writer of these Notes, visited our gospel friends at White Oak, Ga. I remained eight days, and found the little Community, like ourselves, struggling to establish a Communistic home on the basic principles, 'Purity of Life, Equality of the Sexes, and a United Interest.'' Our cause needs assistance. Needs members who are willing to be harvested from the generative order, and become as Brethren and Sisters. But with all our needs we do not propose to take any backward steps by coming down from the cross of Christ. On the 2nd inst. Br. Benjamin Gates and Br. Egbert Gillette, visited Jacksonville, to attend the Horticultural Convention, hoping to get a few notes of interest on the subjects of Horticulture and Agriculture in Florida. On May 3rd the mercury stood at 94 deg. Fahr. Amtreiv Barrett.
