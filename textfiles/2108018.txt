Watervliet, N. Y. July 1891. Elder Henry :ï¿½I send a few notes from the north family. We are busily engaged at farming and the making of brooms. We commenced the cutting of hay the 27th of June. We are anticipating some fruit from the apples, pears, plums, peaches, quinces and grapes. Elder Nathaniel Fry, who is 88 years of age, has raised and picked five bushels of strawberries this season. Pretty good for one of that age. We have about an acre in raspberries, of the red, 'Cuthbert variety. We are all interested in the Manifesto as a medium of communication between the Societies'. The Home Notes are a good thing. J. L.
