Juvenile. Dear Children:--Take care of your thoughts and your actions will... Enfield, Conn., 1888 Dear Children:�'Take care of your thoughts and your actions will take care of themselves.' ' What you love you think about: what you love, you strive to obtain. Good thoughts are like good air, invigorating and strengthening. 'Pure thoughts produce their image on the soul, and a beautiful image it is.' Pure thoughts are good company. Have as many of them as possible. The best guard against impurity of action is purity of thought. Every pure thought is valuable. ' When a thought comes to your brain, That would place on life a stain, Banish it from heart and mind, Eor a purer thought to find.' Keep your spirits constantly guarded with virtuous thoughts and no evil can enter there. 'To near your God be pure in heart.' Cultivate virtuous thoughts and you will gain untold happiness�riches without measure. Fit yourselves for that home where you wish to go. Keep your thoughts pure and you will make rrogress toward a healthy body and soul. Thoughts produce actions, actions strengthen habits, habits form characters. The more you strive for purity, the better. If you have virtuous, loving thoughts they will write themselves in your faces and manners, and they n&gt;ay be encouraging to those who read them. Your lives will be spotless if your thoughts are pure. Watch well what seed you sow, for from the seed comes the crop. Like will produce like. Watch against temptations, evil influences, all the wiles of the adversary. Otherwise there is no safety. Sow well, reap well. If the sowing be sinful, the harvest will be painful. If you sow thoughts that are impure, your harvest will be grief and sorrow. If you sow the precious seed of loving, virtuous thoughts, thoughts that will bear the fruit of truth and purity, you are sowing that which will yield rich returns. When you have for your companionship virtuous thoughts, you have an element of constant joy, and of constantly increasing joy. As you have sown, so shall you reap. The sowing has been in your hearts and lives, the reaping is there also. The precious fruits of the spirit are yours. If I have said that which will awaken in your hearts purer thoughts and higher aspirations, then am I blest and happy. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt. A CHILD'S EXPLANATION OF A TEXT. Christ said, 'If any man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned.' In the spring the dead branches of trees and vines are gathered and they are burned, and Christ took this illustration in his spiritual work and I understand that if I do not obey Christ's teachings and keep his golden rule, I shall be a little withered branch.

Danforth. One day a little bird flew through the open window into the room where we were at work. In trying to get out again, it struck the window with such force as to fall to the floor perfectly stunned. We carried it out and placed it in front of the house where we could see if it revived. Presently another bird came and hopped around it, then going a short distance, would return as though seeking to induce it to fly; but all of no avail; the poor bird remained motionless. The well bird then went away, but soon returned with another bird. They both went directly to the little senseless bird and began to peck its head vigorously. This continued a few seconds, when the unfortunate bird seemed to recover, arose, and all three flew away, apparently quite happy. Canterbury, N. H.
