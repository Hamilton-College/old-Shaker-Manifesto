BE YE BORN AGAIN. DANIEL FRASER. To be born of the Holy Spirit, is not ouly within the scope of human possibilities, bit it is in our destiny to be so born- -to be sinless, and to be holy- -to live for others- -to organize heaven upon earth, or in the laud ot souls. The spiritual emotions of our lower- - the human animal life, organizes family relationships and family partialities. These give form to the civilizations ' of earth. It is within the scope of man's will that these civilizations be just or malignant. If malignant, then there will be kingdoms divided against themselves as is the case to-day. To receive the Holy Spirit as a little child, be created, and help others to be created anew, are the beginnings of heavenly wisdom. That spirit created the Pentecostal church. And in these 'latter days,' Shaker Communities. They are the products of the Holy Spirit; they-cm be sustained only by, and through its operation. Separate yourself from everything untoward and ye shall receive the Holy Spirit. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
