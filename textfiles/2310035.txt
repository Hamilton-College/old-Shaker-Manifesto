CONQUERING LEGIONS. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y Maestoso. 1. The world is in commotion, and human hearts are stirred 2. In fire of agitation, and the living flame of zeal 3. In noble tides of feeling throbs the pulse of yearning hearts, 4. Adown the shadowy vistaes of the ages dim and vast, 5. Led by the conquering legions who will make no compromise, With passion strong, upwelling, and sense of hope deferred. Is wrought the bar of justice and truth's incisive steel. Who strive for the uplifting a truer life imparts. We hear the muffled treading of armies that have passed. Oh, may the suff'ring millions in freedom's name arise. Great wrongs are yet prevailing, and the battle must be fought Nerved be the hand with fortitude these mighty pow'rs to wield, Thro' sway of truth and reason with a deep and fervent plead, Thro' time's increasing war between the evil and the good, To strive above the sordid love of kindred, class or clan, the manifesto. 247 CONQUERING LEGIONS. With weapons that are tempered at the glowing forge of tho't. Till earth's usurping millions to righteousness will yield. Corne forth the marshalled toilers with a cry of liberty. The contest wages ever, till the right is understood. And follow him whose kingdom is the brotherhood of man. Chorus. Wake unto action in the glorious strife, Ev'ry soul to duty, press where the wroug is rife; Sheath the sword that's carnal, armed with godly might, He alone shall conquer whose life is in the right
