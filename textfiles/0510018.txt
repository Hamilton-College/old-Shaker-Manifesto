Anger. Never speak in anger, however much cause you may imagine you have for so doing ; as you not only lower yourself in the esteem of others, but lose your own self-respect, and consequently your confidence; and you cannot hold up your head with that manly or womanly dignity that you might have done had you governed your passion. ' He that is slow to anger, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his -spirit, than he that taketh a city.'
