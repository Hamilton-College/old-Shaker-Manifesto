TRUTH ELIZABETH MARTIN Truth fits to truth! An attribute of Him who reigns As King o'er all the powers that are ; What vital strength, what majesty It is revealing everywhere ! Truth fits to truth ! Already hewn by law of God— No need of plane, nor square, nor line, It ever is the same, its mould Attests its origin divine. i Truth fits to truth! No circumstance can change its face, No creed or system gave it birth; It was, and is, and is to come,— A part of God, diffused through earth. Truth fits to truth ! The more its virtue we employ, The nearer Heaven's gate we rise; The more it enters all our joy, We grow more just, more good, more wise. Truth fits to truth! Then let us build our character On solid truth's foundation stone ; And as our edifice we rear, Let every act be truth alone. Thus shall it stand Thro' Summer's smile, and Winter's frown, Thro' whatsoe'er may test and try; No power can tear the structure down, If truth its pillars underlie. Canterbury, N. H.
