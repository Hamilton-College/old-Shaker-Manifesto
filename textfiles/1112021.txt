ELDRESS POLLY'S SUCCESSOR The decease of Eldress Polly J. Reed necessitated the filling of the extensive vacuum occasioned in the ranks of the Central Bishoprick, of which the deceased has been so competent and honorable a member Eldress Harriet M. Btjllard, for several years the senior of the Novitiate order at Shakers, N. Y., has been chosen to occupy the burdensome, responsible, and honored position. Those of us who have been intimately acquainted with her for many years, know her to be altogether competent, worthy, and an unexcelled champion of our faith. We are safe in assuring all that the interests of the faith and organization will only improve under her administration, in company with her senior companions ; and the original force and determination of her character for the right will be ever and righteously administered. The mantle has undoubted fallen properly. Those who would be pleased with an article from her pen, we refer them to closing chapter in ' Plain Talks ; or AVhat must I do to be a Shaker ? '
