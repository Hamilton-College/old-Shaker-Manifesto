A TRUE LIFE. By Annie R. Stephens. HOW many earthly lives does each day and hour bring to a terminus, but how few are true; how few, comparatively, live to their highest ideal of right, and how many are governed by their lower, selfish desires. We find ourselves placed in this world, with strong impulses and propensities, THE MANIFESTO. 131 the enjoyment of which may produce momentary pleasure, 'but the end thereof is death.' How natural it is, especially with those of inexperienced years, to follow the guidance of these impulses, and consequently reap the bitter fruits of self-indulgence, the effects of violated law, and instead of a life filled with promise and nobilit}7 of purpose, make of it disappointment and sorrow. Some time since, I was standing on a street corner in one of our large cities, waiting for a car; while there, a number of children of the lower strata of society gathered around ; such an accumulation of rags and dirt I never before witnessed. As I looked into their young faces, and saw depicted, even at their tender yjars, the marks of that triune monster�poverty, sin, and suffering,�I realized with deep anguish their deplorable condition; their homes, instead of being homes in the protecting and endearing sense of the word, are hovels of drunkenness and vice; associated with like companions, they become acquainted with every conceivable form of crime; their feet, thus placed on the steepest declivity to sin, how can they, under such conditions, unfold the higher powers of soul and glorify God by living a true life. AVith this sad picture before me I could but pity, where otherwise I would condemn; I could not throw the first stone of reproach, no matter how high I may estimate virtue ; if placed in like circumstances, the results might be similar. Never, in the history of mankind that we have any record of, was there a time when so many souls have devoted their powers of mind to philanthropic movements for the uplifting of the unfortunate. Society is greatly to blame for the many w rong conditions that exist; when justice is done, and all have their God-given rights bequeathed to them, much of the sin and suffering will be averted. Humanity is composed of many incongruities ; owing to our preconceived opinions on religious subjects, the diversity of education, and the various circumstances of life that form our characters more or less, it would seem difficult to prescribe the limits for a true life; and yet, when we look at it from a practical standpoint, it is easy of solution. Goodness of heart is not produced by beliefs nor opinions; it is a growth through obedience to principles that are eternal. 'We find within ourselves diverse natures; the voice of one cries, 'live for pleasure and the enjoyments of this life;' the other says, 'deny thyself, thou wert made for higher purposes than the beasts that perish ; thou wert made to subdue the earth in thine own soul, to conquer and bring into subjection to the law of Christ�by the stronger God-given faculties of the mind�all the elements that are of the earth, and to reign triumphant over all the appetites and passions of the body; thus develop that angelic life that is eternal.' The grand work of redemption lumes up to our minds like an ideal vision ; it comes to our souls as an inspiration from that radiant throng who stand 132 THE MANIFESTO. transcendent in victory; but, unless each one strives for that redemption we can not realize its blessedness. 'It is well to think well, it is divine to act well;' it is not aspiration and noble thinking alone, that constitutes a true life, but noble action and right doing; they that do the most good, who embody in their daily lives the precept of Jesus,�'Do unto others as ye would have others do unto you,' who are pure and true and honest in all the relations of life ; these are they who make of life a success; they connect themselves with all good, and are thus brought near to God where they can feel the warmth of his beneficent sunshine in their hearts, illuminating the darkest way and lifting the heaviest burden. It is in the power of us all to attain to this altitude of goodness. It does not require extraordinary talent nor genius. It is not for the recluse nor the religious devotee who counts his rosary, or repeats the most prayers. No matter what our belief, we may pray with our faces to the rising or setting sun, or towards Mecca, if our faith so directs. These things count for but little, compared with that practical life of righteousness we are all called to live. If we love God, and through our love to Him are striving to make the world brighter and better by improving our own lives and doing all the good we can for others, then we shall feel that we have not lived in vain. Life comes to all with its burdens and crosses; its temptations to be resisted. By bearing whatever it has for us cheerfully, bravely and nobly, we make of it a triumphant success; this, God requires of us, and our own conscious integrity demands it. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
