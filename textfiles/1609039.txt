We are in receipt of a large and very carefully executed engraving of the new Standard Oil Company Building, 26 Broadway, New York, which is noteworthy as the finest business structure on the greatest commercial thoroughfare of this continent. The enormous granite pile, 200 feet deep, and almost two hundred feet in height from foundation stone to pinnacle, is entirely given up to the executive offices of the Company, which is entitled to credit for having added so imposing and enduring an example to the great commercial monuments of the Metropolis.
