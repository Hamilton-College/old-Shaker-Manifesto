A word to the aged A word to the aged.â€”It is well for the old to be cheerful. They may have much to depress them. Health is failing. Friends are passing away. Another generation is on the stage. Other hands take up the world's work. They feel, perhaps with bitter regret, that they are not needed as they once were. Nevertheless, they should cultivate every source of happiness which remains. The love of children and grandchildren, the greater dignity and larger leisure of life, and the quiet hours they can have for communion with God, should be appreciated highly. They should get into the habit of saying good-morning every day to this world, where they have had so many eager, busy, happ_y and holy days.
