INFINITE INTELLIGENCE. O. C. Hampton. Infinity is either one or nothing. I believe in the Supreme Being or Infinite Intelligence which runs the visible and invisible universe, and which is the sum of all that is. The old impossible nonsense of two Infinities, which logically, mutually and mathematically and inevitably destroy each other I abandoned long ago, their very expression being an unpardonable solicism. This Infinite Intelligence consists of Love and Wisdom, qualities the same in essence but differing in manifestation. And again by this apparent law of differentiation these qualities are shaded off into many other dual appearances as faith and patience, sincerity and peace, joy and sublimity, male and female, positive and negative, music and flowers, painting and poetry etc. etc., ad infinitum. Among human beings those who are inspired with noticeable aspirations toward higher, holier and sweeter lives may be considered as belonging to the positive class, while those who seem to be making no noticeableupward progress may be conveniently catalogued as the negative class. In reality both classes are inevitably progressing, whether they know it or not. Heredity and environment are sufficient to account for all the characteristics of each class�the goodness and worthiness of the former ;�the apparent badness and unworthiness of the latter. Then who art thou O egotistical and self-righteous man that presumest to judge another? Jesus said, 'I judge no man.' We are no better qualified to judge than he was. O what boundless room for Divine charity he left in his doctrine for us to exercise toward all, enemies as well as friends, the negative class equally with the positive What boundless love the Supreme Being has toward the just and unjust. And yet Jesus requires this same love to all on our part, for he says, 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect,' and to show how literally and practically be requires us to carry out this injunction he adds, 'who maketh his sun to shine THE MANIFESTO. ��85 upon the evil and the good and sendeth his rain upon the just and the unjust.' It is a lamentable fact that the majority of us are inclined more to condemn the negative characteristics of our fellow beings than to speak of and encourage their positive virtues, which after all are the only real qualities pertaining to them�the only elements that will not finally pass away. Years ago I heard a Brother (who is now in Heaven) say, 'I think Believers would do far better to cease dwelling on the negative side of character and encourage the positive only ; if a man seems full of hatred, gently and patiently set forth the beauty and joy and peace of love' etc. etc., so on throughout the category of the virtues and their negatives. If the love of the Father is Infinite, He must necessarily love Judas as well as he does Jesus, because to talk about degrees in an infinite quantity is nonsense. What a vista of joy and eternal glory this opens up to us, what a stream of everlasting consolation, to be able to love every being in existence and thereby enable all to finally reach the regions of unbounded peace, joy and forgiveness we ourselves enjoy. What greater boon can fall to the lot of finite man, to become infinite in love and savingpower to his fellow man. And this is possible for us all. Union Village, Ohio,
