The Manifesto, the monthly magazine... The Manifesto, the monthly magazine put forth from Shaker Village, N. H., published by the united societies of Shakers, says : ' We have no desire in this matter to exalt a personality, but to invite attention to the movement of which that personality was the center, and to ask the wise and thoughtful to consider whether it be not the same power and intelligence which raised up and supported Ann Lee and her disciples, as instruments of good to mankind for a century past, that is now directing and controlling the phenomena of Spiritualism. Both movements are despised and feared by the world, which shows that they are not of the world' for doth not the world love its own? Both are in their infancy, though one has somewhat the start of the other, and it can be no more intended for them to remain so, than that a child should always remain a child. ' Will our Brother be brotherly enough to listen to one outside his fold concerning the Good Shepherdess whose memory is so sacredly dear to every faithful Shaker soul? There are those in your community who shall feel the truth, inspired by Ann Lee's own soul, when we say her angelic presence has shed around us that influence of peace and security and perfect happiness which can only come from sympathetic relation with the Infinite. Will you accept a message? Then deplore not the loss of those who have withdrawn from your societies. Let your prayers follow them; and seek closer communion among yourselves through that spirit of love that is universal, and which cannot be manifested through strifes and discords. The essence of spiritual power is harmony. A single family in a condition of spiritual unity can stand against the Prince of Evil and all his powers of darkness. The crown of victory is now almost within your grasp. Be faithful to the end. The World's Advance Thought.
