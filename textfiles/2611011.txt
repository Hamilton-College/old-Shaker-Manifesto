West Pittsfield, Mass. Oct. 1898. A glance at the calendar tells us that it is again time for our monthly call at the Home Corner, and though it seems hardly possible, that same calendar has stood the test of nine month's constant use, with a strictly truthful record and we can not but believe it now, so I take my seat with you once more, thinking I shall like the proverbial gossip, keep my satchel always packed, and bonnet strings untied, ready for the next call. Although the inward life of individuals is subject to constant change, and the soul is continually expanding or contracting, the outward forms may be similar to those of years ago. So it is in our quiet home. Day succeeds night, bringing its duties to be performed. The seasons come and go in their prescribed order, each fulfilling its particular mission, and the harvest follows the sowing. But as 'Nature abhors a vacuum,' and, 'The secret of life is action,' so we daily endeavor to improve our surroundings, and ourselves, that we may say with the minister of old, 'I am nearer the kingdom now than when I first believed.' We have recently been blessed by the presence of friends from other Societies. Having one life, one purpose, one baptism, what stronger tie could we claim to 180 THE MA NIFES TO. bind us in one relationship, than Brethren and Sisters in Christ. Brs. Timothy Rayson and Washington Jones, and Sisters Corrinne Bishop and Esther Gill, spent a Sabbath with us, leaving with us pleasant memories of their musical visit. A Brother and Sister from Enfield, Conn., tarried here for a short time. Messengers from the White Mountain state, came for a look at the Berkshire Hills. Br. George Baxter from Enfield, N. H., and Elder Henry Blinn and Brother Arthur Bruce of Canterbury, each of whom we shall remember. We have realized the strength which a spiritual union imparts, and gave us courage by witnessing that which a life of perfect consecration to God's service can bring about. Fidelia Estabrook.
