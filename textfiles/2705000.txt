THE SHAKERS. ITEMS OF DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENT. By Henry C. Blinn, NOW that we have made extended remarks on the religious side of Shakerism, a few items in regard to their social order may not be out of place. We readily admit that the Shaker Community is a peculiar organization, and that the people to a certain extent have chosen to keep themselves separate from the general order of society. This is in accordance with their views, and seems perfectly consistent, as well as in harmony with their religious experience, as it affords advanced privileges in all that pertains to their religious and secular life, and yet it has not a shadow of unpleasant seclusion or dislike to mankind. It may also be very natural for those who are not fully acquainted with the Community to wonder how the Shakers live,�what food they eat; how they manage their domestic affairs ; and in fact, whether they do live like other people. A Shaker family may contain ten, twenty or an hundred persons, and by their system of Christian fellowship maintain a united interest in the peace and prosperity of each other and work industriously for the temporal support of the whole family. By adopting this system of religious belief, and organizing a home so distinct from the homes of Christians generally, it has at times aroused those of an inquisitive mind ; and while wondering, they have supposed many things, guessed many things, and then asserted many things MAY, 1897. that never existed only in their own fertile imaginations. This wondering becomes contagious and hence our willingness to illustrate the social side of the many little affairs of community life. The Shakers have consecrated to God all their time, with all that they have or may have in possession. Their lives are then given for the good of humanity, agreeably to the testimony of Jesus, the Christ, as found in the New Testament. Some have gone so far as to assert that the Shakers neither read nor believe in the Bible. A more^ correct statement would be made by saying,�But few of any class of Christians can be found who have given closer attention to the reading of the whole Bible, or encouraged the stiMy of it more fully, among those of all ages, than have the Shakers. The war of words that has arisen over the plenary inspiration of the I'ook, is of about as much value as the chaff that is blown away by the wind. Christian pugilists and active infidels are readily found on every corner who enjoy the opportunity of giving vent to their pent-up zeal. Neither party cares a straw whether Saturday or Sunday is observed as a day of rest, but make it more of a matter of 'might over right.' The Shakers believe that the Bible is the best inspirational record of the doings of God's peculiar people in all ages of the world. That it contains wonderful revelations through dreams, visions and trance inspiration, and abounds in prophetic knowledge. To study the Bible that we may walk more in harmony with God's law for the best good of humanity, is of much more consequence than to champion the Book because of sectarian influence. It is quite common to be askt,�'How do you settle difficulties that arise between individual members of your Society ? ' In a Christian Community the members must be governed by the spirit of Christ. The contract which has been signed by those entering the Society, and the Rules and Regulations of the Order, which are for the same purpose as the by-laws of other societies determine quite clearly the course that must be taken by each member toward every other member. To injure another person by word or report or by deed produces disunion, and the trespass must be corrected by confession or acknowledgement. The correct government of the mind is an essential Christian discipline, and to be able to maintain a gospel relation, a good union and fellowship must be sustained. No member has a right to trespass upon the privileges of another, and if this is done, either carelessly or willfully, an apology must be made, or it should be made a subject of confession. As there are some sixty or more Shaker families in the United States, and as these families are in a liberal degree quite independent of each other in their domestic arrangements, it would be about as difficult to write concerning them as it would be to write of so many individual families in any village. The directors of these Communities generally designate the time for rising in the morning and of retiring to rest at night, and yet this may be so varied in many ways, for the aged, for the infirm, for those deprived by special cares, and for the little children, that it can not by any means become a fixt rule. The custom of rising and of retiring becomes so much a matter of habit that 'Poor Richard's' advice is readily accepted,�'Early to bed and early to rise.' A class of people who retire at midnight or even later must also rise late if they are to obtain sufficient rest. The hour for breakfast, dinner and supper are determined by each family as may best suit themselves through the different seasons of the year. In the preparation of food for the table no special rule can be carried out unless all should agree to a certain kind of diet. In the several villages may be found a variety of classes, and some of these like good Bible students follow the counsel of St. Paul;�'Whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no questions for conscience sake.' Others having entered the ranks of the Reformers anticipate a brighter future for both soul and body. Swine's flesh is not eaten in any Shaker family, and indeed, no consistent Bible Christian would make use of it. Eating and drinking have become largely a matter of taste, and 'every man must be fully persuaded in his own mind' what is conducive to health :uid happiness. Coffee of many varieties and tea of many shades are used in the several Societies, but I have never heard of a Shaker who reacht the half dozen cups that Carlyle is said to have taken. In connection with eating and drinking, so. essential to the health, comes the general care of the body. This is one of the great blessings of God. The air we breathe ; the food we eat; the garments we wear and the rigid cleanliness we maintain, should all be intelligently reduced to practical usefulness. Every family of Shakers keeps a herd of cows and manufactures more or less butter either for use at home or for the market. Since the introduction of the silo and the raising of ensilage, the farmers have been able to increase the number of animals kept during the winter season and since the introduction of the separator, several families have availed themselves of this wonderful machine. The Ferguson and the Cooley creamers are also in use, and some still retain the pans and the accompanying rack. Carlton, in his journey around the world, found the boys and girls in every country, just the same as those that he had left in his own home. They can no more avoid running and jumping and sliding, and laughing than they can avoid breathing, and it is well that it is so. The children of a Shaker Village can not be other than children. God bless them and their active, welldisciplined and joyous life. No system of religion will ever be able to drive out the fun that bubbles up as naturally in childhood, as the water from the spring. Age will bring the burdens of a more mature manhood and womanhood and then the duty to God and the responsibilities before man will fill the mind and bring burden and care. Some who have written about the Shakers must have been somewhat dis- ordered, as their articles have been so sadly distorted, or as Samanlha says, 'they must be meaner than pusley.' The Shakers are very much like the inhabitants of the section of country where they reside. Their general cultivation and customs, habits and manners if better in any degree, must be made so by conformity to the mission of Jesus, the Christ. To read the third chapter of James occasionally will have a very salutary effect upon the mind for reading or speaking. I think it would be the exception to find a Shaker family that was not well supplied with reading matter, either in books or papers, or that did not understand the general topics of the day. In some families, even the children in common with others, have the active events of the day read to them from a daily paper, while they have ample opportunity to acquaint themselves with other forms of literature, if they so choose.
