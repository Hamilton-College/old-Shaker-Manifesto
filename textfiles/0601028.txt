JUDGMENT Religiously born and religiously educated, we have a high appreciation of sacred history. Jonah, as appears, was a prophet of the Lord — unwillingly so. The whale was elected or ap- pointed, to teach the prophet the way of submission. But really, what have we to do with Jonah, or with his whale ? With the people of Nineveh, we have something to do. They rise up in judgment. Where, in the world's history, find we a nation, a people, a city, against whom the Ninevites rise not up in judgment? Religious organizations, in special manner, stand condemned before high heaven, by the example of Nineveh. The nearer right a religious organization has been, when it departs from the principles of its organization, the more inveterate the power behind the throne, that runs the government machine, against the prophet of the Lord, against the voice of reason. The Lord God of Heaven is about to deal with the dwellers of his little planet; first with Organization, Political and Religious— such as are found wanting in the virtues of their founders — such as hold not fast the good of the past, and lay hold of the good of the increasing degree of Light and Life, will be found, if found at all, among the things that were, but are not. Let those who occupy high official station, beware of the power behind the throne. Let them heed the voice of the Living God, by messengers sent unto them. Let them remember the people of Nineveh. Let them purge themselves and their people of the accursed thing ; for, behold I come quickly — have come — to give unto every man and every woman, according as their works shall be. Truth Seeker
