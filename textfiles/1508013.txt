CHEERING THOUGHT When life's pilgrimage is over and its cares and trembles end, Ere we enter the dark valley whither all our footsteps tend, How 'twill cheer the solemn moments if we feel that this is true, That the world is some way better for our having traveled through ; Some of its sorrow lessened, some of its darkness turned to day, Some of its thorns uprooted, some of its burdens rolled away.
