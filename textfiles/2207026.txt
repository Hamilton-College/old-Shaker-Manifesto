Enfield, N. H. June, 1892. We had thought we would leave our allotted space this month for matters more important, when, at the eleventh hour, a friend inadvertently made a statement bearing rather upon the appreciative of what has heretofore been forthcoming from this branch of the vineyard, and gave us an impetus to keep on the move. Such is the power of influence; true it is that 'the clarion voice of duty should ring high above all other lesser sounds,' and yet, we all at times find ourselves just human enough to joy in the knowledge that even one finds benefit or satisfaction through our feeble efforts; it is said that there are birds that sing the sweeter when caged and oppressed, so there are human birds who apparently enjoy doing a duty for the very love of it, but they are exceptions, not the rule, until that height is reached. We were especially glad to hear from E. O. who wrote for the brave little circle in Canaan, that happy land, who are denying self if need be, that they may be without hirelings. One writer says, 'there is a touch of flavor in garden sauce that a man never gets until he swings the hoe,' and no doubt the vegetables and fruits that find thtir way to your frugal board, are far more welcome, and sweeter to the taste, for having been coaxed into perfection by your own willing hands. The spiritual atmosphere of the home without hirelings, as a matter of simple cause and effect, must be of a higher order; we shall be interested to hear from you often, who have thus begun to build so wisely. Rain lias reigned with us, as elsewhere, but it has only made the green look greener, thus enhancing, if possible, the beauty of the natural scenery. Old Mascoma never over-reaches the bounds of propriety, so we have had neither flood, nor flame, nor cloud burst to cause alarm. E. B.
