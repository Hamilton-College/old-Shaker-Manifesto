Shaker Village, N. H. Jan. 1882 Harry Shaker Village, N. H. Jan. 1882 Dear Mother, Mary Ann C ;â€”I send my love to you. I am pleased with those cards yoii sent me. When I am not in school I carry some wood to the Cottage, where sister Mary and sister Marcia live. Sunday, I learn a Bible text to speak in prayer meeting. Every Wednesday evening at 5 o'clock, the children have a singing school. I learn a good deal and I like to go to school every day. Last summer I watched the Honey Bees to see that the swarms did not fly away. Please give my love to sister Tamar. Thank her kindly for my pretty card. My love to you, my mother. Good bye. From your little boy.
