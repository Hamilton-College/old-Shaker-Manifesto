The Christian in the World A true Christian living in the world is like a ship sailing on the ocean. It is not the ship being in the water which will sink it, but the water getting into the ship. So in like manner the Christian is not ruined by living in the world, which he must needs do whilst he remains in the body, but by the world living in him. The world in the heart has ruined millions. How careful are mariners in guarding against leakage, lest the water entering into the vessel should, by imperceptible degrees, cause the vessel to sink. And ought not the Christian to watch and pray, lest Satan thus entering in, bring him to destruction, both to body and mind? The world anc the things of the world press upon us at all points. Our daily avocations — yea, our most lawful enjoyments, have need to be narrowly watched, lest they insensibly steal upon oui affections, and draw our hearts awaj from God.— Church Union.
