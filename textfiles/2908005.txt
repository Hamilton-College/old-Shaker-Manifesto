LOVE. By E. B. Gillett. Love, turns defeat to victory, And keeps the colors flying; And in the soldier's heart re-lights The embers almost dying. Love turns the tide, and rifts the cloud, And cheers the lonely sailor; And fills the sails with merry gales, And calms the stormy weather. Love warms the cold, and cools the heat, . And makes a blessing of defeat; It turns the blackest night to day, And leads us, in a wondrous way. Olive Branch, Fla.
