THE DOGMATIST'S CREED Believe as T believe — no more, no less ; That I am right, and no one else, confess; Peel as I feel; think only as I think; Bat what I eat, and drink but what I drink ; Look as I look; do always as I do, And then, and only then, I'll fellowship with you. That i am right, and always right, I know, Because my owu convictions tell me so ; And to be right is simply this : To be Entirely, in all respects, like me. To deviate a hair's breath, or begin To question, and to doubt, Or hesitate, is sin. I reverence the Bible, if it be Translated first, and then explained — by mo. By churchly laws and customs I abido, Tf they with my opinions coincide. All creeds and doctrines I concedo divine, Excepting those, of course, Which disagree with mine. Let sink the drowning, if he will not swim Upon the plank that I throw out to him ; Let starve the hungry, if he will not oat My kind and quantity of broad and meat; Let freeze the naked, if he will not be Clothed in such garments As are cut for me. 'Twere better that the sick should die than live, Unless they take the medicine T give; 'Twere better sinners perish than refuse To be conformed to my peculiar views, 'Twere better that the world stand still than move In any other way Than that which I approve.
