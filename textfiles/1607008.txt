THE MANIFESTO. WATSON ANDREWS. Unpretending in literary excellence and plain in appearance as our little monthly is, still to the spiritually enlightened, enough to perceive that 'religion is the vital fountain of virtue ; ' those who have '' tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come ;' and hence are under the influence of an intelligent faith in the Christ gospel, as received and taught first by the male and second by the female portion of humanity. Souls who have this faith and have been obedient to its dictates sufficiently long to be assured of u the doctrines, that they be of God ;' to such the Manifesto is a most welcome visitant, affording, as it does, a soul foodï¿½drafts of living, inspirational waters, compared with which all popular literature is no more than the husk to the kernel, the wrappages to the contents of the package, affording a strength and encouragement so much needed in these lukewarm times.
