The Theatre The Theatre,â€”is a harmless little pamphlet of some eighty-live pages. We do not wish you to go into the theatre, but rather to go through this book in careful consideration, and possibly you may gain some new points of information. It is published by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass. The writer of this little work is evidently fully persuaded in the mission he has taken upon himself and enters it with a zeal that is highly commendable. Believing that the theatre is prejudicial to the life interests of the Christian and exerts a baneful influence over the minds of all classes, lie not only comes forward with a personal protest, but brings with him a formidable array of witnesses who through actual experience or from observation believe that the play houses and theatres are no less than 'the gates of hell.' The author next enters the churches and handles the Christians without gloves. This gate way to heaven has its church 'guild' and pool tables, and billiard tables, and fancy dress balls with theatricals and bacchanalian songs, all brought in to obtain a little money with which to convict the poor heathen. Send for 'The Theatre' and ascertain the position you occupy for the good of humanity.
