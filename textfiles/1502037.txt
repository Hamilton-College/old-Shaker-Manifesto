IT PAYS. It pays to wear a smiling face, And laugh our troubles down, For all our little trials wait Our laughter or our frown. Beneath the magic of a smile, Our doubts will fade away, As melts the frost in early spring. Beneath the sunny ray. It pays to make a worthy cause. By helping it, our own ; To give the current of our lives A true and noble tone It pays to comfort heavy hearts, Oppressed with dull despair, And leave in sorrow-darkened lives. One gleam of brightness there. It pays to give a helping hand To eager, earnest youth, To note with all their waj'wardness, Their courage and their truth; To strive, with sympathy and love, Their confidence to win; It pays to opep. wide the heart, And ' let the sunshine in.
