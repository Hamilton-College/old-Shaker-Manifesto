Enfield, N. H. May, 1897. On May oth, our Society met with an irreparable loss in the demise of Sister Julia Kussell. The departure of so valuable a member is only consolable in the sweet anticipation of our future meeting when we exchange the germ of materiality for a spiritual robe of immortality. Living justly and purely, life becomes glorified in Christ. Should grief assail, if out of the waters of tribulition we piss upon the golden sands of moral solidity, we shall receive from the spiritual censor of God's love, soul strength and consolation. Difficulties insurmountable? 'Where there is a will there is a way;' and in the wilderness of human imperfection, the ax of industry in the hands of earnest heartedness only hews off all unprofitable branches that disfigure the tree of life: whereas the jump rope of pleasurable ease never rids of that which defileth. Thus in the life of Christ, and with the knowledge of right and wrong which experience gives, no one his an excuse to walk blindly from the way which requires willing service for the good of home and humanity, that tones life to the key of harmony with Christ and enables one to read the notes of Christian service in every law of righteousness, prompting the strife to 'go and sin no more.' Sister Fanny Fallon has opened the summer term of school with twenty-two pupils. Our maple harvest was very short, consequently the yield was less than that of last year, yet one hundred and ninety-five gallons of syrup were made. Our kitchen garden, under the fostering care of Brother Fred Houndslow, gives promise of a satisfactory yield of good things. While busy hands are active in caring for the temporal needs of our Society, may our lives yield but those fruits which bless Zion and fashion us after the Christ life. George H. Baxter. ?1
