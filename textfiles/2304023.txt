M A.RCH, the lion month of the year, came in just as we expected from the rough experiences of stormy February, but although storms and tempests have outwardly raged, the inward peace of the band of faithful Believers within our gospel home remains unbroken and undisturbed. Peace and plenty, temporally, and especially 95 96 THE MANIFESTO. spiritually, being the order of the days as they come and go with no thought for the morrows. We are all glad to welcome Eldress Eliza Stratton, of the North Family, to the renewal of her former duties in the Ministry. Some fourteen years ago she removed from the Ministry and became an indefatigable Trustee, afterwards succeeding to the duties of Eldress at our North Family. The order of Ministry requiring her services once more, our Sister comes in again with a hearty and general welcome. As one comes, another goes, for the removal of Eldress Eliza to the Church necessitates a corresponding removal from it, and we bid God speed to our Sister Elmira Hillsgrove who leaves us for the North Family to become associate with Eldress Harriet March. Amid the various changes of life the uppermost thought is constantly with us that the purity of life lived by all souls, compose the Zion of God, and not houses, lands or a multitude of people. This thought leads into another, that of all the papers in the land, our little Manifesto should be the most spiritual in its'aims, from north to south teaching the use of all things as not abusing them, with the constant injunction that all our treasure-stores are being laid up in the heavens where neither moth nor rust can corrupt. This should bear the stamp of the united effort of a united people, to render to God all things with equal gospel non-reservation. With this full spirit of resignation, we become more united and receive from the heavens a deeper baptism into the spirit of Christ, receiving with meekness the power of God into our souls, we need never be afraid of becoming worldly or too deeply engrossed with the various business duties that await our willing energies. Our Sweater business affords us, by a steady receipt of orders, as much work as is desirable for our spiritual growth. Sister Lucy Ann Shepard has temporary charge in the absence of Sister Dorothea Cochran. Br. William Briggs finds scope for all his various resources of mechanical ingenuity to keep the machinery in smooth going order. Our Br. David T. Williams, as engineer, is unremitting in his attention and care, leaving no room for anxiety in that direction May God bless our dear Brethren and Sisters who are working among the intricacies of the machinery. Then there is Br. George St. John, who with that forethought which his able predecessor Br. Arthur Bruce always exercised has already taken time by the forelock in the direction of spring garden operations. He is attending the usual early seed potatoes as they are sprouting for special forward garden planting. Albert Evans. ï¿½
