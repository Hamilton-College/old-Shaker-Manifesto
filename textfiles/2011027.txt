White Water, O. Oct. 7, 1890. We are getting along nicely, still improving a little day by day. We have just finished putting up a hen-house. It is 12x24 and 8 ft. high. We do a great deal of .carpenter work ourselves. Br. James Collins, a hired man and the writer put it up. Elder Lafayette Parker helped us to shingle it. It is just as good as a carpenter could do it. We have commenced drawing logs for stable floor. Elder Henry, Eldress Amanda, Sisters, Melissa Carpinter and Rebecca Me Guire have started on a visit to Watervliet, 0. Will be absent four days. H. W. Frederic.
