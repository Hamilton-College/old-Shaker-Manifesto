Though not the close of the year, still it seems that 'finis' is written on every thing about us, and we are preparing to take up new duties, and look upon new scenes. Every one is busy to secure the fruits of summer toil, and put things in order ere the very severe winter, that birds, frogs, squirrels, nuts, and even corn-husks prognosticate. If the signs given by instinct prove true in this case, why can we not hereafter, link instinct to reason, and be weather-wise in season. Brother Walter was just a month too soon in closing our Society meetings. We have continued up to date, and if our large meeting house could be made comfortable for winter gatherings, our interest would still lead us there, since we have no other meeting room large enough to accommodate the six families of our village. We compare with interest each month the weather reports of New Hampshire and New York, and if we had the reports from our south-western Societies, it would still add to the interest, to note the difference. During September we find our thermometer varied 44 degrees, while in New Hampshire it was only 33 degrees. New York had ten inches of rain, and New Hampshire only two inches, Taking a thoughtful interest in every South Family. Nov. 1893. We have been trying to get out of the little end of the horn, but find we can not. So think we must come out just as we entered, at the same time showing we have not by any means been standing still. We are all quite well considering our ages, which range from ten years up to ninety-seven. All summer we have had beautiful Sundays; not once have we tented on the Old Camp Ground, but have marched on and off toward the Promised Land. Some not of our Order, have attended with us, quite a number of our good friends, such as Mrs. Dr. Newton and Mrs. Talcot from Pittsfield, and John Duss, Trustee of the Economist Society, and many others, who know the value of even a few righteous souls. We appreciate the good Brother, John Scovel, who came here to live from Canaan. He is very helpful, as good carpenters can be. October has passed away beautifully, and November stepped in the same, finding every thing nicely stored away for the cold winter we expect and will surely get. We did well and did reap the blessing. We have dug over fifteen hundred bushels of good sized potatoes, the largest weighing twenty-six ounces. Last year, our good dairy sister marked out three thousand lbs. of butter, not quite that amount this year. Elder William and his trusty helpers, have put down nine hundred feet of water-pipe, to supply the stock with water this winter. Sarah A. Collins. tiling and every one about us, is what makes life a continual source of pleasure and enjoyment. And though the leaves have fallen, and the birds have flown, we still remember that when the curtain falls on the growing beauties of nature, that there is a spiritual harvest to which we can now concentrate and consecrate our labor. Amelia J. Calver. Shakers, N. Y.. North Family. Nov. 1893. The admonition of Elder O. C. Hampton in the Oct. Manifesto is timely. It is a call to duty that should be heeded by every one that has the interest of the cause at heart. Our Beloved Ministry came on the 21st ult. to their Valley home laden with the gifts of the Spirit for their children. O ye weak kneed and trembling ones, do ye not hear the sound of the 'Conquering Legions' as they are marching to the support of those loyal souls who have held and are still holding the fort against the powers of darkness? If not, quicken your spiritual perceptions and you will realize that like an 'Army with Banners' they are marching on. On the 17th of Oct. we had our first heavy frost that destroyed tender vegetation. The month has been very pleasant. It has been one of the old-fashioned Indian summers. An ancient work of some 600 pages on 'Gardening and Greenhouse Management,' published in Dublin, Ireland, in 1784 has lately come into our possession. It formerly belonged to Br. Proctor Sampson. It is interesting to review and compare it with modern works on the same subject. While reading in the Nov. Manifesto the beautiful tributes to the memory of those dear Mothers who have passed away, we thought of the counsel of Mother Ann, to live as if we expected to live a thousand years and as if we were to die to-morrow. We want to whisper courage to our own souls and to our comrades and when called to walk in tribulation may it be that which worketh a spiritual cleansing of the soul. The invitation to our Beloved Editor will never be cancelled. We have a goodly number here of those who have not merely viewed Mt. Zion but are standing thereon. Our trio of Elders are interested in maintaining the testimony, and it is ministered to the dividing asunder of flesh and spirit. We will say 'let the testimony roll.' Hamilton DeGraio. Shaker Station, Conn. Nov. 1893. 'He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much.' These are the words of our Savior, and how true do we find them. To deviate from faithfulness even in a small degree, will harden the heart and lead to greater departures from right. Faithful in small things. We should live by the principle that 'whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.' Only those who have done well, can expect the 'well done.' Without faithfulness there is no promise of reward. Let us resolve that what was well done, shall be better done. Let us tell others how they may shun the pitfalls of sin and we shall show them the sincerity of our friendship and love for pure principles. Superior choice may we display by shunning that which is sinful. We can not look into the future; let us improve the present. Now is our time, do not let us miss it. ***** It is not profitable to keep too many fowls in contracted quarters, without any opportunity for exercise. A teaspoonful of sulphur once a week, given in their soft food, will be beneficial as a stomach regulator. Ginger in poultry food is recommended as a tonic. Oatmeal is the best food for chicks for the first month, regardless of cost. Opinions vary as to what food is best for poultry. It is rare for two poultry keepers to agree exactly as to what articles are the best for egg production. Some people use various kinds of soft foods; others use grain almost entirely. The best feed undoubtedly, is that which runs to neither extreme. Soft food entirely is apt to produce bad results, while all hard food is inclined to diminish egg production. Variety in poultry food 'is the spice of life.' Brown Leghorns lead all others as layers. Daniel Orcutt. Those are the best Christians... Those are the best Christians who are more careful to reform themselves than to censure others. ï¿½Fuller. Enfield, N. H. Nov. 1893. I&gt;~ the Thanksgiving number of the Manifesto, we expressed a hurried note of thanks to all who kindly aided in our Commemoration. It is so very unusual for any one, outside the limit of their immediate local home, to spend time or means for meetings, or conventions of any description that this instance calls forth gratitude and remembrance. Similar gatherings for the discussion and adoption of improved methods in temporal affairs, and the re-kindling of spiritual fires, is one of the future needs of our Societies. The account we mentioned as hoping to furnish, will not appear in this book, but take form elsewhere; some copies, no doubt, will find their way to our 'loving friends,' as soon as finished, but having less means than good-will we shall be obliged to say, any one sending a dime, will receive said pamphlet. This Christmas number of the Manifesto closes the year eighteen hundred ninety three, and may there come to us a renewal of the genuine Christmas spirit. Would it not be a profitable study the coming winter, for the different Sunday Schools who are interested to know of a reason for the hope that is in them, to make a list and memorize, for individual benefit, the passages of Scripture which place and teach, purity, communism, and confession of sin, as the primitive, basic pillars of the pentecostal church of Christ. A joyous Christmas and a prosperous New Year to all. Mary Ella Briggs. North Family. Nov. 1893. The one hundred years of fruitful life which has marked our Society was appropriately observed Oct. 18th. What countless visions appear as the mind lingers lovingly upon the works of the noble pioneers of our several homes; what indomitable courage manifested, what victories achieved, despite surrounding difficulties, which to-day seem to many among us like insurmountable barriers; but those gallant souls 'in sacred pledge of human fellowship,' toiled bravely on; with 'no surrender' as their motto, they triumphantly sang the 'songs of the gospel of humanity;' and by their faithful consecrations is entailed to us a most valuable legacy, and it remains for us to keep untarnished past history and nobly live in the present. As true as obscene art is the product of a sensual mind, so true it is that all goodness is the fruit of a consecrated life to God; for it is impossible for an individual to raise his life high in merit without a corresponding elevation of mind; and all religious societies prove their worth, not by creeds, but by beneficial fruits to humanity, by demonstrating those attributes that characterized the life of Jesus, the Christ. Doubly valuable was our Commemorative Service made by the presence of kindred souls from Mt. Lebanon, Harvard and Canterbury. It was also pleasant to have with us our friends and neighbors belonging to other churches. May the day never dawn when our doors will be closed to those not of our faith and Order of life. We can but hope that our Centennial exercises will not only bind us closer in the circle of co-operative interest and fraternal love, but that Zion may ever be ready to manifest her God-given gifts, and sow broadcast the seeds of truth, peace, and purity. George H. Baxter. Alfred., Maine. Nov. 1893. The beautiful Indian summer is still with us. What a pity it could not continue till the other summer came to take its place. But perhaps we should not prize it as much as we do now, so prone is human nature to forget to be thankful for common blessings. No frost to injure the tenderest plant till the 17th. of Oct., and yet we live away down in the state of Maine. The short crops were the sooner har- THE MANIFESTO. 289 vested, leaving more time for the farmers to remove the boulders that have vexed the plow these many years, such improvements are for all time, and will bless the generations yet to come, when the places that have known us shall know us no more forever. Twenty-five acres plowed this fall which would be but a small piece for our western Brethren, whose cultivated acres are numbered by hundreds. All in our home are enjoying that greatest of blessings, good health, and using the strength thus given to serve the Lord our God, with singleness of heart. We extend our kindest love to all our Gospel relation far and near. An earnest prayer to God for Zion's prosperity is the Christmas gift we give to all. Fannie Casey. Union Village, O. Nov. 1893. The good old patriarch Job says, 'Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.' Even if that is so I am sorry he said it, for it opens such a wide door of excuse, (almost license) to the fault-finding pessimist. It is indeed, almost enough to sadden the countenance of the sunshiny optimist. O that the voice of the faultfinder and complainer were silenced forever. He is brother to those poor old negations, gossip and slander. Every word uttered in finding fault with another, is instantly photographed upon the astral medium, and conveyed with the swiftness and ruin of a poisoned arrow to the party aimed at, whether such party be conscious of it at the time or not. It will sooner or later most surely work its fatal effect. Always does,ï¿½no exception to this law. I am resolved to ignore the negative, discouraging side of existence and cultivate the positive side which brings so much righteousness, peace and joy of the Holy Spirit into our lives. 'From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.' Therefore if we have sunshine in our hearts, and talk sunshine it will have healing in its beams, both for sickness and sorrow. But if we are lorever having clouds and invidious criticisms of others in our hearts, we shall talk these and nothing else. Now I know these things are true from experience. Then the Bible affirms it, and when I quote the Bible I feel as safe as the little girl, who, when disputing a point with another little girl said, ''I know it's so for mother says so and what mother says, is so, if it aint so.' The Bible says 'A merry (optimistic) heart doeth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit drieth the bones.' Now for any thing to be like a medicine it must cure sickness and restore health and comfort. Here is an equal chance for us all to turn doctors and healers, instead of being 'troublers in Israel.' What a glorious change! Union Village is enjoying good health and excellent weather. If you could see all that Elder Joseph has done for the convenience, comfort, and artistic beauty of our premises you would be surprised if not confounded. 'And generations yet to come Will bless the memory of his name Yea, enter in and fill the home, And be partakers of the same.' as we fondly hope. But it will not pay them to come in with the sublime idea of subjecting the hells and setting Heaven Order among Believers. No man since the fall need consider himself sufficient for this; but let him come as a learner and disciple and he will find that we can do him good and make him happy. Our beets, which, for the last two years were eighteen hundred bushels, this year were only five hundred owing to the protracted drouth. Our potatoes and also all fruits were nearly a total failure; but 'Although the fig tree shall not blossom, yet we will rejoice, yea we will joy in the God of our salvation.' We have removed the heater from the Office into a new engine house just completed ; being twelve or fifteen feet west of Office, it is much more comfortable and convenient. It keeps dirt and coal dust 290 THE MANIFESTO. from the cellar and gives us the advantage of replenishing the boiler on the gravity system. There are plenty of hickory nuts, walnuts and butternuts, t3,is fall and the young folks delight in going to the woods for them. Last Saturday our beloved and welltried aged Brethren, Elder Henry B. Bear and Elder Stephen Ball came from White Water on a visit to Union Village for a few days. Every one was glad to see them. We had a blessed time in our morning Society meeting and again on Monday evening when we entertained them with singing, and toward the close sang and played the beautiful Farewell Hymn in 'Shaker Music.' I never enjoyed a visit more than I did with these two veteran saints. They expressed themselves much comforted with their visit and departed on Wed. morning for their home. A few weeks previous Eldress Ellen- - - - -Br. Thomas Mann and Sister Grace Rudduck visited White Water, and had a very enjoyable timeï¿½every thing and every body being brought into practical requisition for their entertainment, comfort and hospitality. I would not do without the Manifesto if I had to sell my necessary food to purchase it. There are no end of good, pure, sweet, spiritual sentiments as well as domestic felicities expressed in the Home Notes. Kind love and thanks to the whole Editorial staff and others who contribute in any way to the support of the Manifesto. 0. C. Hampton. Ayer, Mass. Nov. 1893. 'There is a good time coming and it will soon be with us.' These were the words of a seer, spoken in our religious service, who with spirit sight looked through the mist into the future, for the prosperity of our Zion home. Let the weak take courage and let the strong rejoice. God, our Heavenly Father has us in his keeping and He will give the increase if we faithfully do our work. Of late being privileged to visit our Gospel relation in Canterbury and Enfield, we found the spirit alive to the ministering of our Gospel testimony. Not only by words of peace and love to one another, but a desire to see it on its mission, as a power to do good among the children of men. Would it not be well for us to give a little more attention to this work, 'Where there is a will there is a way.' How did our Mother and the Elders do when their little company consisted of only twelve witnesses? They made it their first business to herald the good news of free salvation. God gave them this mission. God gives us the same mission when he says, 'Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.' 'God helps those who help themselves' and all that we may do in his name, will never go unrewarded. Let us 'put on the whole armor of God' and make no compromise with the sins of the world. Among all our friends we felt an earnestness for the prosperity of the Gospel testimony, and it awakened a response in our own minds. Let us not delay to do the work, which God would have us to do. Our faithfulness in this all important work, will not go unrewarded. Saturday the 5th, we had quite a little flurry of snow, telling us what we may expect in the near future. The work for autumn is about finished and we are now engaged cutting fire wood. The Sisters are engaged in the duties of the home, a problem they have thoroughly solved. Andrew Barrett.
