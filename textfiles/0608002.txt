NO E. T. LEGGETT How many a hell or a Heaven below, Is made by that wonderful arbiter No! Weird child of the doom is that magical word ; Fate bows in submission wherever 'tis heard: How many a soul going lost to the grave, A heart-uttered No would inspirit and save ! How many of desolate hearth-stones there are, This champion word of our language would spare! How little this word, yet a monarch in might! Just born of a breath and a child of the light; How Godlike in meaning! how trenchant and brave! How potent to shield and how mighty to save \ The wealth of the Indies in diamonds and gold, The fame that encircles the brows of the bold, How powerless they to protect us below, Compared to that mighty magician, a No ! How many a hero of field or the flood, With 'scutcheon red-written in letters of blood. That, dauntless, would charge all the furies below, Yet hesitates, falters, recoils from a No ! Thus Eve was beguiled in lost Eden and fell. When Satan wove round her his mystical spell; Her lips faltered yes, while her heart beating low. In vain sought for courage to utter a No. What folly in hoarding the world-worshipped ore, Or delving in darkness for mystical lore; Or seeking high up in the temple of fame, With heroes and martyrs to blazen our name, While lacking that jewel, more precious and rare, Our spirit's sheet anchor, the courage to dare To utter, when sin is enticing below, No half-hearted yes, but a ichole-hearted No!
