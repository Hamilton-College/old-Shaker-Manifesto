Ann Eliza Colburn Ann Eliza Colburn, Dec. 20. at Second Family, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Age 62 yrs. 1 mo. and 22 days. The torch of hope with flickering light Burnslow,-which once was bright and clear, The truest mourners earth hath known Repine for thee, our sister dear. Our hope, our stay, our joy, our pride, So rudely taken from our sight We almost doubt the trials worth, And question-Is the suffering right? o Father, throned in power on high, In pleading thought on suppliant knee We ask for strength to bear the shock, And turn not from our trust in Thee; But patient in the strife for right Endure life's trials as they come, 'Till wrapt in death's calm drapery, we Shall enter our Eternal Home. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
