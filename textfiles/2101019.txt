Hancock, Mass. Dec. 11. 1890. Dear Editok:â€”To the readers of the Manifesto we extend kindly greetings. May peace like a benediction rest upon each one as the Old Tear closes its brief existence; and may health, happiness and prosperity be apportioned to all, especially the Household of faith throughout the coming New Tear. May God's blessing 16 THE MANIFESTO. 17 crown, as heretofore, the unceasing efforts of our efficient Editor, and unity, love and spiritual power be increased in our Zion Homes. We have thus far had only light snowfalls, yet, the ground being well frozen there is good sleighing which the Teamsters are improving. As King Winter with his chilling breath, compels us to be more retired, and increased opportunities for reflection are afforded, we hope, with good Eld. Timothy, to be able to gather more of the fruits of the Spirit. Br. Daniel in Nov. number gives us sound and valuable truths. His remarks upon thankfulness, impure air, and foul drains are truths which humanity would do well to accept and wisely heed. We have long been convinced that proper ventilation, and good drainage are essential to health and happiness, also that cleanlmess is next to Godliness. Our Venerable Father Elder Frederick utters another truth when he says 'no one can be a perfect Christian unless he has good bread to eat, and much less, ex- except he breathes pure air.' We believe in good conditions. Our environments have much to do with our happiness. J. L. S.
