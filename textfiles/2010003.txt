Sheffler. II. The proper way to resist evil is to absolutely refuse to do evil either for one's self or for others. III. It is by those who have suffered, not by those who have inflicted sufferings, that the world has been advanced. IV. It is the curse of every evil deed To be of many others the ever fertile seed. V. To tell the truth, to advocate liberty and equal rights regardless of time, place or audience is throwing pearls before swine. VI. In adversity keep up In prosperity keep down : Will lighten the heft of the cross Remove all thorns of the crown. VII. No roses without thorns, many thorns without roses. VIII. You never will please each and all, yet be of good comfort and cheer�vanity is all. IX. Good advice? When you need it, you don't get it, if you get it, you (think you) need it not, but mind the best advice comes on crutches�always behind. X. Of all kinds of shame, the worst, surely is the being ashamed of frugality or poverty. Livy. XI. Love all, trust few, do wrong to none. XII. I am strongly impressed with the necessity of urging the moral side of non-flesh-eating. I am throughly convinced of the impossibility of the emancipation of the race from all disease, cruelty, tyranny and lust, until men cease to mingle the 'blood and life of beasts' with their own moral and physical nature. �Julia Darling in 'Food.'
