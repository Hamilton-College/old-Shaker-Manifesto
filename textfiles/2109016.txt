One of the ''essentials'' to take with us on our Christian pilgrimage... One of the 'essentials' to take with us on our Christian pilgrimage, is a Comforting Assurance that our life is in harmony with the Christ life. We may have a great many other things, abundant treasures that have been accumulated in 'this world, but if this special one is omitted, it may call forth a great deal of anxiety and cancel a large amount of anticipated happiness. A very great multitude 'out of every nation' are on this same spiritual journey, having their own religious assurances, and transporting more or less of the treasures that belong exclusively to their order. Many of these parties are gifted in asserting rights and claiming privileges, as though the Holy City was in their special keeping, and they were expecting a speedy entrance. Plow fortunate it is for all this great company of religionists that their theologians have arranged for them a halting place or trial station, which they have designated as the spirit land or as purgatory, where they can rest and open their life books, square their accounts and have judgment rendered. A thousand classes or a thousand religious orders are on this line of march, preaching a thousand forms of theology and bearing aloft a thousand crosses of varied shapes, sizes and colors. All are looking forward for their style of happiness, for their kingdom of heaven, and yet not one of this vast assemblage has the exclusive right of way into the Holy City. It is no wonder that some one has said that 'the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and violent men take it by force.' A better passage, however, comes to mind as an invitation to all these Christian crossbearers. 'Come. He that is athirst, come, and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.' With this comforting assueance our pilgrimage becomes more and more beautiful, as we are privileged to drink of those waters welling up unTERMS to everlasting life. Over this interesting passage from the good book, no wayfaring man need hesitate in his simplicity, to share the hope of such a promised reward. Egyptian, Christian philosophers however, have ever been able to determine with far greater accuracy the very essentials that are requisite for a right to the better Land, and have formulated creeds of mystical theology and established a monopoly on the highway of the crosses. But wTe have no use for creeds as they are man-made barriers in the path of religious experience, while the systems of theology are of about as much value as is the chaff that is threshed from the wheat. Credent churches are dominating churches, and where prayers are ineffectual, the sword, the rack or the stake are brought forward to assist in proselyting. The majority of the churches teach,ï¿½'Whoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic faith. Which faith except every one do keep whole and undcfiled, without doubt, he shall perish everlastingly.' Into this faith a thousand doubts have already found an entrance, but if the above is correct all these thousands of doubters must perish everlastingly. Having no use for the creed, and having chosen a very different form of faith, what assurance have we that we are made better by what we do have. Peter, in a letter to his brethren asks them to 'be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you.' 1 Peter iii., 15. Our mind is quite like that of the apostle, on this subject. We would not wish to move along blindly, nor to perish everlastingly. Better have an assurance that the cross we bear, the life we live and the faith which has been delivered to us is just what it should be. Religion is now better known by the manifestations of the mind, than by any forms or ceremonies that can be devised ; and 'to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world,' is of far more consequence. This is the incoming of the kingdom of God as it is to dwell among men. It exalts the cross of our Lord Jesus, the Christ, by whom, as said Paul, 'the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.' Gal. vi., 14. If the thousand or more forms of religious life which are being developed in the world amidst the ceaseless disputations about which the advocates know but little or nothing, could only be laid aside, they might be far better representatives of the mission of Jesus, and in that way so establish themselves as to be ready for his second advent which has been promised Jo come among men, without sin unto salvation. This, above all things else would increase our Comforting Assurance as we pass along on our pilgrimage to the city of our God.
