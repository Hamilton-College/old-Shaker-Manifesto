LOVE CONSTITUTES MY CRIME Madame Guyon IN PRISON. Love constitutes my crime ; For this they keep me here, Imprisoned thus so long a time For Him I hold so dear. And yet I am, as when I came, The subject of this holy flame. How can I better grow! How from my own heart fly! Those who imprison me should know True love can never die. 5Tea, tread and crush it with disdain, And it will live and burn again. And am I then to blame? He's always in my sight; And having once inspired the flame, He always keeps it bright. For this they smite me and reprove, Because 1 cannor, cease to love. What power shall dim its ray, Dropped burning from above! Eternal life shall ne'er decay, God is the life of love. And when its source of life is o'er, And only then, 'twill shine no more. 1648-1717â€”
