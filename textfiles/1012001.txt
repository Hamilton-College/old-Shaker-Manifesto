NEW YEAR'S RESOLVES DANIEL ORCUTT A Suggestion. The beginning of a new year is a starting point, with many people, for the discarding of bad habits and the formation of good ones. If any of our readers are inclined to charge themselves with being too selfish, with having too long lived without endeavors to benefit themselves and others, we hope they will begin the new year by trying to do better. We would suggest one direction in which efforts in this respect will give satisfaction. Let them select from their circle of friends the names of such as would be likely to be benefited by reading The Manifesto, and send the addresses to our office, with sixty cents each for a year's subscription. New year's gifts of this kind would be, to many persons, not only acceptable, but in the highest degree beneficial. Many people have had occasion to be deeply thankful 266 THE SHAKEK MANIFESTO. that The Manifesto ever came in their way. Either they have been directly benefited by something observed in its pages, or it has set in motion new trains of thought, or inspired new impulses; the results have been seen in successes of a moral and spiritual character. There are thousands of people who would be profited by the regular reading of our journal, for it has a direct tendency to draw the mind from sinful pleasures, and attract it toward that which is elevating and pure. Those who are not subscribers should now enroll their names; those who already enjoy the privilege should forthwith extend the same to their friends. Let us commence the new year with the endeavor to do all the good we can, every day, and if we do not grow weary in well doing, the year 1881 will bring forth an abundant harvest of heavenly treasures.
