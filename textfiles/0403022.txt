FRAGMENTS Prudence and economy are essential to the success of individuals, and are the main- springs of true and lasting prosperity in families and institutions. All are familiar with the teachings of Jesus, after he had fed the multitude that had followed him, either from motives of curiosity, or for the loaves and fishes, or to be instructed by him; he made no difference, but supplied them all. He then taught his disciples, through whose agency the bounteous meal had been served, an important lesson of prudence, which was, ' Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.' That was a fundamental principle with him, to which he gave practical illustration at that time. He felt the responsibility of his mission, which was to put an end to the Levitical laws and customs pertaining to the flesh—the generative life—in himself, and his followers, and of setting up a new and spiritual kingdom that would be founded on Virgin Purity; the fruits of which would be ' Peace on earth, and good will to man.' He felt that the physical necessity of those who would gather to the New Order, which it was his work to begin, must needs be supplied, which could not be done, except by strict economy ; and this idea he wished to impress upon the minds of his disciples, on whom the burden must rest when he should pass from their sight. The same principle, and the same language, may be applied with equal force to mental, moral, and spiritual, conditions, ' Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost.' Intuitive knowledge gained through mental perception should be carefully treasured, and not wasted; for through that medium we may gather an inspiration that will enable us to ' give to those who ask a reason for the hope that is in us.' Instructions and admonitions, and even suggestions, in a moral point of view, should claim our strict attention, and be stored in our minds as too precious to be wasted. Every fragment of truth, relative to the welfare of soul or body, should be gathered up. ' Order is Heaven's first law.' Then every gift and blessing should have its place in our hearts in order, according to its worth. All the essential principles taught by Jesus and his Apostles, in the first appearing of Christ, have, after many centuries have passed, been revived by the second advent of the Christ Spirit through Ann Lee. She taught all her followers ' to put their hands to work, and their hearts to God,' and to be prudent and saving of every blessing, both spiritual and temporal; and that, as we cannot make one spear of grass, nor one kernel of grain grow, it would be sin to waste them, and that it is a Christian duty to gather up every fragment, that not any thing that is worth saving may be lost through carelessness or neglect.
