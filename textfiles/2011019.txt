NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Although in the home notes for New Lebanon in the Sept. No. 'enough' was the unanimous verdict rendered on the rain question, we have since found that there was 'more to follow.' September rivaled its weeping predecessors ; but the heaviest rainfall since September 1869 in cur locality, was between the 15th. and 18th. of the month. The earth could hold no more and the water seemed to flow in sheets over the surface. We on the mountain side with a succession of ponds and reservoirs above us had some cause for alarm, until after much exertion, at just the right moment the floodgates were opened. But what relieved us, added to the misery of the inhabitants of the valley below, and we could look with commiseration on the spreading water in the valley, while the people there were equally sympathizing with us as they saw the muddy torrents pouring over our hillsides. The under-ground drains became so filled with driftwood, (and even fish) that they refused to secrete the troubled waters, and sent them broadcast almost to our doors; and for a time on the morning of the 17th. we were unable to ford the current by the street fence without rubber boots; and we watched with anxiety as it crept closer to our doors. But arduous and steady labor on the part of the Brethren, at last narrowed the floods to their proper bounds, and we rejoiced that our well-made dams and reservoirs had so nobly proved themselves. It will yet be some time probably before the wash-outs will all be filled in as smoothly as before, for on surveying the premises the next day we could but repeat the poet's words : 'A morning-glory o'er a ruin The blue sky seems to-day So worn and storm-clad is the earth, So prematurely gray.'

Dear Elder Henry :�We have succeeded in securing our apple crop in good condition; picked between three and four hundred bushels for winter supply and have gathered Squashes, Beets and Beans. Cabbages are bursting open badly, partially in consequence of excessive moisture and partly in being transplanted too early in the season. Our people are much pleased with the appearance of the tile flooring in kitchen department. Our Ministry returned here from Watervliet on the 8th. inst., Elder Daniel somewhat improved in health; Elder Giles not so well. Sisters in usual health. \ Your Brother, T. Eatson. Sontli Family. Oct. 3, 1890. Dear Editor:�It is said 'there is a time for everything.' We sometimes think there is, but not much time for writing. We are enjoying these beautiful autumnal days and only wish they would tarry a long time, before the snow comes and our picturesque scenery must go. We will make the best of the coming winter, hoping that Oct. 1891 will find us all better and wiser. We are cutting and drying sweet corn. It is very nice. Brother Henry is securing some good winter apples ; not a full crop by any means. Last Sabbath day we met at the meeting-house again. We have not missed once this season, there has been more speaking than ever. If every one could preach as Elder Frederic Evans did last Sabbath, evil would not long be in existence. Our Saturday evening meetings for prayer are very necessary, but not as substantial as our Society meetings are. S. A. C.
