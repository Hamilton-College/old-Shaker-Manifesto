An Item — The day has overtaken us wherein we have the happy privilege to be participants in the increase of Christ's Kingdom. In what line of action will that increase manifest itself ? Will it be in forms of belief, about which graceless bigots fight ? or in a right life, which all can commend, and about which all can agree. If in a right life, what may be the laws which govern that life? The laws of that life are threefold. First. Divine law, manifested by benevolence, mercy and aspirations God-ward. Second. Moral law — love your neighbor as yourself. Third. Hygienic law — do nothing against your own body. The increase of Christ's Kingdom will apply these laws to all the ramifications of human emotion, thought and action, till there is nothing in us that is not of God. D. F.
