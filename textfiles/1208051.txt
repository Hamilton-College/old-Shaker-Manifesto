EXALTATION OF ZION. Thou art exalted above all the hills That surround thee, O Zion; Blessed be thy name, thy name forever; Blessed be thy name, thy name forever; Blessed, blessed, blessed be thy name, thy name forever. For in thee is established the kingdom of Christ, Wherein dwelleth righteousness and peace. The wanderer here may find a home, The sin-sick soul a healing balm. Nothing can destroy or harm In all God's holy mountain. Beautiful for habitation is mount Zion. Beautiful, beautiful for habitation, for habitation is mount Zion, is mount Zion. Beautiful for habitation is mount Zion.
