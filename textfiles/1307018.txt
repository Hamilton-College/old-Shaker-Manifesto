CAUTION. LEWIS HORT0N. 'He that does not provide for his own household hath denied the faith.' This may be strong language, but nevertheless true. To take it somewhat to our own household, a brief explanation may be necessary, namely; they who do not take wise precaution in regard to the physical and moral wellbeing of those who are dependent upon their care, fail in some degree in the faith and calling which they have espoused. If there are mistakes in this line of duty, charity reminds me they are unintentional, errors of the head, not of the heart. Those who were sent out into the world in olden times to preach the gospel, were cautioned to be wise as serpents and as harmless as doves. Can we not be wiser than serpents, and as harmless as doves? We should have a care, the world is teeming with contagious diseases, as alarming as the vices of a cultured and an uncultured civilization, especially in cities and other crowded localities. By one false step, sometimes years of labor and exertion are lost, the doors of the household are left ajar, the destroyer creeps in, and sorrow follows the gaunt figure through the aisles of the sanctuary. Isolation is a strong rampart of defence ; watch well upon its towers and if we must needs go beyond put on the whole armor that we may be safe from the physical and moral malaria of the world. Within lies our spiritual gardens, blooming, if we will, with the fragrance of heaven, bright with divinest love. May His Kingdom come in all sanitary 158 THE MANIFESTO. measures, pure air, pure water, cheerfulness, health and happiness. Stanc by the ship now and forever. Canterbury,N. H.
