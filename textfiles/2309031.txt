NO TIME TO LOSE. Annie R. Stephens. WRITTEN FOR THE CHILDREN. 'No time to lose,' say the tiny buds As they catch the spring-tide's beam; We must open our calyxes green and gold, E'er our wonderful bloom is seen. 'No time to lose,' say the blithesome birds As they fly with straw and hay,� THE MANIFESTO. 221 Not even time for our sweetest song, Till the daylight turns to grey. 'No time to lose,' say the busy bees, In these golden sunny hours, We must sip the dew so pure and sweet, From the cups of a thousand flowers. 'No time to lose,' say the working ants We're always busy you know; We gather our store in the summer days E're the winter brings the snow. 'No time to lose' say studious girls While our school-daj7s glide away, We'll fill up our minds with every good, Nor waste precious time in play. Then we will learn from the buds and flowers From insects,�the ants and bees; Lessons of industry, patience, trust, Nature is teaching us these. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
