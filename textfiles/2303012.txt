The year of 1893 is already moving on... Shaker Station, 1893. The year of 1893 is already moving on, and what of the past? In our memories live events which come home to every individual experience of more or less importance, and that which does not appeal to our intelligence, our love of humanity, our wisdom, our Christianity, has seemingly been sown on barren ground. Is not the beginning of a New Year to every soul, the commencement of good resolutions, and firm resolves, that will bring peace and satisfaction, if each one seeing the necessity of reform shall practice it daily, and advocate it at all times. Into every human life there comes an hour when the brand of the interpreter of human thought is thrown, kindling the fire of selfexamination and criticism, calling upon each individual to pour out ttuoffering of his life upon the shrine of truth, justice, and mercy, that will take hold of humanity with a spirit to shape its destiny. The New Year should be the beginning of decision against wrong, a starting point for individual growth, and the awakening of higher aspirations after the true principles of religion. Purity, and consecration, shall be typified in all my diily walks throughout the year, with expressions of gratitude for the blessings I have enjoyed in the past. Maria With am.
