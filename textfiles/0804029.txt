A French agricultural journal, the Basse Cour, describes the result of some experiments in potato growing recently conducted by scientific men in Germany, in which it is demonstrated that the 'eyes' at the top of the potato produce a much more vigorous offspring than those in the lower part, and the consequence is that those agriculturists who cut their potatoes in half before planting them are not well advised in cutting them vertically, but should always divide them horizontally, planting the upper half, and using the other as food for cattle.
