SHAKER LAW G. B. AVERY To all whom it may concern : Running in debt is contraband by Shaker Organic Law; and the adoption of any form of contract by a Shaker, which recognizes an obligation to make a payment or payments posterior to the date specified in the contract of purchase, is violation of Shaker Covenant law. No Shaker Society is constitutionally responsible for the payment of debt contracted by any member of a Shaker community ; and, wherever it has been done, or may be done on account of past transgressions of Shaker laws, it is under protest. ' To hear good teaching and not obey it Is to run in debt and never pay it.'
