OUR FLANNELS The value of flannel next the skin cannot be overrated. It is invaluable to persons of both sexes and all ages, in all countries, in all climates, at every season of the year, for the sick and well; in brief, I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which flannel next the skin is not a comfort and a scource of health. It should not be changed from thick to thin before the settled hot weather of the summer, which in our Northern States is not much before the middle of June, and often not before the first of July. And the flannels for the summer must not be three-quarters cotton, but they must be all woollen, if you would have the best protection. In the British army and navy, they make the wearing of flannel a point of discipline. During the hot season the ship doctor makes a daily examination of the men at unexpected hours, to make sure they have not left off their flannels.
