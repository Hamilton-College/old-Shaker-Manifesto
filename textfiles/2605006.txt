Shakers, N. Y. North JETamily. April 5, 1896. The remarks of Mother Lucy Wright which commenced publication in the April Manifesto, reminds us that the 'ancients of the city' have not passed away, although removed from our material recognition; but are near to us many times when we are not cognizant of their presence. Why the Reaper could not have spared Elder John B. Vance for a while longer is past the comprehension of our finite understanding. We well remember his first visit to our western home in the summer of 1869, and though we were but a child his personality impressed itself upon us to the realization of his exalted character. March maintained her record by giving us the heaviest snow storm of the season. In comparison with the spring before, the present one will he late. At present writing many snow drifts are visible, and winter is loth to surrender its claims. Hamilton DeQruw.
