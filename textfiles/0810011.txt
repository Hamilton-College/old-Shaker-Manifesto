THE WATKINS CONVENTION We were very kindly and respectfully treated at the Liberal League Convention. Our addresses were listened to with much interest, and very many questions were asked regardful of Shaker life and principles. But it wras very apparent, that the Materialists were determined that neither Shakers nor Spiritualists should predominate in influence there; and they therefore made efforts beyond the ordinary that Mate- rialism should not be compassed. We were very happy and satisfied, however, that the masses, by thousands, never accepted much of Materialism in preference to radical Christianity or pure Shakerism. As at Watkins, so will these latter find a preference whereever they may be diligently taught.
