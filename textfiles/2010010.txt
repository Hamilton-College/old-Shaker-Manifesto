TICKETS TO HEAVEN. According to a correspondent of the Pittsburg Dispatch, the Swiss federal authorities have just been calling to account the abbot and monks of a celebrated monastery for driving a thriving trade in 'Tickets to Heaven.' Since the first of the year, 45,000 tickets have been sold, which indicates an immense amount of gullability in those parts. But really these tickets are better in their conditions, and cheaper withal (beiDg only 15 cents apiece,) than those that are distributed among their credulous crowds by some of our American revivalistic scalpers. These Swiss tickets are ornamented on the face with the coat of arms of the monastery, and have on the back the following:� While traveling, take roots of faith, green leaves of hope, roses of love, violets of humility, absinthe of repentance, myrrh of mortification, and some wood of the cross. Bind the whole together with the thread of resignation, place it on the vessel of prayer, and let it boil over the flower of love with the mineral water of moderation, closing with the cover of silence, expose during the night to the light of meditation. Take one cupful morning and night, and all life long you will enjoy perfect health. Toll-booth and entrance into heaven. In order that your baggage may pass the barrier of the celestial toll-booth, place humility at the bottom of your valise, over that put obedience, and on top a prayer of contemplation, roll up the parcel in the wide folds of' the clcak of zeal for the salvation of the soul, take the umbrella of love and go straight to the station of the house of God. A curious mixture that, of sense and superstition, sincerity and knavery, benevolence and cupidity, but deducting all the superstition, knavery and cupidity, there is surely the worth of 70 centimes left in the recipe ; and many times the worth of some of the revival recipes current over here.�Christian Standard. [The above writer seems to place the Catholic Monks and the Protestant Revivalists in the scales, and wonders which will tip the beam. The monks certainly should be commended for getting up a very nice religious recipe, and if the purchasers are careful to follow the prescription, we think they will become pretty good pilgrims. It must 'be a very dull Catholic or Protestant that could not be benefited, to the value of fifteen cents, by the perusal of an article so novel and quaint.�Ed.]
