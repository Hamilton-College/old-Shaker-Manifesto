THERE IS NO DEATH. In Memory of Phebe Ann Jones AMELIA CALVER 'There is no death,' a wiser poet said, Than those who deem this changing life of ours A dying one. 'Tis but uncultured thought, That fastens terror to the sure decline Of mortal life. The blossom falls, and we Eejoice that soon perfected fruit comes forth; The real successor of the fragile flower. And e'en these ripened treasures are but forms, That hold the living germ, the deathless seed, Which in its turn, in earth's cold bosom hides, New life to start. And thus from year to year, From age to age 'tis life increasing life. O friends, Our sister is not dead, nor e'en may we As sleeping think of her; that casket which, Hath long unworthy been to hold so pure, So fair a jewel of the heaven-wrought type, Unclasps its rusted lock, and angels take The sparkling treasure to its home above. Dear sister we have loved thee long, and fain With sweet affection's cord would hold thee here, To lustre add, where oft earth's leaden clouds Too sombre are. Thy cheerful spirit was A beam of light; which seemed astray from heaven s Own fair, effulgent radiance. And O, Thy spotless, pure and virgin life, will leave Its regal worth, enstamped upon the hearts Of all within the radius of thy light. O tell us, can a richer treasure pass From earth to heaven, than an immortal soul, Unblemish'd, pure and snowy white? 'Tvvould seem That angels e'en would pause with lowered wings In humble reverence ere they bear away A gift so rare. But sister dear, we will not think of thee, As gone from home and friends, or buried deep Within the damp of earth; but will rejoice To know, that now untrammeled, you can flit Among thy earth-life friends, and tell us how, In spirit life you found that endless bloom, Which faith and hope, and love, and charity Have given thee Mt.
