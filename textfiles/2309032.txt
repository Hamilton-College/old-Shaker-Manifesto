OUR ADVOCATE. Sophia Wayne. We welcome thee with message clear, Through every month throughout the year, Thy words bring to us hope anil cheer. Our Manifesto. Though conflicts rage and strifes increase, Who advocates the reign of peace, And seeks from sin souls to release? Our Manifesto. Who shows 'the way, the truth, the light,' Declares, 'My servants do not fight,' Condemns the rule that 'might makes right?' Our Manifesto. Our pure, bright harbinger of love, That bears the spirit of the dove, Thy blessed truths our hearts approve. Loved Manifesto! Ballston Spa. N. Y.
