REMEDY FOR INSECT BITES When a mosquito, flea, gnat, or other noxious insect, punctures the human skin, it deposits or injects an atom of an acidulous fluid of a poisonous nature. The results are irritation, a sensation of tickling, itching, or of pain. The tickling of flies we are comparatively indifferent about; but the itch produced by a flea, or gnat, or other noisome insect, disturbs our serenity, and, like the pain of a wasp or a bee sting, excites us to a remedy. The best remedies for the sting of insects are those which will instantly neutralize this acidulous poison deposited in the skin. These are either ammonia or borax. The alkaline reaction of borax is scarcely yet safficiently appreciated. However, a time will come when its good qualities will be known, and more universally valued than ammonia, or, as it is commonly termed, 'hartshorn.' The solution of borax for insect bites is made thus : Dissolve one ounce borax in one pint of water that has been boiled and allowed to cool. Instead of plain water, distilled rosewater, elder, or orange-flower water, is more pleasant. The bites are to be dabbed with the solution so long as there is any irritation. For bees' or wasps' stings, the borax solution may be made of twice the above strength. In every farmhouse this solution should be kept as a household remedy. â€” S. Piesse
