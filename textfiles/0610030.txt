ANGEL OF DEATH Angel of death.—Spiritualists can smile at the approach of the angel of death, for it is to them a birth into joys everlasting, and they know that loved ones linger near to assist the weary spirit to pass from the old house to the new; they can meet the change with rejoicing, knowing that just before them lies a field of usefulness, that will yield pleasures to the faithful soul.— John Murray, in the Olive Branch. That depends altogether on circumstances whether Spiritualists can smile at the approach of death. Some whom we know, we think would feel very badly, if death were staring them in the face; knowing that their life has been of that character fitting them only for the dark regions of the spirit world; they don't care to pass from this sphere of existence. Indeed, it is much easier to purify the spirit here, by seeking the forgiveness of those you have injured, and forgiving those who have wronged you in turn, than to pass to spirit life without accomplishing that object. Spiritualists should learn that it is a calamity to the spirit, to die without being prepared for the change, or failing to accomplish its mission. R. P. Journal. This criticism of the R. P. J. is very tardy in coming, but it is a worthy and needed rebuke to many thousands of Spiritualists, who think the spirit world an unalloyed elysium, for even the worst of characters. Not so ; but there are hells —' dark regions ' as well as heavens there, and every one will go ' to his or her own place.' 'Like will gather to like ' there. God is no respecter of persons, but he is a regarder of characters; and in the economy of the spirit world, even more than in this, God has drawn, lines of demarcation impassable by the evil, to the disturbance of the good. We thank the Journal, and ask Spiritualists to Take Notice.
