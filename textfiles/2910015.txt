Sabbathday Lake, Me. Sept. 1899. While we have seemed to be neglectful of 'Home Notes,' home work has required constant attention and in that capacity we have striven to be faithful, for the elements have been against us in floral culture. The early drought affected our sweet peas so much that the vines were completely covered with the green aphis. This fly absorbed the goodness from the vines, and only by the persistent efforts of shot guns, Sprayers, etc., did we succeed in subduing them. As it is, we got no flowers in July, but through August we had abundant bloom, and what is better, found a ready sale for all the sweet peas, asters and carnation pinks we could raise Since Sept. came in, heavy winds and more drought again played havoc among our vines, but now it is too late to save them. Sisters have canned green peas and string beans for winter use, and the season is at hand for fruit canning. Of some kinds we shall have enough to be comfortable. Apples in our section are scarce. Repairing buildings is the order of the day. In the Dwelling house a large room is being fitted up for music; and at the Laundry the Sisters are arranging a nice, light room where they can be together while making the fancy work. The fall term of school is about to open and the pupils are rejoiced to welcome Wentworth, the mathematician, instead of Walsh. We are delighted with 'Gentle Manners' and shall use it in our school. We were not unmindful of the anniversax-y of the sixth of August. Appropriate songs were sung and selections from the 'Life and Experience of Mother Ann Lee' were memorized and rendered in our Sabbath evening Service. Ada S. Cummings.
