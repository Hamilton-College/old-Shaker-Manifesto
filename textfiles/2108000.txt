THE KENTUCKY REVIVAL. By Richard M'Nemar of Union Village, Ohio. Published in Albany, JS/~. T., in 1808. No. 8. Concerning the New Lights, Continued. It was agreed on all hands, that God was unchangeable and needed not the sufferings and death of his Son, to render him propitious to the soul of any ; that it was through love that he sent his Son into the world, that sin is the only thing in the universe that he hates, that he would have all men saved from it, and that to effect this, Christ made his appearance in the world. That innocence and love could not suffer and die in the room and stead of guilt and enmity. Nor could the imputation of innocence and purity to the guilty and vile, render them happy in the presence of heavenly beings of a contrary nature. From these premises it was concluded and taught by some, that man by departing from God, lost the true knowledge of his character and fell into a gross mistake, in concluding that he was their enemy ; that Christ came to reveal the true character of God in order to convince sinners of their mistake, and prove to them that God was their friend; that he had sufficiently established this point by submitting to be killed by them, rather than oppose or hurt them. Upon this hypothesis the Savior was supposed to die in the room and stead of the wicked, in a seuse, somewhat different from the former. Inasmuch as the parties must meet, and the sinner looked upon God as his enemy, and was determined either to kill or be killed. The love of Christ to the wicked was so great, that he chose to be killed rather than kill, and this was supposed to constitute the gospel, the glad tidings ; that although sinners killed their best friend through a mistake yet he freely forgave them. When any believe this they repent and are reconciled to God as their friend, whom before they thought to be their enemy. This gospel method of salvation was however, by no means established as a matter of common faith. The generality still believed mankind to be under a deeper disorder, than such a mistake. 'For after that they knew God, they glorified him not as God. And did not love to retain God in their knowledge.' Besides, if there is such implacable enmity between the sinner and God, that one or other must die, and if the enmity is found in the sinner, he must certainly be in the wrong ; therefore unless the Deity sacrifice his law and justice as well as his life, out of love to the sinner, death and suffering must inevitably seize upon him that is in the wrong. If the sinner is at enmity against God whatever the cause be, if God is reconciled to him in that state, he must be at enmity against himself. Upon this principle, should the sinner conclude that God was reconciled to him, had nothing against him, overlooked his enmity and disobedience, the last error must be worse than the first. From the propositions laid down, another conclusion was drawn more consistent and which was more universally embraced ; that the coming of Christ into the world was to make an end of sin, and unless we are wholly delivered from it, we can never see the face of God in peace. Pursuant to this conclusion, the first of those new satellites, (Malcham Worley,) which the Presbytery of Springfield had recommended as a light to the churches, began to shine out in the month of June, 1804 ; and from the effulgence of the great luminary, around whose centre the Schismatic body revolved, proposed to obviate every difficulty that had been attached to those intricate subjects, and lay open the whole matter plain to the weakest capacity. However plain and obvious the new diving might have appeared to him or to others at the time it was divulged, certain it is, that none but Schismatics, or such as unequivocally maintain the sacred rights of conscience, could ever have admitted the opening of sentiments so singular, with impunity. Under the auspicious wings of the American Eagle, which shades the honest enquirer after truth from the rage of popes and despots, the reader may calmly peruse those singular propositions which were so generally ascribed to a disorder in the brain, in which the following ideas were included. 'Man was at first created in the nature and image of God, but being tempted, the nature of the serpent was begotten in him, which is an earthly, sensual nature, directly opposed to God. This diabolical nature however contrary to the divine in which man was created, could not overcome nor extinguish it; hence, there remained in the same person two natures, at enmity and war the one against the other ; the one denominated the seed of the woman, the other the seed of the serpent.' 'Adam begat a son in his own likeness, a double-minded man, and in this situation the whole human race were propagated, and thus they remained till Christ made his appearance and began the work of redemption.' 'Jesus Christ, the redeemer, assumed in the body of his flesh the same nature, which was in all other men, was made in all points like unto his brethren whom he came to redeem, had two distinct and opposite natures residing in his one body. This nature which worked in the man, and not some being outwardly visible, tried and tempted him to seek temporal riches and honors, to convert the stones into bread, and cast himself down from the pinnacle of the temple, in order that he might be acknowledged and adored, as the coming Messiah. This wicked nature being denied of all its demands, crossed in all its crav ings, gave him up for a season to the ministry of angels, but afterwards rallied its vanquished powrers, and struggled for life and victory against the Son of God, but was again overcome and held to the painful and ignominious cross, on which he was worn out, wasted and consumed as by a lingering fire, until he was forced in his last convulsive agonies, to cry aloud and yield up the invisible and immortal spirit. Thus the work of final redemption was finished, and the second man arose and ascended out of that lawless nature into which the first fell. Then the serpent's head was bruised, and the first born of the woman's seed put everlastingly out of his reach. According to this transaction, all the types, figures and allegories in the old testament, and parables in the new are to be understood. Thus, Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and Jacob, the sumptuous glutton and Lazarus the beggar and the foolish and wise virgins, are to be considered as types of these two distinct natures; the one elect, the other reprobate ; the one beloved, the other hated ; the one and his offering accepted, the other rejected.' 'Again, the divine nature which was chosen, redeemed, exalted and glorified in the person of Christ Jesus, is denominated in Scripture the spirit, the inner man, and the new man. Its opposite, the old man, the man of sin, the sou of perdition, the flesh wThich lusteth against the spirit, the carnal mind, that wicked which sitteth in the temple of God and defiles it; wThich in the work of redemption must lift up his eyes in torment, be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, be consumed and destroyed and go into final perdition.' 'This wicked which is one and the same in all men, being overcome and destroyed in the person of Jesus Christ, laid a foundation for the gospel to be preached to every creature under heaven, and for all to look and hope for redemption at his final appearing. That it was necessary that this gospel should be published to all the world, before a full end of that wicked should come. By this gospel he was bound, but suffered to live another day, or thousand years. This thousand years is now expired and the period come for that man of sin to be finally consumed from off the face of the earth. For this end, the spirit of God is poured out upon the people, first to reveal, and then to consume this wicked.' Such were the general propositions advanced by Malcham Worley, in the summer of 1804, and which was acceded to by a number of those Schismatics who were considered foremost in the New-Light. 'From whom or from what did Christ redeem ? I answer: He came to redeem us from sin. Mankind are represented as sold under sin, serving sin, servants to sin, under the dominion and reign of sin. It is plain that Christ redeems us from sin or from all iniquity.' 'I now inquire what was the price given for our redemption? The blood of Christ is everywhere in Scripture declared to be the price given. Acts xx., 28. Rev. v., 9. It may be asked if Christ or God in Christ, redeems from sin? And if he gave Ms blood as the ransom or price, who got the price ?' The Apostle to the Hebrews answers ;ï¿½-'Forasmuch as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death.' Here we see who had the power of death ; and he got the price, which was the death of Jesus. Then was fulfilled that old prophecy, 'I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: It shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel.' Gen. iii., 15. This particular point, 'the devil getting the price,' was combated by Dr. Campbell in his strictures. Whereupon Br. Stone agreed 'to eat these dreadful words' because so extremely offensive to the Doctor, and the occasion of a wildness of imagination in the Calvinist preachers and people. Neither Dr. Campbell nor Br. Stone fully understood the expression when they agreed that it should be eaten. The offence of the expressions seemed to lie in giving Satan something that was precious ; hence the Doctor's objection, 'that the precious blood of Christ was given by God to Satan in payment! ' That 'God was so merciless as to deliver up his only Son to glut the malice of a blood-thirsty demon!' That 'the lamb of God was immolated on the altar of hell.' Had he adverted to the Apostle's idea, quoted by Stone, that this precious blood was intended to destroy the one to whom it was given, it must have appeared more consistent for the devil to get it, than the justice of God. The Doctor would not be so unreasonable as to give a dose of tartar emetic to one in perfect health, and thereby at-one him to the bilious. He knows the precious tartar emetic, which is the very essence of bile, must be deposited in the bowels of his patient, in order to collect into union with itself every thing there of its own nature and carry it off in the draught. Admitting that Christ assumed that blood, life or nature, in which all mankind lay separated from God, that life was his, and he had a right to do with it what he pleased. Although it was endowed with no greater excellence in him than in another, considered in itself, yet it might be denominated precious, from the use which he made of it. Admitting that he gave it up as a public sacrifice, made a show of it openly and put away sin by the sacrifice of it, the Doctor must grant that Stone's inference was not so full of horror as he at first imagined, and consequently it must prove a very strong emetic to him that eats it. The above Schismatic doctrine, as far as it was opened and explained, threatened the total subversion of the Calvinistic system; for, upon the principle that sin must be actually destroyed, that Christ did actually assume, overcome and destroy it, and that the same battle must be fought, and the same victory gained by all who are born of God, it follows that proxy sinning, suffering, obeying, dying, rising and reigning are the proper effects of a disordered bruin. It' it was the enmity which Christ nailed to the cross and took out of the way, and evil which he destroyed by death, the hypostatical union of two distinct natures in the Son of God forever, must be a capital mistake, and all the worship that has been offered to him upon such a faith, must have conduced to the dignity and honor of that spirit, which the meek, lowly, and self-denying Savior foiled upon the mount. In fine, the Schismatics taking it for granted that sin was the whole occasion of two, that Christ came to destroy it, that his veracity was pledged to finish the work, and that the time of the promise was near at hand, expected, in whatever way the work should be affected, the day would soon declare it. Several objections were raised in the Schismatic fraternity against Br. Worley's manner of understanding the Scriptures, the most particular of which was, 1st. That it led to Universalism and made Christ the Savior of all men eventually, as well as officially; taking it for granted, that either in the plan of redemption or the execution of it, God had distinguished the souls of men by number and person. 2nd. That if such a doctrine was established it would open a wider door to vice, inasmuch as it would cut off at once from the carnal mind, the powerful influence of hope and fear; consequently, the wicked spirit in man would become more violent, and sin with more greediness, knowing that his time was short. As all agreed that they were only beginning to learn the mysteries of the Scripture, and each one had a right to exercise his own faith, and walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing whereunto he had attained, the investigation of these mysterious and intricate points, was put off to a future period, and the churches went on harmoniously in the first principles of the New-Light which they conceived to be so well established by the extraordinary power and gifts of the spirit. I shall now proceed to give some account of their particular form of government and manner of worship. It has been before observed that they constituted by a vote, which considered the Scripture as the only written oracle through which the mind of God was revealed to them. In order to this general suffrage, in which the body of the people at large had equal privilege, every claim to superiority, by a succession of church offices, had been laid aside, consequently the power of government was considered in the body of the people thus constituted. This new republic, under the standard of liberty and equality, and invested with so great a degree of light, life and power, assumed a threatening aspect toward the little surrounding kingdoms which had so long been weakening each other by civil broils. It is difficult to paint the zeal for liberty, and just indignation against the old aristocratic spirit, which glowed through every member of this new confederacy. Under the influence of this warm democratic zeal these churches soon exhibited an appearance, distinct from anything that had ever been seen. The following minutes of the church at Turtle-Creek will serve to illustrate some of the particulars of their proceedings. (to be continued.)
