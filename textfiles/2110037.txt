How oft my guardian angel gently cried... How oft my guardian angel gently cried, 'Soul from thy casement look and thou shalt see How he persists to knock and wait for thee.' And oh! how often to that voice of sorrow. 'Tomorrow we will open,' I replied; And when the morrow came, I answered still, 'Tomorrow.' H. W. Longfellow.
