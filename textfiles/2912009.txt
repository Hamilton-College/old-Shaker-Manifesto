OBEDIENCE By Lillian Phelps IN order to insure success in the Christian life it is necessary that this important principle, should become firmly established within the heart. 'To obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams.' Every soul must have proved, in some measure, the truth of these words. The effect of disobedience to wise counsel or to the voice of conscience, will ever be a loss of spiritual streugth and consequently of power to resist evil. Whereas a soul that renders obedience to the spirit of truth wherever it may be found will obtain a growth in spiritual life and thus become fortified against the powers of evil. There are different phases of obedience which come with different stages of growth. For instance, one may obey from the power of love for an individual, even as the dutiful child obeys his parents. This will answer for a time, but unless obedience becomes a fixed principle in the heart the foundation for a Christian life can not become established. Again one may obey from fear of punishment and thus never conceive of the spirit of the law, or know the blessings arising therefrom. Mother Ann said, 'Once I served God through fear, but now I serve him through love,' showing that with advancing growth in the spiritual life our love for God and his word prompts a willing obedience thereto. True Christian obedience requires humility, self-denial and the resignation expressed in the words of the Savior: 'Thy will, not mine, be done.' East Canterbury, N. H.
