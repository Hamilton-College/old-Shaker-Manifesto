HEAVENLY GUIDE James G. Russell Enfield, N. H 1. O who will guide my feeble barque, On life's ternpestuous sea? When e'er my way seems drear and dark, My guide and helper be? Alone I ne'er can safely pass The dangers of the way, The rocks, the shoals, the hidden mass, That in the ocean lay That in the ocean lay. 2. Though for a while I calmly sail, Upon the waters fair, Rejoicing, as I breast the gale, And breathe the balmy air.— Yet soon there comes a fearful change, Dark clouds obscure the sky, And all around my vision's range, |j: The foaming waves dash high. : 4. But Oh ! what little faith is mine, I sink beneath the wave, And struggling, cry for help divine,— O Lord, in mercy save. He takes me kindly by the hand, His power my soul doth thrill, The elements at his command, ||: In tranquil peace are still. :|| 3. O who will then my pilot be. My barque to safely guide, Through all the perils of the sea.— The storms, the winds, and tide? I view him, coming o'er the main ;— He beckons unto me, :|| And Peter-like, my feet would fain ||: Approach him on the sea. :| 5. Then he will be my Pilot true, My blest and heavenly Guide, Whatever dangers now ensue, Securely I may ride. And as my barque he safely steers, Toward that heavenly realm, My song shall be, I have no fears, ||: My father's at the helm. :||
