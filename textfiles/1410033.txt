SURE PROMISE. Pleasant Hill, Ky. Canterbury, N. H. 1. My soul, immortal, cannot live On gross material things, 2. O Father, give me daily bread, And wine that's ever new; 3. The earth is promised to the meek, Eternal life beside; 4. O then let nothing rob my soul. Nor any doubts prevail; And all the wealth this world can give, No lasting comfort brings. No famine then I need to dread, Nor what my foes can do. If heaven's kingdom they would seek, Their Father will provide. For while eternal ages roll, His goodness shall not fail. Then let me labor for that While anxious cares of earthly He I feeds die need but ravens when they cry, little here below, meat Which ever will endure, toys, So many millions wound. He Have clothes the smiling little time to mead, learn, That food which saints and My spirit feasts on And will he not Then O that world to angels eat, That hidden manna pure, inward joys And pities those around, my wants supply With ev'ry thing I need? which I go, Shall be my great concern.
