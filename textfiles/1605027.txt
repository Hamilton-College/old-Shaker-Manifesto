Christ's Second Appearing. No. 2. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. In answer to the question. By what authority are believers in Christ's Second Appearing required to live lives of virgin celibacy? We answer. By the highest authority known among men! God has declared that he will have a pure people on the earth, whose hands are not stained with blood ; whose lives are consecrated to God ; whose time and talents are devoted to the upbuilding of his Zion on earth. He will have such a people in this day, or he will have none at all. He will accept nothing short of this�sacrifice; because, 'Now is come salvation and strength, the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ, ' and all excuse on account of the weakness of the flesh is taken away from Believers in this day, whose lives and character are clearly set forth in the apocalypse. ' And I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount of Zion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.' Rev. xiv : 24. 'These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.' These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto God and the Lamb ; and in their mouth was found no guile; for they were without fault before the throne of God.' Rev. xiv; 1, 4, 5. ' For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night; and they overcamehim, (i.e. the accuser,�a false lying spirit,) by the blood of the Lamb, and by the wrord of their testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death. ' Rev. xii; 10, 11. That is,�their own carnal lives, which they freely lay down, for the sake of a higher and a greater life. It is not enough for Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, to live the life of Christ, which is the blood of the Lamb ; but they feel it their indispensable duty, on all proper occasions, to add thereto, the word of their testimony, for they find in it, a powerful auxiliary, in overcoming the world in themselves, and often times the power of God goes with their testimony, and the whole assembly feel its power. ' Stand ye fast 0 my soul! Fight for the victory, Keep thy sword forever drawn, Against the old deceiver; Never flinch at the cross, Yield to no temptation, Count all earthly things but dross, To gain complete salvation.' If the number named, an hundred forty and four thousand, being the first fruits unto God and the Lamb, what must the number be in the general harvest of souls, at the end of a thousand years, �f Christ's reign upon earth?� We apprehend there is more danger of the world coming to an end, in consequence of its inhabitants living in constant and perpetual violation of the laws of reproduction of the human race, than we have of their following the example of Christ in living lives of virgin celibacy. As free agents we can choose which ever we will, and then abide by the choice we have made. It is asserted on good authority that the earth is under a curse from one end to the other ; if this be so, I can see noway it can be redeemed from that curse, only in obeying the gospel of Christ's Second Appearing. ' Now is come salvation and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ.' Rev. xii: 10. North Union, Ohio.
