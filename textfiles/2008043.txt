'THANK YOU.' [Contributed by Eldress Sophie Ilelfricli.] Tlie Powerful Effect Those Words Had Upon a, Street Urchin. Several winters ago, says the Congregationalist, a woman was coming out of a public building when the heavy door swung back and made egress somewhat difficult. A little street urchin sprang to the rescue, and as he held open the door she said, 'Thank you,' and passed on. '�D'ye hear that?' said the boy to a companion standing near by. 'No; what?' 'Why, that lady in sealskin said 'thank ye' to the likes o' me.' Amused at the conversation, which she could not help overhearing, the lady turned round and said to the boy : 'It always pays to be polite, my boy; remember that.' Years passed away, and last December, when doing her Christmas shopning, this lady received an exceptional courtesy from a clerk in Boston, which caused her to remark to a friend who was with her : 'What a great comfort to he civilly treated once in a while�though I don't knew that 1 blame the store elorks for being rude during the holiday trade.' The young man's quick ear caught the words, and he said : 'Pardon me madam, but you gave me my first lesson in politeness a few years ago.' The lady looked at him in amazement, while he related the little forgotten incident, and told her that the simple 'thanfc you' awakened his first ambition to be something in the world. He went the next morning and applied for a situation as office boy in the establishment where he was now an honored clerk. Only two words dropped into the treasury of a street conversation, but they yielded returns of a certain kind more satisfactory than investments, stocks and bonds. Selected.
