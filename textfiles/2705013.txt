The wheels of time keep steadily'revolving, and bucket after bucket empties its contents of good or ill upon earth and its inhabitants. Yice and virtue; health and disease; accumulation and dissolution; prosperity and adversity; stability and fickleness; sunshine and showers; placidity and tempests; peace and anxiety; life and death; et cetera, follow each other alternately, in close proximity. Human plans and projects, generally, have their ephemeral existence which are soon displaced by other novelties to be equally short lived. Even human compacts and organizations are subject to birth and dissolution. Religion has its ebb and flow. Progression is the ultimatum of the human race in all things essential to its proper development in intellectuality, morality and spirituality. The ideas of one hundred years ago will not supply the necessary aliment for the present time. People are not content to travel or live in the old-fashioned way. They must be propelled by steam or electricity on land and water. Their living must be of a superior grade than satisfied our ancestors. Business must be done by telegraph and telephone, seemingly, the world over. Shorthand displaces the old and slow chirographj. The go-ahead spirit is full of invention and push. Once upon a time a man of eminence advised young men to go West; now they are advised to go South. Some of both sexes are acting on the latter advice, and are going South. The Shakers have imbibed the spirit and have gone to the peninsula of Florida and according to their report are doing well. Like all new enterprises, one class advocates the undertaking, and another class objects to it, chiefly the class who have never been there. Those of our people who have been to the location speak in glowing terms of it. Sister Elizabeth Sears, Mar., 29, in company with Brother Benj. Gates, started by railroad, for Olive Branch, Fla. I am an advocate for Florida, and if the way would open I should soon be there. I am far from pressing any one to go there that does not wish to; neither would I deter any one from locating there who desired to, when proper preparations were made to receive him. Those who prefer the cold northern snow and frost to the sunny South, by all means let them enjoy it to their heart's content. Calvin O. Reed. North Family. April, 1897. To the majority of Nature's worshipers spring offers the most beautiful and varied themes for admiration. Now that the opening promises of the year are before us we take the same delight in our surroundings as the seasons come and go and exclaim, 'Beautiful for situation' is Mt. Lebanon! her hills are crowned with majesty, her valleys rich with beauty and blessedness. Our Zion is like unto Jerusalem of old when her people awaited with anxious hearts the coming of the Savior. And so we wait, hoping through faith love and good works to make ourselves worthy of the day that is before us. The times are according to the prophecies, therefore we should be ready to perform our labor willingly, trusting to the Hand that hath led us thus far, to deliver us. The work of the season is being hurried by devoted hands and we are glad to write that our Brethren, as they have for many years past, will do with less and less hired help. The hireling system is a menace to every grade of society, and especially is it so with those who have a high understanding of the law of love and truth. Through the consideration of our Brethren we have found a long and welcome releasement from the care of hn-ed men and now await the time when all our lands shall be tilled by conseci'ated hands and none other. We are contemplating re-flooring and wainscoting our large dining-hall which has become much dilapidated through use and old age. Brethren and Sisters each furnishing half of the necessary funds. When it is finisht we would like to invite all the members of the household of Faith to a union feast,�but must not hope for the impossible. On the first day of April the last inhabitants of the Canaan family bade farewell to their old home, made sacred to many by memories of a long life of devotion. We trust that in the fertile valley of the Connecticut they will take up the threads of experience and find new life and love in their accepted home, where some of the worthiest of our forefathers and mothers lived, suffered and died. Our united prayers for every good gift have followed them and shall continue. May peace rest on our banners, and prosperity attend the labor of our hearts and hands, is the wish of each for each, extended through the hand of the writer. Cora V. Vinndo. Shakers, N. Y. April, 1891. While writing, the merry notes of the robin and bluebird greet me with the announcement that spring has come. For the last month the greenhouses and hotbeds have been brought into requisition for starting early vegetable plants. The report of George H. Baxter on the anniversary of Washington's birthday was interesting. The observance of those days which remind us of the lives and deeds of the great and good who have honored history's pages is beneficial; for 'lwes of great men oft remind us we can make our lives sublime.' It is a beautiful coincidence that the two most prominent names in American history have tl.eir natal clay in the same month. Washington and Lincoln are associated as the founders of the hope of the world, and the liberator from the thraldom of the dark ages. It is pleasant to share in the benefits tliat have come from the labors of such souls, but also to be willing to suffer that the truth may prevail is another question. Wherever the Divine Spirit may lead, may we be willing to give all we have to God and his blessed cause. That there is an indwelling spiritual force able so far to triumph over the physical as to heal its infirmities is well known to those who have been privileged to enter that spiritual temple and partake of the fruit of the tree of life. Why it does not at all times come as a healing power we can not answer but the many manifestations of that gift which have been record- ed in history and revealed in our own Church prove its reliableness. That there will be a revival of that power is our prayer. Hamilton DeGraw. Enfield, N. H. April, 1897. Well may each mortal be termed a miniature world, embodying all the elements of the universe, affected by the magnetic current of others. The governing power of each human world should be Truth, and its resources of good should be dealt out by the hand of Consistency. In taking a retrospective view of the world within, we see intricate boundary lines separating the good from the evil. We recognize streams of love which refresh whomsoever they feed or forces so soiled with the mud of passion, that pollution is the natural outgrowth. Beautiful with mental flowers of holy thoughts that refine life or darkened with poisonous germs of evil. These elements combined with ore of nature, are the portable merchandise we give to each other in our daily intercourse. It is the Christian's duty to so rid himself of evil that he gives to his fellow-beings only the purifying fruits of truth and justice. To do this a knowledge of human nature must be acquired and society's best interest be at heart. 'For the wrong that needs resistance, For the cause that needs assistance, For the future in the distance, For the good that we can do.' We have had the pleasure of entertaining Sister Martha Wetherell of East Canterbury, for a few days in March. We hope that more of such pleasant visitations will transpire during the year. Maple harvesting is in full operation and present prospects bespeak a good yield. We hail with joy the pleasant chirpings of the robin redbreast as his cheery song floats out upon the morning air. Altho the cold season has not been unusually severe and general health has prevailed in our Society, still we are ready to sing,�'Winter, adieu, your time is through.' George H. Baxter.
