Enfield, N. H. April, 1897. Well may each mortal be termed a miniature world, embodying all the elements of the universe, affected by the magnetic current of others. The governing power of each human world should be Truth, and its resources of good should be dealt out by the hand of Consistency. In taking a retrospective view of the world within, we see intricate boundary lines separating the good from the evil. We recognize streams of love which refresh whomsoever they feed or forces so soiled with the mud of passion, that pollution is the natural outgrowth. Beautiful with mental flowers of holy thoughts that refine life or darkened with poisonous germs of evil. These elements combined with ore of nature, are the portable merchandise we give to each other in our daily intercourse. It is the Christian's duty to so rid himself of evil that he gives to his fellow-beings only the purifying fruits of truth and justice. To do this a knowledge of human nature must be acquired and society's best interest be at heart. 'For the wrong that needs resistance, For the cause that needs assistance, For the future in the distance, For the good that we can do.' We have had the pleasure of entertaining Sister Martha Wetherell of East Canterbury, for a few days in March. We hope that more of such pleasant visitations will transpire during the year. Maple harvesting is in full operation and present prospects bespeak a good yield. We hail with joy the pleasant chirpings of the robin redbreast as his cheery song floats out upon the morning air. Altho the cold season has not been unusually severe and general health has prevailed in our Society, still we are ready to sing,ï¿½'Winter, adieu, your time is through.' George H. Baxter.
