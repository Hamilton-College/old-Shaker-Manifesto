The Martyrdom of Huss The martyrdom of John Huss is thus related by Draper: 'He was then made to kneel down and receive his sentence. It condemned his writings and his body to the NL .AJSHGET'ESTO. the; shakee 3O7 flames. He was then degraded and despoiled of his orders. Some of the bishops mocked at him; some merciful, implored him to recant. They cut his hair in the form of a cross and set upon his head a high paper crown on which devils were painted, 'We devote thy soul to the devils in hell.' 'And I commend my soul to the most merciful Lord Christ Jesus.' He was then led'forth. They passed by the bishop's palace -where Plugs' books were burning.. As they tied him with a piece of chain to his stake the painted crown fell off, but the soldiers replaced it. 'Let him and his devils be burned together.' As the flames burnt over him he chanted psalms and prayed to the redeemer.' Can that be true which requires for its support the murder of a true man?
