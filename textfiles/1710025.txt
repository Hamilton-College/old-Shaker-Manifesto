Ninety Barrels a Day There is a distillery in Massachusetts, 'the largest rum distillery in the world, ' so says an eye-witness to the following account, and ' the amount manufactured averages 90 barrels a day, some for home consumption, but the greater part for export to the coast of Africa. The barrels contain 43 galions, and the internal revenue tax is 90 cents per gallon- -$38.70 a barrel. For 90 barrels, a day's work, the treasury of the United States is enriched $3,483, minus the cost of the services of revenue wa.tchmen. That the government shall not be defrauded a farthing of the ungodly gain, or one drop of the fire water may not be lost, government padlocks are placed upon the rum reservoirs, guarded and opened daily for measurement, by internal revenue officers. ' Ninety barrels a day! Can any one follow one day's proceeds of this infamous business, and trace its awful cui se trailing over the homes of men? Go where it will, it goes as a eurse. And the nation's revenue stamp is but the stain of blood money. W. C T. U. Bulletin.
