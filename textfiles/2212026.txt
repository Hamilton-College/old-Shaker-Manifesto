Union Village, Ohio. Nov. 1892. 'Time flees away as a morning dream, With all its burden and sorrow; And faith illumes with a ioyous gleam The beautiful eye of to-morrow.' This is the language of optimism. It is so much better than forever hanging out blue lights. We have not had an inch of rain since the middle of July. But what of that? November will doubtless give us plenty. If we would only go to the trouble of rebuilding the wasteway of our milldam we might have about thirty-six acres of water 10 to 25 feet deep. And all this for $500. We are made glad in 1800 bu. of beets for the cows, for our winter supply and Elder Joseph has just completed a grand root-cellar capable of holding not less than 4 or 5,000 bu. It is an annex to the barn. We are once more in our old new Office. It is perfect, nothing could be added to its beauty, comfort or convenience. Our dwelling or center house has undergone much repairing and modernizing this summer. But O the cement and sawed-stone walks all around the Office and dwellings. We shall not attempt to describe the glory of these walks. Our corn wTill be a tolerably fair crop. Potatoes may possibly last through the winter. Wheat rather poor, but we shall have plenty and perhaps some for the market. Our English Sparrows mean well but they eat the blue-grass-seed about as fast as we sow it. But 'Don't kill the Birds;' they are so cheerful and chipper in the dreary days of winter. We are sowing this bluegrass seed on our newly leveled door-yard. I generally read the Manifesto with eagerness as soon as it arrives. But one thing I regret very much: that is, the substitution of Initials instead of full names under the articles,Poems, Home Notes, etc. Western people would be glad to have the full name of each writer. There is a disappointment when we read to the end of a sweet poem, a pure, spiritual essay, a racy Home Note, and find no name we can decipher nor any reference to the worthy author that we can understand. Well, this is enough, may be too much. We are all quite well and most heartily bid the Manifesto and all its promoters a God speed now and forever. We lately were uncommonly blest with a visit from our most worthy Sisters, Eldress Elizabeth Sears, and Sister Cornelia French of Mount Lebanon, our dear Mother Church. Our meeting on the Sabbath was a feast of good and refreshing inspirations from the store-house of their long travel and experience gathered from the bright fields of the higher life. We sincerely hope they will not stay away so long again; but if they must, that they will send some equally entertaining substitutes. Best love and good wishes to all. O. C. H.
