The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 9. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1S16. Re-written by Henry C. Blinn. Mother Ann and the Elders go on a gospel mission to the state of Mass, On the 4th of May 1781, Mother Ann and the Elders left Watervliet, N. Y., to visit the state of Mass. This had beeu a subject of contemplation for some time. Daniel Wood, of Upton, Mass., had opened the testimony to hi&amp; frieads and neighbors and some of them had already received the faith. Agreeably to a gift from Mother Ann, Daniel had been preparing the people for the reception of the Believers. Mother Ann was accompanied by Elder William Lee, Elder James Whittaker, Samuel Fitch, Mary Partington and Margaret Leeland. A few days previous to this date, Jonathan Slossou had beeu sent to the home of Benjamin Osborne, on Tucconockf mountain with orders to wait for a further gift of God. The first visit was made at this place, where all of the Believers were very kindly received. Several families had fully embraced the faith and testimony. On hearing of the arrival of Mother Ann and the Elders, all the Believers in the neighborhood, and some from a distance, gathered to hear the word of God. Those who had believed were strengthf Now called Mt. Washington in Berkshire Co., Mass. ened in the truth, while several more were added to the faith. On the Sabbath there was a large body of people iu attendance, besides the Believers. The spirit of God was manifested by much outward operation and testimony against the sins of the world. A spirit of opposition was also present. Dr. Hollibert attempted to dispute with the Elders but did not succeed. As they would not enter into a controversy with him, he soon Avearied himself and left the place. Although there were many evil persons present, no acts of violence were committed. After tarrying in this place ten days, Mother Ann and the Elders, bid their dear friends farewell and passed on to Enfield, Conn., and called at the residence of David Meacham. Their arrival aroused the people of the town and the Believers were threatened with persecution by mob violence. They however, remained in the place about one week, during which time many persons came to obtain information about the religious work. Several persons accepted the faith and made a confession of their sins to God. This awakening enraged their ungodly neighbors, who to vent out their spirit of darkness were led to denounce the sacred testimony with the stigma of delusion. As the Believers had no desire to seek persecution, they concluded to leave the place and proceeded on their journey unmolested. They next visit the residence of John Maynor, in Grafton, Mass. With this family they remain three days, and then pass on to the home of Daniel Wood in Upton, Mass., and remain over the Sabbath. On Tuesday they reach the home of Zacheus Stevens, in Still Eiver, and on Wednesday the home of Isaac Willard where they tarry one week. Meetings Avere held in all these places and the word of God preached with zeal and power. After arrangements had been made for the reception of Mother and the Elders, at the 'Square House' in Harvard, the company moved on to that place and made it their residence. Here they were visited by persons from every section of the country where the testimony had extended. They continued to preach the gospel, and to administer the power of salvation and eternal life to all who Avere Avilling to receive it. Here Mother Ann found the place and the people Avhich had been shown to her in vision, Avhile in England. During the residence of Mother Ann and the Elders in this place, the gospel Avord and Avork had a rapid and extensive circulation. They visited many places Avhere the testimony had been preached, particularly, Shirley, Littleton and Petersham. The Believers passed through many scenes of tribulation and suffering, in their labors to plant the gospel of Christ, and to nourish and strengthen the faith of all who had accepted' the cross. They spared no pains, day or night, in teaching and instructing the people, and in ministering the power of the resurrection to lost souls. The blessing of God attended their labors and multitudes followed them from place to place, to hear the words of living truth, and to partake of the power which accompanied their ministration. These things so alarmed the spirit of evil that the Believers frequently suffered persecution and sometimes were abused shamefully. Soon after Mother Ann and the Elders reached Harvard these acts of persecution began to be manifested. As many persons came through honest intentions, to seek after truth, so also many came from time to time with a caviling spirit, to search after evil and if possible to overthrow that which was good. At one meeting a large persecuting company assembled and even came armed with clubs and other weapons of cruelty. They pretended that they came to attend the meeting and to hear what the people had to say. Being unwilling to admit such characters into the house. Elder James requested them to assemble in the yard. Taking his Bible he read selections to them after which he delivered a discourse, and then very kindly dismissed the company. This seemed to have a very salutary effect and they all retired without offering any abuse. Near the close of the month of July, 1781, a report Avas circulated in the town of Harvard that the Shakers had come with seventy carriages and six hundred stands of arms; that they were enemies to the country and had come to aid the British in the war against America. It was also asserted that a man by the name of Whitney had seen a chest of fire arms at the Square House. These reports alarmed the weak and ignorant and served as a pretext for the enemies of the truth, by whom they were fabricated, to vent their wicked spirit and to urge that the Shakers should be driven forcibly from the town. Others of more candor, and consideration were willing to inquire into the matter and ascertain the truth of such vague and doubtful reports. Ephraim Davis, captain of militia, soon after this, collected his company and informed them that he had heard such and such reports concerning the Shakers, and that he intended to go and see whether they were true or false. 'If they are true' said he, k I .-hall see to them, but if they are false, I shall not molest them. ' Their first request was to have an interview with the Elders to whom they stated a full account of the reports that were in circulation. Elder James Whittaker then suggested that he would speak to the assembly, to which the captain very readily consented. ' I understand from your Committee that this large representation of the town of Harvard, has been informed that the Shakers have in their possession concealed weapons of war, and that these weapons are in the Square House. 'ï¿½You are incorrectly informed. We have no weapons of war. We are not enemies to the country. We are a harmless, inoffensive people. We do not want to injure any man either in person or property. We want no man's silver or gold, but want only their souls to God. If yoti believe the reports you may have full liberty to search the house or any other building. ' This speech had a salutary effect on the candid part of the assembly, but those who were enemies of the cross, after searching, in vain, to find any weapons of military warfare, or anything to warrant the reports, were still unwilling to relinquish their design. Seeing the truth afforded no pretext to molest the people, they were determined to proceed upon any pretext which their enmity might suggest. In accordance with this state of feeling, the Committee ordered the Believers to leave the town. Elder James Whittaker remarked, ' We came here peaceably, and we can say as did St. Paul, ' We dwell in our own hired house.' ' After the company had indulged in some more unkind words they began to leave the place, without having committed any violence. Some concluded to remain till evening, and said they should like to hear the Elders speak their faith. Elder James while addressing the company was interrupted by a rude fellow in the crowd. Elder William Lee requested them to be silent or peaceably withdraw. Elder James continuing his discourse spoke of the necessity of confessing and forsaking all sin, and closed with these words. ' If you believe and obey these words, it will be well with you, but if you disobey them you must answer to God in judgment.' At the Square House where Mother Ann and the Elders had their residence, there had been no stores of provisions laid up, and though a large nun*ber of people came to visit them, and crowds were fed, almost daily, yet through the abounding goodness of God, they were never known to lack for food. Mother Ann felt that it was the duty of Believers to provide for their temporal support, and not always be dependent upon the hand of Providence. She then spoke to one of the Brethren concerning these things and reminded him of the small quantity of provisions on hand with which to feed so large a body of people. ' We are fed, ' said Mother Ann, 'by the hand of God. A great many people come to us, bringing but little, yet they are fed and have plenty. It cannot always be like this. ' She then asked the Brethren to devise a plan to procure bread for the multitude. Although grain was scarce in Harvard, Jonathan Slosson knew that it was plenty in the town of New Lebanon, N. Y., and in Hancock and Richmond, Mass., and offered to go and solicit a contribution. Reuben Harrison was selected to accompany him. The Brethren called upon the Believers in the above named places and made known the circumstances of the little church of Christ in Harvard. By the kindness and liberality of the Brethren and Sisters, a good supply of grain and other articles were obtained. On the return of Jonathan and Reuben, Mother Ann and the Elders kneeled in thankfulness to God, for such a manifestation of faith and liberality in his people. (To be Continued.)
