Be and continue poor, young man, while others around you grow rich by fraud... Be and continue poor, young man, while others around you grow rich by fraud and disloyalty; be without a place or power while others beg their way upward; bear the pain of disappointed hopes while others gain the accomplishment of theirs by flattery ; forego the gracious pressure of the hand, for which others cringe and crawl. Wrap yourself in your own virtue, and seek a friend and your own daily bread.
