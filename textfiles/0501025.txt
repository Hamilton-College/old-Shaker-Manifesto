MISSIONARY Go forth little 'Shaker,' your mission fulfill: Proclaim the glad tidings of peace and good will, Lift up thy bright banner, and on it inscribe, 'Love is our motto, and truth is our guide.' Encourage the falt'ring, and strengthen the weak; If man would be happy, God's law he must keep ; For sorrow must follow departure from this, And, just in proportion, diminish his bliss. Go say to our Brothers and Sisters abroad, Though erring, fear not; for our Parents are good ; They send to earth, Saviors, in mortals to dwell, That souls may shun evil, and learn to do well. And thus, by progression, mankind will ascend In spirit with Father and Mother to blend; As true sons and daughters, complete the great chain Encircling humanity's Ocean and Plain.
