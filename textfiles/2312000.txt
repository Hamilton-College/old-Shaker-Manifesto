THE SHIRLEY SHAKERS. [io/� //i� Fitchburg Daily Sentinel.] The Little Communities Observe Their Centennial. An Interesting Account of the People, Their Society, Homes, and Modes of Life. On Friday, Oct. 27th and on Sunday thi! Shirley and Harvard Shaker Communities observed the 100th anniversary of their Societies' foundation. What was also more interesting, the anniversary exercises were held in the old meeting-house which was dedicated to tluj uses ot the Society one hundred years ago, after much effort on the part of the Shakers, trials, troubles and persecutions from those who oppose 1 them. TLie anniversary exercises commenced with singing; Elder Whiteley announcing for the occasion their hymn, 'The Hour of Devotion.' The usual services of the Society were interspersed with hymns, recitations and addresses particularly appropriate to the occasion, and at the conclusion, Elder John Whiteley made an address of welcome. The members of the Community at Harvard were present and remained to the collation served at the conclusion of the exercises, and departed for home just before sundown. Elder John Whiteley referred to the early experiences of the founders of the faith, the sufferings and privations they endured and the persecutions they suffered, and compared their lot with that of their predecessors. He spoke of the trials of Mother Ann, the joy and pride the original Shakers felt when they moved into the new meeting-house they now stood in and loved so well, and urged all to stand fast in the faith and live the principles of their belief in their daily lives. BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MOVEMENT. The Societies at Shirley and Harvard and, indeed, all those formed in this country, grew out of the exertions of Mother Ann Lee who (a history of the movement says) was the very foundation of Shakerism in this country. Ann Lee was born in Manchester, England, in 1735, of humble parents. At an early age she showed strong and remarkable religious tendencies and had very pronounced opinions upon the subject of matrimony. In 1758 she joined the Shakers, then a growing body in England, introduced there from France, and from the very outset became a conspicuous figure, in DECEMBER 274 THE MANIFESTO. f..ct, the head and shoulders of the movement she had joined. In 1774, in company with a few faithful followers, she sailed for this country, and from that time Shakerism in England receded and finally disappeared, while here it spread, fostered in a great measure by this remarkable woman. The community Settled in New York, but in 1776 one of the number, who Avas a man of some wealth, purchased land in what was then a wilderness and here the little band located, grew and prospered. Their zeal and enthusiasm was surprising and they frequently clashed with others differing with them. In the summer of 1792, some time after Mother Ann Lee had made a tour through this section, the heads of seven families in Shirley, twelve in Lancaster and one in Harvard, all professing faith in the new belief that remarkable woman taught, consulted together for the purpose of considering the expediency of building a public house of worship. The time for such action seemed to be ripe, and, accordingly they sent to New Lebanon, N. Y., to Father Meacham for his counsel and consent to build a meeting-house and organize a community. Father Meacham looked favorably upon their petition and sent back a covenant such as the community at New Lebanon had adopted. This set forth that the new meeting-house should be built by free contributions and none were to give who could not do so without incurring any debt, none were to give more than they were able to spare, that the house must be for joint religious and not common use so that none could acquire a sole right of government for what they had done and that the property be changed from private to public and from common to sacred uses. This covenant was adopted by the Shirley body and the work of getting together the timbers for the meetinghouse at once commenced. Work of construction on the frame began in August and on the night of Oct. 31, 1792, so as not to arouse the settlers who opposed and persecuted them, the frame was raised. Little more was done until the following spring when work was resumed and the building completed. The first service in the new meeting-house was held Oct. 27, 1793, and was the occasion of much rejoicing by the little band of Believers. The usual wide difference in the amounts contributed is noticeable on the records, which have been remarkably well kept and preserved. Samuel Whittemore gave $333.33, Samuel Whitney $18, Aaron Lyon $20, all in cash; Moses Hay ward gavj a yoke of oxen worth $45 ; Priscilla, Elizabeth and Grace Phillips gave cattle valued at $83.78; Molly Worcester contributed $3 to the cause, and 90 cents, the widow's mite of Mary Buttrick, is recorded as faithfully and in as bold, round hand writing as the five figure gift of Whittemore. Most of the early Shakers had property, and although the community was small, it was soon in possession of a large acreage of land. Previous to the establishment of the regular community the Believers had resided with their families and conducted their af- THE MANIFESTO. 275 fairs independently instead of in com-'. nion. The ministrations of Mother Ann, her visits and attacks upon the sins and follies of the times, aroused their opponents into acts of violence, but the strange new faith spread rapidly in New England. About 1780 the new and peculiar faith was gaining quite a foothold in Shirley and the people opposed to it were becoming alarmed at the spread. In 1783 the persecutors rose against the Shakers and would have killed Mother Ann had the faithful not hid her in a closet in the house of a Shaker. The house still stands and is a part of the buildings owned by the community. John Whiteley, the present presiding Elder and Trustee of the communities of Shirley and Ayer, has held the position of presiding Elder since Nov. 27, 1871, and the trusteeship since January, 1884. He is nearly seventy-five years old, but is strong and vigorous and able to conduct the affairs of the Society for several years to come. He is beloved by all his community as a devout Christian and the soul of integrity and honor. He was born in Huddersfield, England, and came to America in the summer of 1842. He first located at Newburgh, N. Y., but in 1843 took up a government section of eighty acres of land in Illinois, near the town of Elgin. During his four years' residence there he followed his trade, wool sorter, in Dayton and Elgin, but the fever and ague affected him so badly that to save his life the doctors ordered him to return East. He returned, made his home in Lowell and obtained employment in the wool room of the Middlesex company but, after a year there, moved to Audover and commenced work in the Ballardvale wool room. One day soon after he commenced work conversation turned upon religious subjects, all the men freely expressing their views. Finally Mi. Whiteley gave his ideas and a fellowworker exclaimed: 'Whiteley, you ought to go to the Shakers.' On being asked why, he said 'Because you talk like a Shaker.' This man had visited the community at Enfield, bringing back some of their literature which he offered to loan to Mr. Whiteley, an offer gladly accepted. After carefully reading the work and studying its doctrines he discussed the subject with his partner in life. After due deliberation, they determined to visit Shirley and look into the mode of living of this people. In March, 1849, Mr. and Mrs. Whiteley moved to Shirley and joined the South family, where they lived four years. Mr. Whiteley was then appointed Elder and Trustee of the North family and held the position until he was called as presiding Elder of the joint communities of Harvard and Shirley. Father Eleazer Rand was the first presiding Elder and held the position from February, 1791, to November, 1808. He was succeeded by Elder John Warner, who held office to June, 1828. Grove B. Blanchard then held the office until his health failed and Elder John Whiteley was called to take his place, Nov. 27, 1871. When the church was organized in 1791, Nathan Willard was appointed 276 THE MANIFESTO. Trustee. In July, 1832, he died and was succeeded by Jonas Nutting, who held the position to October, 1867. Leander A. Persons succeeded him and in January, 1884, Elder John Whiteley was called to succeed him. Not far from the homestead may be seen a little cemetery where the leaders of the movement sleep the long sleep. The resting places of the early members are marked by rude stones and brief inscriptions, some having only initials on the stone. Of late the stones have a more modern touch, but are still plain and neat, becoming the character of the Society. Here rest some of those who gave the first subscriptions towards founding the Society and in another little plot rest the others. The daily routine of the community is seldom varied. They rise at the same hour, each performs his or her allotted task, or doing necessary and reasonable work according to his abilities and qualifications. Their food is plain and well cooked and is served at reasonable hours. All are expected to retire at 9 p.m. Sundays differ little from other days except that there is a cessation of labors and the addition of devotional exercises. The Shaker's life is almost one continued Sabbath. The chief means of the communities' support is the dairy business and the manufacture of brooms.
