Shaker Station, Ct. May, 1896. Jesus said, 'Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Why may we not have more of that rest, more of that joy? Why may we not even here breathe the pure air of heaven and be strengthened by the sweet songs of peace the angels sing? Let us never be discouraged by trials. If we firmly resolve to subdue wrong we can do it. We should not be disheartened at slow progress, little by little great things are accomplished; 'with truth for our standard' success will be be certain. Avoid all that leads to sin, is a commind of no small import. Nothing is more beautiful than purity, it was this that made our Savior's character divine. It is one of our golden opportunities to be watchful and prayerful. Patient continuance in well-doing will be crowned with success. The way of success is according to the commandment of God. ****** * 'The largest library is in Paris, the Xational, containing 2,200,000 volumes.'
