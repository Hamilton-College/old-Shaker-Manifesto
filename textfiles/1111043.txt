WHEEL-BARROW RELIGION Richard Baxter said a good thing when he said of some one who lived in his day, that they had a ' wheel-barrow religion.' They went when they were shoved. It would be hard to find a better name for the religion of many who live now. Many people are like wheel-barrows, and no Paddy up and down a steep incline has harder and more weary work than those whose duty it is to push them. As often as not they are quite empty. They take what is put into them, whether it is good or worthless. Whatever knowledge-feeling of duty they have, is proof of some one else's work. They are easily upset or emptied, and they have no power or will to get up again. They move as long as a firm hand grasps them and keeps them going. As soon as they are left to themselves they stop, and are helpless and useless unless they are lifted. When they move, it is up and down, backward and forward, never getting any further, or showing any life of their own.
