The Ladies' Home Journal There is an interesting group of bright girls at the New England Conservatory of Music, in Boston, who represent the quality of push characteristic of the American girl. There are some thirty-five of these girls, and they are being musically and vocally educated by The Ladies' Home Journal of Philadelphia. Some time ago this magazine offered, as a stimulant to girls to get subscriptions for it, free education at the Conservatory. The American girl is quick to see a chance, and one by one these thirty-five girls have come from all parts of the country to Boston. They receive the very best the Conservatory affords, the most desirable rooms in the building are theirs, and they have all their wants carefully looked after by a wealthy periodical. Perhaps in no other country on the face of the globe could such a thing be possible. These girls, too, the reporter was told, belong to nice families, but they preferred to earn their own musical education rather than depend on the family purse. Of course, the particular girls are unknown to the scholars at large, and to all intents and purposes they are paying their own way. And they certainly are. It is said that the magazine is also educating a number of other girls at Wellesley, Smith and Vassar Colleges.
