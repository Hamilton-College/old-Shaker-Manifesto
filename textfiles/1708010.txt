Dear Daniel, Dear brother: You will, no doubt... Glasgow, Scotland, Saturday. Elder Daniel, Dear Brother:- - You will, no doubt, be exceedingly anxious to know how Elder Frederick gets along, and how he stands the labors, and how the work opens. Perhaps I cannot do better than to say that yesterday was the Queen's Jubilee day, and so with a little party we went out to Mr. Neilson's house, examining his fine library, and engaging in conversation upon the work and doctrines of Believers. Those present seemed deeply interested. There is a spirit of inquiry everywhere. In the evening, a party of from forty to fifty met us at the hotel, organized into a meeting, when the Elder gave a full exposition of the faith of Believers. They listened with intense interest. His words seemed to have a deep effect. After the address, there followed a conference of inquiry, very harmonious and interesting. Muuy seemed to be inquiring the way to Zion. Night before last, we held another very interesting meeting in the hall of the hotel, a good many friends- -mostly spiritualists- -coming in, when the Elder again spoke with great power, and in the demonstration of the spirit. This discourse of his was very interesting, giving the practical workings of Shakerism in America. The times seem propitious, and I think we came in the right time. The country is in commotion, and the people are crying out for a better state of things. I think the mission must result in great good, and in a gathei'ing. The Elder gets pretty tired ; but his health remains quite good, considering his advanced age. The work goes bravely on. I shall do what I can to help Elder Frederick during our stay. Love to all. Most cordially yours, J. M. Peebles.
