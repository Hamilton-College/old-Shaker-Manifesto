INQUIRY. SCRIPTURE TEXT. No. 1. 'There came a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in ivhom I am well pleased.' Matt. Hi., 17. At the transfiguration a voice was heard, saying,�'This is my beloved Son, hear ye him.' In Exodus xxxiii., it is written, that the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh to his friend, and in Gen. iii., 9 the Lord and Adam conversed about the affair that occurred in the garden of Eden, but John in v., 37 in quoting the words of Jesus that have reference to God, he says,�'Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape,' while in John iv., 12. it reads,�'No man hath seen God at any time.' It might be quite a difficult matter to reconcile all that may have been said or done as recorded in the first books of the Bible with the statements found in the New Testament. The voice of God in the garden of Eden was quite different from the voice of God on the banks of Jordan. Dreamers, visionists and seers, whether acting in the capacity of Prophets, or Apostles, tillers of the ground or as keepers of sheep, have from the earliest ages reported themselves as walking and talking with God. To the dreamer while in the embrace of sleep, or to the visionist while entranced, this seems to be as real as any of the transactions of our physical life. John says he saw the heavens opened and heard the voice of God, and in all probability he was the only person at the baptism that saw the heavens open, or the dove descend. It requires spiritual eyes to see spiritual things and spiritual ears to hear the angels sing or even to hear the voice of God. A dreamer may see as distinctly, hear as accurately and conduct an interview as pleasantly and consistently as a person in full consciousness, and during this time be locked securely in a room without company, and his mind wandering in dreamland. John was quite safe in telling those unbelieving Jews that they had neither heard nor seen God, according to the Christ dispensation. The disciples were quite human in manifesting a much deeper interest for the dreamers and seers of their own order, than for those of other people. They could heal the sick, but would see others consumed with fire from heaven, rather than to have them healed in any other name than the one in which they were interested. They could hear the voice of God, but were free to say that those not of their order had never heard God's voice. As the voice of God is the voice of the spirit of goodness, a person must be spiritually impressed to hear it.
