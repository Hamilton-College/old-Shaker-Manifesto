JUDGE NOT. ANDREW BARRETT. 'Judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.' I believe that upon this scripture rests the problem of the Christian's life ; which for ages has rested under the vale of spurious sectarianism and which they have tried to work out through their narrow,contracted ideas of Christ. How often by a hasty judgment we judge falsely. What breaks the union or wounds the feelings like false judgment? With the same lips do we praise God and curse our brother. Can this be right? Let the unruly tongue be brought under control by curb bit, and by gospel discipline and our heaven on earth has begun. False judgment always leads to deceit and lies for almost invariably the accuser has passed his judgment behind the back of the accused not having moral courage of character to come up arid sayï¿½brother have we not been friends long enough to speak of a fault to each other without offence ; I perceive you do so and so and it is very disagreeable to me and the company with whom we associate. Who could help giving respect to such an admonition and do better ! But not so with false judgment. According to their own carnal reasoning, we are measured, judged and weighed in their balance of false justice and found wanting in the spirit of Christ. All this done without even a witness on our side to save our characters from total destruction. Now what more shall we say of this Apollyon? the Giant Despair of the Christian's happiness, who seeks opportunities to find some flaw, or pickup some old bone that once a true friend has thrown away into the mud and filth where it belongs and commence gnawing to see if there is not a little meat left to satiate their cravings. And not satisfied with satiating their own hunger, they hunt up a bosom friend and let them have a part. 'Judge not that ye be not judged. ' How in unison this chimes with the leading maxim of the true Christian 'Do unto others as ye would have them do to you.' But we are not through yet with false judgment. While the heavy batteries of truth are sending their heavy shot don't let us miss the mark. An ugly old mule balking at every turn of the road and going only when urged forward by the smart of the lash. Selfwilled, independent, always ready to hug self when the fire of gospel truth is turned upon the enemy's works, and then where and how do we find the poor miserable coward ; fleeing before his enemy and with wide open eyes looking behind for fear of being shot in the back. 'And with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.' Let us who are young beware of this traitorous enemy it will prove untrue in every case. With a jealous eye it looks upon its brother or sister to see wrong in every motive and action. It has severed many tender cords of friendship which might have remained strong. It was the club that struck down one of the first images of God upon earth and it remains the accuser of the brethren and should be cast out. The gospel has given us liberty of conscience and liberty of speech, and this above every other earthly prize my soul covets; and shall I shun the warfare that will bring freedom to our ranks? I esteem no sacrifice too great for the graces of the gospel, no conflict with the powers of evil too severe for the redemption of my spirit from an earthly worldly life into the angelic.
