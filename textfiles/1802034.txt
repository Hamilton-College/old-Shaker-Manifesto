PRAY FOR THE CHILDREN Marianne Farningham You know what life will bring them Of sorrow and of care ; You know the world has burdens, And each must take a share. The sun will oft be hidden, The storms will often come, Before the children enter The safety of 'the home.' But you, for sorrow sighing, Because you have no power To give them strength or shelter In the coming trial hour, Should need remember gladly That God, the Mighty One, Can aye defend the children, Until their course is run. And though you cannot save them From the sorrows of the way, You have a Mighty Helper Who hears whene'er you pray; And though the path be gloomy, Or the torrent deep and wide, He will support the children By keeping at their side. God will protect the helpless, And he will ever be The friend of those who labor, And set the captives free; His hand shall be upon them, To strengthen and to bless, He never will forsake them, Nor leave them comfortless. So, if you love the children, Take them in prayer to him, Beseech his love and mercy, For days or bright or dim; And he will turn and listen, And he will heed the cry, And this the great prayer-blessing Shall reach them silently. Oh, do not sigh for sorrow, That little you can do, For by your prayers prevailing, There is a power in you Which still shall bless the children When you have passed away, And never more shall leave them Till the dawning of heaven's day. So take the children early To the gentle Master's feet, And he shall teach them ever ^he lessons that are meet; And he will give them shelter, And he will be their friend Till the need of prayer is over, And all their troubles end.
