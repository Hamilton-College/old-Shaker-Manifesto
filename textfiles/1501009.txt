'GOD IS LOVE.' MATILDA J. TATTERTON It is written tGod is Love,' and the more we love, the mure must we resemble Him who is the great Fountain oi love and excellence. Then let each one who bears the Christian name, add drop to drop until the clear waters spread wide over all the earth. Let us nourish the sentiment of love in the hearts of others by the manifestation of our own kindly THE MANIFESTO. 13 thoughts in charitable deeds ; and forget not the love we owe 'Him who first loved us.' if there is beauty in one part of the Bible more than in another, it is expressed in that sentiment. Let us take it home for our consideration, reflect upon it; and if we can rise from our meditation with other than an interested love for auy of the children of God, our heart is indeed shrouded in darkness. Inasmuch as He who created us in His own image, created also our brother, should we not extend our love to him. Is revenge our .object? Will it spread sunshine on the downward path of life, or smooth the dying pillow? Ah nay, it will embitter the hours of reflection, and when the soul reaches out for support, our hearts will yearn for that love which in its hour of prosperity we denied to others ; but if we have cherished those sentiments which have their origin in Heaven ; if we have loved not only our friends, but those who have done us wrong, we can meet more confidently those whom we may have wronged, but whose forgiveness we implore. As we desire charity and love we must extend the same to others ; in this way can we become Sons and Daughters -of our God. Canterbury, N. H.
