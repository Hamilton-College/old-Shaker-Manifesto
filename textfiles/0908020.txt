STARVED TO DEATH In an attic, cold and dreary, Lay a mother and her child, Helpless, hopeless, weak and weary, And with craving hunger wild. Husband, father, toil-enduring, Working hard for pittance pay— In a week, enough procuring For his family for a day. Neighbors learn their sad condition ; Gather in to render aid ; Husband goes for a physician— Cannot come, unless he's paid. Tries another and another, Until one consents to come, But too late to save the mother— She in Death's cold arms is numb. Millions spent in church-adorning— Millions wasted, making laws; Millions of the people mourning, While the demon hunger gnaws. Oh, ye paid and trusted leaders! Listen, while ye hold your breath : In this land of Bible-readers, Wives and mothers starve to death !
