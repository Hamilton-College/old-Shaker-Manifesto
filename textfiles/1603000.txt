AN INTERIOR VIEW. NO. 2. OLIVER C. HAMPTON. I have very seriously thought over iMs solemn theme of what is termed among Believers, 'the visible Order of God,' and so well am I convinced of its inexorable verity, that I am willing to stake my eternal salvation on the practical issue of the premises and conclusion enunciated in my first article. I know of persons and not a few either, who, to be sure, are ready to object to the theories therein contained on the score of the annihilation of their individuality. They say, ' If man is to subject himself in all things to this organized power in others, he is no longer an individual independent structure, but merely a helpless wheel in another machine. ' We would reply to this, 1st. 'Was he ever anything else?' Not he, indeed. Who does not know that ' God never made an independent man, 'Twould mar the beauty (logic) of the general plan.' 2nd. Suppose it should embarrass and restrain his lusts and appetites and force him to even very seriously shorten sail on his directly selfish impulses and bring him into the discipline, and gradually the love, of doing good to others instead of the worship of the worse than worthless idol of what he is pleased to call his individual, independent self. This very self-abnegation will increase his happiness and spiritual elevation and glory a million fold. Again, I am convinced that there is no independent individuality except the infinite Love and Wisdomï¿½even our eternal Father and Mother. All the rest of us, finite creatures are bound AN together in the bundle of life and though differentiated by personalities, we are and forever shall be dependent on each other and our interests cannot be separated in time nor eternitv. And the nature of that dependence being, and resting upon the logical exponeDt of our dear Bro. Paul (' the less being blest of the better,') we are only left the alternative of kicking against the goads of our logical, as well as emotional convictions, or of accepting the better way and taking sanctuary under the benignant shadow and protection, of this sublime 'Visible Order of Heaven,' an order as before stated, permeating all worlds and all heavens throughout the Universe even ' Though sordid selfishness should flee dismayed And plunge headlong to its infernal shade. ' In this visible representation of 'God manifested in the flesh,' dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily inasmuch as the dual character of Deity is found therein, by which as parents, the greater, nourish, comfort and protect the less (their spiritual offspring) and in whom as divine representatives are contained all the spiritual medicine necessary for the healing of the nations. I have through the unmerited munificence of these our Father and Mother enjoyed and fully proven, the divine efficacy of this sublime Order for more than sixty three years, and can say, ' I know of the doctrine that it is true having never failed in a single instance in my allegiance to this sacred Order, nor in unequivocal obedience to its salutary requirements. I have had thorny paths of affliction to travel and 'through much tribulation to enter this kingdom of Heaven,' but the abounding love and wisdom, charity and forbearance of this all sustaining Shekiua, has ever been to me, as a pillar of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, to guide me safely through all the sorrows and dangers of this rudimental life. My observation as well as my actual experience go to confirm me in the solidness of this foundation for eternal life. Scores and scores of times have I been released from intense sufferings and been filled full of consolation and peace by going to this sacred tribunal and freely unbosoming my inward temptations, afflictions and even agonies, and this releasement has often been so sudden and spontaneous as to seem even miraculous. On the other hand where I have seen the kindly efforts of this visible Order repulsed and resisted and an organized rebellion set up against it, I have seen without a single exception the disaster and spiritual ruin of the recalcitrant party or parties. I recollect in the long ago, a man who drew a third part of the stars of heaven as it were after him to the earth, from their cosy home of repose and tranquillity in these upper heavens of obedience to the visible order of Christ's pentecostal church re-established by our blessed Mother. He may not have foreseen the full consequences that were to follow, the gray and gloomy cinders of desolation that were to appear in his wake, the silent ruin he would have to be responsible for. But his rebellion swept the church for a time as with the besom of destruction. After leading many astray beyond recall, he himself apostatized and separated from the Society, but the promises he made his followers were never realized. Only ruin and sorrow were experienced by himself and all his party. I walked the streets of Cleveland for hours listening to the ingenious arguments of another individual in opposition to the great truth of 'God manifested in the flesh' through Christ and Mother and their successors. I said all I could to dissuade him from his purposes which were evidently subversive of the sacred order of the church. He, however, persisted, and he and his adherents long since separated in a body from the Church hoping and expecting to form an organization excelling in perfection even 'the pattern shown in the mount.' They soon, however, leavened back into the isolated selfishness of the world and stand today as another solemn proof that '' No weapon formed against the visible order established by the Christ of the universe can prosper' even that ' Kingdom set up upon the earth by the God of heaven which shall never have an end. ' I have written these things in sincerity and out of love and kind solicitude for all who are sin- sick, sorrowful and desolate, and wish to come into closer communion with, and enjoy the consolations of a sweet atonement with God and peace and good will to all their fellow travelers in time. All the interest and object I have left on this earth is to do what good I can toward the sin stricken and sorrowful in elevating them to regions of peace and contentment such as the true church and life of Jesus the Christ is able to bestow upon them. I pray they may give these thoughts a candid examination and then a severe test of their truth by 'being doers of the work' and I will insure a very happy result from this practical experiment.
