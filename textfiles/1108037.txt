THE FOOLISHNESS OF PREACHING EDWARD WILLETT Doctors in plenty, doctors of laws and divinity, Each with his satisfied air, in his wellpadded place: Each with his time-worn notions of Godhead and Trinity, Justification by faith, and salvation by grace ! What, after all, is the just and truthful amount of it, All of their arguments, all of their eloquent speech ? What can they show as the issue of all that they preach ? Truly the finger of each, as erect as the steeple is, Pointing to heaven, conveys a continual call: Yet they are over or under the point where the people is, Mostly beyond or behind the great mass of us all. Sins may be checked here and there, the vile and out-breaking ones ; Good men grow better, and evil men sometimes are stirred ; Hearts may be eased by the comfort held out to the aching ones; Life has been purified greatly by preaching the Word. Yet are their labors too often mere weakness and vanity, Soft on the ears of the cultured and satisfied few ; Yet do the hungry and thirsty great droves of humanity Wander afar from the preacher, the choir, and the pew. Eminent doctors! Doctors of laws and divinity ! Where is the spirit of Peter, Apollos and Paul? If, as you say, you are duly ordained by Infinity, Cast in your nets, and give God a miraculous haul! If, as you claim, there is truth in the Word that you preach to us, Think of the years and the days and the moments you lose ! Stand not too high, but humbly come down here and preach to us â€” Preach to the millions who never find room in your pews ?
