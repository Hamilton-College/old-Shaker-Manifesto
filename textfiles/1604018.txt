PROFANITY. It is recorded in the account of the voyage of the Jeannette, that there was but one case of punishment on board, from the time she left San Francisco until she was crushed in the ice, and that was for profanity. It occurred to me that if the penalty of the law should be inflicted in New York, and all pro' fane swearers strung up at one time, the sight would be at least novel, and the streets be relieved for a season. It is a provision in the penalty for this crime, that sailors shall bear all the sins of the muUitude? It would seem to be a fact beyond controversy, that though a few ministers and churches deny it, the gre?t body of the people do not believe in everlasting d*m* * *n, if one may judge from the uninterrupted torrent of blasphemy that flows in the streets, in the ferry boats, in the cars, in the Post Office, in almost every business place he goes into, this is heard. Men assume the divine prerogative and pretend to determine, one for the other his everlasting destiny. Every one knows or ought to, in a land filled with Bibles, that for more than fifteen hundred years, under the Jewish government, the penalty for blasphemy was death. Was God's fury to be poured out upon his chosen, and not upon the heathen, the Gentiles? Is He no longer jealous for His holy name? If blasphemy is no longer a crime, why do so :nany legislative bodies, not especially noted for godliness, recognize it as such? If it is a crime, why should the criminal be left to go on unpunished, or the law be repealed, and if repealed, why not repeal all law, based on the, ' thou shalt not, ' of the Infinite and Almighty?
