Stair carpets should always have a slip of paper put under them, at and over the edge of every stair, which is the part which they wear first in order to lessen the friction of the carpet, against the boards beneath. The strips should be within an inch or two as long as the carpet is wide, and about four or five inches in breadth. A piece of old carpet answers better than paper if you have it.
