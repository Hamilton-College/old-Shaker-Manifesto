THE ABODE OE HAPPINESS. BY S. MANSFIELD. 'Mid squalid haunts of poverty, 'Mid princely courts and palaces, Full many a year sought wise Sadi, The glittering home of Happiness, Where was it found! beneath what sky? What zone of heaven spans its dome? Alas ! nowhere did he espy Her safe retreat; her long sought home; But fruitless search with sorrows rife, Embittered e'en the cup of life. Once wandering in a dim old wood, He saw a temple 'mong the trees, High, vast and grand�it proudly stood, Old as the hoary centuries. He mounts the step, with trembling pace, He treads the vast and solemn hall, He 'spies a door, and o'er the place, Was this inscription on the wall; Here gnaws no pain�here wounds no dartHere fortune dwells,�here rests the heart. ' ' O happiest hour of life, how dear ' No more my weary feet shall roam, 0, happiness at last so near! At last I've found my secret home. ' Thus cried the sage, as joyfully He hastes to ope the mystic door, Ele stands aghast! what did he see? A dismal cavern, grim and hoar, And peering in its awful gloom, He saw far down�saw what?�A Tomb. '
