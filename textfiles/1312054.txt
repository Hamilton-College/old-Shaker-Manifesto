At a silent, invisible loom... At a silent, invisible loom, Always, morning and night, With tender care wrought One, Who was hidden from human sight. Tangled and broken threads wrought He, And his finished web was fair to see, For he gathered the hopes that were broken in twain, And wrought them into His web again. Exchange.
