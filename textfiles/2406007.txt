IN SILENCE AND ALONE. By Catharine S. Holmes. [Contributed by J. J. Kaime.] If thou wouldst draw near to God And wouldst hear him inly speak, Far from tumult and from crowd, All alone his presence seek. Let thine incense burn apart Till he heed its sweet perfume; For the silent, reverent heart Is the Master's audience room. When the air is filled with song, Thou wilt sing, nor question why, Though the tide which rolls along Leave thy parched spirit dry. Words which entered at thine ear From thy careless tongue have flown, Ere thou couldst the witness hear That their comfort was thine own. With the still, small voice he came, Not in earthquake, wind, or fire. When thou callest on his name, Purely, mightily aspire. Lift thy hands his clasp to meet, Still thine earthly nature's strife, Till celestial accents sweet Speak to thee the words of life. IN
