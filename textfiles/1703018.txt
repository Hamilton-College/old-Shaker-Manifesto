LIVE FOR SOMETHING Live for something ; be not idle- - Look about thee for employ; Sit not down to useless dreaming- - Labor is the sweetest joy. Folded hands are ever weary, Selfish hearts are never gay, Life for thee hath many duties- - Active be, then, while you may ! Scatter blessings in thy pathway ; Gentle words and cheering smiles Better are than gold or silver, With their grief-dispelling wiles. As the pleasant sunshine falleth Ever on the grateful earth, So let sympathy and kindness Gladden Avell the darkened hearth! Hearts there are oppressed and wearyDrop the tear of sympathy; Whisper words of hope and comfort, Give, and thy reward shall be Joy unto thy soul returning from this perfect fountain-head ; Freely, as thou freely givest, Shall the grateful light be shed ! The Catholic.
