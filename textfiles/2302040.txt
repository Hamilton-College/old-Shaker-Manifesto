KIND WORDS. Beloved Elder:--Many thanks to you... South Union, Ky. Jan. 3, 1893. Beloved Eldee :�Many thanks to you for your kind remembrance of your gospel Sisters in the West. We bless the daily efforts in putting forth the life and testimony of all true and faithful Believers. I am interested in reading the Manifesto and in learning the music. From the Sisters in the Office. Lucilla Booker. Elder Henry Blinn, Esteemed Friend... San Fkancisco, Cal., Dec. 1892. Elder Henby Blinn, Esteemed Fbiend;�The Manifesto is a source of great benefit to me. Presenting as it does, the truth in its simplest and purest form, it is the true expounder of a faith, which claims to be the pure, simple, unadulterated Christianity. It appeals to the heart and feelings, as well as to the intellect, and can therefore be read with profit by all classes of society. May it grow and prosper and bring about a realization of the beautiful song of the angels: 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will toward men.' Truly yours, Henry Hellmers.
