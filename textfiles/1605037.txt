From the Little Children. When working in the kitchen... When* working in the kitchen or dining room, not any more than six plates or saucers should be taken, and not more than four cups, and when we have large pitchers to take we should never take more than one, unless they are empty. When we clear off a table the food should be taken off first, then take off the dirty dishes, then take off the castors and brush the crumbs off with a brush or cloth, then get some warm water and put a little soap into the water and a cloth and wash the table clean, then sweep the floor, then set the tables neatly and shut the doors.
