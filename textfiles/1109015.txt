The Children's Grotto THE CONTENTED HERD BOY Iu a flowery dell a herd boy kept liis sheep; and because his heart was joyous he sang so loudly that the surrounding- hills echoed back his song. One morning the king, who was out on a hunting expedition, spoke to him and said : ' Why are you so happy, dear little one ? ' ' Why shall I not be ? ' he answered ; ' our king is no richer than I.' ' Indeed ! ' said the king, ' tell me your great possessions.' The lad answered : ' The sun in the bright blue sky shines as brightly upon me as the king. The flowers on the mountain and the grass in the valley grow and bloom to gladden my sight as well as his. I would not take a hundred thousand thalers for my hands ; my eyes are of more value than all the precious stones in the world ; I have food and clothing-, too. Am I not, therefore, as rich as the king ? ' ' You are right,' said the king, with a laugh, ' but your greatest treasure is a contented heart; keep it so and you will always be happy.'
