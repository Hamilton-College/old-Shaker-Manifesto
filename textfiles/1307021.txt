REPENTANCE. AN ALLEGORY A hermit was conducted by an angel into a wood where he saw an old man cutting down &gt;oughs to make up a load. When it was arge he tied it up and attempted to lift it on THE MANIFESTO. 159 his shoulders and carry it away, but finding it too heavy he laid it down, cut more wood and heaped it on, then tried again to carry it off. This he did several times, always adding something to the load after trying in vain to raise it from the ground. In the mean time the hermit astonished at the old man's folly desired the angel to explain what this meant. 'You behold,' said he, 'in the foolish old man, an exact representation of those who, being made sensible of the burden of their sins, resolve to repent, but soon grow weary and instead of lessening their burden increase it every day. At each time they find the task heavier than it was before and so put it off a little longer in the vain hope that they will, by and by, be more able to accomplish it. Then they go cm adding to their burden until it grows too heavy to be borne, and then in despair of God's mercy, and with their sins unrepented of they lie down and die. Turn again my son, and behold the end of the old man whom thou sawest heaping up a pile of boughs.' The hermit looked and saw him in vain attempting to remove the pile which was now accumulated far beyond his strength to raise. His feeble limbs tottered over the burden; the poor remains of his strength were fast ebbing away: the darkness of death was gathering around him ; and after a convulsive and impatient attempt to lift the load, he fell down and expired.â€”Selected.
