South Family Dec. 1807. November has been the bearer of tidings glad and sad. On the 19th we were made glad by an interesting visit from our brother, Hamilton DeGraw, a life member of the Sonyea Society. He gave us a pleasing account of his recent return trip to the dear old home, of the markt renovations perfected there since our departure, but we shall ever love best its homelike plainness, Nov. 21st (to-day) we go to the North family to attend the 'Welcome Home Meeting' of our loved Sister Martha J. Anderson, the noted hymnologist of the age, and inspired singer of Mt. Lebanon. Now that she still lives, we trust she will have time to visit us. Sister Martha was one of God's noble women, possessing in a markt degree, the qualities that constitute the Christian virtues. Nov. 25th we observed as a special day of thanks-rendering, recounting the many blessings, spiritual and temporal that are ours to enjoy, remembering that in the year 1621 the first Thanksgiving hymn was sung, by the noble band who crost the sea for freedom's land. Nov. 28th records one of the sad scenes of 1897 a barn containing thirty tons of hay went up in smoke. The structure was an ancient landmark erected during the days when Mother Ann Lee traveled through this section. We pray that a protecting power may surround our Zion homes and 'keep them from flood, from flame and famine and in God's goodness may we share, thus we implore thee heavenly Father for thy protecting hand of care.' Dec. 1st we are invited to be present at the memorial services of our angel mother, Eldress Ann Taylor, beautiful and prophetic were the tributes rendered in honor of her long and useful life, her parting blessing 'love to all' was given to the assembly, by Sister Ann Maria Graves, to whom she made known her last wish. May this be our motto 'Love to all.' Genevieve DeGraw
