THE SECRET 'I noticed,' said Dr. Franklin, 'a mechanic, among others, at work on a house erecting but a little way from my office, who always appeared to be in a merry humor, who had a kind word and cheerful smile for every one he met. Let the day be ever so cold, gloomy or sunless, a happy smile danced like a sunbeam on his cheerful countenance. Meeting him one morning, I asked him to tell me the secret of his happy flow of spirits. ' My secret, Doctor/ he replied, ' is that I have got one of the best wives, and when I go to work she always has a kind word of encouragement for me, and when I go home she meets me with a smile and a kiss, and then tea is sure to be ready, and she has done so many things through the day to please me, that I cannot find it in my heart to speak an unkind word to anybody.' What an influence then, to soften the heart of man, a woman hath. To make it the fountain of cheerful and^pure emotions ! Speak gently, then ; a happy smile and a kind word of greeting, after the toils of the day are over, cost nothing, and go far toward making a home happy and peaceful.'
