The Air in Bedrooms — As to tests, we are glad to see that a scientific lecturer has reminded people that nature gave them their noses to use, and he advises them to employ this picket-guard of the body to see if the air of their bedrooms is right. ' When you get up,' he says, 'leave your bedroom just as it was ; go out into the pure morning air and breathe that till your nose is wide awake, then go back and take a few snuffs of your bedroom air ; if it smells fresh and sweet, like out.door air, you have good ventilation, and have breathed the breath of life all the night.' If on the contrary it smells close, musty, ' thick,' sickening, your nose will have told you what your sense ought to have made clear without the test. Another test.— If you desire a killing proof of the impurity of air that has been once breathed, hang up a canary bird in a cage at the top of a closely curtained bedstead, and if the bed is occupied, the bird will be dead in the morning.
