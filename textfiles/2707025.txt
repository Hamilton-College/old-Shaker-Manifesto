An Indian admonition to trust in God was given to Captain John Smith as follows,�'Brother, as you have lived with the white people, you have not had the same advantage of knowing that the Great Being above feeds his people, and gives them their meat in due season, as we Indians have, who are frequently out of provisions, and yet are wonderfully supplied; and that so frequently, that it is evident that the hand of the Great Owaneego doeth this. Whereas the white people have large stocks of cattle, that they can kill when they please, and also their barns and cribs filled with grain, and therefore have not the same opportunity of knowing that they are supported by the Ruler of Heaven and Earth. Brother, be assured that you will be supplied with food, and that just in the right time; but you must continue diligent in the use of means;�go to sleep, and rise early in the morning and go hunting, be strong and exert yourself like a man, and the Great Spirit will direct your way.'
