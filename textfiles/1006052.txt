WHAT AN OLD MAN HAS NOTICED I Lave noticed that all men are honest when well watched. I have noticed that purses will hold pennies as well as pounds. I have noticed that merit is always measured in the world by its success. I have noticed that in nearly all things money is the main object in view. I have noticed that in order to be a reasonable creature it is necessary at times to be downright mad. I have noticed that some men are so honest that necessity compels them to be dishonest in the end. I have noticed that silks, broad cloths and jewels are often bought with other people's money. I have noticed that the prayer of the selfish man is ' Forgive us our debts,' while he makes everybody that owes him pay to the utmost farthing. I have noticed that he who thinks every man a rogue is very certain to see one wffen he shaves himself, and he ought in mercy to his neighbor to surrender the rascal to justice. I have noticed that money is the fool's wisdom, the knave's reputation, the poor man's desire, the covetous man's ambition, and the idol of all. I have noticed that all men speak well of all men's virtues when they are dead, and that tombstones are marked with epitaphs of the good and virtuous. Is there any particular cemetery where the bad men are buried ?
