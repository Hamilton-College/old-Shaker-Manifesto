Ayer, Mass. Aug. 1891. Deae Editor:�I see by the last Manifesto that I am brought upon the stand, Criticism by Br. D. OfCord. Well, I think I deserve it, though it was my intention on leaving home to have only a few days of rest. I have gathered much spiritual treasure, and while enjoying these rich seasons of good at the several Societies, I did regret not having the company of our good Sisters, to share with me, and to drink in the heavenly inspirations. We are exhorted in our little paper to give breath to the spiritual as well as to the temporal. During my visit to my former home they gave me the privilege of a two days' visit to the little family in Canaan which met my feelings most agreeably. In my interviews with the Brethren and Sisters, many expressed a strong faith in the work of crucifixion, by the cross. The hour of worship really did my soul good, as I listened to the testimonies of truth that found utterance in that little united band, I could say with one of old, �'It is good to be here.' Not only were we with those in the body, but the presence of the immortals was sensibly felt during this beautiful season. All through my old home I could realize the blessings of a heavenly influence resting upon those who were still holding most sacred, those principles of purity which they have valued more than life. If by the outward we read the index of the mind, or that which is spiritual, we must say that Mount Lebanon holds her place as the fountain head, from whence our other homes may still draw new life. How pleasant it was to see consecrated souls ornamenting aud making their home attractive, in the beautifying of the Lord's heritage. After a wearisome season of toil and care we are beginning to realize the benefits of good and thorough farming. From less than a quarter of an acre we took seventy-five bushels of extra nice potatoes, and the remaining four acres have the appearance of producing as good results. Our corn and ensilage crop never was better. The Sisters are busy in preserving the fruit, and in caring for the herbs. The dry weather has very much reduced our water supply, and at present, we are obliged to resort to the pumps for much that we use. A. D. B.
