THE MALE AND FEMALE PRINCIPLES IN DEITY. The writer in the Methodist Recorder, who criticises Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith for saying 'Our Mother God,' does not show himself to be better acquainted with the ancient language than Mrs. Smith doej. If he had more information he would know that different words applied to the Deity signified different things in Him. When God is regarded as having more power�not brute power, but spiritual power�one word is applied to Him. Then the idea conveyed his regard to Truth. And this is the masculine, element in the Deity. And Truth is the masculine attribute in God, or Truth is God Himself in the old Testament. But when another attribute in Him is considered, then, in the original language, another name is applied to Him. The additional element or attribute regarded, giviug another appellation, is Love. This is the female principle in the Divine Being. These two elements in the Divine Being constitute the Jehovah of the New Testament, and the Lord Jesus Christ of the New Testament. Or God in the New Testament is Love, while Jesus is truth. In the text, God is Love. '0 TIipos agapa esti,' love is in the feminine gender, though Theos is masculine. In the Old Testament, where the Deity imparts the two qualities of truth and love to the race, as the race is composed of the male and the female, the result is called 'man,' not a man, but mau. God created man in his own image, in the image of Gou created He him ; male and female created he them. Then 'male and female' constitute '�man' There is a male man and a female man, both created of God in his image. In the original, the race name of Adam is given to the male and female, which constitutes the race. Ish is the name for a man, Isha is the name for a woman, but Adam is the name of the race, constituted of male and female. Thus is the race female created�not the woman that was formed of the ribs of Adam. This woman was the one that deceived Adam. She was formed of Adam's rib, not created in the image of God. She was a form of Adam's rib, or she was the self-hood of Adam, the selfishness and the self-conceit of Adam, or the race, under the seductive influence of the serpent�Nature, the self-hood that is in love with the things of the senses. This is the man that tyrannizes over the woman�is the sinner that sternly and stubbornly refuses to her the simple justice that is her axiomatic and inalienable right�the right to say how she shall be hung, if die she must, at the bidding of her tyrant. The full argument to sustain this view cannot be given here, but it stands on an impregnable basis of the clearest criticism, a criticism based in the highest reason and in the nature of things. God is called Elohim all through the first chapter of Genesis, because the Truth is represented as acting. But in the second chapter, where the Deity is represented as acting by Truth united to Love, He is called Jehovah, or Lord God. Here Love, the female element is considered in relation to truth. The higher element is added to the lower one, when Elohim becomes Jehovah. The male element comes first and makes preparation ; and then the female element, the higher one, comes last or second. Love is first in excellence, but truth is first in action. God is love. Jesus is truth. Jesus was begotten of God, born of a woman, and made externally one with the Father by Glorification. God is love. Jesus is truth. The Holy Spirit is a proceediug from God, dwelling in Jesus ; and it was not given till after Jesus was glorified. The Holy Spirit is not he, as the writer in The Methodist Recorder, erroneously affirms. The Greek word for Spirit is in the neuter gender, while Holy is an adjective. The Holy Spirit is not a person, but is the Divine Proceeding, emanating from God as love and J-esus as truth, the feminine and the masculine principles which constitute Deity, making Him the Divine Man. The love-element in God is second in activity but first in excellence; but woman, who represents the love-element is neither as such, superior or inferior to man as such. Each is the equal of the other by virtue of the sexconstitution. Woman, as such, acts from love and truth ; and man, as such, acts from truth and love ; while the two things are so adjusted as to make male and female exact equals us images of God. As equals, in a state of society which is Christiau, equal rights, justice, equity and privileges will be awarded to both sexes. Less than this is uot Christian, is not justice, is contrary to natural rights and to the equity that is called conscience. If there are differences in the sexconstitutions, in a truly Christian state of society, the tastes of the individuals will guide in selection of callings and iMiiployments. That woman may fail to attain her own ideal bv having the elective franchise, the writer, one of the masculine gender, has not a single doubt. But by having it, she may succeed in removing from the statute books some laws too cruel and infamous to be justly characterized in the use of language. Give her, her axiomatic rights, and let her use the rights for the good of her sex and for the elevation of the race as she deems best. For a thousand years man has played the tyrant, leaving the race the victims largely of the lusts, passions and ambi- tions to the vast detriment of our kind. Now give woman the opportunity of mere naked justice, and let her have a word to say where man has signally failed. Cease to withhold in the grasp of the tyrant, her clearest rights and let time afford results. No man of thought and heart can or will fear consequences. �J. M. Washburn, Terrell, Texas.
