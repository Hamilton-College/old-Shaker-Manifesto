Heaven is Within BY ANGELUS SILESIUS, A. D 1620. How far from here to heaven ? Not very far, my friend ; A single hearty step Will all thy journey end. Hold, there ! where rnnnest thon ? No, heaven is in thee ! Seek'st thon for God elsewhere? His face thou'lt never see. Go outâ€”God will go in ; Die thoit, and let him live ; Be not, and he will be ; Wait, and he'll all things give. I don't believe in death; If hour by hour I die, 'Tis hour by hour I gain A better life thereby.
