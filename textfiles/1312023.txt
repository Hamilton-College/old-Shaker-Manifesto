OUR SAVIOE'S WORDS. AMANDA TIFFANY. Our Savior said, 'I am the way the truth and the light,' also, take up a daily cross and follow me. Now as mankind in general confess Jesus Christ, as their pattern, in him centers their religion. Why not follow his example, live out his teaching in a daily, practical life. It has truly been said, 'faith without works is dead.' Now, if we claim to be his followers we must live as he lived, fasting from a carnal, sinful life, and as he was baptized in the river Jordan confessing his sins, so must we be baptized with the holy spirit confessing our sins. Herein we receive power to forsake them. Our Savior also said, 'love one another,' 'do unto others as you would have others do unto you,' 'render good for evil,' and live in peace. Beautiful teachings ! If all mankind would remember, and live out those teachings strictly, what a Paradise our earth would be. How different from the condition now existing; where sin and crime rages from pole to pole, causing sorrow, misery and suffering without end; peace, joy and happiness might reign supreme. Would it not be well for all professing Christians, to examine their lives, and see if in their daily works they honor the name and profession they hold so dear? I know there are those who do live out Christ's teachings in a great degree, though few in number, yet their influence shall be felt and their glory shine forth to the nations of earth, that those who seek the way of life and truth may find it in God's holy temple on earth. Here the weary may find rest, and the sin-sick soul rejoice in the power that cleanses and saves from sin. Let all who wish to be true followers of Christ enter his fold, where there is power to live the self-denying life he taught, free from the sorrows and burdens of sin. Enfield, Conn.
