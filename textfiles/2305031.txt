South Union, Ky. Apr. 2, 1893. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½You say you are walking among snow drifts. Well, Sabbathday 124 THE MANIFESTO. we are reveling in sunshine and flowers. Mercury stands at 65 degrees and peach trees are in full bloom. Leaf buds are bursting and the woods will soon be green. We have planted our gardens, also some corn in the fields. Sometimes we have a little frost. On the night of March 24th we had a very severe gale accompanied with rain and hail, which did us much damage. It unroofed a part of the dwelling at the East family, and damaged the dwelling at the West family by breaking the slate on the roof and the glass in the windows. Miles of fencing and lots of timber as well as many fruit trees were blown down and left for us to witness the destruction of a few hours. I enclose two little flowers, a hyacinth and a buttercup. In these you will see that spring is on its way to your northern home. We report some sickness as the children are afflicted with the measles. John W. Perryman.
