A CURE FOR INTEMPERANCE Many inebriates are lost who might be saved by loving hearts. Grosvenor, the Shaker philanthropist, under the banner, ' Love conquers all things,' moves upon the enemy's works. It seems that forty years ago he began to plead with profane swearers, and when he had secured their attention, begged them in turn to plead with others, which always proves the surest means of self-cure. Finding this personal appeal successful, he resolved to try it upon the victim of strong drink. His plan is this. Meeting a man under the influence of drink he greets him with brotherly kindness, and waits a reply. Whatever the man may speak about, Mr. Grosvenor joins in his thought, and talks on with sincere and affectionate earnestness. Having thus secured the man's interest and confidence, he then speaks to him most solemnly of the sin of intemperance, and induces him, if possible, to promise abstinence. He helps the poor fellow home, and visiting him frequently for a few days, helps him to rouse his will, and then sets him at work helping others. THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 13.7 His remarkable success in the cure of drunkards confirms liis opinion that in this spirit of fraternal love, and by this method many drunkards may besaved. Reformers should make a note of it. Wendell Phillips thinks that if those who are interested on behalf of drunkards would give Mr. Grosvenor's method ' the fair play of an experiment,' it would be a fortunate thing for unfortunate men. Several of the leaders among the Shakers, for example, Elders Evans, Avery and Blinn, warmly indorse Mr. Grosvenor's aims and methods. â€” Boston Paper.
