Editor Manifesto: I have been repeatedly... Sonyea, N. Y. May 1887. Editor Manifesto :- -I have been repeatedly questioned by individuals, residents of your village and elsewhere in regard to .the position that we take as a religious society in reference to the temperance movement and what is our practice in regard to the use of spirituous and malt liquors ? In answer to such inquiries I would say that we take the ground of total abstinence in every case where it is possible. Liquor is used as a medicine only in very limited quantities by a very few. One of the principles taught by the founder of our Order was, 'Temperance in all things,'both in eating and drinking. Even the use of tobacco is discouraged, and very few use it. The writer was reared in the society from a small child and has never used intoxicating drinks or tobacco in any form whatever, and believes he has been benefited in both body and mind by such abstinence. We extend our hearty sympathy and support to the noble band of workers who are striving for the suppression of the evils of intemperance. And this brings another question that is repeatedly asked by our friends. 'Why do you not vote with us as well as pray for the success of the Temperance cause?' In reply to this I would state that as a religious body established on the principle of a community of interest in both temporal and spiritual things, it would be a disintegrating force that would cause more harm to us as a society than all the good we could possibly do by the use of the ballot. I think our friends will understand our reasons and respect us for striving to maintain our principles intact from forces that would teni to weaken and overthrow oue of the fundamental principles of the society. Hoping this will place us right before the public, I remain, Yours lvspectfully, Hamilton DeGraw.
