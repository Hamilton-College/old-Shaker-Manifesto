He thus gives his prevention: I never overstock my poultry house. I always keep their quarters clean and sweet. I use plenty of lime and I keep them well supplied with pure fresh water. I feed them morning, noon and evening at regular hours with a variety of wholesome food. A little fresh lime in their water is very good during the summer months, but you must not forget to clean the poultry house every week.
