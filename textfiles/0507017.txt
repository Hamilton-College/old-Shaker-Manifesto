REMARKS Allow me to suggest to my new sister Annie, who has quite recently been gathered from the broad expansive plane, where pleasure seeking, in outward external things, is the chief desire and aim, that if the flowers of Earth are beautiful, fragrant and refining, are not heavenly flowers more so ? Would it not be a desirable and beautiful attainment, to become so thoroughly spiritual and inspirational, by holy living, that all the senses be sanctified, and we enabled to see Angels, hear them sing, walk with them in the celestial gardens and cull the flowers which never fade? If we become thus ethereal, when our Gospel friends pass on before us to their home in the spirit spheres, we will be so closely allied to them that there will be a harmonious blending of spirit with spirit; and natural material things, pertaining to earth life, however good and true in their proper place, would not enhance the pleasure and worth of soul communings. The glory of the terrestrial is one thing, and the glory of the celestial another. Ed.
