Shakers, N. Y. July, 1897. On a neat little memento presented us by a friend to be used for removing the dust from the eye glasses was printed the motto, 'If you would see the world aright, Be sure and keep your glasses bright.' It led us to reflect that in all the phases of life objects apparently partake of the condition of the medium through which they are seen. The mind inclined to be misanthropic, looking through the vision of the pessimist sees life as it were moving backward toward universal collapse. But to a mind which has a clear sight, viewing aught existing conditions knowing that out of the conflicts of opinion and clashing of interests that seem at present to absorb and turn to a sinister use human life; above it all there is the good angel of concord, more powerful and farreaching in the results than all the rest. We do not accept the doctrine of a chance world, nor that of fatalism. The one leaving everything to go hap-hazard; the other accepting what ever is as final with no power to change for the better. We would suggest the fact that the good Deacon in his controversy with the slave-holder believed that the Lord would be on the side of the one who was ready to help himself; at least the slave-holder thought so judging by his conduct when they had their last meeting. The prospects at present indicate a heavy hay crop. Spring crops are late, the last corn planting on the 25th of June. When we compare conditions with the flooded districts of the west and the sufferings from the violent wind-storms that have devastated sections of our country we have reason to be thankful for our exemption from those destructive elements.
