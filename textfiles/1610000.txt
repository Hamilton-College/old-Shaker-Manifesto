The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 7. Published expressly for tlie several Communities of Believers in 1S16. Re-written by Henry 0. Blinn. The imprisonment of the Believers in Albany. The preaching of the gospel excited an alarm among the children of this world who viewed with unpleasant apprehension this new religion, embraced as it was with such enthusiastic zeal by so many persons. As the testimony of the gospel was a testimony of peace, it gave occasion to the enemies of the cross of Christ to take advantage of the Believers as the country was in a war with Great Britain. They represented the Believers as enemies to the country and this charge was made the pretext for many abuses which they were obliged to suffer. The first open act of persecution that took place after the testimony was preached in America was in July 1780. As many people from New Lebanon, Hancock and other places resorted to Niskeyuna to hear the word of God, those Believers who were able, took with them provisions for their support. Evil minded men in the vicinity of New Lebanon accused the Believers of acting against the civil government, which soon led to a cruel persecution. David Darrow of New Lebanon while driving a flock of sheep to Niskeyuna, was seized by three men. The sheep were stolen and David was taken before Matthew Adgate, a justice of the peace under the royal government. The charge of treason was brought against him, but as Adgate had no authority to try such cases, David was sent under guard to Albany and delivered to the ' Committee of safety,' to be tried by them. John Hocknell and Joseph Meacham were sent, by the Believers, to Albany to witness the course of the trial, but on their arrival they were held for examination before the Committee. These accusers knew it was contrary to the faith of the Believers to bear arms and become soldiers, and on this account flattered themselves with the hope of confirming the charge of treason. As the minds of the Committee had already been impressed with this fact, they were ready to exert their authority, according to their discretion. After an examination the Brethren were ordered to promise obedience to the laws, without being informed what those laws should be. The result was as might have been expected. The prisoners, whose faith and conscience bound them to obey every just and righteous law, without any external obligation, could not promise obedience to laws which were yet unknown, and which in all probability would be unjust and oppressive. Consequently the Committee sent them to prison. But the imprisonment of only three persons, DavidDarrow, Joseph Meacham and John Hocknell, was not considered as being sufficient to stop the progress of the testimony of the word of God. They next seized Hezekiah Hammond and Joel Pratt, two influential preachers of the gospel of Christ, and committed them to prison. An officer was sent to the home of the Believers and Mother Ann, Elder William Lee and Elder James Whittaker were arrested and taken to Albany. After passing a short examination before the Committee and being charged as enemies to the country, they were committed to prison. This was a day of sadness for the little Community, and their sorrows were in tears and prayers for the protection and safe return of these, their best gospel friends. Mary Partington was permitted to accompany Mother Ann, as her companion, and to assist her as best she could under these unpleasant conditions. Calvin Harlow also went to Albany to render what assistance he was able, to the Brethren. The company were imprisoned in the old City Hall, but after a few days were removed,to a prison in the 'Old Fort, ' where the tories and prisoners of war were confined. All the leading characters of the gospel work were now under arrest by the instigation of evil minded men, who had thought to suppress the testimony by persecution. The Believers were still zealous in their religious service and in supporting the testimony of truth at all hazards. No outward opposition could lessen the zeal of a people who had been awakened by the resurrection power of Christ, and who by their obedience to the truth had been made partakers of the power of salvation from all sin. The next person to be arrested was Samuel Johnson of New Lebanon. It was during the hour of worship, on 'the Sabbath, and while Samuel was engaged in prayer. Several persons hurriedly entered the church and rudely dragged the praying brother from the meeting. After a mock trial before the Justice, Adgate, he was taken to Albany and delivered to the Committee for further trial. Samuel had formerly been a minister in a Presbyterian church, and the crime for which he was charged, was in saying.�'People cannot follow Christ and live in wars and fightings. ' The Commissioners represented to him the danger of preaching such doctrines among the people. Samuel replied,� ' I speak what Grod gives me to speak. I have spoken no more. ' The Commissioners remarked,. 'The elect lady will be sent to the British army at New York,' and intimated that the Society of Believers would be broken up. ' She is the elect lady, indeed and in truth, ' replied Samuel, ' but whether she lives or dies, I know that the work is of Grod, and that this testimony's the testimony of truth. ' Samuel then informed the Commissioners that he received his light on the subject of war from the New Testament, and not from the Believers. He was fully convinced in his own mind that those who follow Christ cannot live in wars and fightings. 'Before receiving this conviction ' said he, '' I was very zealous in the cause of the country, but knowing the truth of Christ's word I could proceed no further. ' The Commissioners then informed Samuel that they would not suffer such doctrines to be preached among the people. Samuel replied, ' I shall speak what God gives me to speak: for I feel it my duty to obey God rather than man. ' This remark offended them very much, and they were on the point of condemning him to be executed as a traitor when Dr. Stringer, one of the Committee declared Samuel to be insane, ami he was ordered to be imprisoned in the jail of the old City Hall. After the excitement was over, many candid and thoughtful men expressed their displeasure at the injustice of the proceedings. The public imprisonment of innocent people, for no other cause, in reality, than their religious faith, had a powerful effect upon the minds of honest and impartial people, and of course, drew many inquiring people to search into the truth of the accusations. This caused a more extensive circulation of the religious principles, than would otherwise have been, if the enemies of the cross had not resorted to persecution. A great many people visited the prisoners, and after having heard their testimony of the work of God, were led to accept the truth, and to seek a privilege to make an honest confession of their sins to God, before his anointed witnesses. In this way the truth prevailed against all opposition, and many were added to the faith. The word of God which could not be bound was preached to large assemblies through the grates of the prison, and the hearts of the hearers were touched to accept the testimony of truth. Many precious gifts of God, many divine lessons of instruction, and many heavenly visions were received by those confined within the prison. Communication was allowed with the friends of the prisoners, and the privilege was granted to the Believers of administering to the necessities of their imprisoned gospel relation, so that in the midst of affliction, they were blessed of God in the spirit of peace. The persecutors of Mother Ann, considering her the grand actress in these movements, directed their malice more particularly against her, and were anxious to banish her to the British army then stationed in New York. The Committee however, decided to send her to Poughkeepsie. She was taken from the prison in Albany, in the month of August, and conveyed on board a sloop, and sent down the river to Poughkeepsie and imprisoned in the jail of that town. On this trip, Mary Partington was allowed to accompany Mother Ann. During this term of imprisonment, Mother Ann was treated generally, with much kindness. As Mary was not considered a prisoner she had full liberty to procure anything that was needed for their comfort. Mother Ann endured this injustice with marked patience and Christian resignation. Much of the time was spent in great suffering of soul and in prayer to God for the protection and prosperity of her spiritual children. Elizar Goodrich, Samuel Fitch and others visited the Sisters in prison, but through fear that the presence of strangers might excite alarm among the inhabitants of the town, they were advised not to tarry long as it might bring on additional persecution. Elizar was the messenger of kind and encouraging words from Mother Ann to the Elders who were still in the prison at Albany. When Elizar delivered his message, the Elders were so overjoyed that they exclaimed, 'How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things, and publish peace.' In thankfulness for this message they all kneeled in prayer with their faces to his feet. After an imprisonment of several weeks, Mother Ann was removed to the house of James Boyd of Poughkeepsie, who had accepted faith in her testimony, while she was in prison and who had with the assistance of Joseph Ellis, another young Believer, become responsible for her appearance at court, so that she was permitted to leave the jail.
