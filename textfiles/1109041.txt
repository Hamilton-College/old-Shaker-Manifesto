Figs, as you see and know... E. D. Slenker Figs, as you see and know, Do not of thistles grow ; And though the blossoms blow While on the tree, Grapes never, never yet On limbs of thorns were set ; So if you good would get, Good you must be. Life's journey through and through Speak what is just and true, Do what is right to do To one and all. â€”
