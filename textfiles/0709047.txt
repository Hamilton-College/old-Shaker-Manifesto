Putting on Christ Do you put him on . when you undertake to copy some one or more of the virtues or characters in him— , the gentleness, for example, the love, the i dignity—without being willing to accept the ¦ sacrifice in him, to bear the world's contempt ¦ with him, to be singular, to be hated, to go ¦ through your Gethsemane, and groan with ! him under the burdens of love ? There can be or choosing out here of shreds and patches from his divine beauty; but you must take t the whole suit, else you cannot put him on. s The garment is seamless, and cannot be divided. — Horace Bushnell
