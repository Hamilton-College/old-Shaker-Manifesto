THE FAULT OF THE AGE. ELLA WHEELER. The fault of the age is a mad endeavor To leap to heights that were made to climb; By a burst of strength or a thought that is clever We plan to outwit and forestall Time. We scorn to wait for the thing worth having; We want high noon at the day's dim dawn; We find no pleasure in toiling and saving As our forefathers did in the good times gone. We force our roses before their season To bloom and blossom that we may wear; And then we wonder and ask the reason Why perfect buds are so few and rare. We crave the gain, but despise the getting; We want wealth, not as reward, but dower; And the strength that is wasted in useless fretting Would fell a forest or build a tower. To covet the prize, yet to shrink from the winning; To thirst for glory, yet fear the light, Why, what can it lead to at last but sinning, To mental languor and moral blight? Better the old slow way of striving And counting small gains when the year is done, Than to use our forces all in contriving And to grasp for pleasures we have not won. From the Indianapolis Journal.
