WHAT OF THAT Tieed! well, and what of that? Didst fancy life was spent on beds of ease, Fluttering the rose-leaves scattered by the breeze Come, rouse thee ! work while it is called toCoward, arise, go forth thy way ! [day. Lonely ! and what of that? Some must be lonely; 'tis not given to all To feel a heart responsive rise and fallï¿½ To blend another life into its own. Work may be done in loneliness; work on ! Dark! well what of that? Didst fondly dream the sun would never set? Dost fear to lose thy way? Take courage yet. Learn thou to walk by faith and not by sight, Thy steps will guided be, and guided right. Hard! well, and what of that? Didst fancy life one summer holiday, [play? With lessons, none to learn, and naught but Go, get thee to thy task ! Conquer or die ! It must be learned. Learn it, then, patiently. No help ! nay, 'tis not so ; Though human help be far, thy God is nigh, Who feeds the ravens, hears his children cry. He's near thee wheresoe'er thy footsteps roam, And he will guide thee, light thee, help thee home. Selected.
