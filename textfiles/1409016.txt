PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. F. W. EVANS. Shakers�a quiet people�to the Sovereign People, upon the coming Presidential Election. As the Jews�a natural people, were scattered through the nations of earth, yet remained a distinct people, so will Shakers, a spiritual people, be distributed amongst all nations, kindreds, :ongues and sects, yet not be numbered with any. In the First Appearing of the Christ Spirit to man, ruling by might and power, their Representative, Jesus, said, 'My kingdom is not of this world, therefore my servants will not fight. ' In the Second Appearing of the .same Christ Spirit, to woman, ruling by Love, her Representative, Mother Ann Lee, said, ' Let the potsherds of the earth dasli against the potsherds of the earth. You my people, have nothing to do with it. You will neither fight nor vote. Yet pray for the peace of the Nation whither the Lord hath cast your lot, for in its peace ye shall have peace. ' The Sovereign People should vote for Measures, not Party nor Men. PLATFORM. 1. As Grant recommends, extend the Presidential term to seven years, with no re-election. 2. Continue appropriations. 3. Allow the President to approve a part of any bill. 4. Then add Woman Suffrage, Prohibition and land Limitation, with National Arbitration. ' liighteousness exalteth a Nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.' Therefore make Women and Indians citizens. Work toward the equalization of property, thus lessening poverty, removing the temptation to crime and putting war afar off. Do right. Let the people have nothing to light for or fight about. Let men dig for bread, not walk for money. Landless people are the . raw material of war. Make every man and woman a landlord or landlady, thus ending wars. The work of righteousness is peace, and the effect of right doing is quietness and assurance forever. Give us a Republic in fact, as well as in theory, and all the Governments of earth will become Republics. Heretofore, men and women have been held in speaking distance by blind instinct and physical passion. Hereafter, let them he intellectually and spiritually united, 'and the council of peace will be betwixt them both. ' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
