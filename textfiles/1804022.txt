THOU HAST LEFT US, KIND FATHER. In Memory of Brother SIMON MABEE. J. L. Sweet. Gone with the Angels who have taken thee thither; Gone to receive thy unbounded reward; Gone where the spirits of the just are made perfect; Gone to thy rest, thou blest of the Lord. Freed from all physical ailments and sufferings; Freed from inclemencies bitter and cold; Freed from the rudeness of harsh winds and tempests, Free! thy Redeemer's loved face to behold. Faith filled thy soul with the holiest fervor; Faith led thee on many dangers to brave; Faith bid thee trust in a kind and dear Savior; Faith, sealed thy triumph o'er death and the grave. Oft, thro' faith's vision didst view Heaven's beauty, Angel attendants its glories displayed. Now wilt thou dwell in that glorious City Whose walls with bright jasper are richly inlaid. Soar on thy pinions to those realms eternal, Soar to the mansion that's for thee prepared; Soar ye to join the bright hosts all supernal, There rests the faithful as Christ hath declared. Rounded has been thy life to a fullness, Nobly 'twas given to honor God's cause. Rich is the fruitage of virtue and goodne&amp;s Which thou dost merit obeying his laws. List to the welcome from Saints gone before thee, See! the glorified throng who thy spirit await, Ready to crown thee with immortal glory And usher thee in through the bright pearly gate. Hancock, Mass.
