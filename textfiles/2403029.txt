Too many of us are looking forward... [Contributed by Amelia Taite.l 'Too many of us are looking forward to happiness in the future years instead of getting all the enjoyment possible out of the present. It is well to remember that the time will never come, in this world, when we shall have every thing we want, just where and when we want it. The only way to be happy is to enjoy all we have to the utmost as we go along. It is right to lay up for old age in youth; right to prepare for a rainy day, but it is not right to blend all our energies to this end, and put off until the future the happiness we might enjoy every day. It is far too common to see people working and saving, denying themselves all recreation and many comforts to lay up money to buy more land, to build a larger and finer house, or to save for their children, thinking that when they have accomplished this they will be happy and begin to take comfort. The hoped for point may never be attained; or, if it is, sickness or death may have come first, and the dear ones whom we expected to be happy with may be gone forever. How much better to use some of the good things of life as we go along, to make our humble homes as cheery and bright as possible now, instead of waiting for a better house! Don't starve to-day, either body, mind, or soul, thinking that you will riot to-morrow. Don't hoard and scrimp through all the best years of your life, that you may be generous in your wills. Life is uncertain, and it is better to make your children happy while they are under the home roof, to call to that home every agency which will make their lives sweeter and better, than to deny them these that you may leave them a larger bank account when you are gone.'
