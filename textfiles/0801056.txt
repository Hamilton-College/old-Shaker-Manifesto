To Remove Marks from Tables Hot dishes sometimes leave whitish marks on varnished tables, when set as they should not be, carelessly upon them. For removing them, pour some lamp oil on the spot, and rub it hard with a soft cloth. Pour on a little spirits, and rub it dry with another cloth, and the whole mark will disappear, leaving the table as bright as before.
