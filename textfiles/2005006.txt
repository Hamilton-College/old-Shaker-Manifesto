AN OPEN LETTER TO THE ADVANCED REFORMERS OF THE WORLD. Hamilton De Graw. In a review of Bellamy's 'Looking Backward,' the life (to be) uufoldmeut of the race is thus consummated in the following facts, and who will say they are not possible of realization : Abolition of Wage Slavery. ' ' Private Property. ' ' Money. ' ' Poverty. ' War. ' ' The Legal Fraternity. ' ' Taxes. ' ' The Jury System, and the establishment of the social equality of the sexes, of Communism and the perfect enjoyment of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness by every human soul. Now do you realize that in this barbaric age there is a people who have realized (as far as the moral and spiritual evolution of humanity will permit) the facts that Bellamy in his 'Civilization of the Twentieth Century' has foreseen ' We do not wish to toot our own horn but to prove to the world what has been accomplished. We have abolished poverty. There are no rich, no poor in a Shaker Community. All enjoy the benefits of life equally. We have abolished War; will not under any circumstances take up arms against our fellow men. Our testimony in that regard has been very plain and decided. We have abolished private property. The brotherhood of man is an accomplished fact with us. We have abolished wage slavery. True, we emp'oy some that are n.it members of our Communities to work for wages ; and the sentiment is growing among us to dispense with hired labor entirely, and some of our Communities have already done so. As for the legal fraternity, we try to avoid the use of them as much as possible. In all the affairs of life woman stands the equal and co-worker with man. It could not be other wise, as our organization was first conceived and brought forth by woman�one that we look upon as one of the most illuminated and spiritual minds that has been produced on this planet for centuries. As we believe with Pope, that man has a higher destiny than ''to propagate and rot,' so a virgin life is the, basic principle on which our Community rests. We draw our recruits from the generative plane of life, and as a consequence take what is presented ; or in other words we dip our net into the great sea of humanity and gather good, bad and indifferent; they must necessarily be sifted and those who have evolved the higher life enough to comprehend our principles, remain to swell the ranks of progressive thinkers, while the balance return to the sea from which they came. Our testimony to the world is to have fewer and better children through a higher parentage. Bellamy takes a very optimistic view of [the transition from the crude condition of society of the present era to the social and economic society of the Twentieth Century and iu his ''Looking Backward' predicts that it will come without strife or bloodshed ; let us hope so. Fellow workers in the field of Advance Thought, we as religious Communists present the foregoing facts for your c;iudid and unbiassed consideration: trusting that viewed in the same light, and actuated by the same spirit that has prompted your investigations into the causes and remedies for the woes that are the effect of false conditions that are at present afflicting human society, you will see that we have pursued a course consistent with the highest dictates of reason. And to those who have felt the call of the spirit to come up and out of the rudimental sphere of existence, to you we ask a closer communion of spirit, and make an earnest appeal to help bear aloft the banDer of truth and purity that sin-sick souls may know where there is a haven of rest, where the grim phantoms of their former lives like shadows are fleeing away before the brightness of the latter day, and a knowledge of the truth and beauty of the higher life will be an abiding substance in the souls of our resurrected humanity. Let us all work for the attainment of that ideal life for only by labor can it be realized. Your friend in the cause of truth and progress. *� Sonyea, N. Y.
