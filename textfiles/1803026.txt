Hygiene for Singers Mme. L. Cappiani gives some hints in The Voice for lady singers which are valuable. She says : ' Singing should be done without any exertion in the throat, even in the greatest dramatic climax. Those singers who swell the throat and become red in the face at Forte passages cannot stand operatic work very long, as this is nothing else but an unnecessary muscular exertion counteracting the free development of force, and blurring and thickening the tones. The throat should not be expanded. It must be kept loose, in ord^r that the vooal bands can resound without pressure; which pressure simply hinders the circulation ot the blood, thus injuring general health and causing red face and red throat, followed by exhaustion. Brutal muscular exertion can never produce the power as well as the refined tone required by the true artist. Fortissimo and Pianissimo should be made in the same manner, by sending more or less air through the vocal bands. The throat is but the tube in which these cords resound; the air from the lungs, touching them, brings forth tones or sounds like the JEolian harp. Who that has been in a storm at sea, can forget the wailing of the ship's rigging? A rope is mute in the hand; but at a ship's mast the wind develops vibrations, and the storm gives it a voice.'
