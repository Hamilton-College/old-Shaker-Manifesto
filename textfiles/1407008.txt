Dear Sir: I have been much interested in an extract from a letter... 20 Newgate St., London, England, March 1884. Dear Sir: I have been much interested in an extract from a letter of yours which appeared in a recent issue of the Dietetic Reformer, Mr. R. Bailey Walker, Scc'y of the Vegetarian Society, kindly gave me your address, and said he thought you would give any information I might ask forï¿½I refer to the Shaker settlement of which you are a member. From what I understand of your ideas, the Settlement must have arrived at a state of high civilization. Of course, a Community holding and practicing the principles of vegetarianism and religious celibacy, would be, in the present state of society, far in advance of the most civilized nation. I wish I had known of your Settlement in 1881, when I passed four months in the States. For several years, I have been a Vegetarian, and for nearly fourteen years a total abstainer from the poison alcohol. Nearly half my life has been passed in active opposition to the drinking custom of society. My age is twenty seven, and have never been married. My business life has been passed in a fruit store. I have an intense desire to live and work in a society composed as yours appears to be. The institutions of your country, I have admired for years, and am really American in heart, though English by birth. How I would like to know whether you admit into your Community, outsiders who are prepared to bring their life into harmony with your principles. Any information you can give me, I shall be grateful for. I would send a stamped envelop for reply, only our stamps would not be of use in the States. Hoping to hear from you, at your earliest convenience, with best wishes for the success and happiness of your Community, I remain faithfully yours, Herbert I. Ward.
