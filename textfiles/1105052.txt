One ounce of beef to six tablespoonfuls of water is a fair proportion for a good article. Cut the meat into dice, put it into a stew-pan and add the water cold. Certain components of the beef are soluble in cold water ; therefore let it stand ten minutes. Chicken for broth should be boiled for six hours in a covered stone jar set into a pan of boiling water. Gelatine (which was for a long time considered as absolutely innutritious, but is now recognized by the best authorities, as valuable food) renders beef tea or chicken broth more nourishing, and, as a change, more acceptable to the patient. Soak a quarter of an ounce of gelatine in a quarter of a pint of cold water, add to it a cupful of the tea or broth, and stir it over the fire till the gelatine is dissolved, when cold it will be a firm jelly.

There will be no hangings, no papered walls, no carpets, no nothing to catch and hold the dust, and the bed will stand in the middle of the room, where the air can circulate freely around it. The result will be health.'
