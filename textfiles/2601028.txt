Books &amp; Papers Popular Monthly The Christmas number of Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly is already out, and will hardly be surpassed in richness and beauty of pictorial illustration, or in seasonable variety of literary contents, by anything that mayfollow during the holiday season. The opening article, upon 'Heroines and Heroine Worship,' affords a vehicle for nearly a score of exquisite reproductions from the old and modern master-painters. A similar opportunity is found in the intensely poetic story by A . Cressy Morrison, of 'The Man who Resembled Christ,' which in addition is illu-tnited with some original drawings of rare delicacy. In 'The City of Dordrecht,' George (J. Unite fairly revels in the picturesque, giving us eight of his loveliest aquarelle.-.. The great literary feature of the number is Tolstoi's latest story, 'Master and Man,' specially translated from the Russian for Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, and illustrated by Fogarty. A charming novelty is 'A Daughter of the Samurai,' by Teiichi Yamagata, being an up-to-date Japanese love story written in English by a Japanese author. Amongst other contributions deserving special mention are 'Heroines of Chivalry,'by Mrs. Frank Leslie; 'Literary Boston,'by Lillian Whiting 'The St. Nicholas Society,' by Wilf P. Pond ; 'How the Wixes Joined the Four hundred.' by A. Oakey Hall; and 'A Legend of Jeanne d'Arc,'â€”the latter being a poem by Francois Coppee.
