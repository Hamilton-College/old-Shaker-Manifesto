We have made two valuable discoveries this season : 1, that cuttings of grapes, currants, etc. succeed in growing best, when shaded by a little strawâ€”sufficient to cover their tops. 2, That the leaves of the common helebore being drenched with boiling water, make a decoction, which being sprinkled on bushes covered with worms, proves sure death to them, while being much safer to use than the powdered helebore.
