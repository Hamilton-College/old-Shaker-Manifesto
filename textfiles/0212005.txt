'No Surrender.' BY WATSON ANDREWS ' The following lines were suggested to me by the noble leader in November number of The Shakejj.' This war-cry through the nations rings, -And wakes the sleeping spheres; And Hope, replumes her drooping wings, And points to coining years. There's strength within these magic words— There's vigor in their sound, As backward roll the opposing hordes, And clear the doubtful ground. 'On, up and on!' bright legions shout, Yours is the victory; And Hope's glad eye beholds the rout, While echo answers—'Victory.' What though the ebbing tides disclose The fossils of the deep! What though it seems in vain, that those Bright saints their vigils keep! The laws that lead the ebbing tide, Bring the returning wave; Growth and decay, here, side by side, Their proper oflice have. The seed cannot be quickened, more, Except it first decay; And Cities, Xations, o'er and o'er, Arise, then pass away. But principles do not decay; And virtue never dies; When all things else have passed away They reascend the skies. They reascend, but not alone— Their votaries go too, And sing: ' Thy will, oh God be done!' In songs forever new.
