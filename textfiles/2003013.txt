MARITTA'S FAREWELL. Hannah R. Agnew. Farewell dear gospel kindred, I would not leave you now, Yet to the chilling hand of death. Submissively I bow. Earth's brightest joys are fading Away in mists of time, While spirit voices call me, To a fairer happier clime. My fathers and my mothers Who taught me in my youth. To live a life of purity, And serve the God of truth, Accept my soul's best offering, Of gratitude sincere; And could I tarry longer, My life should be your cheer. In your declining years, my hand Should be your help and slay: But loved ones here, will care for jou, Till you are called away. My dear companions who with me Have trod life's rugged way, May heaven bless and give you strength According to your day. I thank you f. &gt;r the helping hand, So kindly tendered me, While to.-sing on the billows Of life's tempestuous sea. I also think wiih pleasure Of golden days with you, While gaining lasting treasure And learning lessons new. A little while we're parting now To meet again in heaven ; May strength to bear life's burdens Till then to you be given. 0 precious youth be mindful That death is sure to all: A p.d sometimes e'er the flowers bloom, They're blighted, fade and fall. Then shun the vain allurements Which captivate the mind; Your thoughts, your words and acti &gt;ns, In purity refine. 1 love yon all most dearly, And fain would stay with you, And help you in life's thorny maze, To grasp the good and true. But death has claimed the mortal; My spirit now is free ; And with the ange s I'll away, They wait and watch for me. The grave has now nj victory, Tiie sting of death is o'er; I live, and hope to live with you, When time shall be no more. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
