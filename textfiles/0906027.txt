ASSIST EACH OTHER Lend a hand to one another In the daily toils of life : When we meet a weaker brother, Let us help him in the strife. There is none so rich but may In his turn be forced to borrow, And the poor man's lot to-day May become our own to-morrow. Lend a hand to one another When malicious tongues have thrown Dark suspicion on your brother, Be not prompt to cast a stone. There is none so good but may Bun adrift in shame and sorrow, And the best of men to-day, May become the worst to-morrow. Lend a hand to one another In the race for honor's crown ; Should it fall upon your brother, Let not envy tear it down. Lend a hand to all, I say, In their sunshine and their sorrow, And the prize we've lost to-day May become our own to-morrow.
