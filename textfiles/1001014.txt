A HAPPY NEW YEAE ! Now, and all through the year, does this department wish and urge upon all A Happy New Year ! to the old and young, readers of The Manifesto and the many millions who do not read it, but may hear that it urges a happy, Happiest Year during 1880, by the endeavors of each and all to live better than ever before; do more good than heretofore ; take upon self more cross to the denial of the wrong, and for the encouragement of virtue and exceeding righteousness. We ask your company in walking the narrow, Christ path — the path of present justification and happiness, and the fruition of all future happiness, enduring without end. 'AMONG THE SHAKERS.' We begin in this number, the first of three papers, which originally appeared in the Am. Socialist — a paper for which we have had good reasons to have great respect —and which, with what minor faults or mistakes which may occur in statements, are written with the best, most friendly intentions. ' Among the Shakers ' will prove interesting within and without the pale of the societies; and there is contained, along the smooth running sentences, certain expressions which carry great force of truth with them. There are some who will need just this kind of narrative to attract them to a fuller investigation of the subjects which these papers are intended to embrace. Perhaps we Shakers can learn some news therein, or something by which we can profit— who knows ?
