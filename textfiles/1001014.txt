'AMONG THE SHAKERS.' We begin in this number, the first of three papers, which originally appeared in the Am. Socialist — a paper for which we have had good reasons to have great respect —and which, with what minor faults or mistakes which may occur in statements, are written with the best, most friendly intentions. ' Among the Shakers ' will prove interesting within and without the pale of the societies; and there is contained, along the smooth running sentences, certain expressions which carry great force of truth with them. There are some who will need just this kind of narrative to attract them to a fuller investigation of the subjects which these papers are intended to embrace. Perhaps we Shakers can learn some news therein, or something by which we can profit— who knows ?
