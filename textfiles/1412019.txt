Sanitary OUR TEETH. They decay. Hence unseemly mouths, bad breath, imperfect mastication. Everybody regrets it. What is the cause? I reply, want of cleanliness. A clean tooth never decays. The mouth is a warm place, 08 degrees. Particle) of meat between the teeth soon decompose. Gums ami teeth must suffer. Perfect cleanliness will preserve the teeth to old age. How shall it be secured? Use a quill pick, and rinse the mouth after eating; brush and castile soap every morning: the brush witli simple water on going to bed. Bestow this trifling care upon your precious teeth, and you will keep them and ruin the dentists. Xeglect it, and you will be sorry all your lives. Children forget. Watch them. The first teeth determine the character of the second set. Give thï¿½m equal care. Sugar, acid, saleratus and hot things are nothing when compared with food decomposing between the teeth. Mercurialization may loosen the teeth, long use wear them out, but keep them, clean and they will never decay. This advice is worth thousands of dollars to every boy and girl. Books have been written on the subject. This brief article contains all that is essential. Never have a tooth taken out if it be possiAble to have it filled. The loss of a single jaw-tooth will not only give the cheek a sunken appearance, but it will prevent the proper mastication of the food, and this is a long step toward dyspepsia, with its train of evils. Selected. SIMPLE REMEDY. There is no remedy of such general application, and none so easily attainable, as water ; and yet nine persons in ten will pass by it in an emergency to seek for something of far less efficiency. There are but few cases of illness where water should not occupy the highest place as a remedial agent. A strip of flannel or a napkin folded lengthwise, and dipped in hot water and wrung out, and then applied around the neck of a child that has croup, will usually bring relief in ten minutes. A towel folded several times, and dipped in hot water and quickly wrung and applied over the seat of the pain in toothache or neuralgia, will generally afford prompt relief. This treatment in colic works almost like magic. I have seen cases that have resisted other treatment for hours yield to this in ten minutes. There is nothing that will so promptly cut short a congestion of the lungs, sore throat, or rheumatism, as hot water when applied promptly and thoroughly. Pieces'of cotton batting dipped in hot water, and kept applied to old sores or new, cuts, bruises or sprains, is the treatment now generally adopted in hospitals. I have seen a sprained ankle cured in an hour by showering it with hot water, poured from a height of three feet. Tepid water acts promptly as an emetic; and hot water taken freely half an hour before bed time is the best of cathartics in cases of constipa i &gt;n, while it has a most soothing effect on the stomach and bowels. This treatment continued for a few months,, with proper attention 1o the diet, will cure any curable case of dyspepsia. Headacl e almost always yields to the simultaneous application of hot water to the feet ard the back of the neck. It is an excellent plan to record facts like these in a note book, which should be always at hand when wanted. In the anxiety caused by accidents or sudden illness in the family, one becomes confused and is not apt to remember quickly what should be done ; hence there may be prolonged and unnecessary suffering before proper remedies arc applied.
