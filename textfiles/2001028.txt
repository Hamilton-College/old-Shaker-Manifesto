Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Aug. 1889 Beloved Elder Henry :â€”As regards our little publication, THE MANIFESTO, it is to us a welcome visitor; but visitor is not the right name; it is our monthly Companion. When it comes laden with sweet music it starts anew within us, our spring of joy. Your Brother, Daniel Offord
