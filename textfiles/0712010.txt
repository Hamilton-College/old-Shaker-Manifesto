A SHAKER HOME A. C. STICKNEY O the blessing of a home where old and young j st dwell kindly; a] he young unawed, the old unchilled, in unreserved communion.' â€”Martin F. Tupper. p] Thus the poet sings, and this, perchance, w was the ideal picture, at which our friend sc vas looking, when contemplating the kind of home best suited for her dear niece. We ive below a few extracts from a letter adressed to the latter, by her aunt, who had hosen a home for her among the Shakers. 'My dear Niece: I received your last letter with reat pleasure. Am glad that you like the place and eople; hope you will like both more and more, unll you feel settled for life. I say this, believing your oul will be cared for as well as your body. Remember, dear one, you have a soul to save, and God even, cannot save it for you, unless you repent f your sins and consecrate your life to Him. He reuires that you give your heart to Him, though it lay be a small and poor gift. You are now away rom the allurements of the world, in just the place o serve God with your whole heart. O give him our heart, and learn to love your Savioi\ I suppose, to-day, that you are dressed like a real haker, and I have been praying that when you put n your Shaker dress, God will clothe your heart nth. its righteousness.' And so He will clothe all hearts, that, ere hey assume the Shaker dress, will strive to earn this righteousness, by cleansing the ame through confession and repentance for ?ast sins. Verily, 'God helps those who lelp themselves.'
