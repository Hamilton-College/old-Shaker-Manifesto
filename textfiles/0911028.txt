Ed. Manifesto :—In response to your appeal to the generous... Mount Lebanon, Oct. 6, 1879 Ed. Manifesto :—In response to your appeal to the generous, inclosed please find Five Dollars as a mite toward helping ' bear the burdens of the weak.' I feel a deep interest in the prosperity and continuation of The Shaker Manifesto, I believe it ia doing a great deal of good, preparing the way for the coming of Christ to many, honest, truth-seeking souls. After reading the notice in the September Number of The Shaker Manifesto of the Shaker Sermons, I sat down and wrote for one of the books, and I am very desirous of its early issue. Yours truly, Avery Allen
