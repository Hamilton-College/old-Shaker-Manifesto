Good Philosophy A little girl of five years, when on a visit, refused to take a hot roll at the tea table. ' Why not, my dear ? ' asked the hostess. ' Don't you like rolls ?' ' Yes ma'am,' she said, ' but when I eat them at night, I always dream of black cats, and I had rather go without rolls than to be so frightened.' Here was an embryo philosopher! Well would it be if every person who is troubled with bad dreams would both study out and avoid the cause of them.
