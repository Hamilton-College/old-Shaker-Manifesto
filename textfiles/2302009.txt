IN THOUGHT OF. Thine the conqueror's song, 'The world I've overcome;' Thine the crown of full rejoicing, THE MANIFESTO. At setting of life's sun. Thine the Eternal dawn Upon immortal shore; Thine the blissful meeting With kindred gone before. Thine was the Christian's hope, Unmoved thy trust in God; His arm sustained, his love controlled And was thy sure reward. Agnes E. Newton. Canterbury, N. H.
