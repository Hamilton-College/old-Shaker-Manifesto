Buckley, Dr. Buttz,. of Drew Seminary, Dr. Dobbs, Dr. Jeflry and. others, sustain the high character of the American pulpit. Dr. Ormiston's able 'Commentary on the Epistle of James;' Dr. Howard Crosb}''s 'Lighton Important Texts;' and Dr. Curry's'' Great Preachers Whom I Have Known,' are continued. 'The Minister's Study,' by Rev. W. T. Crafts, and 'Homiletic Spectacles,' by Dr. Holme, are suggestive.
