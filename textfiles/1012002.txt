GOD'S PLAN OF YOUR LIFE DR. BUSHNELL . Never complain of your birth, your training, your employment, your hardships ; never fancy that you could be something if you had a different lot and sphere assigned you. God understands his own plan and he knows what you want a great deal better than you do. The very things that you most deprecate as fatal limitations or obstructions are probably what you most need. What you call hindrances, obstacles, and discouragements, are probably God's opportunities : and it is nothing new that the patient should dislike his medicine, nor any certain proof that they are poisons. Check that foolish envy which knaws at your heart because you are not in the same lot with others ; bring down your soul, or rather, bring it up to receive God's will, and do His work in your sphere, under your cloud of obscurity against your temptations; and then you shall find that your condition is never opposed to your good, but really consistent with it. No man preaches well to others if he does not preach to his own heart.
