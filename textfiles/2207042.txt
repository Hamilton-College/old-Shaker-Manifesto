Ladies' Home Journal Bret Harte's young daughter, Miss Jessamy Harte, will make her literary debut in the July Ladies' Home Journal with a most entertaining description of 'Camp Life in the Adirondack^,' in which it is claimed every evidence shows itself of inherited literary tendencies not unlike those evidenced in Bret Harte's earlier work. Miss Harte is a girl still in her teens, and has artistic as well as literary proclivities, as one of the illustrations accompanying her first article shows.
