Juvenile. Dear Children:--'Be faithful unto death... Enfield, Conn., 1888. Dear Children:--'Be faithful unto death and you will receive a crown of life,' a crown more valuable than all the jeweled ones of earth. There is no promise of reward without faithfulness. ' It is only those who are faithful in a few things who will be faithful over many things; only those who do their duty in every-day and trivial matters who will fulfill them on greater occasions.' By doing little things well, you will be trusted with more important ones. .'Well begun is well half done.' Life is made up of little things, and they seem such very small things; but who can tell for how much they may count in the end? Attention to little duties just as scru pulously as to great ones, must be the practice. Present duties well performed insure real happiness. There is an opportunity given you to perform every duty, and it is only by daily and hourly devotedness that you can progress heavenward. For every departure from duty you have to pay in suffering. There is so much comprised in being faithful. You must 'put your hands to work and give your hearts to God,' and a reward will be yours according to your merits. It requires energy and courage to be faithful at all times, even though you have started with every strong resolution. Often you grow careless and are drawn aside by sinful pleasures, which if indulged in become hindrances to self-denying work. Sometimes your feet grow weary and your hearts faint, and you finally feel tempted to give up the struggle for the promised crown. A crown of life is too valuable to lose. You should have faith in the cross-bearing work and then devote your best energies to it, if you would succeed. You should trust in God for help and guidance, and let no evil influence lead you astray. You must have the courage to stand firm in trials and opposition, turning neither to the right nor the left. The Christian's crown 'is a joy forever.' Spare no pains to win it. You must win the crown before you ivear it; win it by selfdenying struggles. No crown without the cross. Master self. Be steadfast, true. Confront difficulties with patience and perseverance. Neglect no duty and never be discouraged. ' Let your polar star be duty and your motto truth and right ' Soon may end your earthly labors. Too soon for duties left undone. With face heavenward discarding all wrong, be faithful in duty while active and strong. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt. Acrostic from 1 Peter.
