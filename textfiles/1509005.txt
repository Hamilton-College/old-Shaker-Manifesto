OUR GOD. MARY WHITCHER. A God that moves in all our ways Denoting love and thanks and praise Is God possessed, and will avail When earthly gods and powers fail: 'Tis here the proof is well combined When God in us helps all mankind But without hands and heart to do, Our God is distant from the view. Canterbury, N. H.
