Sanitary How to Disinfect Clothing and Sick lIooms. Clothing which requires disinfecting should be submitted for about three hours to a temperature of 250 degrees in a chamber charged with sulphur fumes from a large quanity of sulphur. The chamber should be so constructed as to prevent the fumes from passng off. No germs can stand this. After a room has been used by a person sick with any contagious disease, it becomes necessary to disinfect it before it is fit to be used again. This is done by removing and burning the paper on the walls, removing the bedstead and other furniture, and exposing them to air and wind, and giving them a fresh coat of varnish ; by having tbe mattress made over new and the hair boiled; by burning in the room three pounds of sulphur, and by whitewashing, painting and papering the room anew. Now that it is generally conceded that consumption is caused by germs which multiply in the lungs, a method of disinfecting them, which shall be harmless has been sought for, but, as yet without avail. The vapor of creosote, the oil of the eucalyptus and carbolic acid have been tried, and, to some extent, they may paralyze or stun the germs and prevent their rapid increase ; but as the passages of the lungs are delicate, and the vapor cannot be brought very near to them without injury, the good effects are slight. But there is* one method which cannot fail to prove beneficial, and thai; is the inhalation of large quantities of fresh, pure air. This is worth more than any disinfectant for the lungs, and can do no harm. The Herald of Health What We Eat. The wonder is seeing how fast we eat, and what we eat, and how often we eat, and how adulterated the food is we get to eat that we are as well as we are Take baking powder for instance. It is chiefly composed of bicarbonate of soda, cream of tartar and starch, which must disarrange the digestive organs. All alkalies persistently used are bad for health.
