CHILDREN AMONG THE SHAKERS New York, Feb. 4, 1879. Elder Frederick W. Evans : Your letter received. Grlad to hear you are all well. I do not like the letters that my boy writes. He does not understand what he is writing about. He writes what you dictate. You have no right to influence those boys in trying to make Shakers and Spiritualists of them, nor give them the im- pression that they ought to spend their lives with you. You are not acting the part of a friend to me when you do these thing's. The Bible says, ' Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's son, nor his daughter, nor any thing that is his.' These boys are only loaned to you for a time, and while with you I want them to be respectful, obedient and industrious. I want the boys to come out into the world, when of age, and have a chance to judge for themselves whether they want to be Shakers or not. Do you think for one single moment, Elder Frederick, that after I have suffered almost death to bring those children into the world, I will look on quietly and see you take possession of them, body and soul ? No ! Why, they are my own life. You talk about love. What can you possibly know about love? There is no one on the face of this earth knows the meaning of that word but a parent. I do not believe in Spiritualism, nor Shakerism. You should all marry and have lots of children. I hope you will not be offended at what I say. I would not be disrespectful to you for the world. I only want you to know what I think. Respectfully yours, L-----G-----
