Enfield, Conn. Again as the seasons return, and the years fly, we are preparing for winter. Our fall work is nearly finished; another week as favorable as the past, will see the roots harvested, corn husked and fodder in the barn. Three hundred and fifty bushels of carrots, and five hundred bushels of sugar beets, should make happy cows and swell their fame when fed in some such daily rations to a. cow of one thousand lbs. weight for butter production. One feed clover hay at midday. Two bush, corn stalks cut fine by power. One half bushel of carrots or beets. Three quarts cob meal. Three quarts wheat bran. One quart cotton seed meal in two feeds. Please suggest improvement. T. Stroud. Since my last correspondence to the Manifesto have been from home, up in the Berkshire hills; received much benefit thereby, also the pleasure of Gospel interchange which is always profitable. The ministrations of love and kindness received, inspires the soul ever to pursue the strait and narrow way, where we may experience the wisdom and goodness and love of God. Our frail bodies are tottering habitations, every beat of the heart a rap at the door, to tell us of danger, and the wheels of time roll swiftly along. Though my flesh and my heart faileth, yet divine faithfulness and compassion fail not. M. Witham.
