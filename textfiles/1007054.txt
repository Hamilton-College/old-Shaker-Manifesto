The Christian Union says... The Christian Union says: Moreover, this belief in Jesus is not in the least dependent on literary belief in the authorship of the four Gospels. A. few years ago a Hindoo merchant, coming from his native village in the interior on a trading expedition, picked up a copy of the New Testament as a curiosity and carried it back to his home. He commenced reading it; was struck by the simple beauty of Christ's teaching and life; read it to his neighbors ; they shared his ,admiration; by common consent they adopted it as their standard by which to live. The man died; the village held on to the book, and came to be known in all the district as the Village with the Book. When, later, a Christian missionary came to the place, he found the village in spirit and character essentially Christian. Neither the Hindoo apostle nor any of his disciples knew any thing about the literary question. When Christ lived, when and by whom his life was written, they neither knew nor cared. The life was there before them; it was worthy to be followed; and they followed it. To be a Christian is not to believe that Moses wrote the Pentateuch or John the Book of Revelation; it is to be a follower of Jesus Christ
