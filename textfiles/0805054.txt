WEARY NOT O CHRISTIAN PILGRIM FROM THE SISTERHOOD ENFIELD, N. H. 1. Weary not O christian pilgrim, in thy journey 2. Shun the mists of gloom and sorrow, thatch scure thy weary not, Tho the way of life be fore '' thee seems gospel light, Let thy polar star be duty and with many dangers fraught, Thro' the valley of thy mot to truth and right, Then the Savior's love the shadow you in safety shall be brought, shall guide thee to thy home in glory bright. THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 135 For the promise of the Father will not fail, will not fail. Weary not, in the weary not strife For a home in the heavens weary not, is secure, is secure.
