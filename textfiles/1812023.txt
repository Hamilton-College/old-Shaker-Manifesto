FALSE COUNSELORS. [Contributed by Wm. L. Lincoln.] Those who mind the things of men rather than the things of God�those who would have us to put self-crucifixion far from us� those who would have us to pity ourselves� are stumbling-blocks unto us. They were to Christ. Even though they come to us and speak to us as apostles of Christ, our only safety is to do as Christ did, instantly and peremptorily and finally order them to get behind us. 'Whosoever shall save his life shall lose it: whosoever shall lose his life for Christ's sake shall save it.' Make no mistake herein. Be not decieved. Self-pity is a snare, no matter who suggests and urges it upon you. Self-denial, cross-bearing, and following Christ even unto Calvary, are the only securities that we shall come after Him ucto heaven at last. Every other suggestion comes from the devil or from one of his messengers. Words of Faith.
