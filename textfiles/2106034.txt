Beloved Elder Henry:--All of the Manifestos are good but... Pleasant Hill, Ky., Apr. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½All of the Manifestos are good, but occasionally we are aware somehow, certain numbers are in the superlative. The April number is richly laden with 'fruits of the spirit.' 'Spring-tide Offering' was beautiful in language and vividly portrayed the sentiment of womankind and all good men. But my attention was called especially to the 'Trial of Faith,' by William Leonard, an excellent article truly, a true exponent of the past and the present with cheering hope for the future. 'Precept upon precept,' by our able editor, showed that we should keep the vestal fires burning, and stand true to God and our own souls; and in no other way can we keep our feet firmly on the true Rock. Accept the love of gospel kindred of Pleasant Hill. Sincerely, Mary Johnston.
