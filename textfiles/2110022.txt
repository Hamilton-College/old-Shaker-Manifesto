Sonyea, N. Y. Sept. 10, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½Your letter containing the pretty poems was received last evening, thanks for both of them; we were pleased to hear from you again, just as we are each time you mail us- your kind thoughts of Groveland. We are quite sure you are coming and tell the family so; we shall not cease looking for you till you come which certainly you will. So hurry before snow-flying days appear for time flies so fast you know they will soon be here then it will not be so pleasant to look about our town when snow-drifts form along the path with sharp winds sweeping down. The many cold nights, with not quite a frost have been unfavorable for sweet corn, it has not developed as perfectly as it would with more warm weather, but with its imperfections much of it is very good, and may yield a bountiful harvest; it is much easier to predict a failure where no signs of failure exist than to search for signs of prosperity. We are blessed above our highest anticipations in our fruit market. Apples and pears that we were sure would not be seen or heard of, have grown into delicious healthful food, while some trees are heavily laden, quite to the breaking of limbs. Pears have been so abundant that some have been sold. Well, we cannot tell what a few months will produce in the fruit culture. Wheat sowing was commenced the 3rd. inst., and farmers are actively improving the fine days with their much-sowing, while the house managers are trying to brighten the interior of house and home by sweeping and dusting and cleaning in some of the many forms. A few buildings have had the roofs repaired and repainted and many more are waiting for the same renovating element to brush them up to the shining of more honor and beauty, but when they will, remains far ahead in the future, they may and they may not.
