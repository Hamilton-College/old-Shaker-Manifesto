Trouble. There is a structure which everybody is Duilding, young and old, each one for himself. It is called character; and in it every act of life is a stone. If day by day we are careful to build our lives with pure, noble , and upright deeds, at the end will stand a fair temple, honored by God and man. But as one leak will sink a ship and one flaw break a chain, so one mean, dishonorable, untruthful act or word will forever leave its impress, and work its influence, on our characters. 1 Then let the several deeds unite to form a day, and one by one the days grow into noble i years; and the years, as they slowly pass, i will raise at last a beautiful edifice, enduring forever to our praise.
