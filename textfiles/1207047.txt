SHEEP Albertis Sheep are very useful animals ; If it were not for the sheep we would lose many warm garments. 1 love to sue the lambs they are so playful. I think it is very nice to take care of the sheep. The brother who had the care of the stock gave me a little lamb, but I did not feed it for I was too small, but I could see it when I wanted to. I thought very much of it. I think I treated him very well for when he was grown up to be a sheep, I could call him from the rest of the flock and he would come up to me. I used to carry him apples or a few beans or carrots. This ends my story. 12 years. *
