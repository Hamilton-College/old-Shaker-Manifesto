That it has contended earnestly and kindly for the reign of Peace, in the hearts of the people is well known to all the readers of that beautiful little advocate of peace principles. No 1 of vol. 20 comes to us in an entirely new form. The combined fellowship of the 'Christian Arbitrator and Messenger of Peace,' must be the means of doing a great deal of good by advocating the brotherhood of man, and by urging the settlement of all national or individual disputes by a Christian arbitration. Send fifty cents to Daniel Hill, Kichmond, Ind. and obtain the Christian Arbitrator for one year. Hall's Journal of Health Hall's Journal of Health, for Feb. Contents.

One of the specialties 'will be the teachings of the Bible in regard to social Science, political economy, and law taxation.'' The free public library may now be said to dot every hillside in New England. Especially in eastern Massachusetts, whs. e it apparently had its origin, there is scarcely a town, however small, which does not have its library for the free use of its reading public, however limited in numbers. These institutions are often benefited by a small private endowment from some liberal-minded citizen, and are generally well supported by an appropriation from the town. The existence of nearly all of them is covered by the past forty years. The primary object of their establishment was the furnishing of readingmatter for amusement or entertainment, the object of instruction being a secondary consideration; and this is true to a great extent to-day, although the element of instruction is gaining in prominence, and the library is regarded more a/ud more as an adjunct of the public schools. If they were originally intended for the very poor, our experience shows that that use has long been superseded, for their privileges are now shared by the rich and poor alike. The public library is one of the most democratic of our institutions and a good librarian will show the strictest impartiality in the treatment of his patrons. The current literature of the day is brought into speedy contact with the genera] public in the libraries, and as the interest centres largely in the newest books, the patronage is greatly increased by the circumstance of finding them there. Everybody can appreciate the privilege of finding the latest and best literature on any subject in the public library, knowing that the free use of such books may be had for the asking. Most of the libraries, by taking periodicals and newspapers, be- come a combination of library and reading-room, and this enlarges the field of their usefulness. The influence of these centres of intelligence makes better citizens of our young people, enlarges the thought of the older ones, and enables many, no doubt, to bear the ills of life better, and affords entertainment for many an idle hoar.ï¿½ New England Magazine From UA Model Village Library,'' bi/ William R.
