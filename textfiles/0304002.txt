GOOD RESOLUTIONS (Daniel Offord.) Make good resolutions, and carry them out. They help the growth of virtue in the soul, and are as gentle breezes, or rays of sunshine, or as showers that often fall upon tender plants. Some persons make good resolutions, but who, not attaining to perfection at once, become discouraged, and think it is of no use to keep making resolutions which are likely to be broken, and that it is only telling falsehoods, and does no good. This is all a delu- sion. Shall we, because one gentle breeze, or one ray of sunshine, or one single shower, does not produce a crop, say, It does no good? No one would be so foolish. So, because one resolution fails to bring us into the possession of any particular virtue, shall we therefore cease to strive? Nay! 'God looks at the heart' and the intent of the soul, therefore let us make good resolutions, and keep them; and then renew, and keep renewing, till we attain to that to which we aspire.â€”Mt.Lebanon.
