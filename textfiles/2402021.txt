Enfield, N. H. Jan. 1894. Chbistmas has come and gone; and was pleasantly celebrated by both young and old, in the giving of tasty and useful gifts from the branches of the Christmas trees. The New Year opens with scarcely six inches of snow on the ground; line sleighing and pleasant weather. It is the season for 'good resolutions' and we will 'weary not in well doing,' even in the letter of the law. Should we break our pledges, let us renew them whether it be April 1st or July 4th. When once formed, let them ever be before us, even though at times our standard may seem to be set too high for our aim. Our ice crop is being harvested. About twelve inches thick and of fine quality. Shall cut about forty tons. It has been decided to close our South family, and as fast as business will permit, the members are moving to the Church and North family. Elder William Wilson comes to the Church to be associated with Elder Abraham Perkins. We make them all heartily welcome, and trust that they will find in the strength of our numbers a consolation that will in some degree, compensate for the loss of their dear old home. It is one hundred years since the South family was established. On the 7th ult. we held a Society meeting at their home to commemorate this event. From the older Brethren and Sisters, we received many beautiful lessons of patience and forbearance, through examples and incidents drawn from the lives of the first Believers in this place. The room in which we met, is 50x30 ft., arched overhead and contains what has been called the finest floor among Believers. Not a nail head is visible, and the joints between the boards are scarcely discernable, so closely is the grain of the wood matched. A worthy record in itself of the faithfulness of the early Believers. G. H. Kirkley.
