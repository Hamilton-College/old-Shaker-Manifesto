LOOK UPWARD. By Julia M. Lincoln. Look upward, e'en tho' trials compass thee And clouds hang o'er the path thy feet must tread, And doubts and fears disturb thy heart with dread, 0, ever trust and watchful, humble be And from temptation thou wilt yet be free; By waters calm and sweet thou wilt be led ; Thou wilt have living joy in sorrow's stead And hope will gladden thee continually. All hearts must know vexation, pain and grief, All feet must walk the valley dark and drear, But thro' God's mercy cometh sweet relief, His love hath power to banish every fear; Look upward then, and thou wilt yet behold, The fadeless, golden light of heaven unfold. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
