For the Shaker and Shakeress : Elizabeth Doobeney's farewell to the Community, after a Sabbath day's enjoyment, of their worship and repose at Mt. Lebanon. BROTHERHOOD. Brother I know thee not in name, But feel thy future home is mine! Our loving father is the sameâ€” And my heart is knit to thine. SISTERHOOD. Sister, I know that in thine eyes, And in thy accents soft and sweet A Saviour reigns without disguise, Where all the Christian virtues meet. ADIEU, The moment, though a fleeting one, In which I've felt thy sympathy, Shall, while these eyes behold the sun, Rest graven on my memory.
