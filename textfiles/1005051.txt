MOTHER ANN LEE In a recent discourse upon the ' Unfoldment of Truth,' A. J. Davis thus pays some pretty compliments to our founder, and also renders some doubtful compliments to the sagacity of her people : ' I like to think how these glorious ideas got into the world. Just think of that woman, Ann Lee, a woman whom Paul discouraged with his thoughts, not with his ideas. By the way, it is difficult to find an idea in Paul. Paul had many glorious thoughts, enthusiasms, heroic bursts of noble nature in religion, and was willing to do and die for the truth. But he said that women must keep silence. Could Ann Lee keep silence ? She could not. She had an idea that had to be born through her. Oh, the newspapers made great fun of her ; the Nast of that Â¦ period caricatured her. How many persons had their fun while she suffered, more than words can tell, under the divine pressure that evolved, through her, its expression ! ' There is a mother as well as a father side to God.' Mother God! The woman nature will cling to the Father. That is because vines always grow up toward the sun. The feminine nature will grow up toward the Father spirit above and the masculine toward the Mother's side. ' Ann Lee said, ' God is Mother and Father too.' How beautifully Theodore Parker expressed that, so long after, in a great hall in the city of Boston, and surrounded by the best, bravest, some of the noblest of that great center. When Ann Lee brought her great idea into the world she did not see its import. I tell you the Shakers do not understand it any more than the Methodists understand John Wesley or the Presbyterians the works of John Calvin. I tell you the Shakers do not understand, any more than the Quakers do, the beautiful spirit that was at the very heart of their first worker.'
