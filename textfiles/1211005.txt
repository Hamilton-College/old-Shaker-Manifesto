NOVEMBER MARY WHITCHER The last Hose of Summer,' ah more we would say, The last leaf of Autumn that's fair, 246 SHAKER MANIFESTO. How swiftly the seasons pass on and away, And leave nature faded and bare : But one cometh after whose mantle is peace, So Dove-like why should we repine? We've drank in the Harvest and shared the increase Of all in their season and time. The Spring in its beauty, the summer its bloom, The Autumn its fruit ever rare, And now we may rest and enjoy the return, Which heaven has blessed us to share. Canterbury, N. H.
