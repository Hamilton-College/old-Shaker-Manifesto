I refuse to be held to consistency with any dogmatic system of theology of the past. I am with Calvin, and against Calvin ; I am with Arminius, and against Arminius; I am with Episcopacy, and against Episcopacy; I am with the Roman Church, and against it—my object being, not to build or to defend any system of theology or government, but to bring men near to God, and build them up in holiness of life. —Henry Ward Beecher.
