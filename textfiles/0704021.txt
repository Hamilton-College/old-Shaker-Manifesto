Hebrew darkness In a Jewish synagogue in New York, one of the pew-holding brethren has been convict ed of being a receiver of stolen goods and now the trustees refuse to take hi money for the rent of the pew. They are glad to have him come to churcl and get good, but they won't touch hi money. Suppose a Protestant churcl was run on such principles, and prohi bitionist clergymen compelled to de cline money the brethren made at rum selling, for example, there would very soon be a coolness among the brethren An exchange hints that some Christia churches would be exposed to bajikrupi cy.
