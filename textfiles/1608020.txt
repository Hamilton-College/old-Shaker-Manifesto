CONFESSION OF SIN. LIZZIE C. FISH. We cannot understand how an intelligent person can remain in doubt as regards the importance of this fundamental principle of the Shaker church, when so many examples are to be found in Biblical History, showing that about three thousand years' ago it was considered the only 'Door of Hope, 'for salvation. We read that wise old Solomon declared; 'He that covereth his sins shall not prosper,(spiritually,) but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy, (forgiveness of God.) Prov. xxviii., 13. This confession was not to be made secretly or alone to God as a great many are willing to believe; as an offering after this form, brings nothing to light, and to hide from the presence of God, even the remotest thought would be impossible. We can only cover our sins from God's human agents, it is before these witnesses alone that the confession must be made, if we wish to obtain that forgiveness and power, which prompts us 'to go and sin no more. ' We know quite well that the selfish individual who will make an honest confession h efore a witness, human, like himself, will deal a death blow to the selfishness that rules the heart, and will experience a joy and confidence which no other sacrifice gives, also that love and forbearance of a heavenly Parentage, which surpasseth all other loves. Was there no Scriptural evidence to declare the necessity of this principle, we are very sure a Shaker church could not exist successfully without recognizing confession of sin as one of its essential basic principles. It surely could not be the perfect church, spoken of by the Apostle as the ' glorious church without spot or wrinkle, ' for there would be no repentance unto salvation. We know from our own experience that, 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. John, i., 7. Canterbury, N. H.
