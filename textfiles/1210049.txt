Farm and Garden WHAT AN ACRE OF LAND PRODUCED. A farmer living in Maine makes a statement of what he has raisedsthis year on an acre of landâ€”almost enough, we should think, to support a family. He planted one-third of his acre in corn, and he usually produces thirty bushels of good corn. This quantity was sufficient for his family use, and for fattening two or three large hogs. From the same ground on which the corn stood, he raised two or three hundred pumpkins, and an ample supply of beans. From a bed of six rods square he usually obtains sixty bushels of onions; these he sold for one dollar per bushel, which amount purchased his flour for one year. Thus, from one-third of an acre and an onion bed he obtained his breadstuffs and two or three hundred pounds of pork. The remainder of the ground was appropriated to all kinds of vegetables, for both Summer and Winter use. He also had a flower garden, raspberries, currants, gooseberries in great abundance, and also a few choice apple, pear and quince trees. Mr. George Connor, of Burlington, considers a ton of corn stalks worth more... Mr. George Connor, of Burlington, considers a ton of corn stalks worth more than a ton of hay for cows. He feeds to each milch cow one bushel of finely cut stalks, Wo quarts of bran and two quarts of cobmeal mixed and wet with w ater, both morning and evening. Professor Kedzie, of the Agricultural College of Michigan... Professor Kedzie, of the Agricultural College of Michigan, an expert chemist, recently said that a paint or wash made of skim milk, thoroughly skimmed, and water brine, will render wood uninflammable, and he proved it by experiment. He said this paint, or whitewash, is durable, very cheap, impervious to water, of agreeable color, and, as it will prevent wood from taking fire, urged its use, particularly on roofs, outbuildings, barns, etc.
