As the life work of the Christian pilgrim is... As the life work of the Christian pilgrim is to 'seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness,' nothring very mysterious can ever disturb the order of his mind. No churchal creed and no established form or ceremony can ever obscure his light from God, or take from him the assurance that he is a free man, and that the truth as found in Christ, has made him free. Of all the systems of religious life that has ever been introduced among men, the Christian comes as a marked innovation, by ignoring every form of ritual that has been the accompanying credential of the religious devotee. Jesus created life anew, while love toward God was the crowning feature. Little children were by him brought forward that the disciples might learn even from them the lesson of confiding trust, and of obedience, so necessary for those who would accept the words of eternal life. Christianity is a lesson to be learned, and it demands the careful attention of the pupil that its application may be commendable to the divine teacher. When Jesus directed the minds of the disciples to the fact that the peacemakers were to be formed into a class for special commendation, and to be designated as the 'children of God,' he presented the lesson in so simple a manner, that there could not have been the least hesitancy in comprehending it, although so different from the course they had previously accepted. 'Except ye turn, and become as little children,'�and this was said to men of mature minds, men well versed in worldly experience,�and then he continues,�-rrye shall in nowise enter into the kingdom of heaven.' Such an example before a nation of soldiers was to destroy all hope of conquest. With the prophetic assurance that they wrere as secure in the possession of their city as they were of the everlasting hills, they would have accepted more readily the example of Joshua, Jephthah or Gideon, who were called the sons of God, and had given their lives to protect the children of Israel. Jesus was also the son of God, and the author of a new and living way, in which righteousness and the love of doing right should have the precedence. Christians in their zeal say a great many good and endearing words about Jesus and his redeeming love, and then accept Jephthah and Gideon as their Christian examples. Ages of wonderful revelations have transpired in the history of man since the days of the simple Nazarene. The Christian age with its beautiful, pentecostal season of spiritual refreshing, when tongues of fire announced the presence of the Lord, and when the family of Christ were baptized into one spirit of love and good-will. That wonderful age of the witnesses of God, when the Marchionites, Novatlans, Albigenses and Quakers gave their testimony of truth, and manifested the light of the spirit of Christ, and yet the peacemakers, who were to be called the children of God, are lamentably in the minority. That there is a reason why the pure and peaceful day of the anticipated millennium has moved so slowly is quite apparent. Instead of accepting the doctrine of Christ, the churches have accepted the spirit of the world, and their exhortations and prayers have been from that standand been thoroughly the consecrations and point. Had they received Jesus the Christ, they would have preached as he preached. 'Put up thy sword into its place, for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.' Instead of peace the Christian church has been the strong advocate for war, and no less for all the horrors that have followed in its train*. The example of the little child has been nearly obliterated from the mind. Rights that are personal and extremely selfish have dominated in the character infused into daily prayers. That salvation from the sins of the world is attainable, we have the best of evidence, and that the peaceable fruits of righteousness will come to us from above, if we so pray, and that we shall be made better and happier while thus engaged is also clearly evidenced by the life of the great Teacher and of his disciples, as well as by many faithful witnesses of more recent date. It is one of the wonders of the present age that this light of God should have become so obscured. Even the Christian will contend for the necessity of demanding our rights by the influence of powder and ball, as earnestly as he will contend for salvation by some traditional ceremony, and think he is doing God's service. By and by the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our Lord, and then it will be,�Peace on earth, good will to all mankind.
