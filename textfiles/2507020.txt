Alfred., Me. June, 1895. The planting of the seeds is past and now comes the care of the growing plants that the weeds and insects do not spoil them. How curious it is that the weeds will grow and mature without aid from us, but the good plants require our greatest care. So it is with the things of the Spirit. As natural creatures we are as prone to evil as the sparks to fly upward. The path of progress is an uphill work, requiring eternal vigilance, that we do not lose in jm hour what it has taken us days to gain. June has given us a variety of weathers. One day is so cold that a fire is needed for comfort and the next day is so warm, that had we wings, there would be quite a company in the region of the North Pole. We often think of our Florida friends. Our prayers go out for their prosperity, and as our little monthly paper is the only messenger to the distant lands, we will send by it our kindest love to our gospel friends who are toiling for the cause of right. Just now we are needing rain for the growing crops. Grass which has been doing well requires rain soon, or we shall get a small hay crop. The Brethren have taken advantage of the dry weather to shingle the meetinghouse which was built in 1794, and the shingles have lasted until now. The boards of the roof were of excellent lumber, evidently our early father's brought their best to build a temple to their Father and Mother, God. May we pattern them in our offerings. Fannie Casey.
