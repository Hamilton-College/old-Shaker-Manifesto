A TRUE SON of LIBERTY 'A TRUE SON of LIBERTY' is the title of number seven of the Waldorf Series. It is from the pen of F. P. Williams, and published by Saalfield and .Fitch, Now York. The son of Liberty is the pastor of the Union Tabernacle, and through the advantages of his advanced thought he is led to attack the preconceived ideas of the church of Bellicose. He illustrates his views in accordance with reason rather than by tradition. The position occupied by the pastor was the only one that could be taken as worthy of a place in the light of the present day, while his churchmembers, in their narrowness and bigotry, demanded that he should cling to the language of the dead past. It taxes our patience to remain in the company of these dullards. 'That man's mind is a queer jumble,' said the postmaster, as the pastor walked away. What does he mean by mixing up liberty with religion in the way he does? Seems as though I should never be able to straighten out my ideas again. He'd better make out some sort of a new-fangled, political Bible, and preach from that. Ours does not appear to suit his mind.' We follow this 'Son of Liberty' with a deep and loving interest, as every page of the little book develops more and more of the Christian character, till by the hands of religious persecutors, he is nearly deprived of his life.
