Jesus of Nazareth... Jesus of Nazareth, who once dwelt in a tenement of clay, and walked on the earth among men, was undoubtedly the chosen Medium to receive the Anointing Spirit — the Christ of God. And, by steadfast adherence to that anointing power bestowed upon him, he traveled into the life Divine. Since his. day, thousands, by the power of the same Spirit, and in obedience to his precepts, and through the influence of his holy example, have also attained unto the Divine life, and are now with him in the kingdom of heaven. The principles which constitute the kingdom of heaven are eternal, and admit of an everlasting increase, whether commenced on the earth or in the heavenly world ; and the will of God may be done on earth as really as in heaven. And all who are called into this kingdom— this Zion of God on earth — should wisely consider their high and holy calling, and the great responsibility which rests upon them to be faithful; for they are not only called to work out their own salvation, but are also called in relation to the whole human family ; and they should so live and walk that they may become Saviors to other souls, and be truly ' a peculiar people, zealous of good works,' and possess the inheritance promised to the meek. Every Christian virtue will shine forth in their lives, and, by obeying the behests of conscience, they will indeed be a ' city set on a hill, whose light cannot be hid,' raising an ensign of freedom. May the good Spirit hasten the time when the banner of Freedom from Sin shall wave gloriously over Columbia's soil, is the prayer of Hortense Hooser, Pleasant Ejll, Ky.
