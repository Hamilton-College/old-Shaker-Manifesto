SALT. NANCY G. DANFORD. Salt is used to preserve those things that would otherwise decay. It has been said. '' Use sufficient salt and meat can be preserved as long as trees grow or rivers run.' Jesus says, 'Ye are the salt of the earth.' That is, the testimony which ye have received from me will prove a power, where it is obeyed, to save the soul from the sins of the world, and preserve it to the kingdom of heaven order. 'If the Salt hath lost its savor wherewith shall it be salted. ' When once the saving principle is destroyed it can serve no useful purpose whatever. The expression is very significant, 'It is cast out to be trodden under the foot of man. ' Brethren and Sisters let us look well to our goings that the gospel of eternal life and truth lose not its saving power in our souls, and we be cast out of the kingdom at last. More than this, more than the salvation of our own souls is required : 'Ye are the Salt of the earth.' As much as to say. This saving power is given to you as unto chosen vessels, to hold and dispense the life-giving principle of salvation for the redemption of humanity, from under the curse entailed by the fall, and should you lose this saving testimony, where would hope be found for the perishing ones of earth? How can they be saved if the salt is not good ? Therefore, we see how necessary tha*. we hold and bear in our daily lives that quickening testimony which shall condemn the world, within and without. 'For every one (who is iiaved) shall be salted with fire as every sacrifice is, salted with salt.' And, ' Our God is a consuming fire' to consume and destroy all evil; but love unbounded love, to the penitent soul that seeks his saving power, and is willing to accept mercy on the terms approved, which is to confess and forsake all sin.
