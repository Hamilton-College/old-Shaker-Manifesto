Enfield, September 12, 1876 Dear Editor : A short paragraph having appeared in the American Socialist, quoted from The Shaker, runs thus : ' Tell a man his faults, and he will hate you forever.' Without special reference to the remedy proposed in the A. S., I would say that the application cannot be applied to any true Shaker. In all my experience in Shakerism I have never observed any one that was honestly, purposely, and understandingiy traveling away from a lower nature, that would take offense, or carry hatred in his heart forever, as above stated. Many times we find it beneficial to be told our faults, even when not done from the best motives. I do admit there is a class that would answer to all that would come under the meaning of the term hate, at having £heir faults exposed to them ; but it is also well known, such a class cannot by any means be ranked among genuine Shakers. And it would be very questionable if the Divine Order of the gospel could not reach such — whether any other means could ever alter their hearts' obliquities. Yours in brotherly love, Robert Aitkin
