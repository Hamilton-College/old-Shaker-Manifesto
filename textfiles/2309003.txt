MY CHOICE. Lizzie D. Horton. When a very little girl I was placed with the Shakers by a kind father who wished me protected from the sins of the world. He knew that with this people I should find a good home, receive an education and be taught to live an honorable and upright life. Not being blest with any particularly religious aspirations, I could not realize so fully as to-day the great blessing which came to me, not by chance, but by the leading of the Spirit. I was loved and kindly cared for by my Shaker friends, and in my childish fancy and affection tried to return that love. I endeavored to be good and obedient because it pleased them, feeling very sorry when I did wrong, principally, because I had grieved my dear teachers, not knowing that every sin marred my own spirit. I always found forgiveness for my faults, even before I sought it; and when reproved for some error, recognized that love guided the hand that chastened. Thus years passed on, and childhood with its free, happy days gradually blossomed into youth. I began to realize that life was not all play and I longed for the virtuous freedom of spirit which I saw so plainly manifested in the lives of my superiors, not fully comprehending the import or meaning of the desire. I had always said I never should leave this home, for I intended to become a Shaker Sister, but how little did I know what it was to be a Shaker Sister,�a disciple of Christ. At one time, when conversing with one of my best friends and asking counsel, I was advised to pray that conviction might rest upon my soul and lead me to confess, honestly and humbly, all past errors and ask the forgiveness of my friends. This work she assured me would be the first step in the new life, and a sure foundation upon which to build. In this condition, I was seemingly placed before two roads. In one,�the broad way I dare not walk, yet desired to obtain the joy, comfort and reward of the narrow way without paying the full price. While thus undecided the words of our Savior came forcibly to mind,� 'Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat, for strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.' Heeding this voice of warning, I said, The broad way is not the path for me. THE MANIFESTO. 20' I then prayed that I might walk in the 'strait and narrow way,' and that I might clearly see and comprehend my duty. As an answer came the words, 'Knock and it shall be opened unto you,' and again, the price to pay is, 'Thine own life also.' I felt that now I must make my final choice, for time spent in doubting and indecision is wasted. I resolved to enter the cleansing waters of Jordan and thus fit my soul for acceptance with the pure in heart. By an honest confession of all sin and by consecrating my services to God, anew, sought the privilege, on the 17th of May, 1892, to write my name in our Church Covenant. There my name stands enrolled with tried and true souls, and also my resolution to be a loyal member thereof. Thanks to God and to my precious friends, that I number one among you in the morning of my days, for one of the greatest blessings crowning our Centennial year, I deem that of recording my name as a member of this Church. The beloved friends of my childhood and youth who have often 'turned my feet from harm I could not see,' have been the 'angels in the way.' May I be so loyal to my mission that by an upright example I may be able to impress some little soul with conviction, and aid such to make a wise choice, with me. East Canterbury, N. H.
