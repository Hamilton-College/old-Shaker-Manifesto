KEEP AWAY South Union, KY. Mrs. E. L. Ashford, Nashville, Tenn. 1. Keep a way, keep a way, let my spirit have rest, All ye vanish 8. Keep a way, keep a way, let my spirit go free, That no heaven ing fol lies which tend to mo lest, And to hinder my progress in ly gifts be with-holden from me, And that I may keep pace with the Heaven's highway, From my soul, from my soul, keep away. 2. Keep away, light of the day, From my soul, from my soul, keep away. 4. Let me live keep a way, all ye idols of time, That are only a hindrance with my Brethren and Sisters in love, And with them in sweet un ion and clog to the mind, That would be of no use, but would lead me aand meekness improve By rejecting all evilly night and by stray, From my body and pout, keep away. day, Where all bondage and death keep a way, 5. O my soul keep a wake, and be ready to flee, And to hide from the evil which you may fore see; And to be in your duty, this word you'll obey, And from all that is wrong, keep away, keep away, keep away, keep away
