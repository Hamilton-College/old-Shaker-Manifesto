Seed-time and Harvest Beneath the dark November sky, With the cold rain falling drearily, And the bleak wind moaning and shrieking by, The seed o'er the land is cast; In the grave-like furrows the grain doth lie Till the weary months are past. In curling mist and frosty air, And. weeping skies, it lieth there; Or buried in the snows; or bare To every wind that blows, And night's deep darkness, like despair, Hangs o'er it while it grows. It grows in spite of cloud and blast And sullen rain, descending fast; And snow-wreaths thickly o'er it cast, And thund'rous dark'ning skies. And every tempest, roaring past, Strengthens it as it lies. Anon, a kindlier season shines— Warmth and light—the spring's soft signs, With many a beauteous balsam, twines The breast of icy death; And the grain, in delicate, emerald lines Springs up, a fairy birth. Then sunny months, in swift career, Bring up the lusty ripened ear; And the golden, harvest-time draws near And the reaper whets his scythe; Till on the day, the rich sheaves rear Their shapes on the landscape blithe. Sown in the dark, cold, desolate daysReaped in the sunshine's mellow blaze Thus, in the dim and wond'rous ways Of fate, are the deeds of men— Sorrow and trial, defeats, delays, Like storms, that soften the grain, Must test the heart's aspiring claim; But every just and noble aim Shall pass the ordeal, clear of blame; And, in the appointed hour, Bring forth its fruit of wealth or fame, Of knowledge, wisdom, power. In the winds of scorn, the storms of hate, In the darkness of hope, deferred full lateThrough days when the world shows deso;ate, Must sleep the good deeds thou hast done. Patiently labor, patiently wait, Thy work shall see the sun. That which was sown in the wintry air, Shall blossom and ripen when skies are fair; Though thine should be many an anxious care Ere the harvest is gathered in ; Be stout to toil, and steady to bear, The heart that is true shall win.
