William Koch William Koch, at Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. June 8, 1895. Age 70 years, 9 mo. and 1-1 days. William was born in Brunswick, Germany. He studied in the university of Heidelberg, and qualified himself for a lawyer. In 1848 he took part in the revolution at Eome. When the Pope's rule was restored by French soldiers, William being proscribed also in Germany, took refuge in Switzerland. He afterward emigrated to Brazil, became naturalized and was made Judge of the only Court in the Colony of 10,000 inhabitants and held this office for twenty years. He returned to Europe to visit his relations and then came to the U. S. at the solicitation of his brother who desired his aid in publishing a German paper. His belief in Communistic principles induced him to visit the Shakers of Mt. Lebanon in the fall of 1884. In Dec. of that year he entered the Society with his companion and has manifested himself a man of a clean spirit, and respect to the discipline and regulations of the Community. He was gentle and peaceable and seemed rather to submit to injustice, than engage in sharp contention. He was of the better class of mankind, and we believe will be better prepared for his privilege here to become a leader of that class to the higher truths of eternal salvation. A. G. H.
