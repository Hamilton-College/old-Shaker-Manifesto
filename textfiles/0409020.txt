BEAUTIFUL VALLEY 1. l am seeking a beautiful valley, Its pathway I ne'er before knew, And as I am slowly descending, Its beauties unfold to my view; 2. 'Tis true the descent has been painful, With watching, and toil and great care, I've been prosper'd thus far on my journey, And now grow content with my fare; 3. There are pilgrims descending before me, They all have some good thing to say Of humility's beautiful valley, And also of Zion's highway; Away in my old native city, I dream'd of this land far a way, But thought it a desolate region, And dreaded the rough thorny way. I find that each step I have taken, But gives new experience and strength, My courage is strong and unshaken, I'll gain the blest valley at length. For Just through the midst of the lowland, Is a highway of holiness clean, The H-on this path hath not trodden, Nor eye of the vulture e'er seen.
