THE ADVENTISTS AGAIN DISAPPOINTED The Adventists of Chicago, after making their own interpretation of the Book of 'Daniel, fixed upon Monday last at midnight for the end of all things here below, and the coming of the Son of Man. They gathered to the number of nearly 200, in their accustomed place of worship, where the day was spent in waiting and suffering annoying visits from unbelievers. At night they sought a secluded hall, where the ceremonies of feet-wash-' ing and eating the paschal lamb were observed. With the approach of evening came a thunderstorm, during which the skies were filled with a peculiar yellow light, giving temporary hope and courage to the Adventists on the appearance of the promised sign from heaven. After the fulfillment of their services in the hall, the company knelt, awaiting the coming of midnight and the hour of triumph. The early hour came, but the solemn ticking of the clock continued, and the darkness of night gradually melted into the light of dawn before which the hopes of the self-deluded band vanished. Slowly and sadly they wrapped the mantles of earth about them and stole quietly away; let us hope to learn that ' the Kingdom of Heaven cometh not with observation.' In what respect do these consistent Adventists differ from their inconsistent Orthodox Critics? Both read and understand the Scriptures as the very Word of God. All Christendom — Catholic and Protestant — looks for the Second Coming, as do these Adventists. In all respects they are at one, except that the Adventists set the time of the end in their own days — j ust as the Shakers have done. The latter differ from them all, in the manner, and are living in the fruition of the Kingdom of Heaven. Editor
