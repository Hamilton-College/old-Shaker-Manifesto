Shakers, N. Y. Oct. 1897. We record the date of Oct. 3rd as closing the season of active growth in vegetation, the date of our first heavy frost. In our experimental plat this season we tested eight new varieties of tomatoes and selected one that we will retain. The New Stone is a very desirable variety. Smooth, deep red, solid, making it desirable for canners and for marketing fresh. Of the older varieties we have found none that could excel 'Fordhook's First;' early, smooth and excellent quality. We have been enjoying beautiful autumn weather and anticipate a continuance of the same. .The habit of looking on the bright side of life is a very desirable one and can be cultivated as well as any other faculty. We all know that in this world of ours there is enough to depress and sadden the human soul and it needs many times a strong effort to penetrate the cloud that overshadows the material life to realize that beyond there is a silver lining. In the mad scramble for wealth which is being illustrated in the rush to the Alaskan gold fields is portrayed the truth that 'all is not gold that glitters,' and to be contented is to be happy. This does not imply that there should not be an effort made for the betterment of our condition for in that struggle is realized our happiness. With a joyful and thankful heart we recount the many blessings that have been vouchsafed to our lot the past year as we follow it on its descending scale and realize that if we advance in the knowledge of the truth it must be by progressing from the errors that have been incidental to our environment. May we put on the whole armor and with a brave heart and cheerful spirit meet the issues of life. Hamilton DeGraw.
