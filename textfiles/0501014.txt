CHINESE BANKRUPTCY They settle all money disputes among themselves, never appealing to the courts. They have a novel bankruptcy practice. On the last day of the year, the Chinaman who is unable to meet his obligations, pays the largest percentage he can, declaring his inability to do more. On New Year's morning his creditors forgive him, embrace him, and declare him ' free of the books.' Afterward, if able, he cancels the debt from pride, not obligation. In their cooking neither butter nor milk are used. Albert D. Richardson
