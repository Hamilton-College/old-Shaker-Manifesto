THE KENTUCKY REVIVAL. By Richard M'Nemar OF Union Village, Ohio. Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 7. Concerning the separation of those called Neiv-Lights from the Presbyterian Church. A division must always precede a separation. That division in sentiment which began about the commencement of the present century in the Presbyterian church continually increased until it effected an important separation, which took place in the month of September, 1803, a particular account of which is published in a pamphlet entitled, 'An Apology for renouncing the jurisdiction of the Synod of Kentucky.' It is an old proverb, that 'two cannot walk together unless they be agreed.' For nearly three years, the subjects and promoters of the revival continued their outward church membership with those whose constant labor it was to oppose and suppress it. This was a painful situation to both parties : for the New-Light to be chained down in silence, forbidden to pray, exhort or make any noise or uproar in time of meeting, however clearly he saw the danger of the wicked or felt his soul overflowing with the love and goodness of God. No less painful did it feel to the expounder, and those who contented themselves with his learned and ingenious labors, to be interrupted by a sudden shout, and put to silence by the din which commonly followed. Worst of all, to hear that system by which he had all his wealth in this world, and the hope of a favorite interest in a better, set at naught by the general proclamation, 'whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely.' Thus it continued until the unequivocal and open testimony of several ministers came forth in vindication of the new doctrine and the operations and exercises which attended it, and in pointed opposition to the Presbyterian system. This fur-' nished the desirable occasion of banishing from the standing community, those flaming zealots whom ministerial authority had failed to reduce into subjection. Those who were destined to excommunication on account of their faith and zeal, might not be wholly ^efc without the usual claim of congenial descent from Leo the great, the dissenting ministers voluntarily withdrew from under the jurisdiction of the Presbyterian church, and according to their own history 'constituted themselves into a Presbytery.' 'We, the above named, Robert Marshall, John Dunlavy, Richard M'Nemar, Barton W. Stone and John Thompson, having entered the above protest and withdrawn from under the jurisdiction of the Synod of Kentucky and of the Presbyteries to which we belonged, do now formally unite in a body as a Presbytery of Springfield.' The design of these men as they themselves testify in th'eir writings, was not to lay the foundation of any church or distinct party, but as they express it, they considered this 'Presbytery providentially formed to cover the truth from the impending storm and check the lawless career of opposition.' Nevertheless they proceeded to organize what they called churches, although they considered their existence as only a kind of asylum for those who were cast out, that they might come forth and be there, like David's father and mother with the king of Moab, until they should know what God would do for them. On this occasion, as far as the way was opened for a separation, the subjects of the revival who were sincere in their profession, generally came forth and united with the seceding body, which were distinguished by the name of Schismatics. As this separation was productive of a very important change and placed the subjects of the revival in a different situation from what they had been, as far as it extended, it will be proper to trace the outlines of those newformed churches in their separate capacity, and the first thing to be considered is their manner of constituting. Every house must be builded upon some foundation; all human creeds and confessions had been disannulled or rolled out of the way ; the power and authority of modern clergy, as successive to the apostles was renounced, and the Presbytery of Springfield confessed and denied not that they were as far off the true foundation as the rest. In this predicament they concluded that they would stand the safest and be most retired and unobserved by contending parties, upon this foundation :�the Scriptures. The following minutes, extracted from the records of the Turtle-Creek church, will develop this point more particularly, according to which plan the churches in general, which are called Schismatic, were organized. 1804.�'The session, taking into consideration the propriety of a more close attention to the government and discipline of the church, think it expedient to state to the people at large who have considered themselves under our care, the following observations on that subject.' I. 'We think it the privilege of the church, mutually to profess their regard to the holy Scriptures as the only rule of faith and practice, and the only standard of doctrine and discipline.' II. 'We think the Eldership ought not to form a separate body distinct from the church itself, nor go out of doors secretly to transact such business as concerns the body of the people.' III. 'We think it tends to keep the people in the dark and obstruct a real spirit of communion, to examine and admit members, try causes of scandal, censure, rebuke, reprove or suspend in secret, or to transact privately by the representatives of the people, such or any other business of a public nature.' IV. 'We think it expedient in order to the due exercise of government and discipline, that all who believe should be together in one place.' 'We therefore recommend that the church constitute in the place for public worship.' 'Moreover, that the foregoing observations be publicly read in the congregation, and the voice of the church taken, on the expediency of immediately reducing them to practice.' Signed, William Bedel, Malcham Worley, Matthias Spinning, Aaron Tullis, Samuel Sering, Francis Bedel, and Richard M'Nemar. Accordingly, at the close of public worship the above observations were read, and after a brief discussion on the subject, the following propositions were stated to the members of the church. Do we adopt the holy Scriptures as the only rule of faith and practice, the only standard of doctrine and discipline? Do we agree to constitute a church, and in that capacity to transact business? The questions being put, were answered in the affirmative, with uplifted hands, and no dissenting voice. The number were about seventy-four who voted as above, and remaining in the house after the congregation was dismissed, took their seats as members of the church. It was moved that the use of tokens be laid aside. It was also moved and agreed, that the endearing and Scripture appellation of brother and sister be revived among the members. It is to be observed that in those congregations where the members of the new Presbytery resided, the Presbyterian mode of government had been practiced for some time after the separation. Neither did the Presbytery immediately resign their reputed authority, although in everything they introduced some alteration. They considered it their prerogative to license public teachers, or rather to forward those whom they believed were chosen and called of God. The following, written at Springfield, Mar. 1804, will serve as a specimen. Forasmuch as our brother, Malcham Worley, has made known to us the exercises of his mind for some time past, expressive of a divine call to labor in word and doctrine, and we being satisfied from a long and intimate acquaintance with him, of his talents, both natural and acquired, being such, as through the grace of God may render him useful; and considering that the way of God is above our ways, it therefore seemeth good to us with one accord to encourage our brother to the work, whereunto we trust the Holy Spirit is calling him. We do hereby recommend him to the churches scattered abroad, to be forwarded in his calling according to the manifestation of the spirit given to him to profit withal. Signed in behalf of the Presbytery. B. W. Stone. Cl'k. It was but a short time before the Presbytery were convicted that their union was formed upon antichristian principles, and under that conviction dissolved. It will be unnecessary to say anything further concerning the government and discipline exercised by them. Their principle object was to set the people at liberty from the contracted folds into which they had been gathered by idol shepherds in the cloudy and dark day. As soon as they constituted a separate body, as above, with the Scriptures unexpounded as their only index, nothing remained for the Presbytery to do in relation to them, but to sit and watch, as Jonah sat in his booth, to see what would become of the city. It now remains to give a more particular account of the churches and people called Schismatics. From their expressions it is difficult to say what their real character was in their own estimation. They speak of themselves as a church, about to constitute a church, but how the first was constituted seemingly was not considered. Again, they speak of the people at large, and the churches at large. If these expressions have any definite signification, they must mean the people at liberty, and the churches at liberty. To be set at large and at liberty means one and the same thing. It follows then, that they considered the people who had been set at large by the preceding work, as now constituting churches at large or at liberty, who should be bound by no form of doctrine or discipline, but stand loose upon the variegated fields of antedeluvianism, patriarchism, Judaism, baptism, Christianity and Gentile-partyism, or whatever else was meted out between the lids of the Bible, either by history, precept, promise or prophecy. Notwithstanding this extensive liberty, it is truly marvelous and astonishing to consider the regular manner in which they proceeded from thing to thing in the investigation of truth. What is still more striking, is the union and harmony which existed among them in those investigations, and the subordination which they manifested in relation to those who were considered the most deeply initiated into the mysteries of the spirit. Taking what is called the New-Light doctrine as the rudiments of divine truth, they proceeded to consider the nature of justification and reconciliation to God. They rejected as a dangerous error, the doctrine of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ, and taught that no one could be justified or accepted of God but he that forsook his sins and became personally righteous; that no one could be pronounced just, upon the principles of truth, who was not so in reality, and therefore when the true God accepteth any as righteous in his sight, it must be such as are so in reality. Reconciliation or atonement is to be at one ; Christ is at one with G od ; we must be at one with Christ. God is unchangeably holy, just and good, and therefore cannot be reconciled or at one with an unholy, unjust and wicked person. Man in his natural state is unjust and unholy, therefore God is not at one with man. Chris the mediator, came into the world to atone us to God, not to reconcile or atone God to us, for if God is reconciled or atoned to man, it must be by becoming unholy and unjust; this cannot be ; the work of reconciliation or atonement is to make man like God, holy, just and good, and for this purpose Christ came into the world. There is wrath and enmity to be taken out of the way ; this never was in God, for God is love, therefore it must be in man, and to remove it out of man, the blood or life of Christ was shed, and to man that blood or life must be applied, and not to the throne of God's justice which is unchangeably holy, just and good. According to the schismatic doctrine, the vicarious sufferings of Jesus Christ in the room and stead of sinners that they might live, was only a cunningly devised fable, destitute of foundation either in common sense and reason or the Scriptures of truth, that proxy sufferings were inadmissible by any just law, either of God or man, as it would be wholly unreasonable and unlawful to hang an honest man in room and stead of a murderer, that the latter might be delivered out of the hands of justice and set at liberty. According to the unchangeable law of God, the soul that sinneth it shall die. From whence it was plainly deduced that there could be no reconciliation or atonement to God, unM the evil spirit, which is prone to evil, and that continually, was overcome and rooted out of God's creature, and as soon as that spirit which is opposed to the law was extinct, sin which is a transgression of the law, ceased 'of course, and the soul which came from God became reconciled and at one with Him. Hence followed the necessity of the sufferings of Christ being commensurate to the atonement and glory that should follow. He set us an example that we should walk in his steps. He suffered in the flesh that we might arm ourselves with the same mind. 'It is evident that Christians according to their measure have fellowship in the sufferings of Christ, and are filling up that which is behind his afflictions, in their body.' Stone's letters on atonement. Upon this principle it was evident that all who were in Christ suffered with him, that they might be glorified together, witnessed the sufferings of Christ. 1 Pet. v., 1. Eejoiced in his sufferings. (Chr. iv., 13.) That when the glory should be revealed, they might be glad with exceeding joy. The sufferings of Christ abounded in Paul, which were effectual to the Corinthians ; not to exempt them from sufferings, but in their enduring the same sufferings which he also suffered. 2 Cor. i., 5, 6. The greatest depth of the schismatic doctrine lay in the reciprocal union which they supposed must exist between Jesus Christ and his followers, which rendered both the sufferings and glorification identical in each, and left no room for the disciple to suffer in the room and stead of his Lord, any more than for the Lord to suffer in the room and stead of the disciple; and therefore if the sufferings of Christ abounded in the disciples of Jesus, the disciple did not suffer in the room and stead of Christ, but verily Christ suffered in him the same as in his Teacher. They taught that all that were born of Christ and united to him, were true Christians as much as fire produced by fire, is very fire of fire; and as Christ proceeded from the Father, and was true God of the true God, so all that were born of the divine nature of heaven, were perfect in one. It is very evident that the seed of Abraham are all believers. These believers are one, therefore not called seeds but seed. For there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female ; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. Gal. iii., 28. For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body so also is Christ. 1 Cor. xii., 12. Hence by Christ, in this verse, the Apostle means believers who are in Christ. And so I understand Gal. iii., 16. 'And to thy seed which is Christ, i. e. to all believers.' B. W. Stone. Upon the strength of this article of faith the Schismatics were so abundant in their profession of having Christ in them and being full of God, both the Father and the Son; Not that they held as an established principle that a real hypostatical union existed between them and God, but a hypothetical or supposed union depending on their faith, as all things are possible to him that believeth. The possibility of standing in so near a relation to God, afforded a lively anticipation of it to the mind while in the full exercise of believing, but still left room for the following prayer:� 'Come Father, Son and Holy Ghost, And seal me thine abode; Let all I am in Thee be lost; Let all be lost in God.' Were an animal capable of believing that it was possible to be lost and swallowed up in man, and be incorporated with the human body and become one with it, the anticipation of such an exalted state might be very pleasing to the mind of that animal; but should he imagine that man would form the union by swallowing him alive he must find himself greatly mistaken in the issue. Now, considering the great disparity between sinful man and God, it need not be thought strange if those who express the above prayer with great fervor, should be as greatly disappointed when the process is entered upon, by which the all-important union is effected. The Schismatics however, considered this union to have taken place first of all in the person of Jesus Christ. Hence, many important questions were agitated concerning this extraordinary person, the end of his mission into the world, the nature of the work which was given him to do, and how that work was to effect us. Upon which different hypotheses were formed according to the proficiency of each in the New-Light and the Schismatic spirit.
