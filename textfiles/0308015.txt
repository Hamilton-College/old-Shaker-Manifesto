FORBEARANCE The spirit of persecution is often keenly felt in many petty ways through life, sufficient to fully test the fidelity of the striving Christian. Those only who meekly bear unmerited cen- sure, or injustice in its many forms, still maintaining a calm, forgiving spirit, and con- tinuing to do good to their enemies are, indeed and truly, Christian. Genuine forbearance is a virtue, beautiful, noble, and Christ-like. How many professing Christians can meet the insults of scoffers, or hear slanderous reports of themselves or their friends, without a retaliatory answer in their hearts, and who (if practicable) would not turn the weight of the offense upon the offender ? May we never forget the lovely example of our Pattern, who bore so meekly the malice of the vile; when scourged, spit upon, stoned, scoffed and jeered, his lofty spirit could not stoop to pour out a revenge. How noble the breathings of his soul, ' Father forgive them; for they know not what they do.' Let each follower of our Savior ask himself this question, â€” In how great a degree do I practise this Christian principle? Elizabeth Martin, Canterbury, N. H.
