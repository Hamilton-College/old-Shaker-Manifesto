SURROUNDING INFLUENCES. IDA A. THOMAS. Let me gather to the true and noble of heart; those who are willing and ready to sacrifice life itself, for the pure and holy principles of Christianity. It is any sincere desire to ever feel the beautiful influences of such, that they may strengthen me in my struggles. I feel without these pure influences around me, my own efforts are but feeble. It is the true aim of my life to live and learn to do well, so as to be a help to any that I could help in my feeble way. I have enjoyed a privilege among Believers over three years, and in that time I feel that I have gained many and lasting friends. Of my dear Elders I cannot speak too well; tongue cannot express the love and gratitude I feel for their untiriog patience in my behalf. Do you wish to keep near God? then be true with your faith. Do you wish to keep from a worldly influence? then shun every thing that would tend to it. This I will strive to do, to shun every thing that would carry my thoughts from my gospel home out to the bewildering and dazzling influences of the world. I know I have a strong and worldly nature which needs subjection and restraint ; this is chiefly my object in living here, to learn to govern and subject my spirit, that I may receive to my soul's understanding. Many complain of the cross, thinking oft-times this thing or that is unnecessary ; to such I would say, why do you live in such a way ? what is your motive ? Not half, but the whole must be given ; a full and complete sacrifice is required, and now is the appointed time. I am thankful that I have been blest with faith, and also that I have had strength to be guided by it, and I pray that I may receive more and more daily, a substance for my soul to feed on, that I may grow firm and strong, and be a valiant servant in the great cause of redemption.
