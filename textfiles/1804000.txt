The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 25. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Re-written by Henry C. Blinn. Mother Ann and the Elders visit New Lebanon, N. Y. Meeting at the house of John Bishop. They visit Jabez Spencer in Stephentown, Mass., and return to NewLebanon on Saturday, Aug. 23, 1783. Mother Ann and the Elders, with a large company of Believers left the house of Nathan Goodrich, to visit New Lebanon. They arrived at the residence of Israel Tolcott, who lived on the mountain between New Lebanon and Hancock, a short time before noon. Abigail, the mother of a small family, was preparing the dinner, when Mother Ann said to her,� 'Abigail, we shall all dine with you today.' 'And I will arrange accordingly,' said Abigail, 'and enlarge the supply of food.' 'Nay,' said Mother,' 'there will be a great plenty.' Between thirty and forty persons were provided with food that day and were satisfied. Abigail was greatly astonished that so many people were fed upon so small a quantity of food. The EHers then passed on to David Shapley's and made a short call, and then to the house of John Bishop in New Lebanon. At this time was fulfilled the prophecy which Mother Ann had made to John, several years before this date, and while she was in the prison in Albany. It was a joyful day to John. Mother Ann walked through the house from room to room, singiug a song of joy and blessing. The next morning Mother Ann asked John if he had any suitable place on his farm where they could hold a meeting. 'There will be,' said she, 'many more people here than you can accomodate in your house.' 'Yea,' replied John, 'we will have the meeting in the orchard.' It was estimated that some four hundred people were present. A piece was sung by Elder Wm. Lee, and the Believers enjoyed a beautiful season, in which was manifested the spirit of God in a gentle, inward power and gift. Amos Rathburn asserts that he realized a great outpouring of the spirit of God. He saw with clearness the sad state of the children of men, and the gift of salvation that was offered by the gospel. He warned all against losing the day of their visitation. Elder James came forward and said, 'My name is James AVhittaker. I have prayed for you, my friends, as earnestly as ever I prayed for my own soul.' He then spoke of the sinful state of man, and of the necessity of a restoration through Christ, in order to find salvation and redemption, now offered through the medium of the gospel. 'The time has fully come,' said he, 'according to the prophecy, for Christ to make his second appearance for the redemption of man, and we are the witnesses, through whom Christ has manifested himself in this day. The only means of salvation that will ever be offered to a lost world, is to confess and forsake their sins, take up the cross and follow Christ in the regeneration.' He also spoke of the necessity of believing in these messengers whom God had sent, and declared that the only way that they could find the will of God, was to find it in the followers of Christ. This was the way, according to the scriptures, that God manifested Himself to the ancients and that it was as much so at the present time. Father James spoke of humility and self-abasement. '' You cannot blame me for abasing myself.' He declared the great riches he had found by the gospel, and the awful consequences that would follow those who rejected the day of their visitation. Elder Joseph Meacham and Calvin Harlow, made a few remarks in confirmation of the work of God. The power of the holy Spirit was very great and the evidences of the testimony clear. Every mouth was stopped, and every tongue became dumb, and the assembly appeared as though arraigned before the bar of judgment. The Believers went forth in the worship of God with power and with spiritual gifts. There was no one to molest them or to make them afraid. At the close of the service food was prepared for the Brethren and Sisters and for a large number of strangers. At the suggestion of Mother Ann, John Bishop gave a general invitation to all present, to accept of his hospitality. Sixty persons were soon seated, and all amply supplied as had been done for the Believers. It was estimated that some two hundred people had been furnished with food. Concerning this visit, John gave the following statement. u I evidently felt the blessing of God rest upon my house and upon all that I possessed. Though the temporal blessings are the least, and were at this time, yet as they are evidences of the good fountain from whence they flowed I shall insert some of them in particular. ' There were about forty persons in the company that came with Mother Ann, and nearly all came on horseback. The horses were turned into a field that contained ten acres. At first I thought my feed would soon be gone, but concluded not to be over anxious, as I had the privilege of entertaining Mother Ann and the Elders. These horses and four cows remained in the field from Saturday P. M. till Monday noon following. ' The same day after they were taken out, I went to see the field, and as strange as it may seem, it was as fresh and as green as though a creature had not been in it fora week. ' Although the company had been amply supplied with milk for drink, the dairy did not show the loss, as there was as much butter made as usual. ''These things may appear impossible but I feel confident that they were effected by the same power as that which fed the five thousand.' Mother Ann and the Elders now visited several families of Believers, among whom were Hezek:ah Hammond, George Darrow and Reuben Wright. A meeting was held in Reuben's house and the Believers were blest with wonderful power and zeal. Mother Ann while kneeling, addressed the people present.� ' God created my soul in innocence, but by sinning against his holy commandments, I was defiled and made unholy in his sight. While I was in this sad state, God was pleased to call me by the gospel of our Savior, Jesus Christ. By the gift of the holy Spirit I was made able to see and feel the depth of my loss, and by this same power I was helped to travel out of it. 'When I was despised and afflicted by my enemies, thou O God, didst comfort me ! When cruel persecutors rose against me, and put me in prison or in a dungeon, thou didst stretch forth thy hand for my deliverance. 'I thank thee, O Father! Lord of heaven and earth, for the revelation of our Savior, Jesus Christ, which has shown to me the depth of man's loss, and the way of recovery by the gospel. '' I crossed the great waters with a little company, through many dangers and perils, and by the miraculous power of God, we arrived safely in this land. God has supported us by his special grace under all trials and afflictions, and given us strength and fortitude to stand in defense of the truth. 'We thank thee, O God, for raising up so great a people in this land. Thou hast made us able to plant the gospel in the hearts of many, who now through love, glorify thy name. We pray God protect and strengthen thy chosen people, and keep them from all evil.' Mother Ann and the Elders then visited the family of Josiah Skiuner, where they held a meeting. It was a demonstration of great joy and not uncommon at this date, for those who had been baptized into the faith of the gospel, to shout and sing as they were journeying from town to town. It was the day of glad tidings and they were anxious for all to hear them. While at the residence of John Spier, a mob surrounded the house and demanded admittance. They used much threatening and abusive language and at length burst open the door and entered the dwelling. No farther violence was attempted and after they had made all the threats of abuse that their wicked minds could suggest, they departed and the Believers retired to rest. A visit was made to the residence of Nathan Farrington by the urgent invitation of the family. As a meeting had been anticipated, a large company of Believers had assembled, but Elder William remarked.�'As the house is not large enough for the people to serve God in, we had better go into the field.' Some of the people who were present thought Farrington was very foolish to allow such a body of people to enter his field and ruin the crop of grass. But Nathan was full of faith and only made answer, 'You will see.'� To the disappointment, however, of many who were present, more grass was obtained from the field than for many years of previous date. Mother Ann and the Elders next visited Jabez Spencer of Stephentown. On Sabbath morning Capt. Ichabod Turner informed the Elders that a mob was gathering, but it would take several days for them to form into companies. The Elders said they expected to leave the place on Monday morning. Several ruffianly characters, however, came on the Sabbath and maliciously struck some of the Brethren, but Jabez put the rioters out of the house and they offered no further violence. A large body of people attended the religious service. Some of the company manifested an opposition to the work and charged Mother Ann and the Elders with being deceivers and false prophets. Elder James Whittaker in preaching, introduced his discourse with these words,� 'O full of all subtilty and all misqhief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness. Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?' Acts xiii., 10. A very gifted meeting followed and the Believers continued in prayer and praise most of the night.
