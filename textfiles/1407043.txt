INFORMATION FOR INQUIRERS. For the better understanding of those who wish to know of the rules and regulations of our religious home, we have prepared the following brief summary. Further information may be obtained by addressing any member of the order. 1. The form of government in the Society is adapted to the different orders of which it is composed : its powers and authorities growing out of the mutual faith, love and confidence of the members. 2. No one is excluded from the privilege of becoming a member on account of poverty ; nor will they be accepted because of wealth. 3. Plain and explicit facts will belaid before the investigator. To become a member, is a voluntary concession of the individual. 4. Those who accept the privilege to reside wTith us, as well as those who visit the Society as inquirers, are expected to regard the rules of the family where they are entertained. 5. By the principles of this Society, no believing husband or wife is allowed to separate from an unbelieving partner, except by mutual or legal agreement. 6. Parents that become members are not required to give up their children : but they will be requested to see that the children keep the rules of the family. Minors are never taken under the immediate charge of the Society, except by the request or consent of those who have the lawful right over them. 7. No corporal punishment is approved in the government of the Society, nor any external violence exercised on any rational person. 8. It is expected that the children admitted into the Society, will receive an education suitable for the general management of business. 9. Probationary members may retain the lawful ownership of their property, but the interest accruing therefrom will be devoted to the benefit of the Society, until by their own free will, and the consent of the Trustees, they shall consecrate said property to the support of the family where they reside. 10. The Society will not be responsible for debts contracted by persons, previous to the time of their membership. 11. Those who dispose of their property to relations in the worldly order, should remain with those relations. 12. A person wishing to become a member of the Society, must rectify all his wrongs, and discharge all just and legal claims. 18. Those who ask for admission to our Home arc supposed to be in search of more truth and light, hence, an important principle in the Shaker Church, is the covfession of sin to God, in the presence of a witness. 14. Those who have dedicated their property, and afterward withdraw from the Society,ï¿½according to the law of justice and equity, there can be no ground for retraction. 15. To live as Brethren and Sisters in the gospel of Christ, we can hold no private correspondence. All communications sent from or received into the family, whether printed or written, will be subject to the examination and advice of the Elders of the family. 1G. The leading authority of the Society is vested in a Ministry, consisting of two Brothers and two Sisters. Elders and Trustees are also appointed. These orders constitute the general government, of the Society, in all of its branches.
