NO TIME TO WASTE. MARCIA E. HASTINGS. Moments are precious, spiritual needs abundant; there is no time to be spent in frivolous use, talking aimlessly on subjects that are of no consequence, harping on something that roils our selfish sensitiveness, affecting no good purpose, in fact effecting nothing only weakening our ability to concentrate our minds and efforts to do and accomplish something in the way of improvement upon ourselves or others, defiling our own spirits and making us unhappy,- - sour and unlovable; even the saints feel pity for such rather than admire them. So let us cherish love and sweetness ; diligently pursue the ways of Wisdom which are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. Canterbury, N. H.
