Humility and Prayer O Heaven .' we seek thy choicest gifts Of matchless worth, and beauty rare— The gifts of sweet humility, and prayer. O, may we walk where these abound, And seek the blessings Bowing there— The joys of true humility, and prayer. All graces pure, may we possess, The spotless robe which ang-els wear— That's framed in deep humility, and prayer! May Heaven's sacred gems adorn The crowrn, which by the cross, we'll bear— Secured by labor, faith and hope—and prayer. Far down in Zion's peaceful vale, Let every child of God repair— There bow in praise, humility, and prayer. United in true Christian love— Joined, heart and hand, we'll gather there, And pour forth, in humility, a prayer, That will ascend, unto the throne Of him, who sits in glory there. To bless all souls, who ask of him, in prayer. O precious gifts ! divinely given, Blest seasons here—foretaste of heaven ! 'We'll cherish these with love and care, And trusting in Humility and Prayer. Emily Smith, Mt. L.
