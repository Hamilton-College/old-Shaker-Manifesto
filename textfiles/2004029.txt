Union Village, Ohio. Dear Elder Henry;�We are still trying to keep our heads above water though mud and tide are often against us. We have been afflicted to a considerable extent with La Grippe, but it has passed on and our general health is good at present. This winter we have made, in our Family, ten or twelve new gates, and during 1889 we made a very neat picket fence along our street front, and quite an amount of repairing of fences has been done this winter. The good Sisters have lately had the whole kitchen whitewashed, the ceilings and mouldings painted in lively colors, and these processes have improved the appearance of things, thereabout, wonderfully. Yesterday Elder Joseph Slingerland and I measured off and marked places along our street between Center Family and cross-roads south, for an avenue of over one hundred sugar trees, (Acer Saccharinum) which in a few �years will be quite ornamental and refining in their influence, like the sweet harmonizing influences of instrumental music. We put new wringers in our Laundry during 1889, and toward the end of the year, and partly the present year, we have torn down and removed the debris and cleared up around two unsightly buildings which were not worth repairing. Yesterday received a boy 18 years of age into our family�his two sisters have been here a number of years. Br. Thomas Reider who made our new gates painted some red and some a fine blue, and where they stand near each other the variety produces a fine effect. Br. Thomas is very industrious and interested in seeing things ship-shape about the premises. O. C. H.
