NOTES Thk Church of Christ must necessarily be the messenger of peace. Its mission the word of God and its baptism the testimony of divine light. The Church and the World can never enter into harmonious relations, as the life of one depends upon its living testimony, the spirit of truth, while the other fulfills the desires of the flesh ani of the mind. Jesus taught most emphatically that his disciples were not of the world any more than he was of the world, ft was their privilege to walk in a new wav, in the light and to become the sons and daughters of God. The separation which was demanded was so marked that those who were baptized into the spirit and were able to take up their crosses and become faithful disciples were hated of the world and counted as among those that were dead. ' For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.' All of this came through the preaching of the cross. Jesus as a man and iu his relations among men was evidently held iu high esteem, as the disciples have been i'rce to leave on record this pleasing remark. ' He increased in wisdom and statue, and in favor with God and man.' The same may be said of those Avho have accepted his form of life. They grow in favor with God and man. The line of separation is always the doctrine of the cross. This the apostle defines very clearly in his remarks to the Galatians,ï¿½'God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.' This separation between the Church and the World was so distinct that it became impossible for one to live in the element of the other. The sons of Light and the sons of Belial cannot maintain a relation that will harmonize. That which stimulates the life and growth of the first, as effectually produces death and decay in the last. In its true order the Church is the representative of a life of regeneration r while the world knows only the life of generation. Jesus as a reward to his disciples, promises them the blessings of eternal life if they will follow him in this work of regeneration, and gives to them the assurance of an hundred fold reward in the treasures of this life, if they will, as God's servants, forsake their selfish interest and become members of his spiritual Order. Many professors readily admit that the Church and the World are distinct elements ; that they are ever at variance., and yet at the same time they work diligently to blend the two orders into one so that the so called Church of Christ, instead of being a light to the whole world becomes more directly a place of confusion. The Church of Christ establishes peace and good will among men, while the world encourages the spirit of war and bloodshed. Any attempt at the amalgamation of these opposite influences must always be attended with disappointment. Christ's people are not of the world. Their life and prosperity depends largely upon their faithfulness in accepting the spirit of God. A.TTG-TTST,
