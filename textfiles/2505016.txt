Enfield, N. H. April, 1895. With the beautiful month of May just dawning, we are glad to greet the- readers of The Manifesto with the cheery salutation, 'God bless you all;' while we chronicle the good news of general good health and prosperity. The bleak winds of winter have dealt fairly with us, having made no inroads on our physical organizations causing lingering illness, which so wrecks human happiness. On March 22nd Br. Simeon Childs took his transition to the Celestial City. 'Where kinilreil ami .-u;: niians are joyful To wi.len the spiritual boni.' Sixty-two years of his life were devoted to the work of regeneration, and no other man more effectually won the palm of victory over self and sin. It may well be said that those loved him most who knew him best. He needs no monument of honor but the one already erected in the hearts of his home relations. Gospel kindred, as one by one our friends ascend, what are we doing to fill the vacancies made? We are in the midst of mr sugar liarvest having tapped 1800 tries. As compared with last season we are having rather a late spring, but acting upon the advice of a very wise philosopher who declared it was always best to let the weather take its course, we are waiting the arrival of summer when we shall exchange the snow shovel for the hoe and rake and toil for those things which though perishable are indispensable to all alike while inhabiting this mundane sphere. On the evening of April 2nd twenty-five members of the Enfield Christian Endeavor 114 THE MANIFESTO. society, spent over two hours at our sugar-camp, enjoying its fruits and in singing hymns and conversing upon profitable subjrcs. As is well known, they are a growing society. George H. Baxter.
