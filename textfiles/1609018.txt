GOOD BREAD. To the Editor ;�I notice articles upon Graham bread in the American Agriculturist and other papers. Perhaps our experience at the North family, Mt. Lebanon, may be of some interest and service to the public. For many years wn have used bread made from wheat of our own raising. We wash the �wheat thoroughly, kiln dry, grind it ourselves coarsely, use it unbolted, and bake it in a soap-stone oven. No leaven in it. It is good wheaten bread, and we are certain that it is pure and unadulterated as we are that no deception is possible in the production of spiritual phenomena got up among ourselves arid especially for our own delectation and edification. I doubt whether really good men and women�Christians�can be raised upon poor bread, made of adulterated materials and chemically corrupted by leaven. If a clean thing cannot be brought out of an unclean, then how can a good thing be made out of bad materials? Have not a loaf to spare, (unless to feed the hungry,) a bushel of wheat, nor a barrel of flour to sell at any price. F. W. Evans.
