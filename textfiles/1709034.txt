FAITH, HOPE AND LOVE There are three lessons I would write, Three words as with a burning pen, In tracings of eternal light Upon the hearts of men. Have Faith, where'er thy barque is driven, The calm's disport, the tempest's mirth, Know this, God rules the hosts of heaven The inhabitants of earth. Have Hope! Though clouds environ now, And gladness hides her face with scorn ; Put thou the shadow fi om thy brow, No night but hath its morn. Have Love! Not love alone for one. But man as man thy brother call, And scatter like the circling sun, Thy charities on all. Thus grave these lessons on thy soul, Faith, Hope, and Love and thou shalt find Strength when life's surges wildest roll, Light when thou else wert blind. Selected.
