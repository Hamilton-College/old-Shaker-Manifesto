WITCHCRAFT IN GERMANY Accusations of witchcraft and maltreatment of supposed witches by the illiterate country people are still things of frequent occurrence in Germany. A recent number of the Danziger Zeitung tells of an incident of this kind in the village of Stangenwalde, where an old lone woman was accused of having bewitched an invalid widow, because, as the latter was driving past the other's hut, her horse suddenly came to a stop. This was assumed to be owing to the old woman's occult influence, and to prove that the widow's illness had been caused by her. The old creature, frightened out of her senses, was dragged to the widow's bedside and subjected to various torments to coerce her into expelling the devil from her victim. This mode of procedure failing, she was compelled to inflict cuts in three of her fingers and permit the widow to suck her blood, after which the invalid immediately began to feel better. It was then proposed to hang the witch, and a rope was fastened around her neck, while the crowd beat her about the head and face with slippers and shoemaker's lasts. She was finally rescued, but in a dangerously injured condition.
