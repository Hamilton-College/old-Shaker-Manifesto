BETRAYING THE TRUTH, OR IGNORANCE! WHICH? Isaac Anstatt. Had the writer of the article in the 'Flaming Sword' of July 29th, 'Betraying the Truth,' placed a glass before him, he would not, I think, condemn in others what he was about to practice, nor shown his ignorance. We quote�'If the parable of the coming of the bridegroom, who hath the bride means anything, it means there will come a personality, etc. It appears from this that the writer is not aware that not only the bridegroom but the bride has already come, and her name is Ann Lee. From the time of her conversion and baptism by the Christ spirit, the bride, the mother of the 'new heavens, wherein dwelleth righteousness,' having become one with Christ, taught the same gospel, the same manner of life as did Jesus. As we have heard of no spiritual death nor separation from Christ, what need is there of another bridegroom, or as he terms it, (man�woman.) Now that the true order of Deity is represented by the masculine and feminine principles, and here we have the 'virgins' Jesus and Ann Lee, who can administer to the spiritual needs of humanity, and together redeem them from the fall. This is as it should be, and is more in the line of true spiritu- 232 THE MANIFESTO. al progress, as well as science, than the (man�woman) form, the writer calls it. 'Jesus made no mistake.' Did not Ann Lee teach her followers the same doctrine that Jesus taught his followers? Had Ann Lee taught a new and opposite doctrine to Christ, there would be a schism, and there might be a net d of that (man�woman.) I would also call the editor's attention to an article the week previous on 'Theology.' I quote. 'Through a partial attainment of righteousness in the perception of one of the ten principles of the pategories of arch-natural life, viz. the chastity of the female, she ordained the Society of Believers, who, through ignorance of what comprises immortal life, believe her to have attained the goal of human aspiration.' Was not the writer rather blind to find only one in ten ? Did she not lay the foundation of a Pentecostal Church, where all things were held in common, and naught they possessed was their own, thereby destroying the very foundation of selfishness? It is true she struck at the root of all evil, the lusts of the flesh and mind; but did she not, by establishing a Pentecostal Church, after the pattern of the first, where all were to share and fare alike, no high, no low, no rich, no poor, but all one family of Christ, each working for the good of all, having one faith, one Lord, and one baptism, show the only true solution of the social evil and the financial and labor agitations of our day. If this be 'ignorance,' 'I thank thee, Oh Father, that thou hast hid it from the wise and high and unto simple babes revealed it.' The simple logic is this�The writer of the article mentioned is only voicing the feelings of many aspirants to office, notoriety, and leadership, who came or would come into our Community, not to change and reform their lives, but to change and reform society. To such we would say,�If you have no conviction for sin, and no desire to change your lives, remain whore you are, we already have enough dead weights. But to the sin-sick, penitent souls who are hungering and thirsting for the bread and waters of life, come. Watervliet, N. Y.
