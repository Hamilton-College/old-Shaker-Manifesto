Graham Custard Pie . â€” One quart of milk, two eggs, half a cup of sugar, half a cup of graham flour. Beat the eggs and stir all together. The graham flour sinks to the bottom of the pie dish as the custard bakes and forms a good crust. It may appear to be soaked, as custard pie crust often is, but it is not in the least ' clammy.' It dissolves easily in the mouth and is entirely digestible. A pleasant cream pie is made from the same recipe, leaving out the eggs and using creamy milk or thin cream.
