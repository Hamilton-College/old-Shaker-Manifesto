SWEDENBORGIANISM [From the New Jerusalem Messenger. ] I. God is one in essence and in person, in whom there is a distinct and essential Trinity, called in the Word the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and the Lord Jesus Christ is this God, and the only true object of worship. II. In order to be saved, men must believe on the Lord, and strive to obey his commandments, looking to him alone for strength and assistance, and acknowledging that all life and salvation are from Him. III. The Sacred Scriptures, or the Divine word, is not only the Revelation of the Lord's will and the history of his dealings with men, but also contains the infinite treasures of his wisdom expressed in symbolical or correspondential language, and therefore in addition to the sense of the letter, there is in the word an inner or spiritual sense, which can be interpreted only by the law of correspondence between things natural and things spiritual. IV. Now is the time of the second coming of the Lord, foretold in Matt, xxiv, and the establishment of the new church signified by the New Jerusalem in Revelation xxi, and this second coming is not a visible appearance, on earth, but a new disclosure of divine truth and the promulgation of true Christian doctrine, effected by means of the Lord's servant, Emanuel Swedenborg, who was specially instructed in this doctrine, and commissioned to publish it to the world. V. Man's life in the material body is but the preparation for eternal life, and when the body dies man immediately rises into the spiritual world, and, after preparation in an intermediate state, dwells for ever in heaven or hell, according to the character acquired during his earthly life. VI. The spiritual world, the eternal home of man after death, is not remote from this world, but is in direct conjunction with it, and we are, though unconsciously, always in immediate communion with angels and spirits.
