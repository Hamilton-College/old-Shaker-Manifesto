We are all pleased with the improved appearance of The Shaker Manifesto... South Union, Ky. May 3, 1878 We are all pleased with the improved appearance of The Shaker Manifesto— though it seems that all do not endorse your theology. For my part, you can handle Paul and the rest as you may please, I think they need bringing down ; they have been worshipped too long for humanity's good. If we are to believe the records that have been handed down for our perusal—they 'went a fishing' more than once ; and for all the world were like some of these flesh and blood creatures with whom we now eat, drink and have our being.
