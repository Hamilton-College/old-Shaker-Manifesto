Blooded Brutes vs. Scrub Humans. [Contributed by N. A. Briggs.] How can even the Almighty take an interest in such looking people? wa the unspoken query of my mind as I strolled along the esplanade of the West Side Driving Park the other day. Where do the fine faces, the noble brows and the sensitive mouths keep themselves, I wonder, gala days when the crowds outpour? Men with rotund stomachs and beery breaths ; boys with hard faces and cigarette-stained teeth ; women with whitewashed faces and painted cheeks ; girls with leering faces and gum-chewing jaws ; big chins, big necks, little foreheads, and thick lips, the panorama was continuous and depressing. uNow,' said I to myself, 'I wonder how far I shall go before I meet a face I would take on trial !' And I walked around the grand stand agaiu and again without meeting one, until, far off iu a fenced region beyond, I iound itï¿½the delicate, sensitive face of a blooded horse ! There was more intelligence in that one face than in the whole conglomerate mass of humanity I passed to find it. But what gave to the horse its supremacy ? Care in the breeding. Stockmen exercise no end of pains to breed high and not cross the record with an inferior. But in this human genealogy of ours we give no thought to requisites of race or temper or special adaptation. In other words, we tolerate mongrels nowhere but in the human species. No wonder the grand old stock is dying out. No wonder a walk to and fro in a crowd, or a ride in a street car, or an evening promenade through Clark street sends a thoughtful person home with a doub ing heart. While men are so careful to keep a clean record of the brute stock that perishes yet are indifferent to the sort of stock destined for eternities there is little chance for us. There should be a law to govern marriage as there is one to govern commerce. It should be a finable offense for ignorance and vice to propagate their species as it is for a grocer to adulterate sugar. These ai*e delicate matters to touch upon but they are presented with d.-ep earnestness. I have lost all patience with preachers and public teachers of every kind who shoot perpetually over the heads of these practical and vital questions, forever holding to the picked bones of dead, crude and useless theologies. Stop a moment and think what class of people are rearing most of the children to-day which are to make the men and women of to morrow. Is it into the homes of the pure and the cultured and the lovely that the little souls are thronging? Not at all. Where one child blossoms from .such a stalk, eleven are kicked and slapped on the road to vice in the homes of the drunkard and the worthless. Look on the curbstone yonder. There sits a blear-eyed woman, flat in the dirt, squeaking out the 'Sweet By and By' from an asthmatic hand-organ. In her soiled arms nestles a bit of a baby, and at her feet play feebly, like animals, three other children, dirty and uncombed, bearing in their faces already the marks of their heritage. If no law can govern propagation among the criminal classes surely there should be a law to taks such children out of the environments of their birth and bring them up to be a benefit rather than a curse to their country. Talk about redeeming the world, uplifting the masses, cleans- ing the ballot! The only way to do it is to save the children. As well expect a physician to cure a man of pneumonia by applying hot poultices to a patch of moonlight on his bed-room wall, as expect this fever-racked and pain-tormented patient of an adverse time to recover vigor and manhood by the application of nothing but theories. If the Heavenly powers would only make me ruler for a time do you know what I would do ? I would fine every father $1,000 and make him work it out, too, for every child of his which he could not decently educate and properly maintain. Every couple proposing to be married, should join a protection class to study each other up and gain some idea of the solemnity of angelbreeding, quite as important in its way as perhaps the propagation of Clydesdale or Alderney stock. And when I had that matter settled if I had any ammunition left I'd bring down the gum chewer and the woman who wears a dead bird on her hat. I keep a thunderbolt always in pickle for feather-heads.
