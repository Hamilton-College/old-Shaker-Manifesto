Canaan, N. Y. Dec. 1893. Beloved Editor:â€”We have been silent contributors to the Home Notes for some months by. giving space to others. Through some mistake our last Notes did not enter your Office. They contained a brief account of our terrific hailstorm therefore we felt somewhat disappointed in not having it published. A member of our 'Floral Circle' wrote out a description of the storm in blank verse which we enclose for your consideration. [The Storm at even-tide will appear next month. Ed.] On the 27th ult. some of our Sisters were surprised at an unusual, sudden jarring of the house. They at once attributed it to vibrations of an earthquake, in which opinion they were subsequently confirmed by learning that a severe shock was felt in Montreal at the same time. We have spent a very happy and joyous Thanksgiving. Our friends from the North family came to spend the day with us. I do not know as such a thing ever happened before. We have generally been recipients of their hospitality. We had a beautiful meeting in the fore- noon, after which we shared together a bountiful dinner, no lives of poor innocent animals having to be taken to satiate our appetites. In the afternoon the 'Floral Circle' gave us an interesting entertainment some over two hours, and we trust all were benefited thereby. Dec. 3. To-day we are right in the midst of a heavy snow-storm, the wind blowing so fiercely as to rock our house. We wish our gospel kindred a happy New Year. Angelina Brown
