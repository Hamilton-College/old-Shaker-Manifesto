Small-pox Cure The following was sent to the Liverpool Mercury by Edward Aine: 'I am willing to risk my reputation as a public man if the worst case of small-pox cannot be cured in three days simply by the use of cream of tartar. One ounce of cream of tartar, dissolved in a pint of water, drank at intervals when cold, is a certain, never-failing remedy. It has cured thousands, never leaves a mark, never causes blindness, and avoids tedious lingering.' [The above remedy for the most-dreaded of diseases has been going the rounds of the press for some time, but we have received the authority of a reliable octogenarian, that a family of nine, in Canada, was attacked with it, four dying before trying the above, and five recovering by its timely application. Should it prove so invariably, we may gladly dispense with Jenner's disgusting discovery. Ed.]
