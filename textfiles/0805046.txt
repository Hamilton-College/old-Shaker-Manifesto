HOME TOPICS How To Keep Bouquets Fresh There are various recipes for keeping bouquets fresh. Some people stick them in moist sand; some salt the water in the vases, and others warm it; others, again, use a few drops of ammonia. My rule is to cool the flowers thoroughly at night. When the long day of furnace heat has made the roses droop and their stems limp and lifeless, I clip them a little, and set them to float in a marble basin fall of very cold water. In the morning they come out made over into crisp beauty, as fresh and blooming as if just gathered. All flowers, however, will not stand this water-cure. Heliotrope blackens and falls to pieces under it, azaleas drop from their stems, and mignonette soaks away from its fragrance. For these I use dry cold air. I wrap them in cotton wool and set them on a shelf in the ice-chest. I can almost hear you laugh; but really I am not joking. Flowers thus treated keep perfectly for a week with me, and often longer.
