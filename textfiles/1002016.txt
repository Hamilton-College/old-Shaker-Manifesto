MOUTH VIRTUE W. K. BARBER Words are but breath — they may be moral, From the tongue may glibly roll, Goodness seemingly their prompter, They're no index of the soul. Yet as such we oft accept them, Gauge by them the speaker's worth, Eanking those whose talk is virtuous With the chosen ones of earth. Knowledge of a man's true nature What he says cannot impart — 'Tis his deeds alone acquaint us With the promptings of his heart. The benevolent and guileless Make of virtue no parade, And instead of oft proclaiming, Keep their good deeds in the shade. But the heartless and the vicious Their real nature to conceal, Of the pious role assuming, Prate of what they never feel. Most censorious, these sham Christians, While the practical, the true, Of their fellow-men's shortcomings Take a charitable view. Hypocrites show no such lenience ; 'Tis their cue, when they detect Any foible in another, Holy horror to affect. Cold their hearts, tight drawn their pursestrings — Though benevolence may flow From their lips in rounded periods, Talk relieves not want nor woe. They, even, who sneer at virtue, Making of their sin a vaunt, Are less than those vile impostors Whose religion is mere cant.
