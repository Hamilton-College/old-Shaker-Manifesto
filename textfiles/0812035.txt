HE DIED RICH How hard some men strive all their lives to have it said of them when they have passed hence—'he died rich!' Relatives and friends who are left behind seem to consider it a compliment to the dead to dwell upon the theme—'he died rich!'; M^NTF'ES'TO. THE 3O5 And now comes up the question. Is it an honor to a man to die rich? Is the world any better for a man to die rich than it would 3&gt;e if the same man died poor? Is the man any happier in the next life on account of it?
