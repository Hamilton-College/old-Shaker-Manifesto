Religion vs. Science OLIVER PRENTISS n all ages and stages of human existence, the religious element has been, s, and ever will be manifest. Its modus operand! is the exponent of progess made, from lowest planes to subimer elevations. In the remote past, eligion regarded science as the enemy, and brought suit. For centuries, the issue has been on rial before the high court of judicature — enlightened public sentiment — and now religion begins to enter a nolle prosequi. Science, instead of being the enemy of religion, begins to be regarded, by most advanced minds, as the lever, kindly given, whereby religion^ may lift itself to sublimer forms of thought. When religion and science, in the natural order, shall so practically cooperate as to get up children in good shape, there will be material for the advance movement—the building up of the resurrection order—the higher spiritual Shaker life. And then this little planet may begin to take rank with its more mature compeers.
