MARRIAGE We have given up all hope of ever being able to set all the people right upon our opinions of marriage. Several letters of recent date have been received at this office, assuring us that we must have very wicked feelings towards this institution, or we would practice it and its injunctions. But such is not the case. We have transcended the sphere where marriage,, reproduction, private property, politics, etc.— are honorable ; and are willing to view these as honorable in their proper sphere, among 'the children of this world.' Being promoted into a higher sphere, needs not cause us to hate the normal rudimentary conditions nor those in them, unless we find them cropping out in ourselves, to the disturbance of the elements of the advanced sphere, among 'the children of the Resurrection'—of Christ, or Christians. In ourselves we may hate to have them ; well knowing that Christians never did, never can practice them ; M^JSTIinESTO. THE SHAKBfJ JVLAJSTIWttSTO. though many calling themselves so, do practice them. Proposing still, and ever, to 'follow' •Christ Jesus, we mean to do with marriage, etc. just as he did with them— let them alone ; leave them with 'the •childreu of the world,' until they get soul-sick of such practices ; yet all the while, loving their souls, and desiring for them, even as for ourselves, an equal resurrection into the advanced, higher, holier life-practices of Jesus, the Christ.
