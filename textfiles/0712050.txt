Nothing to do NOTHING TO DO'Nothing to do!' in this world, of ours, Where weeds spring up with fairest flowers, a Where smiles have only a fitful play, Where hearts are breaking every day! 1 'Nothing to do!' thou Christian soul, Wrapping thee round in thy selfish stole; Â£ Off with the garments of sloth and sin, Christ thy Lord hath a kingdom to win. v 'Nothing to do!' There are prayers to lay On the altar of incense, day by day; c There are foes to meet within and without, There is error to conquer, strong and stout. ^ 'Nothing to do!' There are minds to teach The simplest form of Christian speech; C There are hearts to lure with loving wile, From the grimmest haunts of Sin's defile. 'Nothing to do!' There are lambs to feed, The precious hope of the Church's need; Strength to be borne to the weak and faint, i Vigils to keep with the doubting saint. 'Nothing to do!' And thy Savior said, j 'Follow thou Me, in the path I tread.' Lord, lend Thy help the journey through, i Lest faint, we cry, 'So much to do.' The Nation.
