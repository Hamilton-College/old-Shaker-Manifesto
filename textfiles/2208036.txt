PSYCHE. Stanley Fitzpatrick. I saw a soula human soul Crowned with a royal diadem From which the rays of lambent light Fell to her shining garment's hem. In her right hand a scepter proud Seemed meet for one who wore a crown; Yet while her eyes were raised on high Her scepter pointed earthward, down. In her left hand a prophet's harp A harp of gold with many strings A curious, carven thing it seemed, Like that to which a seraph sings. She smote the harp and words of flame Like lightning leaped athwart the sky, In music rareimmortal strains Deep, swelling anthems grand and high. She raised the scepter of command And then I knew her inward might I knew the power was hers alone To lead man upward to the light. I knew the clustered, starry rays Which formed the circlet round her head Were gathered from immortal suns Which from the Infinite were fed. And so I bowed as to a god, And in the dust my forehead laid; Her splendor dimmed my mortal eyes And made the trembling flesh afraid. And then a voice from silence boon Arose, sense-stilling, low and deep. Like rustle of the new-born leaves When wings of night above them sweep. It said: 'Look up, and claim thine own! LTplift thine inward eyes and see! Behold! thy soul before thee stands And yet not thinefor it is Thee.'
