Dear Brother:--I have received your kind letter of Dec 20th... [Many of our readers will, no doubt, be interested in the following letter, written by Elder John E. Ead*s of South Union, Ky., to Elder H. L. Eads of Union Village, O., as it was at a time when the Believers were in deep sorrow. Ed.] South Union, Ky., Jan. 4, 1862. Dear Brother :ï¿½I have received your kind letter of Dec. 20th. and never was I and many others, more thankful to receive a letter from your pen. It seems you had the kindness to try repeatedly to get a letter to me, but succeeded only in this of the 20th. ult. I will now, also, try to get one to you, and hope the best I can for success. We were as much surprised, as we were thankful to receive a letter at this time. I read it in both of our families, and, when I read it the second time, I received evidence that it had been supernaturally protected. Your letter, I suppose, had been inspected by the appointed and lawful supervisors, but they had the manliness, and sufficient human sympathy to send it forward, till it reached our depot. For it would assuredly be severe, indeed, as well as destitute of the ''milk of human kindness' to hinder the passing of a communication which consisted only of kindly inquiries of welfare between brothers, and an interchange of pious thoughts toward our Redeemer and Creator. I hope, therefore, this of mine, in return, may be as favorably received by the inspectors, as was yours to me, seeing that it does by no means interfere with the interests of either party, now in the field. For, as you observed, it is so well known to the public that Shakers, (as we both are) take no part in the politics of the world, no sides with any political party, but, loyal to whatever government, under providence, is extended over us, taking no part in its establishment, and that we are peaceable, inoffensive citizens, making an honest, and humble living. That Shaker institutions are clearly religious institutions. This being well understood by the public generally, I think I may fairly infer that we will meet with more clemency from inspectors, than we would if we were at all belligerant, either in our faith, or character. I was very thankful to hear of your reasonable good health, and of that of all our friends ; but I could not forbear sympathizing, when I heard that between two Shaker settlements, so many thousands of dollars had been lost, on account of the war, and that at other places considerable had been lost. On your part, it seemed to me that the stagnation of business, and the multiplicity of widows and children 'thick as blackberries' that were coming in to receive your comfort and protection; this, I thought, would be drawback enough upon your temporalities without any further inflictions of the calamities of war. We have not been visited with anything of which we feel like complaining though we have fed the soldiers, in their passing and repassing, from two at a time, up to hundreds, till we have about gone the length of our string without suffering ourselves. Not long since, our sisters had to be up pretty much one whole night cooking lor a company of six hundred soldiers, (cavalry,) and with all of their exertions did not set all of them something to eat, being at first represented as a company of one hundred and fifty or two hundred. The poor creatures were hungry, but a portion of them had to go on, for we were not able to supply them. This thiug of feeding horses and soldiers both, we find soon takes away the subsistence upon which .we, ourselves, must depend. Of late, some who call themselves 'Texas Rangers' seem inclined to take by violence what they want or say they need ; but this has not been carried to any great extent as yet. But if the necessities of the war should increase, we are unable to say what may come upon us in this line. But, in a spiritual line, we are promised that our sufferings shall not exceed our ability to bear, provided we will be true to our faith and calling. It was a peculiar comfort to me, and all your friends and acquaintances here, to hear of the welfare, and to receive the pure love of those prominent laborers in the vineyard to whose names you so kindly alluded and mentioned. They feel to us, and we so esteem them, as beautiful branches of the Heavenly Viue, yielding Heavenly fruits ; and 0, how we would love to see them, and be refreshed and cheered and comforted by them ; but we cannot at this time. Beloved Elder John Rankin made an effort some month or two since, to reach your lovely residence, and did go far enough towards the military boundary in that direction to ascertain the fact, that if he passed over, he could not return. He therefore returned, and gave up the point he so ardently desired. We must say that we have got along, thus far, with less trouble than we anticipated. The soldiers make no demands upon the country but what the military necessities of their case seems to justify, are inclined to manifest a good degree of southern politeness, and seem to desire to make themselves as little offensive to the inhabitants of the country, especially in a political point of view, as they consistently can. The exceptions to this do not seem to proceed from the government and regulations of the army, but from over zealous partisans. For a while, we felt great apprehensions of trouble from drafting, and on account thereof two of us made Governor Johusou a visit, at his residence in Bowling Greeu. We found him affable, familiar, and fortunately well acquainted with the Believers. We found no necessity for pleading our faith, habits or manner of life, for he seemed to know much about Shakers, and wt.s favorably inclined or disposed. We found, to our great relief, that he had no thought of drafting the citizens of the country, but simply desired to raise a few regiments of volunteers. We were well satisfied with our visit, (Urban E. Johns and myself,) and the counsel which he gave' was so much like what we had already received at home, and that was, to stick together and stay at home ; make no visits north, and thus avoid censure, remain neutral, as we professed, and show ourselves loyal to the government extended over the land. And in this course he did not think we would suffer more inconvenience than the necessities of the case would bring over the common country. He seemed pleased, aad satisfied with the kindness we had shown to the soldiers. We also endeavored to get an interview with Gen. Buckner, but he was off all day on duty, and we could not obtain it. The great battle yet to be at Bowling Green, does not appear to us to be as near at hand, as it does to you. There is such a seeming remarkable tardiness in the movements of the army on the federal side. As one side increases, the other must increase in proportion, so that ic is difficult to be sufficiently prepared. Fear may have its influence, and it may be a natural backwardness, as it should be where brothers are about to meet in deadly conflict, and we may suppose it will be a bloody matter when it does come off: except, as you remark, there should be another 'Bull Run or Manassas race,' from one side or the other; which would be decidedly the cheapest way of settling the affair, provided it would be as well settled, when the race would be over. But that would be too good ; we do not expect it, and all the part we expect to take, is to do what Ave can for the wounded and dying, when the affair is over, provided matters so turn that they be thrown, in any numbers, upon our mercy. This only, would be dictated by a truly Christian faith. Your presentation of Christian duty, meets our feelings exactly ; for, as you say, 'We cannot go to war, we cannot kill anybody ; for the spirit of our divine Teacher by which we are led, doth utterly forbid it, and disqualifies us ; for his kingdom is not of this world ; therefore those who are exclusively his servants, cannot fight nor shed the blood of their fellow man.' Nay, as you further remark, if we ha^. to seek the caves and rocks, the sequestered vallies or mountains, and the solitary places for a home, subsisting upon the merest pittance, which G-od in his goodness causes to grow from the bosom of this beautiful earth, we could not so highly offend the Almighty Father, who has 'power to destroy both soul and body in hell.' With this kind of resolution, we expect to suffer our share of affliction or judgment, which is now abundantly abroad in the land. In regard to the Christlike virtue of turning the other cheek, when the one is smitten, we have had a little trial in one case. Elder Solomon Rankin who was waiting upon the soldiers, had been advocating this virtue, thereupon, one of the soldiers felt a sudden impulse to try him to test this virtue, declaring that he did not believe in such a doctrine, and with the same brought Elder S. a spat on one cheek. Elder S. instinctively turned the other in accordance with his doctrine, and the soldier brought back his hand with a spat on the other cheek. This caused a considerable laugh with ihe soldiers, as it did with Elder S. but it never changed one stern muscle of the soldier's countenance. This truly represents the spirit and faith of all of us, on whom the powers of the world to come have had their proper influence. But where there is not much experience in this line, another branch of counsel is easier kept. ' When persecuted in one city, flee to another,' but faith must be kept, if we are protected. Judging from the outward appearance of things, our future prospects are not clear to us. What may come to disturb or unsettle us, we do not know, nor do we know the amount of judgment God will require at the hands of mankind, before they will be willing to do his will instead of their own. Nor do we know whether He will be pleased to establish two republics or one; or whether or not he has something in reserve, differ- ent from the prospects of either party, that he will bring mankind to as their greatest jrood. This .we do not know ; but we hope that we, with all parties, may be reconciled to his will, when his government shall be established. You will of course know that God's will is always foremost with us, and we find that it is a good deal the sense of the soldiers that the success, or ill success of their arms, will, in a good measure, decide what is God's will in the matter. Now, dear brother, I do not see but I have written you pretty much all of interest that I well can at this time. I doubt not that you know more of the present state of affairs than I do. Thank you much for delivering our love in so sensitive a manner. We are also thankful to receive so much pure love in return. Yea, thankful we are, for love is rendered double in value in these times of tribulation. Receive, therefore, the true and pure love, not only from myself, but from many of your old friends and acquaintances ; please distribute the same to our friends so far as you may have opportunity. Kindly farewell, John R. Eads.
