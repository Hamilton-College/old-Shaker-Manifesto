Shakers, N. Y. August, 1898. The public press has recorded the translation of one more of the veterans who battled for the releasement of our nation from the thralldom of chattel slavery, he has joined the church triumphant Parker Pillsbury in his association with those valiant souls Garrison, Philips and Sumner formed a host who were invincible and could not be defeated. We have perused with a great deal of pleasure and profit 'Acts of the Antislavery Apostles,' by his pen. The coming generation could be benefitted by the study of those lives, reviewing their conflicts and their victories, preparing themselves, to deal intelligently and with decision 140 THE MANIFESTO. with the questions that to-day are demand ing a righteous adjustment. We have had beautiful weather for our grain and hay harvest, some three weeks past during our harvesting season without rain. While some other crops were needy the excellent quality of this harvest will more than compensate. We will again speak approvingly of the subject matter in the Aug. Manifesto. The excellent ideas there illustrated must have a beneficial effect. Where one listens to a verbal sermon one hundred peruse it when publisht where it can be circulated among the masses. The age is a reading one and tho our Manifesto may occupy only a little of the space and time given to the perusal of the ideas publisht and placed before the public some of which are wise and some otherwise; yet we believe it has its mission and should be sustained not by caustic criticisms but by holding up the hands of the editorial department in their efforts to place before the public that which is for the benefit of the masses, and willing to give time and means to forward this end. Long live The Manifesto and our veteran editor. Hamilton DeGraw.
