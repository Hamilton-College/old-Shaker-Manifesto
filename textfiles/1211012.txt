CONTENT SARAH A. GIBBS Beyond the hills that shut me in I heard the sounds of labor. World's work and pain and sorrow too Seemed struggling with its neighbor. And love seemed dead, and peace had fled Far off to fields elysian, And might was right, and strength was law; Such was the earthly vision. My soul was stirred; I prayed,—'Letme Do some great work so purely, To right life's wrongs, that I shall know That I have loved thee surely.' My lips send forth the eager cry, The while my heart beat faster, 'For some great deed to prove my love, Send me, send me,—my Master !' But every road was hedged with thorns, My hands were torn and bleeding; Each gate was barred, and hope ill-starred Was in my heart receding. Night came ; within the valley's rim The sounds of pain and sorrow Grew faint; with idly folded hands I waited for the morrow. From out the silence came a voice Saying, 'If God thou fearest, Rise up and do, thy whole life through, The duty that lies nearest. The friendly word, the kindly deed, Though small the act in seeming, Shall in the end, unto thy soul Prove mighter than thy dreaming. The cup of water to the faint, The rest unto the weary, The light thou givest another's life, Shall make thine own less dreary. And boundless realms of faith and love Will wait for thy possessing; Not creeds, but deeds—if thou wouldst win Unto thy soul a blessing.' And so I wait with peaceful heart, Content to do His pleasure; Not caring if the world shall mock At smallness of the measure. Of thoughts, or deeds, or daily life, He knows the true endeavor To do His will, to seek His face; And he will fail me never. —Benson, Vt.
