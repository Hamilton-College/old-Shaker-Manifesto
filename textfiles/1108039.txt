A NEGRO PRAYER The following grotesque, yet solemn prayer is a verbatim report, taken in the winter of 1862-3, at a public meeting held by plantation negroes in a settlement near camp: ' O Lord God of dis glorious universe, wilt dou look down in the omnipresence of dy eye upon dese dy collard children bowed upon de knucklebone dis night. Take a solemn peep upon us, and let a beep o' light in. Dou knowest what dese, dy poor darkies, need. Dere be Sam, dere be Jerry, and dere be Pompey. Dey are in dere sins, dat's what I reckon. Help d'era to git up and git dem from de wilderness of sin, and come into de clearing of salvation. Take a solemn peep, also, upon de darkies in de oder cabin, who fiddle and where de bombastic toe, while dy servant fulminates words to dee. And, bress dy humble servant now supplicating dee in behalf of dese benighted darkies. It behooves dee to dig deep and sound in de very bottom of his heart. May dere be nary blimmage between myself and my Saviour. In de language of de mighty Washington, dis world is a fleetin' show. To-day we are alive and hoppin' round like grasshoppers, to-morrow de sickle of death cuts us down and spreads us out like grass in hay time. On every side dou knowest, 0 Lord, is de evidence of de dislocation and destruction of de human family. Dere be fighting among one anoder and natural disease. But we die to live again, either as saints or evil spirits. Dese discussions 'bout doctrine election before ordination, perfection and such like, confuse de intelligence of both black men and white. Many dere will be with slick countenances, white collars and fine clothes who will find de gates shut against dem, while de blind old woman, hobbling on crutches, she go straight in. Amen.'
