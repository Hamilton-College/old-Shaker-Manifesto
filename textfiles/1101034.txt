Jane D. Knight Departed from her home at Mt. Lebanon, to heavenly spheres, Dec. 16,1880, Jane D. Knight , aged 75 years. This good sister was the daughter of one who was prominent in many of the leading reforms of the world. At the time of her decease there was issued by Weed, Parsons &amp; Co., of Albany, N. Y., a little book written by her, entitled, 'Events Touching Various Reforms,' and which, for its size, is a spirited and interesting treatise â€” espe- cially to the Quaker fraternity and our own.
