THE HONEY BEES' SONG What the Honey Bee sings to the Children. I am a honey bee, Buzzing away, Over the blossoms, The long summer day, Now in the lily's cup, Drinking my fill, Now where the roses bloom Under the hill. Gayly we fly My fellows and I, Seeking the honey our hives to supply. Up in'the morning— No laggards are we— Skimming the clover topsj Eipe for the bee, Waking the flowers At dawning of day, Ere the bright sun Kiss the dew drops away. • Merrily singing, Busily winging Back to the hive with the store we are bringing. No idle moments Have we through the day, No time to squander In sleep or in play, Summer is flying, And we must be sure, Food for the winter At once to secure. Bees in a hive Are up and alive— Lazy folks can never prosper or thrive. Awake, little mortals, No harvest for those Who waste their best hours In slothful repose. Come out—to the morning All bright things belong— And listen awhile To the honey bee's song. Merrily singing, Busily winging, Industry ever its own reward bringing. Anon.
