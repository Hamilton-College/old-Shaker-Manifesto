WELCOME. Receive ye a welcome. A loud welcome cheer Tis your Father who greets you and your Mother is near. Dear one, we will meet you where the waters divide At the day's brighest sunset, or the fair eventide. O lay down the oar let our barque smoothly glide O'er the beautiful stream to the blest Eden side. O lay down the oar and we safely shall ride To the mansions of rest on the sweet Eden side. ï¿½'Faithful servaiit well done,' the conquest 13 o'er Your work is perfected on this earthly shore, Come join in the chorus with angels replete. You're welcome, thrice welcome, the heavens to meet. O lay down the oar and with us abide In the haven of bliss on the sweet Eden side. O lay down the oar no ill can betide, 'Tis comfort and rest on the fair Eden side.
