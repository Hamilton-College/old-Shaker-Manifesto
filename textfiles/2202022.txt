Sabbathday Lake, Me. Jan. 1892. At Christmas time there were six Brethren and four Sisters sick with La Grippe though it came in a lighter form than two years previous. Those who were the sickest were confined about a week. But all this did not hinder us from having our Christmas festival. In the evening at 7 o'clock the bell called all who were able into the meeting room. The Committee of Arrangements had all things in readiness. In the floor was a beautiful fir tree lighted with wax candles and its branches laden with tokens of love for each Brother and Sister, not one forgotten. We also had recitations from the school children and a spiritual as well as temporal blessing was enjoyed by all present. Thus far the winter has been very mild. Sabbathday Lake remained open until the night of the sixth, when a cold wave froze it over and brought a slight snow-storm, which covered the bare ground making it white and clean. As it now appears we are likely to have a light ice harvest, but it may be that February will be favorable and bring us all the cold weather we shall need. In closing we send a loving greeting to all our Brethren and Sisters. A. S. C. ness. May 12th. 1851, he assumed the office of presiding Minister of Society, acting in said capacity till the Ministerial order dissolved, which was in the year 1859. Again he was elected to spiritual burden, officiating as novitiate Elder at the West Family and many years found him serving in that capacity always striving for the greatest good. He would frequently say to the children when meeting them in a group. 'Be good children, you are all mine, you are my interest and treasure.' N'ow that he has gone from our vision we still have his goodness before us, a monument reared to his memory that time can never efface. G. D. G.
