Conceding to make the argument clear... [written for the manifesto.] iiAnd all that believed ivere together and had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, as every man had need.' Acts, ii., 44, 45. 'William Perkins. Conceding to make the argumeut clear, the plenary inspiration of the gospel, there is inference irresistible, that the above history directly from the Lord, was written to show the purest fruits of Christianity. Could anything be of higher obligation upon the disciples of Christ ? The condign punishment inflicted upon Ananias and Sapphira for seeking to escape this obligation is a solemn confirmation of the Christian's duty and privilege of putting all their goods in common. True as the entire gospel system is voluntary, contrasting with the violent impositions of a selfish world, so is this its unselfish, noblest deportment. It is not too much to say, that the leading trait in the life of Christ was self-denial, to livt for the salvation aud ultimate felicity of others. All manner of vanity, pride, silly and hurtful fashions, slavery, caste and war were utterly repudiated; while meekness, kindness, generosity aud peace were enjoined by precept and example. But the marvel confronts us, that the more leading and popular churches in the world utterly ignore the purer practical injunctions of the gospel they profess and cling to absurd, and we must add, demoralizing dogmas. Hence is the gospel light obscured under a bushel, and our race unreformed and unredeemed. Save in the Quakers and Shakers, violence, bloodshed, slavery,� 'the sum of all villainies,' four tedious years of intestine war, slaughtering a million of our citizens prevailed, and every so-called Christian church participated. Sadly marvelous, that the ungodly, the so-called infidels are fouud in this wretched conduct! But as professed followers of Christ are seen in the same line, the marvel seems enhanced beyond solution; the single orthodox dogma of total depravity it may prove, while others are sadly discredited. Regeneration by the Holy Ghost, sauctification aud final perseverance of God's elect saints get but little support. If by their fruits we are to know them, then evidently the least we have to do with such dogmas the better. By forsaking all for the Believer's communistic life, a leading passage in the gospel is exemplified. Matt, xix., 29. Forsaking' goods and sundering earthly ties, we are promised more,� a hundred fold and eternal life. Believers, though persecuted and their property often destroyed, have still by their steadfast industry and economy, acquired better homes, more brethren and sisters and spiritual enjoyments. The stain of oppression, slavery, caste and bloody war is fouud nowhere among them. Instead, they enjoy the luxury of a clean conscience and the firm hope on the absolute promise of eternal life.
