COMMUNISTIC The attempt of Thomas Hughes, of Rugby fame, to establish a grand communistic settlement in Tennessee is meeting cordial sympathy and hopeful anticipations. This communistic relation is one of the features of a genuine, brotherly, Christian love. Even though this feature may be inferior to other features of genuine Christianity, it is none the less essential in making men and women of Christ. In the selfish relations of ordinary life, marriage, private property, etc., there is a greed for ease and comforts — a strife for the most and the best for me and mine — that occasions a war of households which extends to a war of nations. All wars have their origin in the strife for more than an unselfish part of the lands or enjoyments which should be universally enjoyed and equally so. Hence, we glory in this new attempt at organizing a better, truer brotherhood than commonly exists.
