PREACH THE WORD WHEN Paul through his interest for the gospel, gave this charge to Timothy,ï¿½'Preach the Word,' he knew quite well the necessity of the constant presentation of the testimony of righteousness. Paul was himself an active worker in the cause of Christ and had been earnestly contending for the faith as it was delivered to the saints. Preaching the word was a manifestation of the life of the church. It gave the best evidence that living witnesses were still unflinchingly engaged in diffusing light from God, and in establishing a kingdom of peace among men. They had already learned the fact, that 'Faith comes by hearing,' and that faith in God is essential for those who would walk successfully in that life which the divine Teacher so clearly illustrated. A wave of thought from the same source pleasantly passed over the consecrated home of the dear friends of Mt. Lebanon and they cheerfully responded. Possibly the Believers had been reading the charge that was given to Timothy, and as they read they acted upon the force of its inspiration and kindly and lovingly carried the word of God into the presence of those who listened with pleasure. It was the one visit of a century, and yet its influence for good may extend over the space of another century. If in the good providence of God, a multiplied interest should be extended and the hymns and psalms and words of Christian kindness be sung or spoken, who can say what the spiritual outcome of it may be to the city and to the individual listeners. 'God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform.' Others may take heart and become interested in gathering the latent good that is in our communal homes and present it as a token of joy that now is, as well as of that eternal treasure which is to come. As we enter into the fruitfulness of the work of Christ, we shall be inclined to exalt the Lord our God, and with no uncertain sound proclaim, 'Behold, now is the accepted time ; now is the day of salvation,' instead of looking into the distant future for what should be at our own door. The good Book is emphatic on this subject, and awards the blessing to those who give, in preference to those who receive, and establishes the progressive life of the race of man. Give as God gives. He sends his rain upon the lands of the just and the unjust. He makes his sun to shine upon the evil as upon the good. 'Go ye into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye receive.' And just here comes the necessity of giving information, as best 88 THE MANIFESTO. we may, where the vineyard of the Lord may be found. 'Seek and ye shall find.' It is beyond the strait gate and on either side of the King's highway. It is where God has established his name for righteousness. Where good seed is sown that will bring forth some thirty, some sixty and some an hundred fold. Where good vines are planted and are known, without doubt, that they will yield abundant good fruit. Laborers are already there and actively engaged in their allotted work of redeeming the world from sin, and resting assured that they shall receive a full reward for all their labors. There may be some who are yet standing idle, or are not engaged in any profitable work. These need to be better informed. The Lord's vineyard under the care of his laborers should be a beautiful place, and the workmen should be interested in its protection and prosperity. Those who work far a day and are expecting the compensation of one or two pennies, may do more or less good for God and his people. To be able to work for God and the good of humanity, even for one day will not fail to bring its reward, but a faithful continuance in well-doing is the only safe road to final success. To stand idle, whether in the vineyard or on the corners of the streets, is a clear representation of a class of minds that are quite alike in their interests. Called of God for active work in the establishing of righteousness among men, it is sad that so many grow lukewarm, as did the church of Laodicea, and even with greater light and more extended privileges, can not otherwise than meet a corresponding fate. As God is good, so all that flows from that source must bear the impress of his goodness. No class of people can absorb the whole. All are finite and all are quite sure that there may be more or less iniquity in the birth or that has reached the soul since that date. It is an inheritance that we are forced to accept without qualification. To overcome this inheritance in part or to a fullness, is the effort of every man and woman who appreciates a better state of society while on the earth. It is not that all men should see alike or believe alike, unless they are specially organized for that purpose, but that all who love righteousness and hate iniquity, should work in the interest of that which will make this earth a more pleasant dwelling place for men and women. And what of our own religious profession ? We know that it is an exalted work; that it is sacred, and we as readily say, it is of God. It is clearly presented to the world for inspection. If we are as faithful as the profession demands, we may possibly hear the voice of the good angels as they sing, 'well done ;' while on the other hand if unfaithful to the light which God has given, we are quite sure of the unpleasant result.
