Sanitary. The strong animals that do the world's work... The strong animals that do the world's workthe elephant, horse, mule, ox etc., eat only vegetables. No one thinks of f eeding them flesh to add to their strength or fleetness. No wolf or other predatory animal can catch a deer, antelope, caribou or moose on a fair run, but by stealth, sly cunning, watching and springing or hunting in packswhere the fugitive doubles an his tracks and they cut across. So of the hounds and hare. A. O'Leary, M. D. in Human Nature. Bread and fruits... Bread and fruits, in the larger sense of the term, contain all the essentials of a correct human diet, whether for flesh, blood, brain or bones. Unripe fruit proves more or less injurious to every one. Currants, gooseberries and apples gathered before they are half ripe and stewed or made into pies, are common. These cooked fruits contain all the noxious ingredients that the raw ones do. The sun in the process of ripening may change them to healthy ingredients, but cooking does not and can not do it. In this way a world of unripe fruit, so to say, is eaten and a world of disease and premature death is the consequence. Dr. Alcott.
