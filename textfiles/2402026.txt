Shaker Station, Conn. South Family. Jan. 1894. The dawn of the New Year has already appeared and with it hopes and anticipations for the future. I desire to render praise to the giver of every good and perfect gift, for that I have, and all I am, and all that I may hope to be. There are many external hindex*ances that conspire to arrest our progress in the higher life, and we might well despair of perfection in time, were we left alone in the conflict. But our minds may be preserved by the holy influences of the Divine Spirit. My heart is in sympathy with the Apostle who found evil present when most intent upon good. I earnestly desire a mental apprehension, quick to discern the things of highest moment, and bow before the mercy-seat for a renewing grace to descend in my hour of need. Is not every effort for success a matter of deepest concern? There is no gathering tiie harvest and sitting down to rest; no time to remit labor until the power of watching is removed. In no department of human effort is assistance more devoutly pledged by the great Helper than in our incessant attempt to pain the victory over our inbred foes. To this end let us carefully watch, and humbly pray. There is but little of interest to mention. The wood is being sawed and put into sheds. All the old apple trees are beingcut down and cleared away to make room for a better selection of fruit. There has been little snow as yet; the weather is mild and spring-like, although for health cold weather at this season of the year is preferable. Health prevails in our Society which is a great bleessing. Maria Witham.
