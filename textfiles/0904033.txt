To Purify Oil To make the oil pure, take a good sized bullet or other piece of lead which has a thick coating of lead rust, cut it up fine, put it into the oil, and let it stand for two weeks. This causes the acid to settle, and it then resembles milk at the bottom. Now pour off the top, and your oil is pure. Common clock oil can be treated in this manner and made better than some watch oil.
