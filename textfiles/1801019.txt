Remarks —It is very true that the several classes of religionists look upon things very differently, and probably will never see eye to eye till they become of one faith and one baptism. How any teacher of a religious class can illustrate this remarkable interview between Jesus and the young man, without including the whole story, and make it consistent with itself, is to us a puzzle. The young man sustained a good moral character, and Jesus accepted him so far, and the text says, ' loved him.' He was also in possession of some wealth,—'selfishproperty,'—and unless he consscrated this to the Lord, he could not become a Christian. Jesus, evidently, wanted him to become a dis- ciple, but with all his uprightness, according to the Mosaic law, Jesus says to him, One thing thou lackest, 'Go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast [houses or lands, every- thing you own,] and give to the poor, theu come, take up the cross, and follow me.' It is no wonder that the young man went away filled with sorrow To give away all his earthly possessions, would reduce him to poverty and yet so long as he retained it he could not be a follower of Christ.
