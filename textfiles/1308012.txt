SYMPATHY MARY WHITCHER. Human sympathy, what is it? Just a passing thought or word? Or an inbred true compassion Welling up mankind toward? If the stream hath not a fountain, Thoughts and feelings ebb and flow While the constant love and action, Very few are blest to know, Then true sympathy is god-like, Shining forth as doth the sun, Stationed in the heart or center, Giving warmth to every one. Who inherits hath a blessing, Who hath earned it, greater gain But without it we're possessing Little worth the Christian name. Canterbury, N. H.
