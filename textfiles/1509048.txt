THE GOOD OLD WINTERS In 401, the Black Sea was entirely frozen over. In 7GS, not only the Black Sea, but the Straits of Dardanelles were frozen over, and, in some places the snow rose fifty feet high. In 822, the great rivers of Europe�the Danube, the Elbe and others were so hard frozen as to bear heavy wagons for a month. In 860, the Adriatic was frozen. In 991, everything was frozen, the crops totally failed, and famine and pestilence closed the year. In 1067, most of the travelers in Germany were frozen to death on the roads. In 1134, the Po was frozen from Cremona to the sea; the wine sacks were burst, and the trees split, by the action of the frost, with immense noise. In 1236, the Danube was frozen to the bottom, and remained long in that state. In 1816 the crops wholly failed in Germany. Wheat, which some years before sold at 6s. per quarter, rose to �2. In 1308, the crops failed in Scotland, and such a famine ensued that the poor were reduced to feed on grass, and many perished miserably in the fields. The successive winters of 1432, 3, and 4, were uncommonly severe. In 1363 the wine distributed to the soldiers, was cut with hatchets. In 1683, it was excessively cold. Most of the hollys were killed, coaches drove along the Thames, the ice of which was 11 inches thick. In 1809, occurred the cold winter; the frost penetrated the earth three yards into the ground. In 171G booths were erected on the Thames. In 1744, and 1745, the strongest ale in England, exposed to the air, was covered, in less than fifteen Biinutes, with ice an eighth of an inch thick. In 1809, and again in 1812, the winters were remarkably cold. In 1814, there was a fair on the frozen Thames. Hunts Merchants Magazine.
