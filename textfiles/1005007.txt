THE SPRING OF LIFE HORTENSE G. HOOSER Blessed season ! spring is coming— See the shrubs and flowers all blooming, Bees and insects sweetly humming/ Welcome to the pleasant May. All the trees and forests showing, Nature in her beauties growing ; Streams and rivulets merrily flowing, Down and onward to the sea. Youth, the spring-time of the human, Bud and flower of man and woman, With the seasons are forthcoming, As the hoary heads decay. Youth matured soon take their station, Guide the helm in every nation, Bone and Sinew of creation, But they quickly pass away. The son of course succeeds the Father, The daughter too, survives the Mother, And so races the wide world over, Rise, flourish and decay. This is the law throughout creation, With animals and vegetation; With individuals and with nations They rise, flourish and decay. O'er the broad land wealth is abounding, Food in the valleys, on the mountains, Thro' the air and 'mid the fountains, Life sustaining gifts we share. Let all intelligence and nature, Adore their God, the great Creator, Who thus provides for every creature, Whether in water, earth or air. When mother earth receives her children, Back to the dust whence they were given, The spirit reascends to heaven— To regions where there's no decay. Celestial bands of shining hosts, Give welcome, when they've safely crossed The stream of time.whose waves have tossed Them on the shores of endless day. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
