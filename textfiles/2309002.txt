COMMENTS ON ''IMMORTALIZED.' In 'The Flaming Sword' of July loth 1893, there is an article entitled; ^Immortalized,' which is so singularly narrow and unspiritual when compared with the magnificence and depth of our soul-saving faith, that it would invite some remarks even if its conclusions concerning Mother Ann were correct and acceptable. If we discard old theologies, why should W2 take the silken thread of truth and tangle it up into a new snarl or snare. Ages and ages of the past have left no trace of their history and fameï¿½well, it never was the object of a great soul. Jesus through the eternal truth that he lived reached glorified immortality. We have reason to believe that his body was not corrupted by disease, nor by generation, and, as far as our requirements extend that would be all the immaculate flesh which we could see any use in; as to the 'personality, name, form and function of the mangod that stood forth from the grave,' they have as little bearing on the soul's travel as the Father, Son and Holy Ghost doctrine has. There is obvious inconsistancy in the statement, that Jesus showed the world a 'new and living way, by having attained to the knowledge and possibility of dematerializing his body and converting it to spirit,' for then it could not be a tangible, material form as declared ; or, if through the perfection of his character he rendered his flesh immortal either pure or indestructable. What became of it after it appeared? for 'flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God' however transcendently immaculate, because they are of substance and weight, therefore could not share the throne. In the waters of repentance, the soul may be cleansed from the corruptions that are in the world through lust; and for the external, there are several methods by which fetid organism corruption is overcome or stayed. Embalming, freezing, potrifymg etc., will keep it from the old dead way, namely, the corruption of the body. It is a curious fact that no ethics or religion have as yet been able to bring the body to the perfection that is produced by the science of the pugilists. It is veritable nonsense to speak of one having received an illumination of immortal thoughts while his body, brain and surroundings are undergoing the disintegration which is but a natural process of decay? then alas, for our inspiration and aspiration ! But nay, is it not far more in accordance with the general plan that our earthly form, like all other things which have served their use, shall go to the elements that made and unmade them? Whoever is instructed in and lives the life of the heavens to which we look, will surely be welcomed by their intelligent hosts whether he believe that God is man, that the son of man is the Son of God, and all the rest about the God-head bodily, or, that he thinks all creeds are non-essentials or even rubbish. While we believe that all souls are immortal we would not think that any are celestially immortalized that merely overcame corruption or depravity ; purity and holiness must be added and then perfected in the fear, which is the sacred love of God. The soul THE MANIFESTO. 205 that succumbs to corruption or bin has not yet attained to divine immortal life. The generative spirit world feeds and perpetuates the life of the flesh, often grossly, even the angels of its many spheres impart the same influence in a refined way, just as the festering pool sends up its lovely white but poisonous vapor. What kind of contracted, 'angelic heavens' are they, 'whose central and foundational principle is that the Son of God was glorified in his humanity,' and that they could not 'tolerate the sphere of any person who denied the Divinity of the Lord whom they confessed the Son of God and the divine human;' that intolerance has the color of the blueness of the blue creed. Such heavens ought to pass away by the death and closure of their cycle. No broad minded soul would wish to be admitted into any of them; for their angels in order to progress have need of being scattered among the noble ones on earth, who have overcome corruption and conquered in all its phases the nature that produced its loathsomeness; such are capable of teaching that class of angels not to minister to mortal flesh. If we were going to seek for embodiments or prototypes of Ann Lee, we would not begin with the mother of Ephraim, who was 'joined to his idols,' nor close with the gentle Mary, who watched over and sympathized with her son through his mission of trust and suffering. The march of time developed more advanced women than were those. Mother Ann, by her soul labors and with the derrick of her testimonies, tore out the great root of evil; trunk, branches, blossoms and fruit were cast into the flames never to be resuscitated, never to be made immaculate, but to be burned. She flung up the earth in all directions, and searched for every fibre which might again send forth the growth of that Upas tree ; thus clearing the soil for the germs of the immortal. While she taught what constitutes that life most lucidly and with the simplicity of her own genuine goodness, neither she, nor any of her children, believed that the goal of human aspiration was reached by her or by themselves. How could they while they were encouraged by the ministrations which were the reward of the work that they did, and which their faith still revealed as being before them. What an Olio Incongruous could be published of the various presentations of Ann Lee that have been listened to by the Shakers for the last forty-five years, while they adhered to her instructions and were blessed. She left us, in degree the Immaculate Motherhood which proceeded from the arch celestial, the key stone of which was and is Hatred to the Flesh. That Motherhood has been increased and glorified, it more than meets our souls; no man hath seen it, for it could not manifest, save to souls that travel in the regeneration. Behold it is not connected with the male prophet who is to turn the hearts of the fathers and sons to each other; fathers and daughters are seldom separated in feeling. The Messenger is he (not she) that is to prepare the way before the Lord, who is to come to his temple, in his dreadful day (with whip 206 THE MANIFESTO. of small cords,) and who is to abide his coming? evidently no daughters. He, the Messenger of the Covenant, in whom men delight, 'Behold he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.' That sentence we thought went out of use with Miller's misinterpretation of the spiritual influx that was about to illumine the world. Who saith of Ann she is my Mother and shall perform all my pleasure ; even saying to Jerusalem thou shalt more beautifully be built, and to the temple, thy foundations shall be strengthened, they who have come up out of great tribulation and who still in humility walk in the light of their Immortal Faith.
