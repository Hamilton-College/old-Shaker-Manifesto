GENTLE WORDS. CLARA BUSH. Why not let our words be gentle? Harsh words rudely jar On the feelings of a brother; And to kindly greet each other Would be better far. In the plainest words of converse Music sweet is heard; If in tenderness they're spoken ; But the melody is broken By an angry word. It would show a strength of spirit To let no hard word Fall petulantly from our tongue, And strike the notes to music strung, Making rude discord. We would find it just as easy, In kind tones to speak; Hasty, cruel words are grievous, And too sadly, truly prove us Pitifully weak. Oft a little word, soft spoken, Falling on the ear, Throws a passing ray of gladness O'er the heart darkened with sadness, And dispels the tear. Gentle words ! they cost so little, And such power hold To impart to olhers pleasure, Why not greater make their measure Many thousand fold? It will make our own hearts richer, If we will but give Lavishly to our fellow man, Gentle words whene'er we can, While on earth we live. We are lowly, sinful creatures, Sadly prone to err; 250 THE MANIFESTO. Yet, if we've blindly gone astray And ean make amends to-day, Let us not defer. If one kindred heart we've wounded, By a word unkind, Oh, let us now forgiveness ask, And make it our most willing task The sad wound to bind. There may be less sweet than bitter, In the cup of life ; There may be more thorns than flowers Yet, if unbroken love be ours, We can bear the strife. Kenton, Tenn.
