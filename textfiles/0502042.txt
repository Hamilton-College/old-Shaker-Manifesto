KATIE KING EXPOSED It is said that a young woman personated Katie, when the real Katie was not forthcoming. The Truth Seeker thus discourses: 'It was found she had made her entrance and exit into and from the cabinet by means of a panel or secret drawTer in the partition, and with her artful representations, she had succeeded in ' deceiving the very elect.' The philosopher and close observer, R. D. Owen, had faithfully attended upon Katy's seances, and has he not detailed the whole 'wonderful affair' in the Atlantic Monthly, and characterized the same as the most remarkable representations of spirit power? Now, however, since the fraud is exposed, the good man is compelled to acknowledge himself deceived by dishonest mediums. A lesson is to be learned from all this. If Mr. and Mrs. Holmes have been frauds, it does not prove that all others are. Chaff does not disprove the existence of wheat, and all the lies in the world do not falsify one truth. But so long as money is to be made in the roll of mediums, it is not strange, perhaps, that dishonesty is resorted to. The public must be chary, and not believe too readily all representations made. ' Try the spirits, that ye be not deceived.' ' Words of wisdom, like apples of gold in basins of silver.
