Juvenile. Dear Children:--'Those who have clean hands shall be stronger'... Enfield, Conn., 1889. Dear Children :�'Those who have clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.' Clean hands come only by daily heavenward living. Clean hands and clean hearts are synonymous terms, and without the one the other is impossible. Clean hands�clean hearts ! Do you consider what the words imply? To have clean hands you must live above sinful desires, above selfish strivings and impure thoughts. You must 'keep your record clean,' for clean hands can only be an index of a clean life, a life devoted to holy purposes. Those who have clean hands and pure hearts of shall see God,' and feel his love and protection day by day. Pure hearts and clean hands are acceptable offerings. A sure way to love purity is to practice it. Think not to gain clean hands without selfdenying struggles; you must have 'deeds good and true,' not dream them; you must have the courage to resist temptation, as comparatively few do have. 'Pray God that your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless.'' It is well to pray, but better still to watch and work and to remember that 'God helps those who help themselves.' Good deeds are sincere prayers. Let your constant prayer be, 'Give me a blameless body,' and your daily endeavor be to use those means that will give answer to your petition. 'Beautiful hands are those that do, Work that is virtuous and true.' And clean hands, or they could never be beautiful, could never 'do work that is virtuous and true.' Clean hands forever! Corning to angelic manhood and womanhood un.-tained by any thought of evil. Oh, glorious hope of heaven, full and joyous evermore ! Thank God for it. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt. Dear Manifesto:--How nice it is to have you brighten... Pleasant Hill, Ky., 1889. Dear Manifesto :�How nice it is to have you brighten our homes every month. You are always welcome here. We little girls hunt out the easy pieces and read them. I live with eight little girls and many happy times we have together. I have not been here long, but I like my Shaker home better than the city where I used to live. I go to Day School and Sunday School. I am trying to improve in both. I like to go to Sunday School very much, we have such good kind teachers who are trying to teach us the right way of life. I pray that we n?ay grow as good and wise as they are, and return their loving kindness, as thsy show to us now. We are having a delightful time this winter, everything is so nice, and we are blest with good kind friends to watch over us. Dear Manifesto, may we ever follow your kind advice which teaches us to put away self and live for others. We thank Brother Daniel for his nice letters and we hope to hear from you both again. With love from all, I close. Thankfully yours Tillie Johnson.
