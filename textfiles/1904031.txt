Dear Manifesto:--How nice it is to have you brighten... Pleasant Hill, Ky., 1889. Dear Manifesto :ï¿½How nice it is to have you brighten our homes every month. You are always welcome here. We little girls hunt out the easy pieces and read them. I live with eight little girls and many happy times we have together. I have not been here long, but I like my Shaker home better than the city where I used to live. I go to Day School and Sunday School. I am trying to improve in both. I like to go to Sunday School very much, we have such good kind teachers who are trying to teach us the right way of life. I pray that we n?ay grow as good and wise as they are, and return their loving kindness, as thsy show to us now. We are having a delightful time this winter, everything is so nice, and we are blest with good kind friends to watch over us. Dear Manifesto, may we ever follow your kind advice which teaches us to put away self and live for others. We thank Brother Daniel for his nice letters and we hope to hear from you both again. With love from all, I close. Thankfully yours Tillie Johnson.
