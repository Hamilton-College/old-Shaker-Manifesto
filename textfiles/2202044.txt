George M. Wickersham George M. Wickersham, at Mount Lebanon, Church, Dec. 25, 1891. Age 80 yrs. He bid farewell to earth to celebrate Christmas with his gospel relation in the Spirit world. No more on earth will he take notes of the weather, Nor state the fall of rain and snow forever; For he has gone where it's supposed to be Calm as sea of glass through all eternity. C. G. R.
