Deaths. Mary Shepard Mary Shepard, at Watervliet, O., Dec. 22, 1891. Age 56 yrs. 11 mo. and 20 days. Sister Mary has been a faithful worker among Believers for fifty years. She came to the fold when she was but six years old and has been a good Sister to the cause. She will be very much missed by all, for we can see her no more. When well, we could see Sister Mary every-where; she was always faithful at her post of duty. H. W. F. George M. Wickersham George M. Wickersham, at Mount Lebanon, Church, Dec. 25, 1891. Age 80 yrs. He bid farewell to earth to celebrate Christmas with his gospel relation in the Spirit world. No more on earth will he take notes of the weather, Nor state the fall of rain and snow forever; For he has gone where it's supposed to be Calm as sea of glass through all eternity. C. G. R.
