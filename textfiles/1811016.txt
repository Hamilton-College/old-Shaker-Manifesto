Personal influence wins as many souls to Christ as eloquent preaching... Personal influence wins as many souls to Christ as eloquent preaching. Here the teacher can do as much as the preacher. Christ did not preach to a great multitude after his resurrection, or show himself to many, but walked for several miles along the Emmaus road with two discouraged disciples. Christ left the crowded streets to address Matthew at the custom house, and turned from the multitude to call Nathaniel from under the fig tree. The great crowd did not get a sermon from Christ the day he paused to use his personal influence with Zacheus in the sycamore tree. The Savior made such use of personal influence as to show how to win souls to the Gospel by it. In this we should copy after him. We, too, can stop a moment by the old well to point some poor woman to the waters of eternal life. We, too, can pause by the roadside to talk to some passing friend about his soul's welfare. The magnetism of personal attention is wonderful in power. Wield it over the children; by it draw your irreligious friends to Christ; try its reviving power with those who never go to church. Consecrate your personal influence to Christ, and then let it, like the great moral magnet it is, draw men and women to the Bedeemer. Christian Union.
