ORIGIN OF CANAAN UPPER FAMILY The Canaan Upper Family commenced its existence by a gathering of eleven persons on what used to be called the Patterson Farm, a little below the North Family in Mount Lebanon. The gathering of the Family took place sixty years ago, in December, 1813, under the care of Dan Higley and Eunice McCarter. The year following, viz., in November, 1814, the Family moved from the Patterson farm to a house called the Mill House near a grist mill about half a mile west of the village of Mount Lebanon. After living in the Mill House seven years, the Family moved on to the farm in Canaan (its present location), called the Peabody Place, May 9,1821, at that time the Family consisted of thirteen brethren and fourteen sisters. But of the twenty-seven persons who moved into Canaan at that time, only four are now living, all of whom have for many years, been members of other families, namely, John Lockwood, Wm. Thrasher, Rufus Ames, and George Curtis. So that fifty-two years have passed since the Upper Family was established in the land of Canaan; its future destiny who can tell ?
