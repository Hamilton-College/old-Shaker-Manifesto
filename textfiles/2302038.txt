Beloved Elder:--Many thanks to you... South Union, Ky. Jan. 3, 1893. Beloved Eldee :ï¿½Many thanks to you for your kind remembrance of your gospel Sisters in the West. We bless the daily efforts in putting forth the life and testimony of all true and faithful Believers. I am interested in reading the Manifesto and in learning the music. From the Sisters in the Office. Lucilla Booker.
