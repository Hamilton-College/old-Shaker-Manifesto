Mount Lebanon, N. Y., Nov. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :—David prayed in this wise : ' 'From my necessities, O Lord, deliver me.' It was short, but pithy. Can we not pray, 'From raising and caring for cattle, O self-denial, please release us !' The cows succeed in manufacturing milk from the vegetables and fruits furnished them. Oleomargarine is manufactured butter, and comes from animal fats of doubtful quality. The cocoanut butter is said to be delicious. Women will yet make as good milk from fruit, as cows do from grass. Great progress is being made in England in hygienic food. Women—noble women—are turning their inventive faculties from devising some new, immodest, health and morals destroying fashionable dress ; to creating new, appetizing and health-sustaining kinds of food, and their preparation for a vegetarian table. Vegetable restaurants (restorers) are now established in England by the hundred, and are all the time increasing. America is a fleshmeat-eating nation. The natives— Indians—lived almost exclusively on wild animals : that is the best form of flesh-food. Good times are coming. In love, F. W. Evans
