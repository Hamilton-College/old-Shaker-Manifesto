Useful man ! Investigator Tins slur is from the Investigator, which is continually illustrating the unchristian worldliness of the clergy ! We say ' useful man,' and mean it—useful, so far, in repeating the example of unworldliness in the Master, Christ, which the clergy are scarcely anywhere noted for. We only wish that the clergy would progress in such ' usefulness,' until they would be to their flocks what Jesus was to his — an unworldly communist; a virgin peacemaker! Wherein is the Christian rea eon why Christians should not ' FOLLOW ' the Lord ? and the especial reason, why Boston ministers, and all others, should not be bright, living examples for the people, in all that pertained to Jesus, the Christ? Ministers, herein is the correct atonement — herein the true resurrection — herein the works, combined with faith, that demonstrate genuine Christianity.
