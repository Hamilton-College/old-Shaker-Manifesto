SWEET CONSOLATION Mary Whitcher . 0 God, nay heavenly father, How can I e'er repine, So truly blest and happy In this, the lot that's mine ! My heart expands anew To praise thee all the day; Again, at eventide, 1 would resume my lay. No urging do I need, To meet thy call of grace ; Permit me only here To earn and hold a place ; Why was I blest of thee, To leave the fallen course Of nature, stained and lost, And so perverse? And what would 1 have been, Hadst thou permitted me, The worldly life, as seen, The best yet known to be? A slave to pride and sin, To passion and to lust; With conscience stirred within, But naught of earth to trust. Long, long would be the road To travel back to theeâ€” My Saviour, and my God, My home of purity. Could I desire all this, To make my song of praise For highest, heavenly bliss, As shared from childhood days? Nay, Father, I am glad, Blest Mother, I rejoice ; Not once the feeling sad, I follow named by choice, And joyful give the whole, In gratitude each day, For blessings to the good, Found in thy narrow way.
