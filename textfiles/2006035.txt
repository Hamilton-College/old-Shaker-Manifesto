We should keep in the strait path of the Christian traveler, and turn not to the right nor to the left, for if we do we get very far away. There are many roads and paths that are joined on each side by others. They each have a name They are disobedience, falsehood, selfishness, pride, unthankfulness, neglect of prayer, and many others. When we get out of the strait path, we have to go back. But how? By a full confession of sin and being sorry for it. We must turn from evil, sinful ways to good ones. But is it easy? Nay, it is only gained by great effort. My motto should then be, 'If at first you don't succeed, try, try again ' If we keep on trying we will at last gain the victory over sin. Hancock, Mass. Clara Wilmarth.
