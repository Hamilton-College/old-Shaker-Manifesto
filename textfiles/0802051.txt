Selected Self-Sacrifice. Down, selfish thoughts that rise, And whisper to my soul, Keep back, O Satan of my life, You shall not have control. O, what am I, I ask, All pleasant things to claim? I bow my head to kiss the rod, And blush for very shame. A little thing from God, Placed here to do His will, To serve my fellows while I may, My mission to fulfil. What if Desire allure My steps to walk 'mid flowers, If duty calls me otherwheres I leave her charmed bowers. Where Pain and Sorrow call, My feet must not be slow, Though into laughing crowds of joy They much prefer to go. Not lost in pleasant dreams, And castles in the air; 'Tis real life demands my aid, With homes of grief and care. Ambition holds her cards To charm my human eyes, But blind to them I still must choose, Humble Self-sacrifice. Content if but at last, At setting of life's sun, I slip from darkness into light To hear the sweet 'Well done.' Ellen O. Peck [In The Cottage Hearth.]
