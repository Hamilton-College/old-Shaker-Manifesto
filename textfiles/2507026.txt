The Herald of Glad Tidings The Herald of Glad Tidings is edited by Ulyssus G. Morrow. It is said to be 'strictly unsectarian, and illustrates God's purpose of the ages, and objects, time and manner of the second advent.'. As this number of the paper seems to be wholly in the interest of Roresbanity, we think it must belong to that order of Christians.
