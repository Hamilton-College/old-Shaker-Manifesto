Jesus of Nazareth as a Higher Critic Jesus of Nazareth as a Higher Critic, by H. L. Hastings. This little book is No. 38 of The Anti-Infl lei Library. A few lines from the body of this book will speak for itself. 'The man Christ Jesus was in a position to speak impartially concerning these matters. He was neither a Priest nor a Levite and did not subsist upon the tithes and sufferings of the people tind mi had no pecuniary interests in the national religion, tie was not a Scribe nor a Lawyer, nor was he a theological professor, bound by his position, his vows, or his salary to study the law and defend and proclaim it however he might doubt its authority. He was untrammeled by creeds, concessions, and sectarian bonds. He was neither a Pharisee, Saddueee, an Essene or a Heioiiian. He was of royal lineage, but he laid no claim to authority on that acconnt. He was a plain, working man; his hands ministered to his necessities. He was able and willing to earn his living, and coultl afford to tell the truth.' Pab. at 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
