The Shaker, TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN Be Lawful.—If leaders do not regard this, who can they expect will do so ? A Shaker eldership is a place of care, example, practical wisdom, and deep, parental solicitude; not one of nere authority, right or wrong ; but of neekness, charity, long forbeai'ance. True, wise elders drown differences of brethren, with their sunshine, wisdom and love. Be Prudent.—If those who are first in care of temporal things are not the greatest servants unto prudence, who can they expect will be? The doctrine of 'Don't do as I do, but as I say or wish,' never worked any better among the Shakers than elsewhere. An honest trustee will be first in prudence, first in the comforts, and first in the burdens of the heart, of his brethren. A real honest Shaker trustee truly feels and acts like the poorest man or woman in the commune. How is this? Be Pure.—If, by our words or deeds, we are not so, do we not belie our profession ? and do we not testify against mere profession, without practice? Be Peaceable.—This follows as a matter of course ; and means a peace wrought by righteous elders, trustees, and golden-rule-loving brethren and sisters. It does not mean the consequences of inequality, insult, tyranny, and subjugation—where these are, he who preaches peace, preaches in vain. Be Brethren.—All the trouble that can arise, after fully consecrating one's self to the fundamental principles of Shakerism, comes from the neglect of compliance with the 'golden rule.' Would it not be a healthy question for us all to ask ourselves: ' How would we bear our conduct, if practiced on us by others, as we exercise it on others ourselves?'
