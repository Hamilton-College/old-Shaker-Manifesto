Dear Lena;—As I have a little leisure and am sitting quite alone waiting for you to join me, I thought I would pencil a few lines to you. Just think! I have been with believers, seven years next January, and I never saw Elder Henry, before. I enjoyed the visit very much. I think we should be very grateful for this kind remembrance. I wish we cotild have had a chance to tell him all about the picnic we had with our.Shirley friends. Do you not think he would like to have beard about it? What a good time we had. I wish the day had been twice, as long. Dear sister, I have been thinking while here, how many children there are who would like the privilege that I am enjoying. O I wish that more children were blessed with such a good home, surrounded with so many kind friends, to watch over and to instruct them.' How thankful I ought to be. It is my prayer that I may realize the blessings that are bestowed upon me. I love my home and my friends, and I will try to do so well that they will all love me. With much love I bid you good bye, Rosie--Age, 13.
