HOME. ELLA E. WINSHIP. Most persons have read, no doubt, many articles upon the subject of Home. Some describing its outward adornings, others its social and mental enjoyments, and still others its moral influence, its restraint and protection from evil. The burden of this article is the true spiritual home ; by which is meant neither locality, circumstances, nor surroundings. It is nothing less than a home in the eternal principles of truth and righteousness; a perfect affinity with godliness ; a spirit so firmly established on the rock of truth that it would be at home nowhere else ! Should it stray never so little, there would be no rest, no contentment, until the wanderer should return. How many of us, when thinking of Home, or when singing beautiful songs upon the subject, think merely of our outward surroundings and associations ? How many when we sing, '; I am on my journey to that beautiful land, ' have in view only a future home, a clime beyond the grave ? There is a more exalted meaning than either of these, another conception of a spirit home. Many individuals may dwell upon the same bit of consecrated soil, and yet their spirits may not dwell together. The habitual frame of mind, the aspirations, the faith, the trust, in short, the virtues or vices of an individual constitutes the spirit's home. It is sometimes a startling question,�wheredo our spirits dwell?�and how shall we answer it? Is it in the worldly element, in the realm of selfishness, weakness, and sin, or is it in the principles of uprightness, purity, and holiness? That is a glorious land in which to dwell, where vices, temptations and: weaknesses, will be regarded as foreigners and trespassers ; and the soul whose home is there would feel like a stranger who had lost his way, if lie should once leave its blessed borders. Let us dear young friends, having found our Spirit Home, our ' Holy Land,' continue life's journey with gladness and zeal, our spirits securely resting in eternal principles ; and may our friends both seen and unseen, always find us at home.
