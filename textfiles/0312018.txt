Good resolutions are safeguards to the soul... Good resolutions are safeguards to the soul â€” God's blessings are limitless as the twink- ling lights that spangle the vast arch above, or the sands of the sea. Every thing in na- ture's realm, evinces an overruling supernatural power. The smallest insect his goodness shares. The birds carrol their sweetest notes to Him who gave them life, swelling their little throats to the fullest extent, reminding us of the musical fullness of the spheres. And the running streamlet, as it ripples over hill and dale, sings a merry song; it may be shallow at its source, but it finds its way to rivers and lakes, and its terminus is the deep blue sea. Every drop of this vast body of water contains animal life ; and if the tiny aquatics were asked why they were so lively, they would reply, in their language, ' Because we have nothing but water to drink.' Would that many human beings might reply in the same language who are now wedded to the wine cup, or bound in the demoniac chains of Alcohol! Alas, that man who was made to govern himself, and rule over the lower orders of animal life, sinks himself below the beasts that perish! 0 that intemperance might flee the land. Margaret C.
