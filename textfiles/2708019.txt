'Blood being made from the assimilation of food, it is, therefore, to food itself we must primarily look for the origin of these earthly deposits. Besides providing the requisite elements of nutrition, food contains calcareous salts, which, upon being deposited in the arteries, veins and capillaries become the approximate cause of ossification and old age.' 'The action of distilled water as a beverage is briefly as follows: First, its absorption into the blood is rapid; second, it keeps soluble those salts already existing in the blood, thereby precluding their undue deposit; third, it facilitates in a markt degree their elimination by means of excretion. After middle life a daily use of distilled water is highly beneficial to those desirous of retarding old age, and it is also a useful adjunct for averting stone in the bladder and kidneys.' Distilled water, diluted phosphoric acid, glycerine and some of the aromatics constitute a most delicious drinkï¿½a very nectar. And this nectar, drank freely, tends to remove calcareous deposits, thus prolonging human life. Temple of Health. FOODS FOR THE AGED. Some foods contain too much calcareous substance for health; but fruits, nuts, fish, venison and wild game contain only a very trifle of these calcereous salts and earthly particles, and are, therefore, very healthy for the aged. Fruits and distilled water are specifics for ossific depositions. A French physician observes That man begins in a gelatinous and ends in ah osseous condition.....In the human body water forms TO per cent, of its aggregate weight; in fact there is not a single tissue which does not contain water as a necessary ingredient. Now water holds certain salts in solution, which become more or less deposited, notwithstanding the large proportion eliminated through the secretions. Nevertheless it is only a matter of time before these minute particles deposited by the blood have a markt effect in causing the stiffness and aridity of advancing life. The reason why in early life the deposits of earthly salts are so infinitesimal is simply because they have not had time to accumulate. 'It is the old kitchen boiler which is found full of incrustations, not the new one, time not having been sufficient for their deposit. M. LeCann proved by analysis that human blood contains compounds of lime, magnesia and iron, averaging 2. lin every 1.000 parts. This clearly demonstrates that in the blood itself are contained the earth salts, which gradually become deposited in the system.'
