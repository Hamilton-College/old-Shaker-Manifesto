THANKS, FRIENDS! Every one will be or ought to be pleased to know that some kind friends are responding to the request for some simple aid in the wider circulation of The Manifesto. Thanks for such friends, and may they increase. For one dollar, we will circulate one hundred copies to new readers. One such writes us from Florida, thus glowingly: 'I have just received your Manifesto; it must be God sent it; I never saw such a paper before!' etc. Who would be more philanthropic than usual, and lend us the aid ?
