RENOVATION. Catherine Allen. In the wondrous shadowings of the soul of nature which we behold in the ever varying beauties of creation, who can fail to recognize the gifts of a be � neficent Creator? And who can fail to be admonished when considering how unfavorably compare the conditions of human society, intended as the crowning of all God's handiwork? Nothing is left unmarred which mankind has power to molest. But this will not always be. Humanity has made steady advance, and will continue to progress to still higher summits of righteousness. Mighty earthquakes will shake to their foundations, the now existing structures of society. The black impending clouds of conflict, and the tremendous agitation of the elements which is now being felt over the whole civilized world, are but premonitions oi' those upheavals and overturnings, which must be realized before governments can be so organized as to cause the land to become birthright iuheritance to every human being, and to annihilate the custom of usury, and render all monopolies impossible. The acknowledgement of a God is the central idea of all government, and before these changes can be wrought, the Motherhood in D^ity must be more generally recognized ; then, as man has long sought to frame earthly institutions on his idea of an exclusively masculine God, so, the dual,�parental idea in the God-head, which so readily appeals to both the intellect and affections, will bear a potent influence in the formation of correct, civil governments, social and educational systems, in which woman will act her noble part, co-operating with man, in the various offices of Church and kState. But, for her to successfully attain and fill these positions, will involve a thorough reconstruction of the educational systems for both males and females. The causes of the terrible commotions by which society is being convulsed, are at once traceable to that inborn sentimeut which asserts itself as never before ;�that 'All men are created free and equal;'�the innate love of liberty and justice which long has smouldered, now bursting into flame, as the breezes astir from a higher world, find access to those who have long dwelt in the dark caverns of ignorance and oppression. The warming sunbeams which fall upon the frozen earth, unsealing her fountains, and quickening into growth the myriad forms of life which weave the beauteous robes of spring, also bring the wild beasts from their lairs, the serpents from their lurking places, and renew to activity all those lower forms of life which are but expressions of corresponding, undeveloped and inharmonious conditions in humanity, as are also the fierce havoc of the elements in earthquake, tornado, and other merciless destruction by land and sea; and when, after a long period of seeming inertia, the finger of an all-wise Providence points to the time on that dial-plate which marks the progress of cycles, when the vernal spring of a new era shall gladden the earth, those rays of celestial radiance which act upon the diviner nature in man, will also wake to life all the lower antagonistic forces of his being. While present conditions of society fulfill almost identically many of the ancient prophecies, to-day the over-arching sky is aglow with inspiration which gleams through the rifts of the tempest clouds below. Brave prophet hearts catch its gleams, and in their light behold the grand triumph of truth over error, which shall evolve order from chaos in the establishment of a universal, international government based upon the inherent rights of man, which will secure to every individual, male and fema'e, just representation and recompense for toil. Thus will the whole fabric of society be reconstructed. Civil law will no longer protect capital and tax-labor, nor the idler gi'ow richer while the honest toiler is excluded from the means of existence by the wonderful achievements of science, in labor-saving machinery. None will need suffer from over-work or from the want of interesting aud rational occupation. Inventors, after being liberally rewarded by the government, will see the benefits of their discoveries and improvements redound to the advancement of humanity ; and, like the postal system, the telegraph, telephone, and all public conveyance by land and sea, will be controlled by a government of the people and for the people,�purely democratic. Conditions will then be in every way more favorable to the manifestation of the higher sentiments in humanity, and a much larger proportion than at present, will be ripened for the harvest sickle of the Resurrection Order, removing the necessity for war, famine and pestilence, and unmentionable evils now tolerated for the purpose of regulating population. Therefore, the wild confusion and disintegration so wide spread among all classes and phases of society, rather than discouraging, are the most assuring to- kens that the 'Spirit of the Lord is brooding over the face of the waters.'
