AGGRANDIZEMENT Money is now exactly what mountain promontories over public roads were in old times. The barons fought for them fairly: the strongest and cunningest got them ; then fortified them, and made every one who passed below pay toll. Well, capital now is exactly what crags were then. Men fight fairly (we will, at least, grant so much, though it is more than we ought) for their money; but, once having got it, the fortified millionaire can make every body who passes below pay toll to his million, and build another tower of his moneycastle. And I can tell you, the poor vagrants by the roadside .suffer now quite as much from the bag-baron, as ever they did from the crag-baron. Bags and crags have just the same result on rags. â€” New Aye.
