Rock of rest THE ROCK OF REST. MATTHEW XVI. 18. Tossed on many a wave of doctrine, Restless, weary, ill at ease With beliefs that quiet others, But as vague to me as these; I have done with idly chasing Phantom lights that rise and fall; Drift no more with drifting doctrines — Grown indifferent to them all! Shall I long regret the visions Of a rest so idly woood ? Shall I long go on deploring Creeds, that but opinions proved? Quenched be every weak emotion! Bring my future weal or woe, Weal nor woe shall blight or bless mo — Faith, nor creed, shall move me now! Murmuring thus, there came a whisper From the Friend who knew me best: ' Seek the rock on which I builded: On that rock alone is rest.' Suddenly, with light supernal, Faith, the higher reason, came, And my foot touched base eternal — Benedictions on his name!
