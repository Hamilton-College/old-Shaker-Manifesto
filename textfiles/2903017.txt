In Memory of Sister SOPHRONIA DOLE. By Louise Bussell. Our Mother has crost the dark river, Been called to an eternal rest, And joined with the angels in singing The song of the ransomed, so blest. Like a ripened sheaf, she was ready, Her toils and her labors were o'er; And gladly she heard the sweet summons To rest from all care evermore. She spent a long life in God's service, Was one of the faithful and tried; A pillar of strength, she was ever A soul who all sin had denied. Her words were like balm to the weary, She blest every one in the right, Gave courage and strength to the doubting And bid them to walk in the light. Tl IE MANIFES TO. 45 And now as we tender love's tribute, How brightly her virtues do shine, Inciting us onward ard upward, To joys that are pure and divine. And O, in our hearts is erected, By her life so noble and pure, A monument strong in its structure, For truth is its corner-stone sure. We love thee, and bless thee, dear Mother, For the seed of good thou hast sown; . And for all thy toiling and sowing A harvest for thee has been grown. Go, reap the reward of thy labors: The angels have welcomed thee home, I hear them proclaim the glad tidings, No more on the earth shalt thou roam But ere thou dost enter the portals, Kemember the toilers below, And wave o'er our pathway thy mantle, Thy love and thy goodness bestow. O, help us to live for the gospel, To swerve not from duty's straight line, To carry aloft the bright banner, And work for the cause that's divine. We want to be blest with a fullness, Of goodness, of mercy and love, We plead for a power that is mighty For the strength which comes from above. That we may be true to our calling Be workers in Zion's rich field, Devoting our all to God's service, That our lives rich blessing may yield. Shakers, N. Y.
