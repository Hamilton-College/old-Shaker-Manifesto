Kindness in Handling Horses One very bad habit or practice we observe both in the city and in the country is, that of yelling at horses before cart, wagon, omnibus or buggy, with that of suddenly and violently jerking the reins, supplementing it with sharp shrieks of the voice, provided they make any untoward movementâ€”a habit we deem no less reprehensible than detestable, and one that should be at once corrected and abandoned torever. Gentleness and kindness will be found not only the wiser and better, but the more humane and effective course in accomplishing the end desired.
