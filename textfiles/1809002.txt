PRACTICAL RELIGION. Marion Johnson. In the so-called religious world, there are as many kinds of belief and doctrine, creeds and theories as there are different sects; and the believers in each, claim theirs as the ouly rule and guide of action, by the observance of which, they can find their justification and acceptance with God, and at last, admission into heaven. Among all these varied and oftentimes conflicting theories on a question of such supreme importance to the whole human race, the query would naturally force itself on every reflecting mind, which is the right way ? All cannot be right; each way cannot be the one only way to heaven, for Christ was not divided, neither will his true followers be divided in their faith and principles. We read in the scriptures, ' There shall be one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.' 'Pure and undented religion is to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep ourselves unspotted from the world.' Here is a religion which is practical in all its bearings, and embodies the sum total of our duty to God and man. To be kind, charitable, and merciful to all with whom we have any dealings, and to keep our spirits free from the contaminating influences of worldly elements and principles, would also imply a complete consecration to God, of all our faculties e .A possessions. There is no religion worthy of the name which is not actualized in every-day life, in thought, word and deed. That which is only assumed on the Sabbath, is not a religiou, but a cloak to cover up the sins of the week. There is one criterion by which we can judge unerringly whether we are the true disciples of Christ or not. ''If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.' John, vii., 17. If that is the rulingmotive in the heart, to do the will of God ; and we conscientiously live up to the highest light that shines into the soul; regardless where that light may lead us ; carefully taking up the crosses that may lie in our pathway ; patiently bearing whatever trials or tribulation we may be called to pass through ; counting all things but los&gt;s for the excellency of the knowledge of the will of God ; we shall be assured beyond the possibility of a doubt, that we have found the one only straight and narrow way which leads to the summit of full and final redemption from sinï¿½eternal life. As a believer in the practical Christian life, I have proved it by the experience of more than a quarter of a century, to be the power of God unto salvation, inasmuch as I have lived it out. I know that in the end it will give me complete victory over the very nature of sin, if I continue to square my life by the life of my Savior, taking him as my pattern and guide, bearing the cross which he bore, and living his life of purity and love. Canterbury, N. H.
