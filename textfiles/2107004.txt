At one time Father William Lee called at the shop... At one time Father William Lee called at the shop of a blacksmith to get his horse shod. The blacksmith seemed quite unwilling, as he had other work. Father William then asked the privilege to do it himself, to which the blacksmith reluctantly consented. Father William worked with such dispatch, and so astonished the man that he stood by to look on. When the job was finished, Father asked what he should pay. 'Nothing,' said the man, 'it is sufficient pay to see a man work like that.'
