Give us a breed of walking horses &gt;Give Us a Breed of Walking Horses. What use are fast horses to farmers? Can they put them to work in the plow, harrow, cultivator, roller, reaping-machine, cart, or wagon? No, A storm might arise and the whole crop of hay be ruined, if they had to depend on 2: 40 horses to haul it in. There is but one use that we can see that a farmer might put them to,—sending for a doctor; but as farmers have very little occasion for this professional gentleman, and never get very sick, a slower and surer horse will answer better. Why, then, parade these horses at the head of the lists at agricultural fairs, and give them the biggest premiums? No wonder our practical farmers complain of this, while there is no premium at all for walking horses, which are a thousand times more useful,—we mean to the farmer, and for general agricultural and industrial purposes. Thoroughbred horses have their uses, and we do not de^re to utter a word against them, but many good words in their favor. They, however, must fill their own places, and work-horses theirs ; and neither should be advocated to the exclusion of the other. Both should be recognized according to their value.
