ZION'S WATCHWORD CHARLOTTE BYRDSALL North, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. When evening zephyrs whisper When morn upon us breaketh It is a constant blessing Of shadows of the night, When twilight nearer gathers In brightness or in gloom, We find the toil of Zion From eve to morning light, A scene of holy union These hours well fraught with labor, Bring goodness rich and new, And this is Zion's stronghold, And sheds her mellow light, Still in our hearts hath room, From morn to shades of night; Her mission glad and true. Then in this realm of beauty, And joyous in its mission, We store the fruits of conquest For labor is the watchword We feel the magic spell That stills the world of action, We hail each opening day, Go forth to meet the burdens Within life's treasury, And day and night bring nearer That will redeem the earth, It is religion's power, And bids the day farewell. That throng the pilgrim's way. The ransom of the free. Her glory and her worth.
