A THOUGHT If goodness be beauty, 'tis ours to create ; Through pleasure and duty, in Church, or in State Good morals — good manners, — good influence control, Which give to life vigor, and beauty to soul. One talent, first given, we have no excuse, For earth or for heaven, if not put to use. One lone seed, the acorn, brings forth the great Oak; One word fitly spoken will lighten a yoke. The germ for a science, the bud for a flower, Have first small beginnings, and deep hidden power; Tick, tick, and this ticking, time's length march shows ; Think, think, and by thinking, the human mind grows. Life, breath, and all motion have pulsation small; Drops make up the ocean, and atoms earth's ball; And as we contemplate body and soul, We find them but atoms in one perfect whole. Mary Whitcher, Canterbury, N. H.
