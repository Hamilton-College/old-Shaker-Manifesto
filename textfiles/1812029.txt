A CURIOUS FACT. 'Tis a curious fact as ever was known In human nature; but often shown Alike in castle and cottage; That pride, like pigs of a certain breed Will manage to live and thrive on feed As poor as a pauper's pottage. Of all the notable things on earth, The queerest one is pride of birth. Because you flourish in worldly affairs, Don't be haughty and put on airs With insolent pride of station. Don't be proud and turn up your nose At poorer people in plainer clothes ; But learn for the sake of your mind's repose, That wealth's a bubble that comes and goes, And that all proud flesh wherever it grows Is subject to fluctuation.
