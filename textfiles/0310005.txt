DUAL CIVIL GOVERNMENT The Times of July 28th says : ' The Fantees are among the most interesting of the African tribes. Many of their customs seem directly borrowed from the ancient Jews and Romans. Murder is punished by the offender being sold into slavery. When the tribe, or rather the aristocracy of the tribe, are tired of a king, a parrot's egg is brought and shown him. The sight of this is the signal of death. They believe in one supreme Deity — the 'Good Sjpirit ' — like the North American Indians. They have a priesthood which includes both sexes ; and the honors, immunities, and property of this body are hereditary, just as they were with the priesthood of Egypt. The superior priests are held to be immortal; and there is a village, in a part of the country called Braffoe, in which a multitude of aged priests are said to have lived from time immemorial.'' From all of which it appears: First, That capital punishment does not exist. Second, That the monarchy is limited. Third, That they believe in God as Spirit, and as dual— male and female. Fourth, That, consequentially, they have a dual government — male and female. Fifth, That they believe in the immortality of the bodies of the righteous.
