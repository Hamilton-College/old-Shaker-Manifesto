Elder Henry Blinn, Esteemed Friend... San Fkancisco, Cal., Dec. 1892. Elder Henby Blinn, Esteemed Fbiend;ï¿½The Manifesto is a source of great benefit to me. Presenting as it does, the truth in its simplest and purest form, it is the true expounder of a faith, which claims to be the pure, simple, unadulterated Christianity. It appeals to the heart and feelings, as well as to the intellect, and can therefore be read with profit by all classes of society. May it grow and prosper and bring about a realization of the beautiful song of the angels: 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will toward men.' Truly yours, Henry Hellmers.
