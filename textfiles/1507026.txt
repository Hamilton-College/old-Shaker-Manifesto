BUSRO, NO. 3. SAMUEL S. MCCLELLAND. On the 20th we again loaded our boats and pushed off into the stream. A good spirit ï¿½was manifested by the Brethren which made the toi's of this laborious passage pass more pleasantly. On account of the low water great care had to be exercised in managing the boats to avoid the rocks and the logs that se largely blocked the passage. At noon, Sept. 25th, we reached the Ohio River and soon landed for the night. We passed Diamond Island the 27th and landed for the night fifteen miles below Red Banks. A heavy shower fell on the night of the 27th and our camping ground was all afloat. For a few hours our situation was very uncomfortable, but the rain ceased at about nine o'clock A. M. when we pushed off and came within sight of the town of Henderson before sunset. We had learned of the movements of the ' Press Gang, ' and were not over anxious about leaving our boats till late in the day. We landed safely in the evening and at 10 o'clock P. M. entered the encampment of the Believers. As we had no covering to our boat, all our goods were thoroughly drenched, and for a while we were kept busy in restoring them to order. All hearts were made glad at the arrival of Brother John Woods from Union Village. He was the messenger of love and encouragement. The church at Union Village had sent him to bear these good tidings. Samuel G. White also arrived the same day with a message of love from the Believers of South Union. The ministration of these good gifts was very refreshing and was received by all with great joy. On the 80th, six of the Brethren returned to Busro to attend to some unsettled business. Those at the encampment put our tents in order, and attended to the care of the sick as best they could. Our hearts were saddened when we realized how we had been cast out from our beautiful home at Busro, from our fruitful fields and well tilled gardens, to make a weary pilgrimage of hundreds of miles, which could only be through great anxiety of spirit and severe toil of body. We remained at this encampment till the 9th of October, and then made preparations to renew the journey. While at this place we had word from home and of the depredations committed on the place by the unorganized militia. The Church at Union Village, under whose direction we were marching, had arranged the programme for the remainder of the journey. We were to move on to South Union, Logan Co., Ky. a distance of 112 miles from Red Bank: then on to Pleasant Hill, Mercer Co. Ky. 140 miles from South Union, and then to Union Village, Warren Co, Ohio 150 miles farther. The ' Press Gang' that took our horses, when on their way to Fort Harrison, had now returned them to Busro. James Brownfield was one of the company selected to return and secure the horses and household goods that had been left at that place. He went on horseback. The horses we secured and loaded with such articles as were most needed by the Believers at Red Banks. While this company were absent others were splitting shingles and making a roof to our large boat, for the better protection of our goods while ascending the Ohio river to Cincinnati. On the 7th, Joel Shields and James Veeley arrived from Pleasant Hill with two, five horse teams. By them we received some 1500 lbs of flour which was a great blessing, as we had been unable to obtain sufficient, even for the sick. The gift of love and blessing from our kind gospel friends was also very highly appreciated. Arrangements were now made for the continuation of our journey, and on the 9th inst the wagons, foot people, with the sheep and cattle took up their line of march, leaving the Elders and several other persons to wait the arrival of the Brethren from Busro. All were anxious to leave the encampment as we were hourly in dread of the return of the 'Press Gang, ' and this constant fear made our encampment more or less like an imprisonment. So soon as the company that traveled by land had left the place, the boats were made ready and on Sunday morning, the 11th, pushed out into the river. We will now follow the first company, and they unfortunately met with an accident early in the day by the overturning of one of the wagons. As no one was harmed, nor any- thing broken the carriage was soon righted and again moving on the road. After going a distance of seven miles we encamped for the night. The next day we traveled thirteen miles, but this was attended with a great deal of difficulty on account of the poorly made and very muddy roads. A heavy shower on the 11th gave us a thorough wetting, and made the roads almost impassable. One of the wagons was overturned which added much to our burden. That nothing was broken in these accidents was a source of much satisfaction. A large part of the night was spent in feeding the fires and drying our wet clothing. As a whole it proved to be a very uncomfortable night for the rest. Our next failure was in a yoke of oxen. Their strength was exhausted and this obliged us to procure a span of horses to take along the load. The next day we spent an hour searching for the oxen that we had so kindly released from the yoke. So soon as these were found we moved on, and before night were again most thoroughly wet by the fall of heavy showers. This subjected us to another night of broken rest and to a large amount of work in drying the clothes. On the morning of the 14th it was still raining, and our beds and wearing apparel were in a sad condition. The roads had in this time become extremely muddy and slippery, so that it was with difficulty that any of us were able to proceed. Seven miles only was the length of the journey for this day. At night we obtained shelter in the house and mill of a man by the name of Wilson. He was very kind to us in making this free will offering, and also in providing an enclosure for the stock. For this blessing we had abundant reason to be thankful. On the morning of the 15th Matthew Houston and Samuel White from South Union, drove into our camp having in charge six horses. Several of the Brethren and Sisters now set off for South Union at which place their services were needed. Near noon of this same day we met James White and lloberi Gray from South Union who had come to us with a load of provisions, and among these were some of the largest sweet potatoes we had ever seen. Before the close of the day a heavy shower fell upon vis, so that we could build no fires till after midnight. We fortunately found shelter for the sick and for the children in a meeting house which afforded them a very comfortable shelter. Those that regained in the woods had but little rest during the night. The drying of our clothes occupied several hours. We left this camping ground the next day at eight o'clock but had not proceeded far before a wheel to one of the wagons broke down. The repairing of this was attended with some difficulty on account of our peculiar situation. Xine more horses were sent to us from South Union, which proved a great blessing to some who had traveled so far on foot. On the evening of the 17th we reached Jasper Springs (South Union) and were received in all kindness by our beloved gospel friends. Every thing was arranged for our comfort, which we received with thankful hearts as it was the first place in which we had found any rest since the 15th of Sept. We remained with our dear friends three days, and found time to shoe our horses and to repair some of the wagons. Others found employment in various ways that proved profitable and very needful. Eld. Peter Tease of Union Village accompanied by three other Brethren met us at this place and brought to us barrels of bread and biscuit; a large supply of boots and shoes and also other blessings. By advice it was thought best for some thirty persons to remain for the present in South Union, and in this number was included many of the sick and feeble. The Brethren also concluded to leave the sheep at this place. Early on the morning of the 20th preparations were being made for a continuation of our journey. After taking a kind and affectionate farewell of our beloved gospel friends, we marched to the road and proceeded on our way toward Pleasant Hill. It proved to be a rainy day. The road became very muddy and the traveling was disagreeable. We reached Big Barrow before night, a distance of fifteen miles, but succeeded in crossing the river with only half of our wagons. On this account we were obliged to encamp on both sides of the river. The next day we traveled sixteen miles. It pleases us to remark that we are now find- ing better roads and that the weather is more favorable, which blessing we fully appreciate. Nothing worthy of special remark occurred till the 26th when we were obliged to travel in the rain and found the roads very muddy and disagreeable. For several days we averaged about fifteen miles each day. On the 28th one of our wagons broke down. The load was distributed to the others, and as the carriage was well worn we concluded to burn it, and save the iron for future use. For the first time on this journey we were obliged to face a cold north east storm. We arrived at Pleasant Hill at 2 o'clock 1'. M. on the 21)th of Oct. where our good friends received us very kindly and treated us with Christian friendship during our stay. The sick received the best of attention, and all of the company were refreslied and rested as far as circumstances would admit Louis Willhite of Union Village met us at this place, and in his carriage we found additional accommodations. We left Pleasant Hill on the 31st crossed the Kentucky River and encamped on the hill just four miles from the Shaker Village. On the 2nd of Nov. we passed through Lexington and Georgetown and then encamped for the night. Our journey the next day was over a very hilly road. Heavy showers fell on the 4th and the roads became slippery and the walking \ery unpleasant. At night we found but little rest, and the rain prevented us from building our fires. The morning found us wet and our clothes well bespattered with mud. Our journey to-day was twelve miles. We suffered another cold north storm and were obliged to remain in our wet clothes all day and through the night as the fire-wood was so scarce. On the 8th we met Elder Issachar Bates and John Wallace of Union Village. They came to accompany us to their home. We now moved on with increased zeal and crossed the Ohio river in the ferry boats, and all landed safely at Cincinnati. After continuing our journey about five miles farther we encamped for the night. The roads still continue to be muddy, but as we were anxious to see the end of our pilgrimage, we hurried on and at night encamped at a place only six miles from Union Village. (TO BE CONTINUED.)
