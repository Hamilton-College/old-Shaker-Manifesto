This is the judgement age.... This is the Judgment age. Considerate people, those within and those without the churches, listen, to weigh, and to apply the tests of reason. None can remain the same that they were before, after hearing the truth of the spiritual life rationally presented. Through the word uttered by the messengers of Truth, faith has entered consciously or unconsciously and cannot be dislodged if any are so unwise as to wish it. The beginning of faith is like the least of all seeds, and in every heart open to the Source of all life and light, it will find nourishment and grow till ripe for the harvester ; Therefore let us continue to sow in faith and courage, knowing that the harvest will be sure in its season. 'How canst thou claim the harvest, If thou hast not sown the seed, Or think the blessing will be thine, In thy hour of need?' Alonzo
