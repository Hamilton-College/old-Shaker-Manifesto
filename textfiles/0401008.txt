The man who yields to anger... The man who yields to anger, and seeks to appease his disturbed temper by inflicting upon his horse, or other domestic animal, an unmerited punishment, is injuring himself in a great degree. Such a man will, in a short time, become morally depraved, and incapable of rendering any true sympathy for man or beast. It will destroy those beautiful traits of character that make a man manly, and should be the distinctive marks of his affinity with God, as a son of the Most High.â€” E. C. W.
