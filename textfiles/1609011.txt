A QUESTION. If everything that happens is God's will, Both good and ill, Then say wherein Rests man's responsibility? Though sin Go hand in hand with him thro' ways of shame, Is man to blame? If everything that happens is God's will, Both good and ill, What credit hath That man who ever shuns the evil path, And treads with feet that do not hesitate The true and straight? Gertrude Alger, in The Index.
