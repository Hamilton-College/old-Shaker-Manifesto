IN MEMORY OF ELDER OTIS SAWYER. MARY A. GILLESPIE. 'WE LOVED HIM FOE HIS WOllK'S SAKE.' Another of God's holy men Hath laid his earthly armor by And put on immortality. He was well nigh a perfect man, His life was one of sacrifice And faithful serving to the end. A minister of righteousness, A father to his people, he Was full of love and charity, Robed in angelic purity,� His crown, the crown of life. Where he was beet and fullest known There love affixed her shining seal. E'en little children loved so well When lie was absent for a day They'd run to meet him when he came And greet him in their childish mood. How oft we've heard their pattering feet L'pon the path as he approached, And seen them stand with anxious gazeTo wait his coming, then to greet. How much he prized their cofidence And loved their simple innocence. How gentle, healing, were his words LTnto the wounded, sorrowing heart; And O, how fatherly and kind When by an erring child approached,� He was all tenderness and love, And sweet: affection�oft he said ' To err is human, ' we'll forgive; Go, little one, do so no more; If tempted, fall upon your knees And cry to God,�no matter where, And never be ashamed to pray. For He who for the sparrow cares Hath eye and ear for you and me, Prayer is a precious gift, too sweet, Too sacred to be trifled with. How oft as his associates, we Have sat with him in converse sweet Of heavenly things, the growth of souls, And of the gift of prayer, and heard Divinely uttered from his lips Rich golden words; we blest them then; More precious now, as we no more Shall hear his voice or sec his form; But know beyond a doubt he lives, And loves, and cares for all, e'en now, the same Dear blessed spirit, still do be To us a heavenly messenger; Our way is all up hill, we need, We ask your kiud assistance still. E'en as thou livest, we still live, Be one with thee in gospel love, One in the truth which makes us free In bonds of angel purity. For thou art ours and we are thine, On, on through blest eternity. Alfred, Me.
