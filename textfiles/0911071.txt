DISINFECTANTS The Commission of Experts appointed by the National Board of Health to prepare a circular embodying familiar instructions for disinfectants, have made a report to the board. The disinfectants to be used are : First, roll sulphur for fumigation; second, sulphate of iron and copperas dissolved in water in the [proportion of If pounds to a gallon for soil, sewers, etc. ; third, sulphate of zinc and common salt dissolved together in water in the proportion of four ounces of sulphate of zinc and two ounces of salt to a gallon of water for clothing, bed linen, etc. The commission excludes carbolic acid for the reason that it is difficult to secure the proper quality, and that it must be used in large quantities to be of service.
