EXEGETICAL AND CRITICAL. In Home Notes of Union Village, for Aug. Manifesto, Elder Oliver quotes a text from Ezek. xxxi., 8, and asks 'Who will hunt it up and explain it?' Sister H. Agnew thinks no one lias paid attention to that request, and she wishes to have it noticed. She has hunted it up, and I rise to explain. The Prophet is uttering a parable to describe the greatness, glory, beauty, strength and prosperity of the kingdom of Assyria, which had been destroyed about 30 years previously, or in the year 605 before Christ.

No pomp, nor splendor, nor greatness could save her from the punishment due for her sins. A. G. H.
