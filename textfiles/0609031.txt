CENTENNIAL BLESSINGS ANN BUSBY Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Blessed year of our Lord — eighteen hundred seventy-six — Every blessing does afford — With the daily cross affixed. Every avenue is open For advancement in the right, All the captive chains are broken, And the day succeeds the night. Lot tho spirit, now unfettered, Glory, halleluia sing, Triumphing in the victory, Which the cross of Christ does bring. Blessed year of our Lord, Let sweet melodies arise, Wo will sing with ono accord, Of salvation's glorious prize, Of the rapid lino of travel, To our Father's Kingdom new, Wo will bravo each rising trial, And the heavenly way pursue; By confession and repentance, We will weave us garments fair, Rejoicing, that our spirits, We, for glory, may prepare. May this year of our Lord, New centennial blessings bring, On the rulers of our land — On the peasant and the king ; May our blest and lovely Zion Be replenished by his hand, And the gospel testimony, Sounded forth o'er sea and land. May the preaching of the prophets, In the wilderness bo heard, Preparing all the people, For the coming of the Lord.
