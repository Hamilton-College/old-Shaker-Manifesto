Things I Love BY G. T. SPROAT I love the honest, truthful soul, Who is not ashamed to say, 'I own I'm wrong ; help me to walk In a more perfect way.' 'A wrong confess'd is half redressed,' Pray speak of it no more; You have acted nobly, and I lore You better than before. I love the artless, noble soul, Who will not wince, nor start, To learn his faults, though from a foe, With malice in his heart. ' Strike on, strike on, keep striking on!'' The wise old Roman said; ' Your blows, good friend, may mend my heart, And will not break my head.' I love the brave and fearless soul, Who dares, in open day, To meet his heart alone, and hear All that it has to say. ' If you have anything to say, Speak on, good friend, -within; Together let us seek the light, And search out every sin.'
