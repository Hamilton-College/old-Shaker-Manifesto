Hancock, Mass. August 12, 1890. We always hail with gladness the arrival of the precious messenger, which comes to us usually so punctually, and so neatly appareled. Mentally we exclaim, God bless its able Editor and worthy contributors. Long may it live to herald God's truths. We think each successive number of the Manifesto surpasses in excellence the preceding one. The Editorials in each number are most valuable and instructive. The August No. contains several most interesting articles. Letter from Dr. Carl, Instrumental Music, and the beautiful sentences in 'Our Lord's Prayer' so ably treated, are, in our opinion, super-excellent. Notes about home we find very pleasant reading and always turn with avidity to them, for we are anxious to know how the dear friends in other portions of God's vineyard are prospering. Observing the absence of notes from our beautiful home in June and July numbers, and knowing that vacations were in order in these days of excessive heat we fancied that our note-collector might be enjoying a vacation. But lo! on receiving Aug. No. we were agreeably surprised to fiivl that one writer at least, still remained at home. Produce from our vegetable garden is abundant. Green peas and new Irish potatoes headed the list of esculents that covered our dinner table on the first ot July; which is something unusual in this section of country. Elder Louis must have t ngagt-d tli.ï¿½ services of tact, skill and perseverance to have been so successful. He was wonderfully prospered in raising a large fluck of chickens until they became quite sizable, when a large number of them disappeared, having been destroyed by some rapacious anim.il. Most kinds of fruit are unpromising this season. Pears are a total failure. Apples lew. Plum trees altogether fruith.-s. Small fruits not plenty excepting the blackberry which seems to yield well. Looking from our window we can see busy hands engaged in gathering this variety of berry from a nice little briar patch that was planted two years ago last spring by our venerable father, Elder Albert, and has been mostly cared for by him since. Should he live until the coining October he will have been eighty years an inhabitant of this earth sphere. He is a model of industry, frugality and temperance and is, in the true sense of the word, a Christian. A colony of busy workers have quietly come, as it seems, with the intention of making a permanent settlement. They belong to the class that a son of Erin once described as having a hot fut, (foot.) At present they appear inoffensive and if left undisturbed, will, we trust, remain quite peaceable. They have reared quite a structure for themselves and we think are well satisfied with their location. They may have emigrated from Norway as they have selected a Norway Spruce in which to build their residence. Is this an omen, and if so, is it for good or ill? can you tell us? Before closing our note we must tell you how displeased we are with your change of position, for we greatly fear that duty will not call you in the direction of our home as frequently as heretofore, and we well know that home duties will not be neglected by you for pleasure seeking. We all sincerely wish that you might give us a call, we think you would find that Old Berkshire maintained well her reputation for beautiful scenery and healthful climate. J. L. Sweet.
