Dear Editor ;-I enjoy reading the letters in the Letter Box... Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Mar. 1884. Dear Editor ;ï¿½I enjoy reading the letters in the Letter Box. Last evening we had a short but very good meeting. I am sowing the seed of life, and I hope that the seed will be good. These few verses I like very much : ' I am Jesus' little friend, On his mercy I depend; If I try to please him ever, If I grieve his spirit never, 0 how very good to me Will my Savior always be. He is with me all the day, With me in my busy play; O'er my waking and my sleeping Jesus still a watch is keeping; 1 can lay me d wn to rest Sweetly pillowed on his breast. I am Jesus' little friend, On his mercy I depend : Jesus will forsake me never, He will keep me safe forever. How I wish my heart could be Loving Savior, more like Thee. ' Yours, Wm. Sherman
