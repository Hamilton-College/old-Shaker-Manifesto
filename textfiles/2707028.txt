No answer comes to those who pray... No answer comes to those who pray And idly stand; And wait for storms to roll away At God's command. He will not break the binding cords Upon us laid; If we depend on pleading words, And do not aid. When hands are idle, words are vain To move the stone; A Heaven-sent angel would disdain To work alone. But he who prajeth and is strong In faith and deed; And toileth earnestlyï¿½ere long He will succeed. War Cry.
