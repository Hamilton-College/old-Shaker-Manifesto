EULOGY TO OUR DEPARTED BROTHER, ELDER ODILON B. ELKINS. JAMES G. RUSSELL. The shaft is broken!�all is o'er; Unbidden tears may flow, But our dear brother is no more, Upon this earth below. He sought, we know, but sought in vain, Life's mission to fulfill, For tragic Fate usurped its reign, And he in death is still! In death we say,�but that sad word Has but one meaning here, Its certain summons he has heard, And all that earth holds dear, Unto its own is now consigned, While we stand grieving by, That one so noble, true and kind, Were born, so soon to die. Ah ! brother, can we justly say That it is well with thee, That thou sheuld'st pass from earth away, While so endearingly Thou art attached to loving hearts That fondly hoped and prayed That Fate, with all its baneful darts, Thy presence, might evade ? We hoped to claim thee, brother dear, For many years to come; And why should we not sorrow here To find thy labors done Thus early, in thy prime of life, A period of age When strength should be supremely rife, Life's duties to engage ? We know thy early years of strife, Thy struggling days of &gt; outh; We know full well throughout thy life, Thy deep regard for truth. Whatever thy convictions were, Obedience thereunto, Was thy defense, and naught could stir Thy mind to acts untrue. We say, our brother's life was good; We cannot well say less : A brother who has nobly stood, With aim to love and bless. ****** And as our dearest ones depart For brighter, angel spheres, One universal throb of heart With intermingling tears Shall manifest our truest love For such departed worth Transcending far beyond, above The brief confines of earth. Then, dearest brother, peace to thee : Sweet peace forevermore; In that bright world where thou shalt be, Thou hast a blessed store Of laurels thou hast truly won And none can take away, While there thy light renews its dawn In blaze of endless day.
