THE ACCEPTED OFFERING. Agnes E. Newton. It is not the amount given, but the spirit that prompts the offering that merits divine approval or vice versa. l'One coin out of a little,' says St. Ambrose, ''is better than a treasure, out of much.' The narrative concern ing the dropping of the two mites into the treasury of the Lord, is rendered doubly interesting by facts of equal importance connected therewith. We learn from history that it occurred at the time of the Savior's last visit to the Temple. Fora brief interval of rest and retirement he had sought the Court, known as the Court oi the Women. In this Court were thirteen chests, each shaped like a trumpet, broadening downward from the aperture. Into these were cast the contributions which helped to furnish the Temple with its magnificent wealth. The multitude were dropping their gifts into the treasury ; conspicuous among them was the wealthy class offering freely of their abundance. Jesus with divine penetration comprehended the entire scene at a glance. Following the wealthy train, came a poor woman, who, timidly advancing, dropped into the Receiver two mites or prutahs, the smallest of coins. A prutah is a trifle less 'than half a farthing. How sensitively she must have shrunk from giving so little among the rich who could lavish their gold upon any desirable object; but the loving heart of the Savior, at once recognized and blest the purely unselfish motive that prompted the offering of all that she possessed. Like healing balm to the sorrow stricken spirit must have been the words from one who never spoke in vain. 'Of a truth, I say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.' Very brief the narrative ; four verses of Scripture complete the entire story ; but how extended has been its power for good! How valuable the lesson it presents to all, who would really imitate the Pattern, to value the motive, rather than the greatness of the act performed. Canterbury, N. H.
