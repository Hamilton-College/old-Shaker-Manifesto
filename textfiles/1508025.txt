SAUL 0F TARSUS VS PAUL THE PREACHER. A Story for Children. LEWIS HORTON. Amid the burning sands of the Syrian desert, not a great many miles from Jerusalem, there is an 'oasis' a br'ght green spot, about twenty-five miles in circumference, fragrant, blooming, and fruitful with the growth of spices and other tropical productions. This spot of emerald earth has been kept fresh and fair for many thousand years by a small river running through its centre in a steady constant flow of pure water. It was, and is now, a halting place for the caravans that came across the desert from the cities and towns of the Orient, laden with the choice and valuable goods so famous in the history of the ancient East. This traffic led to the founding of a city, which is now so old that no person on the earth can trace the time of its origin. It is the city of Damascus. A city that was old when Jesus of Nazereth was a chid. It was old when Abraham was a boy. It was old when Jacob journeying across the plain of Mamre, laid himself down at night to sleep, with a stone for a pillow, and saw that beautiful vision, a ladder set up on the earth, reaching to heaven and angels ascending and descending, a prophecy of the blending of the two worlds which should come to pass in the latter days. This strange city of Damascus whose history can be traced back thousands of years, still flourishes in its intermingling of ancient and modern architecture; watered and refreshed by the river that flows through its centre. In the rise and growth of primitive Christianity, it found an abiding place in Damascus, Jerusalem and other cities of Oriental history, under circumstances of cruelty and terror, Saul of Tarsus satiated with his persecutions of the Christians at Jerusalem, obtained permission of the high priests to proceed to the city of Damascus on a bloodthirsty mission against the Christians in that place. Armed with written credentials, with a retinue of followers, all in warlike array, ï¿½' breathing out threatenings and slaughter' glorying in the number that he should bring bound, unto Jerusalem, of the innocent followers of the Divine Teacher. When within but a few miles of this noted city of Damascus, behold there shone round about him a light brighter than the sun, Saul, dazzled, smitten and blinded fell to the earth in terror paralyzed by a spiritual manifestation which has no parallel in modern history. A voice spoke from above his prostrate form, crying, 'Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?' Saul answers, who art thou Lord? The reply came back, ' I am Jesus whom thou persecutest, ' Saul of Tarsus inquires again, Lord what wilt thou have me to do ; ' Arise and get thee into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do. ' Saul arose, and was led with blinded eyes into the city of Damascus, thence to the house of Ananias, who restored his sight, and sent him forth as Paul preacher of the Gospel of Christ. Gifted above the men of his time, as warrior, scholar and orator, he became well adapted with his spiritul gifts of healing the sick, comforting the weak, prayer, exhortation, &amp;c, for the mission which the spirit of his Divine Master called him to perform. Thus, through obedience do we become exalted and prepared for a noble mission, both here and hereafter and which grows fairer, and brighter with each victory won. Canterbury, N. H.
