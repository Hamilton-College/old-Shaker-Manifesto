In the early Centuries of Christianity... [Contributed by Elder John Whiteley.] 'In the early Centuries of Christianity, when religious fervor extinguisht every other kind of enthusiasm, marriage was denounced as worldly, and celibacy was preacht and practist as the one thing for people who were expecting the heavens to open at any moment. In consequence, the best and most earnest Christians left no posterity, and the fervor which blossomed into activity while they were upon earth, faded out of existence when they past away. The world now and for all time, is in the possession of people who crowd into church when some one is being married.'
