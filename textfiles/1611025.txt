THE SPRING-TIME. As we observe and enjoy the beauties of spring in all its brightness and freshness we are reminded of the many thousands now living upon the earth that are in the spring-time of their lives that possess all the health strength and vigor that rightfully belongs to | youth. We understand that the buds do not form on a tree until the sap has started, also that it has the appearance of a lifeless object through the Winter months during which time it retains the germ of life and when spring-time comes with its bright warm sunshine and its pleasant April showers, the sap which has flowed only through the roots and trunk is distributed through the branches and small twigs, and the buds begin to swell and finally burst forth in loveliness of bloom filling the air with its fragrance. The whole tree seems full of life and strength, but let a destroying worm find its way to the tree and there perform its destructive work we should see in due time that something was M*rong although for several months the tree does not appear to be other than in good condition, it will sooner or later show the effects of the little worm's work. It is just so with our lives although we may appear well in the sight of others if we harbor the selfishness of an unthankful heart, slander, pride or any of the evils either inherent or acquired it will sooner or later tell upon our lives. On the other hand every little act done unselfishly, every little step of obedience also, every kind word or smile given to encourage those who are perhaps a little weaker than ourselves will be one step nearer heaven and happiness and will finally enable us to stand as a power for good and not for tjvil. I believe that when one is striving very hard to discard an evil they should fill the vacancy left, directly with good or else we should be like the man who swept and gar- j nished his house, then grew lukewarm and easy. The result was that he was seven times worse than he was before he took this pains but this is not progressing and as the true Believer is always progressing, it will be of no advantage to grow careless.
