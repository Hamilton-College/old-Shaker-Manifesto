SURE PROMISE My soul immortal cannot live On gross material things, And all the wealth this Avorld can give, No lasting'comfort brings; Then let me labor for that meat Which ever will endure ; That food which saints and angels eat, That hidden manna pure. O Father give me daily bread, And wine that's ever new ; No famine then I need to dread, Or what my foes can do. While anxious cares of earthly toys, So many millions wound, My spirit feasts on inward joys And pities those around. The earth is promised to the meek, Eternal life beside, If heaven's kingdom they would seek, Their Father will provide, lie feeds the ravens when they cry,â€” lie clothes the smiling mead, And will he not my wants supply AVith every thing I need. O then let nothing rob my soul, Nor any doubts prevail; For while eternal ages roll, His goodness shall not fail. 'I need but little here below, Have little time to learn ; Then O that world to which I go, Shall be my great concern. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
