AN EXAMPLE IN HUMILITY. Thomas of Aquino was by far the greatest man of his age, of noble birth, of ancient lineage, of fine appearance, the most consummate theologian, supreme in learning and goodness, the friend of popes and kings. In position he was but a humble monk. One day at Bologna, a stranger arrived, and asked the prior for some one to get provisions, and carry his basket. 'Tell the first brother you meet,' said the prior. St. Thomas was walking in meditation in the cloister, and not knowing him, the stranger said, 'Your prior bids you to follow me.' Without a word the great teacher�the angel of the schools as he was called by the affection of his admirers� bowed his head, took the basket and followed. But he was suffering from lameness, and since he was unable to keep up the stranger rated him soundly as a lazy, good-for-nothing fellow, who ought to show more zeal in religious obedience. The saint meekly bore the unjust reproaches, and answered never a word. 'Do you know whom you are speaking to, and treating in this rude way ?' said the indignant citizens who witnessed the scene. -'That is Bro. Thomas, of Aquino.' 'Bro. Thomas of Aquino!' said the stranger in amazement; and immediately throwing himself upon his knees, he begged to be for- given. 'Nay,' said St. Thomas, ' it is I who should ask forgiveness, since I have not been so active as I should have been.' And this humility, so rare in little men, was the chief characteristic in this truly great man. Once again when he was addressing a vast congregation in one of the cliief churches of Paris, an insolent intruder beckoned to him to stop, and aimed at him an abusive harangue. The saint waited till he had ended, and then, without one word of anger or resentment, calmly continued his discourse. Erom that disciplined and noble heart all pride had been expelled. 'Give me 0 Lord' �such was his daily prayer�'Give me 0 Lord, a noble heart which no earthly affection can drag down!'' Farmer's Everyday Christianity.
