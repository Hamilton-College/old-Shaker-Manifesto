SPEAK NOT TO HIM A BITTER WORD ' Would'st thou a wanderer reclaim, A wild and restless spirit tame — Check the warm glow of youthful blood, And lead a lost one back to God; Pause, if thy spirit's wrath be stirred; Speak not to him a bitter word. Speak not — that bitter word may be The stamp that seals his destiny. • If widely he has gone astray, And dark excess has marked his way, ' Tis pitiful — but yet beware, Reform must come from kindly care. Forbid thy parting lips, to move But in the gentle tones of love. Though sadly his young heart hath erred, Speak not to him a bitter word. '' The lowering frown he will not bear, Thy venomed chidings will not hear, The ardent spirit, will not brook The stinging tooth of sharp rebuke. Thou would'st not goad the restless steed, To calm his fire or check his speed — Then let no angry words be heard — Speak not to him a bitter word. ' Go kindly to him — make him feel Your heart yearns deeply for bis weal. Tell him the dangers thick, that lay Around his widely devious way,— So shalt thou win him, call him back, From pleasure's smooth, seductive track, And warnings, thou hast mildly given, May guide the wanderer up to heaven.'
