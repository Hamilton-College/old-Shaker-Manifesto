IF IF. If all the pity and love untold Could scatter abroad in coins of gold, There would not be, on the whole round earth, One hungry heart, nor one wretched hearth. And oh, if the kind words never said Could bloom into flowers, and spread, and shed Their sweetness out on the common air, The breath of heaven would be everywhere. Christian Union
