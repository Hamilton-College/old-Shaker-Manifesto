A SISTER'S TRIBUTE Betsey M. Hall Lines dedicated to Elder GltoVE B. BLANCHARD, who passed to the Evergreen Shores, April 23, 1880. Beloved father, friend so blest, You leave the earthly form, To enter into joys of rest, The resurrection morn. With kindred spirits you explore Angelic realms of light ; Thy earthly sufferings, known no more. But joy and pure delight. We feel thy presence with vis here, Imparting love and peace â€” A radiance from the Angel sphere. 0 may its power increase. This blessing from thy spirit-form, Which here tbou dost impart. Rests like the dove, a holy calm, Inspiring every heart. Long hast thou labored in this place, A rl EAOHKK of the truth ; Pidst sow the seeds of gospel grace, And virtue in the youth. Thy worthy precepts may we heed, Thy bright example too, Of faith and trust in times of need Which bore thy spirit through. We feel that you will aid us yet, With strength of Angel-power, Your interest in us ne'er forget, But help impart each hour. We waft our blessing,love and thanks, From all, a tribute due ; We'll meet thee soon on Jordan's banks, And kindred ties renew.
