South Union, Ky. Nov. 29, 1894. Thanksgiving day at South Union. The air is clear and calm, and the sky looks serenely blue. It is one of those mornings long to be remembered. We are in good trim for a holiday. The sheds are filled with well-seasoned stove wood, and the corn is all husked and cribbed, and the vegetables and tubers are safely stored away for winter use. Although the summer and fall had been unusually dry, our wells gave an abundant supply of good, fresh water, and the springs and creeks boiled up and meandered over their gravelly beds with as musical an air as if there had been a fresh shower every other day, so we might well exclaim with the Psalmist of old Palestine, 'Give thanks unto the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever.' In the midst of our reverie, the big bell peals out its silvery tones to summon us to Service. Our worship consisted of singing and prayer, and an address by one of the Brethren which was befitting the occasion. We rendered praise and thanksgiving, bearing in remembrance the devout and valiant hearted Brethren and Sisters who established a Society in this place that we might enjoy the benefits of a Communal home. When the hour of twelve came, there were just iifty of us who sat down to that Thanksgiving dinner. The viands on that table were both rich and savory; the big bronzed turkeys being distributed about, showed most prominently to the eye, but your humble scribe is a lover of other good things which did not materialize, in the line of cranberries and baked beans.
