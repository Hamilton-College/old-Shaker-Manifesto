INFIDELITY Let none be surprised at the rapid increase of infidelity in the land. There are so many professedly Christian people, with so very little practical Christianity, that the wonder is, there are not more blatant infidels to indict them. Let it be as plainly as it is reasonably understood, that professions often lie; that he or she is a Christian, who lives as Jesus Christ did ; otherwise every pro- fessedly Christian family is, to be very mild, a school of practical infidelity. Whoso wears the name of Christ, must depart from all iniquity.
