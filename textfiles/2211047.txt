Onward Christian Soldiers 'Onward Christian Soldiers.' Whoever wishes to be the owner of a beautifully bound Book, and made happy even before they lay back its covers, will do well to send for the above work. Within, it will be found very interesting, as it covers a large field of usefulness, for those who are anxious to work in the Lord's vineyard. It is a year Book; on the pages of which the names of many dear friends may be written. The selections of poetry and prose that follows every date throughout the year, are accepted from the best sources now known. The Christian Endeavor movement occupies many pages and comes from the pen of Rev. Francis E. Clark, D. D. A history of the King's daughters and sons is an interesting feature, written by the General Secretary of of the Order. Mary Lowe Dickenson. The work is beautifully illustrated.
