PEOPLE WILL TALK You may get through the world, But 'twill be very slow; If you listen to all That is said as you go ; You'll be worried and fretted And kept in a stew, For meddlesome tongues Will have something to do, For people will talk. If generous and noble, They'll vent out their spleen, You'll hear some loud hints, That your selfish and mean ; If upright and honest, And fair as the day, They'll call you a rogue, In a sly sneaking way, For people will talk. And then if you show The least boldness of heart, Or the least inclination To take your own part, They'll call you an upstart, Conceited and vain. But keep straight ahead, Don't stop to explain. For people will talk If you dress in the fashion, Don't hope to escape, For they criticise then In a different shape ; You're ahead of your means. Or your tailor's unpaid, But mind your own business, There's naught to be made, For people will talk. Now the best way to do, Is to do as you please, For your own mind, if you have one, Will then be at ease ; Of course you will meet With all sorts of abuse, But don't think to stop them, It ain't any use, For people will talk.
