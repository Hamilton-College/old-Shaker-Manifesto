God's Will be Done Say to the torrent : 'Stay thou on the hill !' The torrent replies : ' I'm obeying God's will.' Say to the rivulet, murmuring by : ' Be still for a moment!' and it will reply : ' I must not, I will not, I cannot be still, '¦ I must be in motion, and doing God's will!' Say to the sunbeam : ' 'Withdraw thy bright ray ''' The sunbeam replies : ' God's laws, I obey.' Then sa}* to the whirlwind, uprooting the trees— To the hurricane raging, or the mild, whispering breeze— To the river, the lake, or the ocean : ' Be still!' Their response is forthcoming: 'We are doing God's will I' To the tear, as it wells from the grief-stricken heart— Or, with joy overflows, as rich treasures impart— How idle, how needless, how fruitless and vain, To say to that tear : ' Return thou again I' That tear, in the language of heaven, will say: ' Created I was, God's laws to obey.' The vitals, which, panting for the life-giving air— The heart with its throbbings, and the sigh of despair; The deep pangs of remorse on the guilt-laden soul— How vain the endeavor, these things to control ! Those pangs, and those vitals—that heart and that sigh, In emphatic language, will surely reply : ' Unyielding obedience, by night and by day, ' To the mandates of God, we are taught, and obey!' From the smallest of insects, revealed to our sight; Or the greatest of angels, in power and might— Or the earth in her orbit, the sun, moon or stars, Or great Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Mars— All matter, all being, all spirit shall say: ' Forever the mandates of God we obey!' Then how foolish, self-righteous, irreverent in man, To think, in his wisdom, to better the plan ! Bather learn to be humble, to love and to pray— The laws of his Maker to know, and obey— To feel it his duty, his privilege, his shrineTo say: ' Thy will. Father, be done, and not mine !'' E. E. Frost
