PROGRESSION. MARY WHITCHER. Onward, onward, ever onward, But be sure the road is right, Leading upward, leading heavenward To the prospect of delight. Here we view the vernal landscape Ever bright with joys sublime, Earth the shadow of the substance Well portrayed by things of time. No exchange for lower station When we reach our Zion height, Tis the soul's sweet habitation, The abode of peace and light. Canterbury, N. H.
