CLING TO THE RIGHT. M. J. TATTERTON. There is nothing more certain than this truth. Right will triumph eternally. It is equally certain that wrong is destined to utter destruction. Whoever links himself with error, is sure eventually to encounter overthrow. There may be temporary prosperity, there will be final defect; hence, they consult their wisdom and safety who cling to the right at whatever cost ; not through stubbornness of will, but through steadfastness of faith and honesty of purpose. How brief the scenes of trial Avill seem when the struggle is over; how unworthy of notice will be all the sufferings of the present time, when compared with the crown, the joys, the raptures which shall reward the faithful soul. Let the followers of Christ take courage ; their conflicts are brief and they war against powers destined to fall. Those who cling to the right, shall triumph with it forever. Canterbury, N. H.
