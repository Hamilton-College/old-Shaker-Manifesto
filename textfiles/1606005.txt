THE BROOKLET. ARABELLA SHEPARD. This lone retreat, this humble nook, Glides sweetly by a rippling brook, And speaks in language as it goes, To quell earth's sorrows and its woes, It lulls to rest while murmuring by, And calms the soul in sweet reply; We close our eyes on things below, While inspiration here doth now. Silence here doth hold her power, In this sequestered lowly bower, No gross intrusion here we|find ; To annoy at all a peaceful mind. North Union, Ohio.
