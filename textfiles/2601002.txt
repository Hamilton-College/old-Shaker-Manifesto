DUTY By Annie R. Stephens A narrow mountain pass my feet must go ; A steep declivity,—a rugged way, My back must ache with burdens of the day. Stern cragged rocks their darkening presence throw, The mists rise up from valleys dim and low. O'er thorny paths, through shadows cold and grey,— Still on I press, nor pause in dread dismay, For it is Duty's path, full well I know. Still will I climb and, climbing, gain the height; Tho' sandals worn, my feet with peace are shod, While Hope can see the shining Tabor light, And Love forgets the road my feet have trod, While, from the Mount of Vision on my sight Gleams the bright, vernal table-lands of God. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
