The Pulpit The Pulpit, for December is full of good things. The leaven of humanity is l!javenin? the teachers of all denominations and thong lit now dwells more upon the Fatherhood and Motherhood of God, and the Brotiierhood of man, than it does upon the mystified theology of the saved and the lost. Those who write of Heavenly Visions, have chosen a beautiful title for a beautiful subject. Then follows a Christmas sermon and that must be good, as all who think of Christmas, think of a good time when all sorrow shall flee away. The illumination of Death spreads a beautiful light over what some would make a scene of sorrow. One writer has chosen lor his text, The beauty of the Lord,ï¿½Psalms xc, 17, and this beauty permeates the whole of his article. The Pulpit is now able to publish the portraits of the several writers, which adds much to the value of the Magazine. Pub. by G. Holzapfel, Fredericksburg, Fa.
