Tribute to our Sister MARTHA CROOKER. By Asenath C. Stickney. 'For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.''Phil, v., 21. Dear, cheerful, loving sister, At length, you've earned your lot Among the risen 'Marthas,1'1 Where 'worldly cares,' come not. Now restsweet rest enshrine you, Our precious loyal one; The blessings of the household Receive,for robe and crown. As long you've borne life's burdens With modest grace and care, And long have dealt to others The bounties yours to share, So shall the sweets of Heaven Be multiplied to thee, Her joysin blest fruition Yours,heightened endlessly. We all must miss the friendly smile, The cheery, pleasant tone, But He, the Authcr of all life Now claims what is his own. And thus, no requiem we swell To note your blissful change From thrall of earth,no dismal knell, No dirge will we arrange. But bid you lovingly farewell! While angels', parents sing, 'Well done.' And friends uncounted, christen you 'lheir 'Good Samaritan.' As 'Carrier dove' from spheres above Oft bear us gifts of peace, And we with you, will strive anew To meet each blest increase, Of truth and light and love, That virgins wise approve. East Canterbury, N. H.
