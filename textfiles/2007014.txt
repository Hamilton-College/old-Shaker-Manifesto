MULTUM IN PARVO. Benjamin H. Smith. We have just sung, '-Grain by grain the treasure's won.' Now a grain is a very small affair ; but life is made up of small things. The man who goes through life constantly saving in little ways finally possesses considerable property. It is constancy, that ensures success and the want of it brings failure. If we attempt to cultivate a field, and hoe one day and then rest off a while the weeds get the better of us. We shall all find the same experience spiritually. We must keep at the work of gaining a little every day. 'Grain by grain' may be a very slow process but if the grains are of gold a man would find himself rich who had patiently accumulated them; and the Christian meets the same result. Canterbury, N. H. [The above was spoken in our Sunday service.]
