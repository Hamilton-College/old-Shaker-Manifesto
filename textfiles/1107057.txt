Cement FOR Leather One who has tried every thing says that after an experience of fifteen years he has found nothing to equal the following as a cement for leather belting: Common glue and isinglass, equal parts, soaked for ten hours in just enough water to cover them. Bring gradually to a boiling heat, and add pure tannin until the whole becomes ropy or appears like the white of eggs- Buff off the surfaces to be joined, apply this cement, and clamp firmly.
