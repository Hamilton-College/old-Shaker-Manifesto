AN AUTUMN VISIT TO SHAKER VILLAGE. The autumn chill is in the air The flowers are slowly dying, 'Tis good bye summer everywhere, The leaves are turning colors rare, The birds are southward flying. While traveling in New York State in the Autumn of 1885 I had opportunity to visit the Shakers at Watervliet of which I readily availed myself. The lady with whom I went, had been there several times, and had some acquaintance with the people. Having myself spent a portion of my childhood in a shaker community and although twenty five years have elapsed since, still, my recollections of this people are as distinct as possible. The day of my visit was a perfect one for the time of the year. The crispness of the morning air told of coming frosts while the balmy warmth of mid-day sunshine made it seem that summer was giving autumn a place with reluctance, and lingering regret. The country through which we rode was rich with beautiful orchards, where the trees fairly bent beneath their burden of fruit; these were succeeded by fields where the story of a plentiful harvest was told by heaps of yellow corn and golden pumpkins. Even the golden rod and frost flower made the roadside gay, while the woods were gorgeous with every hue that can charm the eye and captivate the artistic soul. At length we came to our destination and ' I knew by the smoke that so gracefully curled Above the green elms that a village was near And I said if there's peace to be found in the world, The heart that is humble may look for it here.' And we were in Shaker Village, there was a feeling of peace and rest in the very air We went to the Second Family and were received with such a genuine welcome that I felt like one come home after long years of wandering. We were subsequently shown into the neatest of neat rooms to await our dinner which they told us would be prepared very soon. Sister Nancy who came to show us to the dining room in simple hospitality made us kindly welcome. I cannot give the bill of fareï¿½ suffice it to say, the viands were abundant and appetizing and we did the good things before us ample justice. After dinner the Eldresses came to show us around the buildings where everything was in perfect order. We entered one room where some young sisters kindly sang for us while one of them played the cabinet organ. At my request they also very kindly sang' me an old fashio .ed melody which made the years so melt away, that I could almost fancy myself again a Shaker sister like themselves crowned with the snowy cap and wearing the quaint kerchief. They then conducted us out through the garden where although most of the produce had been already harvested there was much left to admire. There were barberries growing in abundance the largest I had ever seen some of which they gave us. I have n^jne yet the fruit still being red and perfect. Returning again to the office which was our starting point we parted from them with a kind farewell and a cordial invitation to visit them again. The entire interview could not have lasted two hours yet as long as memory shall keep its place in my heart I shall remember the noble Eldress and her gentle companion Sister 11. yea and love them too. When we started homeward I felt I was leaving dear friends. I could not but feel that theirs was a peace which the world could neither give nor take away. We left the dear sisters with a blessing and a kind good night. A.P. C
