HOME QUESTIONS. SARAH S. WOODS. Am I improving my time to the best advantage? Do I exercise my mind and hands to accomplish the most my strength and ability will permit ? Am I as efficient as I might make myself? Would I not exert myself more to promote a selfish interest, or to gratify ambition, than my interest to promote the commonwealth stimulates me to? Am I not too selfish to make the sacrifice required of a faithful steward, devoting all my services to my Master's interest, that I may be entrusted with the true riches ? If I am not faithful in the righteous mammon who will commit to my trust the true riches ? Canterbury, N. H.
