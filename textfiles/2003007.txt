WHAT IS SHAKERISM? George St. John. The above question was asked the writer by a friend not long since, and as possibly the same query may be propounded by some reader of this paper�not of oar order,�the reply may properly be given here. There is nothing obscure, puzzling, or metaphysical about Shakerism ; it does not require that one should have a collegiate education, or be profoundly versed in theological lore to enable him to penetrate its obscurities, or sound its depths. It cannot be said of Shakerism as a New England writer said of transcendentalism when asked to define it, that it is 'a soaring after the unattainable, and diving after the unfathomable.' Nay, Shakerism is so plain that ' 'he who runs may read,' and 'the way-faring man though a fool, cannot err therein.' Here are the fundamentals of Shakerism.�'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and mind, and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself.' 'Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you.' 'Cease to do evil, learn to do well.' 'If thou bring thy gift to the Altar�of God's service�and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift.' 'Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart.'' 'If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us ; but if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' 'Owe no man anything, but to love one another.' 'Let us walk honestly as in the day.' 'Be not conformed to this world.' 'Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.' 'Bless and curse not.' 'Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.' 'He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest.' They that are Christs, have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts. 'Blessed are the peace-makers. Blessed are the pure in heart.' Superadded to this, Shakerism re- quires a life of virgin purity as taught and lived by Jesus ; a baptism of the spirit in the waters of repentance as typified by his baptism in the waters of Jordan ; and as in his case, so in ours, we must be baptized 'confessing our sins.' As our Savior and his disciples and the ' early Christian church 'had all things in common,' so Shakerism in its temporalities follows in the same path, and its disciples live the same communal life. As the teachings of Jesus were of God, so Shakerism is not a man-made faith, but is of God; divine : and as our Savior 'learned obedience by the things he suffered,' so Shakerism holds that through trial and temptation, by resistance and self-abnegation, by a daily bearing of one's cross regardless of its form and the weight of the burden, by humility, charity and self-denial, by love and by prayer, a way is opened for man to enter into 'that rest which remaineth for the children of God.' Such in brief is Shakerism. Canterbury, N. H.
