THOUGHTS FOR TO-DAY Abstract Christianity It is well to remember that an abstract Christianity is neither useful nor beautiful. The value of it is only seen when it becomes a habit of living. The most shapely and beautiful garment loses its symmetry and beauty when it is cast off, and laid upon a couch or hung on a peg. Let it be put on by its owner, and you at once perceive its comeliness. Something like this is true of the religion of Christ. It is not meant to be judged or criticised apart from the lives of men. But when the robe of Christ's righteousness is put on and worn its beauty is revealed to all beholders.â€”Sunday Afternoon. PHOTOGRAPHS The Publishers As the Gospel of Christ is prohibitory of worldly vanity, pride, and ambition for the distinction of certain members of the Household of faith above their Brethren and Sisters, and as the temporal property of the Shaker Community is all consecrated to the support of its people in the service of God in the use, simply, of those things that are needful and profitable unto righteousness, and the promulgation of the Gospel Testimony, its publishers deem the use of Societies' funds for the procurement of photographs to be in contravention of that sacred consecration, and as militating against that harmony, meekness, love and fraternal equality which characterizes the true members of the Church of Christ. Our motto should be personalities absorbed by principles.
