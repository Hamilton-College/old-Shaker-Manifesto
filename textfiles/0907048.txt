PHOTOGRAPHS The Publishers As the Gospel of Christ is prohibitory of worldly vanity, pride, and ambition for the distinction of certain members of the Household of faith above their Brethren and Sisters, and as the temporal property of the Shaker Community is all consecrated to the support of its people in the service of God in the use, simply, of those things that are needful and profitable unto righteousness, and the promulgation of the Gospel Testimony, its publishers deem the use of Societies' funds for the procurement of photographs to be in contravention of that sacred consecration, and as militating against that harmony, meekness, love and fraternal equality which characterizes the true members of the Church of Christ. Our motto should be personalities absorbed by principles.
