THE WORK OF ALBERT LYNCH THE WORK OF ALBERT LYNCH. A lbert Lynch, whose work is becoming so much more generally known to Americans through his drawings in Scribner's Magazine and his cover designs for The Ladies' Home Journal is Peruvian by birth, but of English parentage. He is only thirty-three years of age, and of extremely retiring disposition. He is unmarried and lives in Paris. The young artist commands the highest prices for his work, his smallest water-color paintings read ily selling for $600 to $900 each. In 1893 he received the Salon's first prize for his beautiful panel of 'Spring,' showing a single figure. This picture won the admiration of the French art critics and the public to such an unusual degree that the painting was sold for a fabulous sum to a private Paris buyer. Recently The Ladies' Home Journal acquired all publication rights to this painting, and it will serve as one of the cover designs for that magazine. The next issue of the Journal will also have a design by Lynch, portraying his. conception of a woman's ideal costume. A succession of other cover designs by Lynch will follow these two.
