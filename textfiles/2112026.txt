Shakers, N. Y. Nov. 1891. We have all our crops housed for the winter. We have had a lagre supply, of apples, 270 barrels for Avinter use, and 750 barrels for vinegar. Since this month came in we have bid a long farewell to two of our beloved aged friends. Sister Catherine was one of six sisters, and all of them closed their days as members of our Community. All were persons of integrity and fully devoted to the gospel cause. The grandmother of sister Catherine was the first to embrace the faith after Mother xlnn came to America. She often walked the distance of three miles to attend religious worship, and Mother Ann would often say to the Sisters, 'Nellie is coming, be ready to meet her.' She passed through severe trials as her husband was bitterly opposed to her religious faith, and did all he could to prevent her from being a Believer. Sister Catherine's father and mother accepted the faith of Believers, and permitted their children to do the same. J. B.
