Alfred., Me. Nov. 1894. The President has appointed the 29th of this month as a National Thanksgiving. Our Society can well unite in the thanksgiving. Our fields, orchards and the work of our hands have all been blessed, therefore we have cause for thankfulness. Not for one day only but every day in the year we rejoice and give thanks to the Giver of all good gifts that we have a knowledge of the truth as revealed through Christ in His first and second appearing. Obedience to this truth, lifts us above the selfishness and sinfulness of a worldly life. The cross of Christ is burdensome, only to those who seek for self-pleasure instead of self-denial. Christ said 'take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, for my yoke is easy and my bui'den is light.' Every soul who is willing to wear this yoke in humility of spirit will find it easy, and the burden light. It is the burden of sin that is heavy, and grievous to be borne. We are saved from such burdens by an honest confession of all sin. Thank God for this blessed knowledge of the truth. May we continue in the way of well-doing, glorying not, save in the cross of Christ. For a few days the ground has been white with snow, and the atmosphere quite like winter. As late as the 4th of this month one of the young Sisters made a beautiful bouquet from flowers grown in the open air without protection, showing how long the warm days continued with us. Let us magnify the good things and we shall be less inclined to dwell upon our trials. To Br. Alonzo Hollister we extend our love and sincere thanks for the little books of Bible Lessons. We realize the vast amount of labor it must have cost him to prepare such a book, but be assured kind Brother your labor is not lost. Our young people are delighted with it and will peruse it with deep interest. Dear Gospel kindred accept our love and kindly greeting. With you we earnestly pray for the prosperity of Zion upon earth. Fannie Casey.
