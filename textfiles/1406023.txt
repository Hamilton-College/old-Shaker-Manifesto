A SWARM OF BEES. JOSEPH WOODS. Jesus said: ' Be perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect. ' To obey this command, it is requisite that we should do as well as we know how. Our Heavenly Father with his infinite knowledge can do no more. To meet the requirement, it is necessary that we Be watchful; Be prayerful; Be careful of our words and actions ; Be charitable ; Be honest; Be kindly affectioned one toward another; Be forgiving; Be merciful; Be pure; Be peace-makers; Be sure we are right before commencing anything, whether of a temporal nature or spiritual interest; Be steadfast; Be what we seem to be, and seem to be what we really areBe industrious and active, soul and body Whoever indulges in idleness, will find sooner or later, that time thus spent is lost. It is one of the strong holds of the Adversary whereby he helps some individuals to make their profession nothing but a sham. Be thankful; Be pru'lent and saving of the temporal blessings given; Be interested in all that pertains to our spiritual welfare, and he so earnestly devoted to the work of the gospel, that those not of us, may take knowledge of us, as did the Jews of Peter and John, that we have not only been with Jesus, but hold a relationship and union in the spirit never to be marred nor broken. St. Paul said; 'I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, principalities nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height nor depth nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. ' We should be more than persuaded. Be not indifferent; Be true to principle : How great the privilege to be and do good. Canterbury, N. H.
