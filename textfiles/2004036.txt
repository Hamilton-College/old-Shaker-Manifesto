Blessed are ye when men shall revile you... Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and he exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Matt, v., 11, 12. Although all of the Savior's promises are equally comforting and necessary for our highest good and happiness, it is in times of trouble, when sufferiug under false accusations and bitter persecutions, as a result of doing our duty, that this blessed promise comes to us with ten-fold power. How many aching hearts have been comforted and sustained by it. To how many Christian martyrs it has given fortitude, and brought that peace of spirit that flows like a river. We all need hope and comfort but it is the sorrowing heart that needs it most. Fred Worthington.
