Lines upon a caged lark LINES UPON A CAGED LARK. A cruel deed It is, sweet bird, to cage thee up Prisoner for life, with just a cup And a box of seed, And sod to move on barely one foot square, Hung o'er dark street, midst foul and murky air. From freedom brought, And robbed of every chance of wing, Thou couldst have had no heart to sing, One would have thought. But though thy song is sung, men little know The yearning source from which those sweet notes flow. Poor little bird ! As often as I think of thee, ' And how thou longest to be free, My heart is stirred, And, were my strength but equal to my rage, Methinks thy eager would be in his cage. The selfish man ! To take thee from thy broader sphere, Where thousands- heard thy music clear On Nature's plan; And where the listening landscape far and wide Had joy, and thou thy liberty beside. A singing slave Made now ; with no return but food ; No mate to love, nor little brood To feed and save ; No cool and leafy haunts; the cruel wires Chafe thy young life and check thy just desires. Brave little bird 1 Still striving with thy sweetest song To melt the hearts that do the wrong, I give my word To stand with those who for their freedom fight, Who claim for thee that freedom as thy right.
