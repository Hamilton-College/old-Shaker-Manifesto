CHRISTIANITY. Dr. Carl. Christianity is that system of religion which Christ founded in his First and Second Appearing on earth for the good of all mankind to lift them tip from sin and the lower order of passion which is bringing all to one sad end. This only true system of religion is to transform man into the image of heavenly saints. Like a great ship set off in a rough sea, it had to break the waves of opposing elements of the world and with Satan's hosts, which has ever been combined for its over-throw, as we learn from the Testimonies of the Life, Character, Revelations and Doctrines of Mother Ann and the Elders with her. O what a glorious gospel we have s:iven us through their tribulations for our good. Let us shout praises to God for these precious truths given to us, which are truly glorious in their origin. Glorious in their aim, glorious in their conquests�God owns them, angels smile upon them, saints rejoice in them, and devils dread them. But my dear reader, though this Holy Gospel be so glorious, so benevolent, and so energetic in its nature, none can by any means share its triumph but those who accept it in their faith, enjoy it in their hearts and practice it in their lives. To accept the Gospel of Christ, Christianity, is to believe and accept Christ; to follow in his footsteps, in accepting his teaching, precepts and examples these must go together in our lives. And every man stands in the way of the gospel, who does not accept Christ. Christ said, 'He that is not with me, is against me and he thatgathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.' The Gospel has evidently suffered greater loss at the hands of many wh:&gt; claim to be its friends than from those who have sworn hostility to it. Many, too many, indeed, have made it a cloak that they may be the more efficient to accomplish their work of ruin. The dagger concealed in the heart of the hypocrite is more to be feared, than the uplifted hand of the open foe. Brethren and Sisters, the Christ whom ye have received is a Shield. Keep him between you and the world for every one who receives Christ, is made a voluntary, resolute agent on his own part, a determined, moral hero, who works, who strives, who fights, in prayer, that he may overcome self. To such, Christ is a present help in time of need, but he helps no oue to live a Christ life who does not try to help himself, and abides in no oue who does not abide in him, but whose desire is to give and to bless, to make men better and Christ-like, and labor to transform the whole earth into God's kingdom. This Christian spirit, breathed into the heart by the Holy Spirit, finding expression in all forms of benevolence, in all efforts to elevate the race, and spread the blessed Gospel to all mankind is the only true Christianity. Paul was so filled with this burning Christian love, that he regarded the claims of humanity upon him as a debt�and am a debtor both to the Greek and the Barbarians. Both to the wise and the unwise.�Yea a d.btor to the whole world. Not to the rich only, but to the poor, not to the Greek only, but to the ignorant barbarian�and am in debt to all is the language of Paul's great heart of love for all mankind. Shall we not labor for this spirit of Christian love and then fulfill the command of Christ; he says, 'Go ye into the world and teach the gospel to every creature.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
