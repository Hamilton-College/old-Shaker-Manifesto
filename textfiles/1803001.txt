MATERNAL SPIRIT. Anna White. Oh, Mother! hear our earnest prayer; We look to thee for strength and care. Thou art our fortress and our stay, Thou art the Light, the Truth, the Way. Thou art the Bride arrayed in white; And revelation's perfect light Eeveals to us that thou art She Who was, who is, and is to be. Who was, when light from chaos sprang, And morning stars together sang; Who is the second Christ divine, The lily fair and blooming vine; The Heavenly Comforter in need, From whence all goodness doth proceed; And rich are we who share her love 'Tis pure as nectar from above. And thou art She who is to be Soul-centre of humanity; Above all other hills shall stand The scepter planted by thy hand, Where eagles thither shall be led To waters pure and living bread; For where the body pitch theii tent, Exalted spirits oft are sent. Such find just what their souls desire, The cleansing fount and furnace fire ; These will refine from earthly dross, Make holy by a daily cross. Oh blessed Spirit! brood o'er earth, And teach man of the second birth, How he must die if life would win And heaven's kingdom enter in. How all must suffer ere they reign Triumphant over sin and pain, And willing sacrifices make Ere they pure heavenly joys partake. Maternal Soul! to us most dear, Embrace thy children far and near; Our feet as pillars fast shall be Our hearts, made glad, rejoice in thee. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
