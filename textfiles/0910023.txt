To the Generous Of course, reader, you are the generous one meant, whoever you as reader may be. We will not bore you with uninteresting words. We want to state, frankly to you, that in this enterprise of issuing thousands of copies of The Manifesto, monthly, we are at large expense, and must rely on every generous heart with whom we come in contact to help us ' bear our burdens.' ' Let tlie strong (help) bear the burdens of the weak.' At the end of the year we want to be one with our printers. We now owe them between two and three hundreds of dollars, which we want to pay them as soon as possible. Will you help us what you are able ? It costs nearly or quite one hundred dollars to run our mailing expenses on The Manifesto for a year. We neither charge nor get pay for our services, and although our paper is small, these are not a few; but of this we will say nothing more. But will those who have generous hearts think of us to help us ? Shakers should be most generous ; and the generosity comes in after just debts due are paid. But let every one be generous—kind friends all, help us keep the good work moving — the sowing of good seed, the reaping of good souls.
