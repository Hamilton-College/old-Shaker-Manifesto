CIVILIZATION BY THE SWORD! Of The Yates Co. Chronicle wo have had many good words to say; but when it imparts so reprehensible a doctrine as ''The civilization of Africa even by means of the sword which so often affords the only means of opening a way into barbaric regions, is a thing to be hoped for!' then we object very strongly to its religious influences. It is too late in the day for editors of moral and religious periodicals, and certainly too late for socalled ministers of the gospel, to make appeals to the sword for aid, in extending civilization or religion. Already we hear from the highest representations of civil and military circles Â¦extensive deprecations concerning weapons of warfare. Let not these chieftains excel in advocacy of arbitration and peace ! When has the sword succeeded ? To that grand old historical character, Wra, Penn, let us look for the brightest, best, and ever and only successful means of civilization ever known. Pay for what you want, when the owners are ready to sell: and after offering every inducement, wait until they are ready. See the foolishness of N. 0. Meeker of forcing Indians to use the plough! Muskets on one side, ploughs on the others, and then a raid upon their limiting grounds and customs ! Meeker invited his slaughter ; and because of his massacre, when attacking the rights of the Indians, his daughter exhibits an insight to her training, by calling on the IT. S. government to 'exterminate the race, for all the red skins extant are not worth one white man.' If so her father thought, and he acted so, he only received the effects of which he alone was the cause. According to the statement of an Indian chief, to the writer of this, Indians never fought with each other, nor the whites, until incited to do so by the aggressions of white men. Let us use heathens and Indians with kindness and humanity; and every experience of the past is declarative of there being an excess of such compliments returned by them.
