Eldress Malinda Buckhannan Eldress Malinda Buckhannan, at Union Village, O. Dec. 24, 1890. Age 91 yrs. 7 mo. 17 days. She embraced the gospel in her childhood in 1805 and for 84 yrs. has lived a holy life without spot or blemish. She retained her mental faculties nearly to the end of her long and useful life. Although conservative by nature she was fully able to intelligently appreciate any and all improvements and progressed methods among Believers, while yet holding to the esoteric principles of our most holy cause with a faith and firmness that no amount of adversity, sorrow or outward disaster could ever shake. 'The memory of such is like ointment and balm,' and she has gone to possess a diadem of peace and a crown of resplendent glory that fadeth not away. O. C. Hampton.
