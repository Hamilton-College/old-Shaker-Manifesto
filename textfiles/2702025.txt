Editor begins the New Year and the new volume with a confidence that assures us that he knows he is right and is determined to 'go ahead.' His introductory chapter is well worth a careful perusal, even tho we should conclude to let the stars take their own course unnoticed. 'Would to God that we could incite every man, woman and child who shall read Word and Works during 1897 to the loftiest, most determined resolutions and efforts of their lives for the year upon which we now enter. Resolutions to achieve all that God has made possible for us.' With this incentive toward a better humanity, there is a Christian hope well worthy of our emulation. Valuable and interesting articles are also to be found in Word and Works, that have a practical bearing on our Religious and Social life. Even the best interests of the little children are considered from month to month and a special corner appropriated for their nice contributions. Publisht by Word and Works Pub.
