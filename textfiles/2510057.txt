Every Where Have Flowers Any Rights? This question is discussed, both in prose and poetry, in Will Carleton's Newspaper Magazine, Every. Where, for August. The great roadway of the lakes to the ocean, the lordly St. Lawrence River, is treated, both by poet and artist. Dozens of other features peculiar to this most original of papers, are at their best in the current number. Fifty cents a year; ten cents for sample copies and agents' outfit.
