MOTHER'S CLOSET. And this is the place* which was Mother's dark prison, All one dreary night when this cottage was new; The wicked surrounding, till morning hud risen, To smile on the wilderness, glittering with dew. The history told me has oft been repeated, But now its impression is painfully mine; A dreadful imprisonment�though it defeated The purpose of men m their cruel design. The thoughts of that scene and the dread suffocation, To such narrow limits consigned, for the night, The rioters threatening, with fierce indignation; It surely presents us a heart-chilling sight. We think with regret on the painful inaction; But dear was the life which they sought to protect; Yet have we not looked with undue satisfaction, On that self-possession which thus should direct? How different the mansion which she was preparing For those who were seeking her life to destroy; How unlike the message her voice was declaring, Good news of salvation, 'glad tidings of joy.' What manner of men with pretensions to honor Could this peaceful cottage the whole night surround; 'Surrender that woman, our hands are upon her,' Say they 'or your dwelling shall come to the ground.' One thing I am happy to learn from tradition, That no delegation was sent from this town] Some three or four others, in that expedition, Must share all the fame with those 'men of renown.' At length from the meeting they send a petition, 'A young woman wishes to pass through the crowd To go to her child;'�she is granted permission, Although to none else was this favor allowed. By this honest plea was her exit effected, And word to the proper authorities sent; Who, knowing that all should &gt;by law be protected, In duty were bound such abuse to prevent. What must they have thought when this whole delegation Were fed by her order whose life they design; When kindly they furnish a generous collation, 'Twas surely a strange invitation to dine. * * * 'What means,' they inquire, 'the riotous meeting, Surrounding this dwelling the whole night, of course ? * Alluding to the small closet in which she was placed and concealed by a bureau placed before the door. f Shirley, Mass. Now, m�n, in the name of the Commonwealth greeting, We bid you disperse, or the law we enforce.' The rioters leave with pretended submission, But Mother soon tells you of 'visions of blood,' They follow the Elders, while yet on their mission, The dragon resolving to pour out his flood. Our unyielding heralds of peace and miration, By these cruel men were to Harvard pursued : And now they are treated as foes to thenatien, What language can picture the scene which ensued ? * * * * A chosen Committee report Resolutions, Well cheered by the throng, that the two English Priests For doctrines adverse to their Church institution? Be faithfully scourged and then fully released. 'James Whittaker first may prepare for the sentence;' For he was chief speaker and mighty in truth: His eloquent preaching of faith and repeutanc � Was rapidly gaining American youth. * * * By choice of a man in his full strength and vigor, Who toils until weary, then rests to renew, The blows were inflicter-l with unsparing rigor, In numbers the stripes must have been,�not a few. The story I've heard as all parties have told it, (On both sides at least it is just to remark,) So painful the scene, should you chance to unfold it, You scarcely can draw the sad picture too dark, But let me forbear as we leave to the reader, The sad contemplation of good Elder James; The call was then made 'William Lee the chief leader,' And thus to the multitude Father proclaims : 'I will not be bound to that tree like my brother, But kneel down and suffer what God lets you do,' Which done, they commence, just the same as the other, And all were expecting the same would go through. The Brethren and Sisters were held by that party, For each claimed a preference in sharing the blows; Such ardent affection, so pure and so hearty, From true Christian feeling undoubtedly flows. Though faint from his wounds, we behold the young poacher, Rush forward to rescue his Elder and friend. 'Not satisfied yet,' says the Court-martial teacher, 'Another such lesson your fashions will mend.' This generous adventure throws all in commotion, The angels of mercy appear in the cloud, And now a young Sister with equal devotion, Escapes at this moment the grasp of the crowd. On him, as the merciless blows are repeating, Her person she throws at the risk of her lifePermit me, to fancy the demons retreating, And leaving those men to continue the strife. She instantly meets, for this prompt interference, A blow in the face from that powerful arm; The blood gushes freely, which makes her appearance, The object of sudden and painful alarm. A voice from the crowd, and by Wisdom's direction, At this fearful moment is now heard to say, 'The man who is pledged for that woman's protection Will make you repent of the deeds of this day.' Thus viewing the medium of vengeance so clearly, The man with the scourge is alarmed for the first, Or they might have finished their lives, very nearly, That noble young convert prevented the worst. Wherever this gospel is preached to the nations, This act a memorial shall be to her name;* While warriors, and heroes, and men of high station, Descend to oblivion's shades with their fame. She told me her story, with tears and deep feeling, When I was a youth, I remember ib well; A moral impression, indelibly sealing, Which must in the cause of humanity tell. Well might she rejoice at dispersing the riot, From these worthy Fathers averting the blowt; 'Twas her happy mission the tumult to quiet, And give to her dearest companions repose, [ing,' They kneel in the valley, without 'wrath and doubtAnd fervently prayed for their enemies there ; Then 'lift holy hands' and with angelic shouting, Their sweet consolation serenely declare. At close of this day of severe persecution, (A day and a night was their life in the deep,) They gather together, at this Institution, Recounting the scenes at which angels might weep. Says Mother, 'Well, James, you were cruelly treated But you must forgive them who did you the wrong.' 'Forgive them, my God,' was the prayer he repeated When Mother resumes her melodious song. All join in the chorus of praise, for protection, To Mother extended in that fearful night; What spirit could give this pacific direction, To hearcs thus oppressed, without justice or right? The story as told us, is so evidential Of Christ and his gospel, we are not at a loss, In all we discover the one thing essential, The power of salvation, the power of the cross. * Jemima Blanchard. -The Millionaire.
