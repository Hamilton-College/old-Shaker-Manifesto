Why should we say farewell... Frederic I. Stebbins. Lines written upon the occasion of the funeral of Brother Richard Quimby at Sonyea, N. Y., Jan. 21., 1889. Why should we say farewell, Thou art not far away ! Thy spirit meek and kind We feel with us to-day, And love and tenderness Thy presence doth impart. 'Twill glow in sympathy, Each prayerful waiting heart. Our thanks to thee we bring, For testimonies sure, Simple and few thy words, Thy life sincere and pure. Thy mem'ry, ever fresh, Shall in our hearts abide, The witness of an honest life The true Believer's pride. The lessons of thy life, To each of us shall be, A fervent trust in God, And deep humility. Groveland, N. Y.
