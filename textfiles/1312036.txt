House and Farm Professor Threadwell, of Massachusetts... Professor Threadwell, of Massachusetts, found that a half-grown American robin in confinement ate in one day sixty eight worms, weighing together one ounce and a half, as much as the bird himself, and another had previously starved upon a daily allowance of eight or ten worms, or about twenty per cent of his own weight.

It will also almost always stop excessive hemorrhage from a cavity caused by the extraction of a tooth, by being placed in it. It is not wise to go out in the early morning air before eating at least a few mouthfuls. Especially ought this precaution to be strictly observed in malarial sections, and in seasons when much sickness is over the country. Nothing can be more unwise than to go into a sick-room fasting, and when the sickness is contagious, the result may be dangerous if not fatal.
