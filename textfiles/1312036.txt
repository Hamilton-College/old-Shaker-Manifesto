In troublesome bleeding from the nose... In troublesome bleeding from the nose, snuffing up powdered alum will generally control it. It will also almost always stop excessive hemorrhage from a cavity caused by the extraction of a tooth, by being placed in it. It is not wise to go out in the early morning air before eating at least a few mouthfuls. Especially ought this precaution to be strictly observed in malarial sections, and in seasons when much sickness is over the country. Nothing can be more unwise than to go into a sick-room fasting, and when the sickness is contagious, the result may be dangerous if not fatal.
