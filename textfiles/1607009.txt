REPLY TO THE BOSTON JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. By the kindness of some unknown friend, I have received a copy of the ' Boston Journal Supplement, ' of February 27, 1886, calling my attention to, an article headed ' Shakerism ' (marked.) Some things in it are true and some are false; but the spirit and tone of the whole article is calculated to mis' lead the public mind and to misrepresent the moral character of the Shakers generally, and its first founder. It begins with the following :�'It is said, that Elder Frederic Evans, one of the most prominent leaders of Shakerism, deplores the decrease in numbers of that sect. ' This is true, and somewhat complimentary; but he is not alone. There are others among the Shakers who admit the decrease in their numbers in every community of theirs in the IT. S., and deplore their loss, and have for years. They look upon it as a 'calamity,' of which they have been forewarned; brought about by causes over which they had no control, nor could have. Again we quote from the Journal. 'They are no longer a by-word for honesty and fair dealing.' This is not true, and what is not true is false. We do not know exactly, but we will venture to say, there are more than five, yea more than ten, (a sufficient number if they had all been righteous, to have saved an ancient city from destruction,) Shakers can be found in every community of ours in the U. S. who are men and women, distinguished for 'honesty and fair dealing, ' as much as they were in the days of their greatest prosperity. ' They still hold on to the original faith of Shakerism in all its essentials, especially in living lives of virgin celibacy; -when they cease to do this, they cease to be Shakers. As long as there are ten souls left in every Society, who are carrying out practically, original Shakerism, in their daily walk and conversation, their reputation is established throughout the whole civilized world, as far as they are known. It is understood, to be a true Shaker, is to become an honest man, and an honest woman, or in other words to be a true Christian, a follower of the meek and lowly Jesus, they are synonymous terms, and the reason why some try to be Shakers and fail, is because they are not honest to confess every known sin which they are guilty of, to God, and before one or more of his chosen witnesses ; they then try to palm the blame, or cause of their failure, off, on the Shakers ; but nothing but strict honesty before God, and his holy angels, will ever stand the test. The reputation of the Shakers is established, and cannot be overthrown by any such garbling writer as#is found in the 'Boston Journal Supplement' of February 27 1886. Let us see what more he has to say against the Shakers. 'You must accept as inspiration their peculiar views and faith in the second coining of Christ, in the person of an uneducated and uncultured woman, taken from the lower ranks of society in the factory districts of England, and whose standard of morals was not very pure nor elevated, as* was well known in those days. ' It was well known too in those days that 'Ann Lee,' to whom this writer alludes, was not a person of doubtful reputation, but sustained a good moral character from her youth up, being born of poor but respectable parents, and was uneducated. Having lost a devout mother when young, she associated and affiliated with a small society of Friends, called ' Quakers ' whose standard of morals was equal, if not superior to any church in England. On account of her extraordinary gifts of visions and revelations, she was recognized as a leader among them, and by whom she received the endearing appellation of 'Mother Ar.n, ' and was ever afterwards called so, and well did she sustain that character while in the body. It was well known in those days which were more than one hundred years ago, that 'Mother Ann' had friends, who were personally acquainted with her, and knew more about her than her enemies, who knew nothjng but by false reports and malignant slanderers and in whose sight, to be uneducated was a crime ; this was her crime. But her friends who stood by her in every emergency tell another story. When it was publicly known that she was endowed with the gift of tongues, and other apostolic gifts, some of the nobility and clergymen, had a curiosity to hear her speak for themselves. She consented to be interviewed and criticized by them. When arraigned before them, they said to her, 'We have heard that you speak in unknown tongues, and dialects of different nationalities. We understand the languages, and would like to hear you for ourselves. ' She_ modestly replied,�' Of myself I can do nothing! but, if I have the gift, I can speak what is given me. ' Suddenly the gift came upon her, and she spoke* in several different languages and dialects. Her interviewers were satisfied, astonished, and confounded. She went so far beyond anything they ever knew, that they counselled her enemies and persecutors to refrain, and to beware what they do as touching the moral character of that woman, tor we have now heard her for ourselves, and find no fault in her; but much that is praiseworthy. She is controlled by a superior power, above that which is human. Of herself, she knows no language but the English. 'Again, we say, refrain from that woman and let her alone. ' This shows conclusively that Mother Ann w-as educated in a higher school than the arts and sciences of worldlyr literature, although good in their place; but they are all on the intellectual plane, and can never be substituted for the development of the moral and spiritual faculties, on the higher plane. Thousands have progressed on to the intellectual plane in this day, and there stop. They have never entered the Christ sphere; neither in the body nor out, consequently they are not saved. This is the reason why they know so little about Christ, and some deny him altogether, both in the body and out; not because they are intellectual, but because they are carnal, sensual, earthly, devilish, and unholy. But Mother Ann fully entered the Christ sphere while in the body, and was thoroughly educated in the school of Christ, by which she was enabled to cope with the most profound scholars in England. By the law of analogy and reason, I am constrained to say, that what the Jewish nation was nearly two thousand years ago, the English nation is to the surrounding nations of Europe today, because evidently both nations were chosen and ordained of God, to usher in the gospel of Christ's first and second appearing; two of the greatest events ever recorded in history, and may yet prove to be so in the end. Jesus was born a Jew, and lived a Jew, and kept the law of the Jews, and fulfilled its requirements by abstaining from its violations and living a pure life, such as God did own and bless, inviting us to follow his example and the whole human race likewise to do the same or suffer the ' penalties ' annexed for living in violation of that law. What are the penalties annexed? They are the awful calamities which are visited upon the nations of the earth, by sea and by land all over the world; too awful to relate, and too common and too heart-rending to need a recapitulation, and growing worse and worse every year. The Nor have we any evidence that these calamities will cease until 'they have accomplished the work where unto they are sent, ' which is to put an end to sin, and to bring in an everlasting righteousness, which is unto all, and upon all them that believe and obey ' Christ' not Adam. Nearly two thousand years ago Jesus of Nazareth was crucified on Mount Calvary, between two theives, as an impostor; but now is proclaimed the only Savior of the world throughout Christendom, and is believed on in the world by millions of the human race; is made the second person in the adorable Trinity of three infinite Gods, all in the masculine gender begetting an offspring. Surely! 'Tall oaks from little acorns grow. ' I used to think that one infinite God was enough and covered the whole ground. Where is the Bible? Let us have it 'revised' and make it mean something else! This doctrine is too absurd to be swallowed in the nineteenth century. I would advise our opponent in the ' Boston Journal' who complains of the Shakers who ignore the married life and require the separation of families with entire self-abnegation from relatives and friends together with a rigid compliance with the rules and discipline of the order, to go and join the 'Moral Keform Society' in America. North Union, Ohio. [The article that was published in the Boston Journal, under the title of ' Shakerism,' did not seem to us as worthy of a reply, as the writer is quite well known to the Shakers of New Hampshire. He has been a member of one of onv families, some half a dozen times and as many times dismissed from the Society. In another article this writer might interest the readers of the Journal, if he would relate his own personal experiences among the Shakers.� Ed.] v
