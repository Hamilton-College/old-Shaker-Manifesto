Canaan, N. Y. Jan. 3, 1893. Oxce more we have celebrated the anniversary of the advent of Christianity, and had a very pleasant time, although we met with some disappointment. We had anticipated meeting with our friends from the North Family to hold a social entertainment, but as the weather (over which we have no control) did not favor uï¿½ we made the best of it. One good thing, however, it was just the right weather for forming ice, and on the -27th ult. our Brethren stored the yearly supply of ice of finest quality. New Year's day we were somewhat compensated for our previous disappointment, for we had the pleasure of having our loved Ministry with us to spend the day, and we enjoyed the privilege, which is not ours very often. They were ministers of that strength and blessing which ever flows from the pure in heart, and in this renewed strength we will abide through the coming year. We think they began the year just right by visiting the least of the flock, first. It was indeed a time of refreshing, a feast of good things, spiritual and intellectual. How much better to spend time and strength in the accumulation and distribution of true riches than superfluous trifles, the so-called customary Christmas gifts which require the cost of time and money to obtain. This practice is good for those not of our order, who live in the selfish relations of this world, if once a year they can enlarge their hearts and extend their sympathies beyond the family circle limit, it is well; but a religious community living above selfish relationships should have something better to impart. The Apostle exhorted the people in his day to covet earnestly the best gifts. By curtailing desire to necessity; being satisfied with comfort and convenience ana discarding the frivolous and superfluous, more time and opportunity can be given to the cultivation of the intellectual and spiritual powers. Through the year we will garner the fruits of the gospel, love, joy, peace, charity, forbearance, consistency and gentleness, that we may have wherewith to feed other souls and to impart to our dear Brethren and Sisters, both old and young, not only at Christmas and New Years, but from day to day.
