The i%apid flight of time gives us so little rest between the Notes about Home, that should they all be written in one key, it will be because the vibrations of one have not died away, before it is time to begin the next. This bitter, cold weather is not conducive to many but shivering notes. While such intense cold, with little snow works so much mischief, we realize the wisdom of the Scripture which says, 'He giveth snow like wool;'' for surely with a heavy mantle of snow covering the earth we can so much better bear the Zero weather. Snow as an embankment about the house, closes many a windy passage, and also protects the water pipes; but 'It is an ill wind that blows no good.' The cold without snow gave us an early harvest of clear, good ice which was secured between Christmas and New Years. Thanks to Elder Oliver for considering the August 'Notes.' To his suggestion we heartily say Amen! When we will all agree to more nearly balance our material wants with our needs, we shall all find perhaps, a surplus fund, with'which to enrich the mind and spirit. Amelia J. Calver. South Family. Jan. 9, 1893. We all enjoyed Christmas very much; business was good and consequently we received many gifts for our comfort. These kind feelings were extended to all. Our Sunday school was nicely arranged and all had a good understanding of the old, old story, and that the new birth was to bring, 'Peace on earth, good-will to men.' Elder William Anderson has just had a call from Boston, and walked over the ice better than Pegasus. We hope his trip will be good luck in the temporal line, if not in the spiritual. We are all trying to remember that 'An ounce of prevention is worth (more than) a pound of cure.' The hills are bare and grey, and the sleighs are tucked away. The children are all waiting for a sleigh ride, but we have not foi'gotten, that one year we had more snow in March than we wanted. The snow may come before winter ends. Sarah A. Collins. Center Family. Jan. 13, 1893. Januaby nearly half gone, how the time flies, it seems hard to keep pace with it and yet we can not help ourselves from moving on even if we would. We are busy with the aid of hired help drawing wood and logs and caring for the cattle, sheep and other animals. Ice was harvested by our family in Dec. We stored about as much again as we have been in the habit of doing. The quality was very good and the weather was superb for the occasion. We are sorry to be obliged to part with so many of our number and yet they are all advanced in years the last one to go hence, Br. John Eoss, being nearly seventy-four years old, a sturdy, scotch highlander whose memory we are pleased to hold dear, as he was a true man and Brother. This is not the season of year to make material improvements in external things, but a good time to cultivate and improve home talent, this the Brethren and Sisters are striving to do in a limited way, holding gatherings for learning the songs of Zion, some of which are very beautiful. We appreciate the new book recently published by our dear Canterbury friends. I consider it a nice contribution to our musical store. Timothy Bay son. Watervliet, N. Y. Jan. 1893. Beloved Elder Henry:�We send you an article written by our aged Sister, Ann Buckingham who has now passed to the other shore. We are having a cold January, with but very little snow. Ice about fourteen inches thick, and very nice. We have secured what we may want for the present year. We are busy now in obtaining our yearly supply of wood. Many are the blessings that are bestowed upon a good, warm stove, but they will be forgotten on the approach of midsummer. The song of the shiit is still being sung by the good Sisters as their machines stitch, stitch, stitch, but as the price for making grows less, the song loses its joyful strain. Our water wheel, for lack of water at the reservoir, does not move, and that causes lamentation. When the heavens open and send down the much needed rain, I expect tu hear a song of lejoicing. The dear Brethren and Sisters who came from Groveland are a great support to our Society meeting, as well as to all the interests of their new home. We are very thankful they have come to dwell with us We are all engaged in the gospel warfare against the powers of evil, and expect by so doing, to gain the victory. Josiah, Barker. Second Family. Jan. 1898. The cold weather of the past lifteen days and no snow to hinder, has made ice of an excellent quality, from twelve to fourteen inches thick. The North Family joined hands with us and we are securing our stores of ice for the season. We have also made the Sisters glad, with a new range for the kitchen, and an addition of cold and hot water for kitchen, bakery and dairy. The water is supplied by a wind-mill which pumps it into a tank holding ten thousand gallons; to them it is a luxury, as in the past they have pumped all water used. It also runs at the barn. Not much snow, consequently no sleighing, but it has been a good time to cut fire wood. We have lately parted with a loved Sister, a Mother in Israel, one who helped build up Zion by good works. This causes our minds to revert to many who were of this number that have passed on within a few years. The Yedders, Wells, Bates, Trains, Harwoods, Youngs, Buckinghams, Copleys and other families who were the pioneers of this part of Zion, and they were a power for good in their day. Would that we could convert some like unto them in this day. But with all due respect for humanity at large, how many are willing to come and sacrifice all, as did those blessed pioneers, asking in return only the gospel of Christ and Mother. We have but a few more of these good aged souls left, and when they are gone, there will be a vacuum difficult to fill. May a wave of true conviction spread over Zion and the world of mankind, and may our ranks be replenished by more such consecrated souls. It is a general time cf health in our Society. We are pleased to say that our worthy Brother, Chauncey Miller is growing in strength, daily. Isaac Ansttti'.t. North Family. Jan. 1893. Since our last notes we have passed the festive season of Christmas and New Years; they were enjoyable both temporally and spiritually. At Christmas time tokens of love and remembrance were passed between the different Families. Then the seasons of spiritual communion. I pity the one that can attend them and not feel their uplifting power. On New Year's day we enjoyed a beautiful season with our gospel kindred, when the presence of our dear Elder Daniel Boler was made manifest with other angel messengers. Truly it was a baptism from the inner heavens. The winter so far has been quite free from snow, a few boisterous days, but on the whole, pleasant. The January Manifesto was so full of good things that we could not draw the line and so have taken them all in, sure they will not produce mental or spiritual dyspepsia. 47 48 THE MANIFESTO. The essay on 'Cheerfulness' is timely How often we look on the dark side even when we know the sunshine is better. The humorist is an essential character, in the social economy. One that is always chaste in his remarks, but has the faculty of making things pleasant and sometimes causing the company to have a good hearty laugh. It is health to soul and body. We second the motion of Elder Oliver Hampton that it would be desirable to have the address of those that write the Home Notes that wt may know the author and be better acquainted. What says our beloved Editor? Hamilton DeGraw. Ayer, Jan. 8, 1893. Elder Henry:�I am pleased to inform y ou that Elder Calvin Reed, of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., attended divine service with us to-day. How inspiring it is to meet with those who give up all for the gospel, and live in confoi'mity to the principles of the gospel, that they may benefit humanity. What a blessing it would be if all could see the beauty of a life of consecration. The remarks made by Elder Calvin, touched the hearts of many who heard him. It will awaken new thought toward an increase for good. We need living bread, and fresh fountains of truth and light; something to reach the soul and quicken it into action. We need a new inspiration, something to reach the soul. An influence that will bring into action the combined powers of body and soul. I often think of the pleasant time I spent in your place, and visit in mind with those I met there. We are having cold weather, with but little snow. We have harvested the ice. It was of good quality, twelve inches in thickness. Louisa L Greene. Shirley, Mass. Jan. 6, 1893. We have filled our ice-house with the best ice we have been able to gather for several years. We have already cut and sawed a large portion of our wood for the winter of 1803 and 94 and part of it housed. We have sold 590 barrels of apples. Other crops full average, giving abundant cause for thankfulness in the way of temporal blessings. We would that all the stumbling-blocks might be removed from the way to a greater increase of spiritual blessing. To this end we give our life, our all. John Whiteley. Shaker Station, Conn. Jan. 1893. 'Buy the truth and sell it not.' If we obey the spirit of truth, it will lead us to perfect happiness. The power to be true and faithful is only gained by waging unceasing warfare against evil. The path of truth is the road to salvation. Truth and purity go hand in hand, and that which is true and pure should be exemplified in daily life. Let us be true and our great reward will follow. 'Be true,' is an admonition carrying with it an inspiration which not only invigorates life, but makes it enjoyable and beautiful. How much we need to watch lest we deviate from the path of truth. We should have a noble aim in view; be virtuous, wise and true. * * * Ground or broken bones is one of the best substances that can be fed to hens. It not only contains lime for shells, but also nitrogen and the phosphates. It should be kept before the hens in boxes all the time. In cold weather, fowls should be supplied with material for the egg-shells as_well as material to fill them. Sawdust is the best material for hens' nests, as it is less liable to break the eggs. More meat scraps should not be fed than are sufficient to keep them laying. Hardiness is the first consideration in selecting a breed of fowls. For first class layers, Leghorns hold the first place. Keep none but choice fowls and give them choice treatment. Daniel Orcutt. Jan. 9, 1893. Time flies so swiflly that we must beware, lest we neglect some of the important duties of the present, and before we Mass. THE MANIFESTO. 49 are aware the opportunity for contributing Notes for our loved Manifesto is past. We are thankful for our little Monthly and hope to be more punctual through the coming year. The weather for two weeks past lias been like winter, cold, windy and freezing with very little snow, but the prospect at this writing is more favorable for sleighing, as it snows quite thick and fast. The ice harvest has commenced to-day with us, it is clear and solid; ten to fourteen inches thick. Much labor and care has been spent in preparing the wood for home use, the past month. How many are the blessings that we enjoy. Health prevails'in our midst for which we render heart-felt thankfulness to the giver of every good and perfect gift, and for the mercy extended to this portion of Zion. The past year nearly five-hundred Publications have been sent in all directions from our home, to spread light and truth over the land. May the effort not prove fruitless, our labors for this glorious cause find no cessation, but 'Onward, upward is our motto.' Maria Witham. Canterbury, N. H. Jan. 1, 189:5. It is quite easy to say that the things in this world are never just right. When some of us want it to rain, the clouds fly over our heads as lightly as so many feathers, and when we want a good big snowstorm, as we do at the present time, then tlie clouds pour out rain with the greatest liberality. Up to date very little snow has fallen on the hills of Canterbury, and our farmers, who are anxious to haul some 500 cords of fire wood during the early part of the new year, are quite at a loss to know how it will be done. The only remedy, however, is in waiting patiently till the good time comes; and come it certainly will at an early or a later date. Santa Claus with characteristic faithfulness made his yearly visit very much o the delight of all ages: but this year he unfortunately became a little mixed with the church people. The old man said it was his day to visit the children, but the ministers sent the children to Sunday school and told Santa Claus he must go to church. With real Puritanic grace we informed the dear old Saint that he must defer his visit till Monday, as the children were studying their catechism and reading the Bible. To some of the little folks this made Sunday a sad, long day, but as the sun was bright on Monday and Santa Claus made his visit just the same it was the manifestation of great joy. Many little surprises were made, as some pretty token of remembrance was found attached to the boughs of a prettily furnished Christmas tree. Singing and dancing was the order of the day for all the chirttren, while those of maturer age shared largely of the same enlivening spirit. Then comes New Year's day following so closely the example of Christmas that the very same day of the week must always be selected as the only appropriate season for the incoming year. So the good folks prayed, and si'ng on Sunday, and made merry on Monday. Praying and singing will never grow old, and as the new year began on Sunday, it all moved along in harmony, and then on Monday began t' e general routine of business al'iairs t'nat enter so largely into the life of a Community. This second day of the now year opened upon us with an entirely new programme. A class of Brethren had very kindly offered to prepare a dinner for the benefit of the Sisters, and then for tLe whole family. While this may not have been wholly a new thing under the sun, it was new enough to create a genuine surprise among the big and little folks that comprise our family. The baking of som-, very nice cake, as well as the cooking of the oysters and basting of the chickens was under the direction of the Brethren and at 11-30 a. m. the tables were spread and not less tiian sixty Sisters were seated. The Brethren also officiated in the capacity of waiters, very much to the satisfaction of all present. At a later hour the Brethren sat dowu to this sumptuous feast of fat things and 50 THE :&gt;!ANIFKSTO. enjoyed the repast, we trust, with a growing thankfulness. In the evening the Brethren appointed a meeting to which the Sisters were kindly invited, and all that consistently could attend, were present, either as a matter of curiosity or from special interest in the success of the new year movement. The interesting and varied programme occupied nearly one and one half hours in reading, speaking and singing, wholly by the Brethren, and was appreciated and enjoyed by all present. Jan. 10. Ice crop harvested. Twelve hundred and fifty cakes, twelve inches thick. Quality excellent. A light snow has just fallen but not enough for business purposes. Henry ('. Illinii^ Enfield, N. H. Jan. 1893. We find very much to our satisfaction, that through all the past season, a special Providence has seemed to bless our daily toil in the united efforts given to heed the injunction of our Mother, in 'putting our hands to work and hearts to God,' with an abiding trust in the guardian care of that power which rules the wave, and gives hope to those who trust in the promise given, that 'they who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.' Since our last communication there has been quite an improvement in our Laundry, by the introduction of steam for washing purposes. This is brought from the large boiler at the barn, through pipes some 290 ft. in length, carrying force sufficient to heat water for all the washing and boiling of the clothes. There are pipes also around the room under the wash tubs, to warm the air, making it very much more comfortable than formerly. We find a very great difference in the amount of labor required to do the washing. We have not yet, all [the arrangements that are necessary for perfect convenience; some more tubs for boiling the clothes are needed, with other fixings which will eventually be done. Business in the mill is pressing. The contract for corn-planters must be filled, while things of less consequence wait. The majestic waters of old Mascoma were chained in ice on the 18th of Dec. just 18 days earlier than last year. On the 2nd of this month we began cutting ice for home use, 15 inches thick; a good supply is harvested awaiting the days when old Sol shall give us a scorching. We are having rather severe weather these days. On the 4th inst. Mercury was down to 18 below Zero. The family are in usual health generally, with the exception of some colds which could only be expected from the extremes of our New England climate. Julia Russell. North Family. Jan. 1893. The Jan. number of the Manifesto came to us laden with lofty sentiments of soul-inspiring truth; we were very favorably impressed with the spirit and tone of the piece entitled 'Cheerfulness,' by Sister Lucy Bowers. We can conceive of no helping power in sighing over, or complaining of weakness and decrepitude as concerns individuals or societies; such a spirit would have a tendency to eclipse the brightness of active goodness and thus retard progressive life; self-culture and holy aspiration can alone aid in bettering society. In nature's vast field of unbounded life, we see perpetual growth of bloom and fruitage, symbolical of godly attributes, ceaseless purity and continual goodness. And should not God's people blend in unison with infinite laws of increasing good? 'God loveth the cheerful giver;' such workers being in rapport with divine influences exemplify the beauty of holiness and aid in bringing about desired reform. ) the road to heaven's portals Is paved with willing, cheerful deeds; With acts of Christian courtesy, Which minister to those in need. Christ's mission was to bless and save, With cheering sentiment restore; The fallen, He did not condemn, But bade them go and sin no more. Since our last Home Notes, the dawn of a 'Merry Christmas' has added clieer and happiness to our lives; we made practical THE MANIFESTO. 51 the law of love by the giving of gifts, the singing of songs and other appropriate observances of the day. A company of Sisters from the Church family attended our services and partook with us the fruits of the Christmas tree; thus each annual festivity is freighted with instructive lessons, teaching the importance of cultivating mutual love, true unity and soul generosity. We have our supply of ice housed; it is of excellent quality, being free from snow. May the blessing of peace and prosperity abound throughout Zion. George II. Baxter. Canaan, N. Y. Jan. 3, 1893. Oxce more we have celebrated the anniversary of the advent of Christianity, and had a very pleasant time, although we met with some disappointment. We had anticipated meeting with our friends from the North Family to hold a social entertainment, but as the weather (over which we have no control) did not favor u� we made the best of it. One good thing, however, it was just the right weather for forming ice, and on the -27th ult. our Brethren stored the yearly supply of ice of finest quality. New Year's day we were somewhat compensated for our previous disappointment, for we had the pleasure of having our loved Ministry with us to spend the day, and we enjoyed the privilege, which is not ours very often. They were ministers of that strength and blessing which ever flows from the pure in heart, and in this renewed strength we will abide through the coming year. We think they began the year just right by visiting the least of the flock, first. It was indeed a time of refreshing, a feast of good things, spiritual and intellectual. How much better to spend time and strength in the accumulation and distribution of true riches than superfluous trifles, the so-called customary Christmas gifts which require the cost of time and money to obtain. This practice is good for those not of our order, who live in the selfish relations of this world, if once a year they can enlarge their hearts and extend their sympathies beyond the family circle limit, it is well; but a religious community living above selfish relationships should have something better to impart. The Apostle exhorted the people in his day to covet earnestly the best gifts. By curtailing desire to necessity; being satisfied with comfort and convenience ana discarding the frivolous and superfluous, more time and opportunity can be given to the cultivation of the intellectual and spiritual powers. Through the year we will garner the fruits of the gospel, love, joy, peace, charity, forbearance, consistency and gentleness, that we may have wherewith to feed other souls and to impart to our dear Brethren and Sisters, both old and young, not only at Christmas and New Years, but from day to day.
