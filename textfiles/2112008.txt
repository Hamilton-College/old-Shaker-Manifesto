BLESSED. Lars Erickson. Blessed are those that hunger after the bread of life, for they will be filled. What is the bread of life ? it is the life of Christ. Jesus was at the same time God and man, and his word was from everlasting, in that it was the creating power. [Spiritually.] He dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, and his life produced in us a living faith that will yield fruit for eternal life, and those who hunger and thirst for this will become a wrell of living water.
