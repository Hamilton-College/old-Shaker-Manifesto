MEMENTO MORI MARTHA J. ANDERSON When we stand by the bier Â®f those we have loved, and view with sorrow the motionless form, the cold, set, marble features, once aglow with expression and life ; when we walk above the new-made graves, or visit the ancient mounds of the voiceless past ; we need no further reminder of the frailty of mortality or the surety of dissolution. But the mind soon wearies of monuments, epitaphs and tombs. One does not always choose to walk beside the shrouded angel who bears the emblem of the dread destroyer, to entertain gloomy thoughts, nor to dwell amid shadows dark, sepulchral, with eyes fixed on the cold, gray earth, as if a home in its bosom was to be our final resting place. Rather let us gaze star ward, and when our souls are thrilled with awe and wonder, at the marvelous works of that beneficent Creator who formed us even in His own image, think of that glorious translation, when we shall put on immortality and rise into superior conditions of life. Ah ! let us remember death amid the liveliest scenes when we feel strongest; when life in its brightest aspect looms before us like the golden light of some fair morning, giving a charm to every thing it touches. Then as we turn to duty's path, to pleasure's way, to social surroundings, or to spiritual devotions, one sacred, hallowed thought shall touch the spring of action: 'I will live as though I had a thousand years to live and as though I were to die to-morrow.'
