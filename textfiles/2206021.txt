Sabbathday Lake, Me. May, 1892. As I take my pen for writing I ask myself the question. What shall I write'for the beautiful month of June? At this date the wind is blowing and the weather is cold for the time of year. By the sound of old JEolus one would think we were about to have a January snow-storm. Sr. E. B. says, that Mascoma Lake loosened its icy fetters April 11th. Sabbathday Lake was a few days later. April 16tli showed its rippling, sparkling waters to full advantage. Arbor day was observed by the school in this place, not in setting out many trees but in trimming and taking care of those already started and by the gathering of many bunches of beautiful May-flowers which are now adorning tables and mantles, filling the rooms with their lovely fragrance. The ground is ready for planting. There are ten acres of grain sown and five of potatoes planted. Corn will have to wait for warmer weather. 254,000 ft. of logs have been sawed at our mill this spring of which 104,000 belong to us and the remainder^ to the neighbors. As Baldwins are the best apples we have for market we have grafted between five and six hundred wild trees with that variety. The Sisters have set out 1}4 doz. fruit trees and 1,000 strawberry plants. Before these notes reach the Manifest:), we shall transport 50 tons of pressed hay to the Portland market. A. S. C.
