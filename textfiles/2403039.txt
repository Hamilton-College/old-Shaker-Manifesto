BREAD AND BUTTER LETTERS. More than once I have been seriously troubled because a young friend has failed to acknowledge to me her safe arrival at her home after visiting me, writes Mrs. Lyman Abbott in the February Ladies' Home Journal. The 'bread and butter letter,' as it is sometimes called, because it is supposed to be an expression of thanks for what bread and butter stands for, should be written within twenty-four hours after arrival at one's destination, to the hostess whose hospitality one has been enjoying. It is not quite enough for a young man who has been visiting his college mate to write to him alone; courtesy calls him to send at least a brief note to his friend's mother, or the lady taking her place. You think it is not an easy thing to do, and it is not altogether if you try to make your note unique and different from others, but the simplest way is the best way, and if you have had a pleasant time say so. An agreeable incident of your journey, or a few lines about the circumstances into which you have gone, will make a letter which your hostess will enjoy, and she will set you down in her selected list of well-bred young people. Besides that, you will have the consciousness that you have been thoughtful of another's feelings, and have not been guilty of the appearance of ingratitude.
