Remarks by Correspondent. We cheerfully accord to other minds open to proofs of reason, the same sympathy ia expressing honest difference of opinion which we desire for ourselves. Unless there were perfect freedom in this respect, how could friends ever arrive at mutual understanding? Our friend's views in relation to sifting known truths from lies and superstitions with which they have been intermingled and not adhering to beliefs simply because they are old, we have long since received and acted upon. But in 'spirit manifestations' we have found a residuum of truth which is both old and new. That is, constantly recurring facts of experience in the history of all ages and peoples, including our own. On this head we testify what we have seen and heard. If our brother's knowledge of the character of the evidence is not sufficient to establish his belief in the facts testified to, we attach no blame, but await his future introduction to a knowledge which we are sure will convince him.
