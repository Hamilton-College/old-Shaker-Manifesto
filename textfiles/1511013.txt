LETTER BOX TEEES. Some trees are very tall and large and others are not so large. I will name all I know of. The Oak, the Maple, the Fir tree, the Chestnut, the Horse chestnut and the Willow. I will name the fruit trees, the Cherry, the Peach, Pear, Plum, Apple and the Quince. The fir tree keeps green all the year round. Gertrude Lackey. Canterbury, N. H.
