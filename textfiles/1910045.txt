The Phrenological Journal The Phrenological Journal for September has an interesting sketch of the American Astronomer, Maria Mitchell. This is prefaced with a portrait of this remarkable woman. The work also contains portraits of Wilkie Collins, the English novelist; and of Caroline Schultz the RussoFrench Physician, with accompanying notices. Practical Phrenology by Prof. Sizer affords a valuable amount of instructive information. Those who are so fortunate as to obtain a copy of the Journal will be better informed by the careful perusal of these articles. Fowler &amp; Wells Co., 775 Broadway, N. Y.
