LITTLE HINGES BY KATE CLYDE 'Mighty doors on little hinges Oft with ease and smoothness swing. So it is from merest trifles Often great events will spring. Little, thoughtless words and actions Hold a pow'r none can foretell; They are but the tiny seedlets From which later growths will swell. Oft some little word we utter With unheeding, careless lips; Oft perform some trifling action That as swift from mem'ry slips, Till some after act, resulting Prom the strong but secret pow'r Hidden in that deed forgotten, Comes to view some future hour. If that word were one of kindness, If we did a loving deed— Ah, we know from Christian sources Only good results proceed! Just when some poor heart was sinking 'Neath a load of grief and care, May be that kind word or action Ileav'nly whispers seemed to bear. If that word were cruelly spoken, If that deed were mean and bad, Surely their results could only Serve to make the angels sad. Oh, by life's most trifling actions, If they are but kind and true— By each soft word gently spoken— How much good we each can do ! Selected
