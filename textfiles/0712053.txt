POETRY. We have been extremely sorry to learn from our experience as an editor that a very common folly, and one of the most unaccountable, is the desire among a great many people to write poetry. There are many things of literary excellence that poetry may lack; it may be defective in grammar, coined and curious words may be forgiven, fantastic and difficult antitheses and illustrations maybe allowed; but there must be genius. It has been our fate to bo tormented by correspondents who have all these things that may be forgiven, and more, too, they lack genius, which cannot be forgiven. As a rule these correspondents mistake a fit of sentimentalism for the divine afflatus; they are a good, solid, commonsense people with a little bit of 'inner consciousness,' which while it does not amouut to a poetic frenzy yet gives them a trouble which can only be assuaged by spoiling good white paper and worrying the Editor. If this be a relief, we will stand it. But they must not be angry if we do not allow them to parade their folly before a less gentle critic—the public. —Pacific Methodist.
