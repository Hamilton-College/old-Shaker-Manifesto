EXTRACT FROM A VISION ' And I saw an angel flying in the midst of heaven, crying with a loud voice,' Away with your ' dead body,' which has hitherto obscured the sun of revelation. Jesus, a son of God, standing upon the heights of time made an aperture into the spiritual heavens, and his professed followers can no longer stuff his dead body into that aperture. And I saw angels—disembodied humans — descend to earth ; and the spiritually blind received their sight, and exclaimed ' I see angels asT men walking.' And as I passed down the broad avenue leading to the depot I observed a ' broad ' and a ' narrow way.' The broad way only had a gate ; significant that the broad way begins to have some barriers to unrestricted travel. I thank God and take courage that the world is advancing to higher aims and ends — to true religion — which is light and love, virtue and peace, unadulterated and immaculate.— Prophet.
