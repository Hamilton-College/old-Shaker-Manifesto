TEA, COFFEE AND TOBACCO. Tne eminent Dr. Bock, of Leipsic, writes as follows respecting the influence of tea and coffee upon the character: 'The nervousness and peevishness of our times are chiefly attributable to tea and coffee; the digestive organs of tea and coffee drinkers are in a state of chronic derangement, which reacts on the brain, producing fretful and lachrymose moods. Fine ladies addicted to strong coffee have a characteristic temper, which I might describe as a mania for acting the persecuted saint,The snappish, petulent temper of the Chinese can certainly be ascribed to their immoderate fondness for tea.' Although Wood gives it as his opinion that chewing is the worst form of using tobacco, yet Dr. Geo. P. Hall says in the International Medical Magazine that the use of cigarettes is certainly the most objectionable. He says the effects of tobacco when past the physical limit are very wide and far reaching, and may fall in some degree on any one or more of the nerves or nerve centers of sensation. Dr Hall then relates four cases of tobacco omblyopia as proof of the serious effect of this drug on the eyes. He quotes Bosworth as stating that tobacco is not sim ply a cardiac poison, it is also an arterial poison. Its ill effects are shown in cerebro-spinal irritations, headaches, vomiting, morning fatigue, impairment of memory, physical irritation, inaptitude for work, and even transitory aphasia.
