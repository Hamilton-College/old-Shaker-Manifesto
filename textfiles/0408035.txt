LAWS OF HEALTH Dr. Everett, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, has been lecturing to the citizens of Newburg on the laws of health. He claims that health, moral character, and the temperance question depend upon physiology ; that diseased conditions of the nervous system render people peevish and profane, and establish the demand for alcoholic stimulants. The doctor argues that so long as mothers and children are fed upon pickles, pepper and other irritants, there will be an after demand for strong coffee and tea, tobacco and alcohol ; that our temperance agitation is a practical failure, because we do not have it on scientific principles â€” that is, that the food question is at the base of the temperance question. The appetite grows by what it is fed on, and highly seasoned and stim- ulating food indulged in for a series of years naturally begets an appetite for something still more stimulating.
