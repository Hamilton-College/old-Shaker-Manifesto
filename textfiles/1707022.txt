Elder Frederick writes... Elder Frederick writes: June, 14.- -James is unassuming, helpful and modest. But he is highly appreciated in England and Scotland. If you could have heard the blessing and thanks by some in the meeting, of the good they had derived from his 'Round the World ' and ' Homes in the Spirit Land, ' you would have realized what an influence for good he has exercised over thousands of minds. And he has done much to spread a correct knowledge of Believers. He will have his reward. It is in a practical, unselfish spirit- -an interest in gospel truth- - that he is with me in Scotland. F. W.
