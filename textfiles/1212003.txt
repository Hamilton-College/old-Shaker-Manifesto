WHAT I WANT. GILES B. AVERY. I want a kind and tender heart. For other's woes to feel, A soul secure from fortune's dart And bosom arm'd with steel To bear divine chastisement's rod And, mingling in my plan, Submission to the will of God, With charity to man. I want a keen observing eye, An ever list'ning ear, The truth, through all disguise to spy. And wisdom's voice to hear, A tongue to speak, at virtue's meed, In heaven's sublimest strain And lips the cause of man to plead, And never plead in vain My last great want, absorbing all, Is, when beneath the sod. And summon'd by my final call, The mercy of my God ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
