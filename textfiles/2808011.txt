Shakers, N. Y. July, 1898. During the month of June we were very pleasantly interrupted in our usual vocations by a visit from our gospel friends from the state of Maine, Elder William Dumont and Elder Henry Green. If friendship and the bond that holds us in spiritual communion are strengthened by the application of the adage, 'Short visits make long friends,' our alliance must be indissoluble. Yea we will 'remember the Maine,' but with the spirit of peace that makes all those who love our blessed cause and are striving for its prosperity one in spirit and purpose, instead of the revengeful interpretation which at present is given to that saying. We also had a very pleasant visit from our Sisters Emma Thayer and Celia Thorpe of West Pittsfield, Mass. We were glad to hear from them that our good Brother Ira Lawson is imprpving in health. May the angel which cometh with healing in his wings restore him to perfect health. As we write these Notes on this pleasant Sabbath morning, July 3, our thoughts have been moving forward to the contemplation of the probable results of tomorrow. How many realize the true import of and the spirit that should prompt the celebration of our Independence? That it might be a reality in our national life there were those who suffered and gave their lives for their country, and the present generation if they are to hold as a sacred and indissoluble inheritance what has been gained must be prepared to meet the living questions of to-day with the same heroism and confidence in the ultimate triumph of the truth that our forefathers had. Summer has put on her royal robes and the vegetation that has been so backward is at present hurrying forward to complete the task assigned. July 3, gives us the highest registration of the season to date, 98 degrees in the shade. Hamilton DeGraw.
