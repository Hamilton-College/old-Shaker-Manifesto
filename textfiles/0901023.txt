PARTICULAR NOTICE The subscription price of The Manifesto is very low at sixty cents ; but we would be pleased to get two subscribers for One Dollar. When thinking of the good we would do, make a present of The Manifesto to some friend when you subscribe for yourself. In remitting we prefer money ; and in the absence of the very convenient ' shinplaster,' fractional currency, we advise sending six dimes for one subscription ; One Dollar bill for two subscriptions.
