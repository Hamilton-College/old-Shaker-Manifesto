WHO CAN IT BE? A recent visitor at Canterbury writes a most glowing description of one of their spiritual meetings, and of the effective simplicity and sincerity of the people there during the hour of worship. Howells' recent account was thoroughly indorsed; and the opinion fully expressed that ' mere doctrines, however good, will not hold people together for a century: it requires an afflatus; meetings of the members very frequently, which the Shakers do nearly every evening of the week, etc.' But we are in search of a new contributor to The Shaker, and it is the one whom the above writer alludes to, beginning with Frederica Bremer's words, concerning her: ' She is of singular beauty, and a more fascinating, inspired glance than hers, I never beheld,' continues, ' Hers is an inspirational nature; through her are given many of the songs which enter so largely into the worship and daily life of the Shakers. Here is one: ' Ever changing, ever aiming Toward a higher, better life; Ever learning, ever earning, Is the good believer's strife. Light unfolding, spirit moulding, Is the law of endless growth; Feeding thought and word and action From the wells of boundless truth.' Then the writer gives us an epitome of 'the most effective discourse of the day,' from her lips ; 'the burden of her utterance was the genuineness of one's religious character, etc.' Now, Who can tliis be? and why does she not, and will she not, become an immediate contributor to The Shaker? Nor her alone, but let all those choice spirits in form, ' send holy inspirations down,' and ' aid the goodly work along. Does not the life of The Shaker form part and parcel of the perpetuity of our institutions ? vV
