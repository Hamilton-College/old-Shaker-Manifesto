History of the English people Green THE BEST ENGLISH HISTORY. So History of England, since the publication of Macaulay's famous work, has more promptly and deservedly won the very highest reputation, than Green's 'History of the English People.' Ranking fairly with Macaulay in the brilliancy and interest of its style, and superior to it in its accurate delineation of events, it covers the entire field of English history, from the earliest, to recent times, (and giving the history of the people, rather than of the conflicts ot the kings ou,y,) while Macaulay's history is limited to a very brief period. Green was first published in this country by the Harpers, in four octavo volumes, for $10.00, but The Useful Knowledge Publishing Co., New York, have issued very handsome editions, at prices ranging from $1.00 for an octave cloth-bound volume, to $2.50 for a five volume Elzevy half Russia edition. It ought promptly to find a place in every home library, as, upon the whole, the best as well as the cheapest history of England. For sale at the Manifesto Office.
