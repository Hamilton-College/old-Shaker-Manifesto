MINE Whatever else you are, children, do not be selfish. We often hear, ringing out above the music of children's voices, the words, ' That's mine!' and it startles us like a sharp clap of thunder when the sun is shiningâ€” it seems so little in keeping with the sunshine of childhood. Not long since, a mother, selecting clothes for a poor woman, brought to the parlor a pair of bright red stockings, beautiful, but too small for her little one. The child saw what it was her mother held, and sprang forward, saying, ' You-won't give her those, mamma ? Those are mine ! ' and the emphasis placed upon that one word ' mine ' opened to our gaze such a yawning pit of selfishness in that young girl's heart as made our own ache to contemplate. Don't be selfish, children. It is not really natural for any of us to be unselfish, but by a little care we can make a sort of second nature. That is, act generously and unselfishly so often that it grows to be almost natural for us to do so. Brethren's Advocate.
