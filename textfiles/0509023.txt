Dear Editors of Shaker and Shakeress : We offer a tribute of thanks for our monthly visitor, the S. and S. It is hailed with joy, and love greetings, every time it comes, and we invoke the blessing of heaven upon those who strive so much to make it interesting and instructive. We need Saviors on Mt. Zion ; those who are eagle-eyed — clear sighted — divinely inspired, and in rapport with spirit spheres. They will find the keys of revelation, that will unlock what have been called the ' mysteries of godliness '— of religion — reconcile the past with the present, give confidence in the SHAKEEESS. 71 coming future, and show that Philosophy, Science and Religion are indissoluble friends, and will walk hand in hand together. But the sword of truth, proceeding in love from the mouths of the Lord's prophets, will separate the false from the true; and we pray that the days of the ever faithful prophets, and prophetesses, that are now with us, may be lengthened. We also pray, that such greatly needed laborers and teachers may increase manifold. Lovingly your sister, Nancy Riley, West Ptttsfleld, Mass.
