Dear Children: Buy the truth and sell it... Enfield, Conn. 1885. Dear Children:ï¿½'Buy the truth and sell it not. ' Truth is a jewel that you cannot too highly prize. As water purifies the body, so truth purifies the soul. You will never regret being true. Truth sustains and invigorates the spirit. If you have not truth for your foundation, your superstructure is unsafe. 'Truth will make you firm and strong. ' Honor and eternal life belong to truth. It requires constant watchfulness to be true. Those who are true are safe, and only those. Let truth be your motto and you will overcome, if you persevere. ' One grain of truth will outweigh a life-time of falsities. ' Separate the chaff of folly and sin, from the grain of purity and truth. ' A sure protection against falsity is in the love of truth; against evil, in the love of good; against uncleanness, purity. ' Never depart from the stronghold of truth. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
