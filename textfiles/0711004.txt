John's answer to William's question JOHN'S ANSWER TO WILLIAM'S QUESTION. TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN. 'Is the Church of England worth preserving?'— Mr. Gladstone. What is the church? Is it a place For holy antic and grimace? A sort of Sabbath opera-bouffe, Performed beneath a Gothic roof? Parade, with priest for fugleman ? Burlesque upon the latest plan Of things the most sublime and serious, Where mummery, veiling the mysterious, Yields mumbo-motley as result Of search for an 'aesthetic cult?' Is this the church you tnean? If so, John's answer's an emphatic 'No !' Is it a stage where bumptious boys May wrangle over gauds and toys, Fuming whene'er some scrap of flummery Is stript from their too florid mummery? May vent on Luther, or on Tait, Ecclesiastic Billingsgate ? Much like an angry housemaid, chidden For finery that is forbidden ; Who strikes an attitude as martyr Because her Sabbath rig's not smarter. Is this the church you mean? If so, John's answer is a ready 'No!' Is it a 'scene' where cleric pride May be supremely glorified ; And every petty priestling hope To play the part of petty pope, Shining in foolish virgin's eyes With sacerdotal sanctities; And gently dazzling, now and then, Some mooney and molluscous men ; Where, gaily decked in stolen plumes, 'Midst pompous rites and fragrant fumes The emptiest daw may masque and mum Ecclesiastic Fe-Faw-Fum ? Is this poor thing your 'church?' If so, John's answer's an explosive 'No!' Is it a word of life or death ? A sacerdotal shibboleth? A proud abstraction, vague and vast, Veiling the tyranny of caste? A verbal fetish, shaped to rule The flexile fancy of the fool? A web of forms, traditions, creeds, Stretched 'twixt the soul and the soul's needs? Is church the 'priest's preserve?' If so, John's answer is—'Preserve it? No?' London Punch.
