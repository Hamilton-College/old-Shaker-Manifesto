A TEST CASE. F. W. Evans A woman, sixty four years of age, of Springfield, Mass., asks, in a most supplicating, feeling manner, to be admitted into the North Family of Shakers. She has raised a family of children, who are married and have families of their own ; and, being in good circumstances, they are willing to support their aged mother, but do not wish 'to be bothered with her' in their aristocratic households. Answer. Do you know what spirit you are of and what it is you are asking for ? An entrance into a family of sixty men and women who are self-supporting ; have worked for and bought the land they own ; have built houses, and inhabit them ; planted orchards and vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. A people who cultivate their own lands; make and mend their own clothing; cook their own food, and wash the dishes ; do their own house work, without employing a single servant. These men and women, having the faith of Jesus and Ann, have cut themselves off from the self-seeking, self-pleasing, aud ruling elements of the generative order upon which the world of mankind rests and by which it is perpetuated. '' The ends of the world ha^e come upon them.' They sowed to the spirit, and have reaped life everlasting�a home ! They enjoy the fruit of their own labors; have received according to their works. And is it not the same with yourself? In youth, you gave yourself to the world, and now the world has forsaken you. Your own children cast you off. They have the same right to bear children, the same duty to keep the world from running out, that actuated yourself. Anon! the measure they mete will be meted to them again, by their own children, who will leave them to go to a poor-house or to an ' Institution for the care of aged gentlemen and ladies' whose children cleave to their own dear husbands and wives, and to their own offspring. Those who spend the morning and noon of life in ''marrying and giving in marriage' must needs finish the day in the same field of nature. 'The king of terrors' will consign them to a world in which their only hope is in a physical resurrection. If we granted your request, housed, clothed, fed and cared for you, and your children should pay us for the same, should we not be the servants and you the masters and mistresses�the gentlemen and ladies? Thus, instead of a Shaker Society being the head, it would become the tail�a rendezvous for the debris of the generative order. And who would support the order? 'He that is not for, is against; and he who gathereth not with, scattereth abroad.' Any one receiving our faith, can unite as with any other religious order, and continue to care for themselves externally, as they do. We do not furnish a home for all who may become members. Mt.
