THOUGHTS FOR AUTUMN. Alas! the cold bleak wintery winds begin to blow, And lovely Nature once so fresh and green, Will soon be clad in one vast sheet of snow, But even then is time for thoughts serene. Should we thus change and in the winter time Our hearts which once were warmed by love's bright beam, Be frozen o'er and we no more be kind, Ah! then would be no time for thoughts serene. But 'tis not so, though hard the winds may blow, Nor from the sun proceeds one cheering gleam, With love and friendship still the heart doth glow, Ah! surely then there's time for thoughts serene.
