HONEST ADMISSION. ABRAHAM PERKINS. The value of a thing is estimated, not always upon its merits, but more largely upon its cost. If to obtain it, the sacrifice is great, the greater the value of the prize and higher the appreciation. The quality of that Avhich is cheap in its price is generally in equal proportion to price, and in the end the most expensive and the least to be prized. We realize this fact, both in the natural and spiritual order. The treasure which is to be found in the gospel of Christ is the 'pearl of great price ;' and it costs all that a man hath to obtain it. For this reason, few there be, able or willing to make the sacrifice and pay the price to possess it. As a whole, we find the human will the greatest sacrifice man can render, as it is the dearest and most precious object in life ; for the preservation of which, he will sacrifice everything. Consequently, it becomes his god to be idolized, adored, worshiped, fostered and preserved. Therefore, to come into possession of eternal life, the 'pearl of great price,' to him who has studied his own proclivities and knows himself, it is a self-evident truth that his will, his selfish life, his darling passions must all be surrendered. It is sadly to be lamented, that the present age gives so little evidence of the existence of the vitalizing spirit of Christ in our churches. The outlook is nothing short of utter failure and annihilation of the power of salvation upon earth, unless by the powerful arm of the Almighty, humanity is moved and drawn to the presence of the Most High. The earth needs a shaking that will reach and move even the heavens, and work upon man a revival that will bring him in humility upon his knees, and cause him to cry out, 'ï¿½' Lord, what shall I do to be saved?' The civilized world seems indeed on the verge of a great revolution ; a revolution that shall make life more real, profession more practical and religion more an elevating and saving power. Where in all Christendom, (and we may extend it beyond) is there not more or less of a spirit of agitation and disturbance politically, financially and religiously? There exists generally unrest and dissatisfaction. Peace is largely taken from the earth, and the true God is little known among men. Nations are convulsed by a party spirit, a want of sympathy and common brotherhood. The ignoring of self-sacrifice for progress and reform, with a spirit to traduce character and work evil abounds. Such representation may seem unkind and uncharitable ; but is it not too true, not to say universal, yet quite general and to the dishonor of a professed Christian people ? Who that has common perception can deny the absolute necessity of a general subversion in the affairs of men, and the need of a more earnest seeking for the spirit of union in support of morality and Christian religion, the genuine doctrine of Christ, the support of principles that will eventually bring in the fullness of the work and the glory of the millennium. We might well conclude with the Adventists, that the end of the world is near, and that its inhabitants are in a working condition to destroy themselves. The mission of Christ was to bring peace on earth. Unless this is seeured to man, labor is in vain and life not worth having. What then is duty? Common perception, general observation and a knowledge of our own hearts teach us our necessities and absolute requirements essential to the possession of eternal life, the 'pearl of great price,' whose concomitants are peace and joy in the holy spirit, and the godly love which brings man into love with fellow man, and makes him a brother in all the relations of life ; insomuch, that no place is found in the heart for any selfish interest or debasing indulgence.
