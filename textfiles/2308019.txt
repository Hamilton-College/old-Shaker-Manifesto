Watervliet, Ohio. July, 1893. We are busy putting up clover hay of which we have about one hundred tons. Crops are good all round. Commenced cutting wheat, of which there are about ninety acres. We purchased a hay loader and it works to perfection. It is like the Irishman who came to this country, and wrote home to his people, telling them this country was a great country. All you had to do was to carry the brick and mortar to the men on the building and they did the work. But it is a little better with our hay loader; it does the work, and all we have to do is to stand on the wagon and place the hay wherever we want it. We have been hauling corn and oats to market. Corn is bringing 40 cts. a bush, and oats 34 cts. Everything is moving on nicely here at Watervliet. We are all striving to do good to our fellow-beings, and helping each other in the right way. Doing unto others as we wish to be done by and having charity for all good Believers who are trying to better their conditions day by day. Two Brethren from White Water came to see us and spend a few days. Brs. A ugust Frederick and William Beckwith. We enjoyed their company very much, and would say here that Believers are welcome to visit our home at any time. We are a small Society, but nevertheless our hearts are with all good Believers in Christ's second appearing. I close by giving my love to all who read this. H. W. Fredrick.
