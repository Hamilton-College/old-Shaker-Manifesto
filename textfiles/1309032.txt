PICKLES. Take small sized cucumbers, and scald them three successive mornings in weak brine. Drain them dry, have ready a brass kettle and some nice strong vinegar, with cloves, allspice, and a small piece of alum, which will make them green and brittle, a little horseradish root improves them. Pickles made in this way will keep through the year.
