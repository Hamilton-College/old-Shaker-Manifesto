HALLOWED PEACE. Enfield, N. H. 1. After true repentance, after the voice of prayer, 2. After conserevation cometh the holy peace, Cometh a spiritual blessing crowning our sorrow and care. After the full resignation cometh the fall increase. Fresh as the dew of the morning, it quickens to newness of life, Perfect the rest in the service, and broad is the growth in this love; Linking with joy and devotion all our burden and strife. Sacred the blessings descending free from the fountain above.
