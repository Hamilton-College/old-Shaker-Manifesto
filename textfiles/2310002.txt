THE GOOD TIME COMING. Emoretta Belden. Life in this world is never stationary. Every year we see changes in the people and places about us, and if one year brings about an apparent change, what may not be achieved in a c �ntury of time? Many and marvelous are the events of the past. What some have even termed impossibilities, are taking place in our midst and are thought to be indispensable adjuncts of our life. So it will ever be. That which we have never even thought of will be accomplished. 'Necessity is the mother of invention,' and as new wants are developed, new articles will be brought forward to supply the deficiency. The number of inventions brought before the public yearly, is almost incredible. 'The records of the Patent Office show over 21,500 issued in 1889. Edison's patents alone fill one large volume.' Life is a progressive march; we advance step by step, from light to light, and should never be content until we have attained to our highest ideal. As this is true the people of 1993 will, no doubt, be more enlightened in many respects, than are those of this age, and the social status may be very different. Of only one thing are we really certain, and that is, the love of our Father in heaven ; this will ever be the same for He is unchangeable, 'The same yesterday, to-day and forever.' To Him a thousand years are but as one day; hence, the sun will rise and set in its splendor, the seasons come and go, the rain will fall, and through all this his children will share the protecting love of their heavenly Father, a hundred years from now, even as we do now. Listen to the voice of the prophetess : ' 'In that day the sound of war shall be no more heard in the land. Nay, schools for training young men in the art of killing their fellow man shall be no more seen on any hill-top, neither in any valley, and the standing Army of twenty-five thousand men shall be scattered to all parts of this wide land, and their weapons shall be the implements of peace�'the pen is mightier than the sword.' 'All disputes shall be adjusted by arbitration. The tears of the mother THE MANIFESTO. 229 shall be dried and the load lifted from her heavy heart, for her loved ones shall not be exposed to danger on the battle field. The gray-haired sire will not mourn the premature death of his stalwart son�his peace shall be such that his last days shall be likened unto a deep river flowing through a still, green valley. The money used in this day to defray the expense of war, and of military academies, will then be devoted to the sustaining of free schools and colleges for the higher education and training for the professional life of the people. I know that much, very much has been done in that direction, but in that day whereof I speak all knowledge will be free as the air we breathe. Before a half century shall have passed, laws will be made forbidding the printing of impure and sensational literature, and many a parent's heart will be made to bound with joy wheu the declaration of that law goes forth, and many a life will rise to a more exalted position when it shall come to pass.'
