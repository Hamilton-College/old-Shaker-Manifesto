Emeline Kimball Shaker Village, N. H., Feb. 3, 1876, Emeline Kimball , aged 65. We were more than sorry to hear of this great loss to Canterbury. As a physician, nurse, and dear good Sister, 'None knew her but to love her, None named her but to praise,'â€”She leaves us to bloom among the 'Evergreens.' *
