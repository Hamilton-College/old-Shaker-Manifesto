GEN HARRISON AND THE WINE-CUP.- [Contributed by Eldress J. J. Kaime.] The following story is told of Gen. Harrison in connection with a public dinner given him on one occasion; 'At the close of dinner, one of the gentlemen drank his health. The general pledged his toast by drinking water. Another gentleman offered a toast and said, 'General, will you not favor me by taking a glass of wine?' The general, in a very gentlemanly way, begged to be excused. He was again urged to join in a glass of wine. This was too much. He rose from his seat, and said in the most dignified manner; 'Gentlemen, I have twice refused to partake of the wine-cup. I hope that will be sufficient. Tho you press the matter ever so much, not a drop shall pass my lips. I made a resolve when I started in life that I would avoid strong drink. That vow I have never broken. I am one of a class of seventeen young men who graduated together. The other sixteen members of my class now fill drunkards' graves and all from the pernicious habit of wine drinking. I owe all my health, my happiness, and prosperity to that resolution. Would you urge me to break it now?' ' National Temperance Advocate.
