Small things Small things.â€”Every farmer should have a small room, tight and warm, which he can lock and where he can keep his small tools. Then he wants a good.solid work-bench,with an iron vise on one side and a wooden one on the other. For iron working he wants a solid piece of iron for an anvil, a seven-pound steel-face hammer, a riveting hammer, one large and one small cold chisel, two or three punches from one-fourth to three-eighths inch, a rimmer and countersink, to be used with bitstock, a screw plate that will cut a screw from one-fourth to three-eighths inch; then with round iron of the various sizes, and ready-made nuts he can make any bolt he wishes. For carpenter work, he wants a square, a shaping horse, drawing knife, a set of planes, auger from one-half to two inches, a fine hand-saw, with coarse cross-cut and rip saw, large cross-cut saw for logs, and a grindstone.
