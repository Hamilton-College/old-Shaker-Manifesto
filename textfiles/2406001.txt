Dear Eldress Rosetta... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. May, 1894. Dear Eldress Rosetta :ï¿½Human existence is a strange anomaly, so full of contradictions and paradoxes. We are indeed complex beings, not only in our own individuality, but as a part of the great cosmos. We embark on life's sea, all unconscious of the dangers that lie around us, yet there is an invisible hand that guides and directs, and each day as the surges beat around us, we feel safe in the line of our life work. How fully the present claims our attention ; truly we strive in vain to pierce the misty future, which is wisely veiled from our sight, lest we become oblivious to, and neglectful of the duties and obligations that claim our ever active service. We have not much time to dream or philosophize, but in dealing with matter of fact realities, we have great need of sublime patience and heroic fortitude, lest we become weak and vacillating. The firm soul doubts not, the true soul wavers not,and the upright in heart despair not. The hidden forces that continually urge us to grander, nobler striving, make continuous existence possible. It is pulsating life that holds us to the centre of being, and unites us to the great Over-soul from whence we came, and whither we are tending, through evolutionary processes of development. Life is action and motion, the still pool grows stagnant. The sapless branches die; so with individuals and bodies of people, if they cease to move or grow, they cease to exist, for the want of accretive and concretive force. As a people should we not be quickened anew, and awake to a realization of the great truths committed to us, feeling a yearning desire that others 128 THE MANIFESTO. may share of the power of salvation found under the ministration and baptism of the Christ spirit? When we look abroad in the world and see the chaotic conditions there existing, and know of the misery, vice and crime, that keep human beings on the lower plane of animal existence, we feel an impulse, and a strong desire, that as we have been lifted up we want to draw all mankind to us. Though all are not prepared to receive the truths of the higher life yet every good thought and desire is helpful, and above all, the loving service of unselfish devotion, sustains the home, where all who seek, shall find the bread and water that faileth not. These are strange times, destitution and suffering on every hand, the great rush of emigration to our shores especially to the large centres of civilization, helps to increase the present misery. It may be of interest to you to know that we have made up a contribution, and sent to the head quarters of the Salvation Army in New York; it consisted of three barrels (tightly packed) of clothing, one bale of bedding, two barrels of assorted beans, one of dried apples, and twenty-five sacks of potatoes. By applying to the railroad companies, they were taken free. One of the officers of the Army, who has charge of distribution, expressed much gratitude, and said they had great need of every thing in the line of food and clothing, to keep the needy poor from freezing and starving. All charity organizations were taxed to their utmost. In looking over an old record dating back to the establishment of the Church, we find that Believers held strictly to the injunction of Mother Ann and the first Elders to live temperately and practice economy, that they might have something to give to the poor. We found it recorded, that in several instances, when there were great calamities, they responded liberally to the call for help. I copied the following: 'Wed. July 16. In consequence of the late distress of the poor inhabitants of New York City occasioned by yellow fever, the Churches and Societies of New Lebanon and Hancock made a collection of money to the amount of two hundred and thirty-six dollars, and various kinds of provisions for their relief, which were transported to the city of Hudson in twenty-three wagons to go by water to New York, with a letter addressed to the Mayor and corporation by the Trustees of the Society; a copy of this letter and the Mayor's answer is preserved.' Our good Brother Benjamin sent a box of clothing to another quarter of the city, and I have no doubt, but other families and Societies would have increased the contribution if there had been a general appeal. I presume our friends of Enfield have many callers, especially at the Office, 'The sons of rest,' as the tramps are politely called, make their way to Shaker Villages where their neighbors usually send them, or they come a long distance over the mountain. A Sister once said that every one was hungry as soon as they stepped on Shaker ground. If people felt their spiritual needs as keenly as they realize their physical necessities how gladly would we give of the bread THE MANIFESTO. 129 that perisheth not, and provide for them a home, where true equality reigns, and unselfish love renders mutual service. We have several Sisters who have not been in the family a year. Brethren are greatly in need of help and we hope to see their ranks filled before long, some men are writing and many are '^almost persuaded,' but fear they will have to practice just a little too much self-denial if they come in our Order. We hear that you have been gathering some in your family from the South family, you must have had a busy time moving. In sending our love at this time, we remember Eldress Melinda, Elder William and others who have made the change. It is some time since we have had a precious missive from Beloved Elder Abraham who has favored us wTith so many beautiful letters and songs, in the years that have passed. I have only room to say love to every inmate of your home. Martha J. Anderson.
