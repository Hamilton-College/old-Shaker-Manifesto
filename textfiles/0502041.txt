Dear Editor and Editress : I have been much edified in reading your editorials, the year past, likewise many of the articles in both departments. They were rare specimens of literary merit, sound, logical, argumentative, scriptural, full of pith, pathos and the fire of God's Truth. That is what the world and many among Believers, need, and must have. Jesus 'made himself of no repute' — not by immoral conduct, but by bearing witness to the Truth. He put forth Ideas, far in advance of the age. They were rejected by many, especially the Jewish orthodoxy. To them He was an 'Infidel.' That the Good Samaritan, whom Jesus approved, was an Infidel, we have no doubt. He showed his faith by his works. To this class of Infidels in the world, who make no profession of Christianity—who gain Heaven by being honest in their dealings with their fellow men — our little paper meets with acceptance. Blessed are such Infidels ! I am willing to stake my all with this class, be they in what part of the world -— in what 'world they may. It was this class of Infidels, in its highest types, that framed our United States Constitution — who, in their wisdom, and far-seeing Statesmanship, took the necessary precaution forever to exclude the possibility of introducing the Jewish War-God, or any other God or Christ, or Bible into that Sacred Instrument. Again, we say, Blessed are such Infidels! We unite with all such, for the preservation of the Constitution of these United States — as it was—as it is—as it shall be. It was made for man — for all men and all women—of all nations, kindred, tongues and peoples, under the Heavens — for all Religions — subject to no eclesiastical tinkering. So we say Hands off.
