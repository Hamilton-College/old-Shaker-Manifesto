A PLEASANT SEASON Alfred, Me., Jan. 1882. Dear Editor, Manifesto ;â€”Our late Christmas Festival, which for good reasons was postponed to the evening of the 26, was one of the most social entertainments, of the kind, we ever enjoyed. ' The following Christmas song was one of the contributions. It was good for us all to be there, to witness the sparkling brightness, and overflowing enjoyment of all the little folks, and even the 'children of larger growth,' as they looked upon the three evergreen trees, with their expansive limbs heavily laden with a great variety of fruits, pretty and useful tokens of sweet remembrances. Some original and many select pieces were admirably spoken. All fitted to the occasion and tending to awaken an strengthen the bond of Christian love and fellowship, and unite the hearts of all as one from the oldest, 81 to the youngest 7 years of age. Our very special, liberal and loving friends, the Goodalls of Sanford, and the Ushers of Bar Mills, which includes, M. U. Osgood. all of whom are always doing good, contributed many beautiful, nice as well as sweet things, which each recipient gratefully received.
