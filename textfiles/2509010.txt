FAITH. By Lucy S. Bowers. Faith is a white robed angel pure and bright Who lends to human hearts her holy wings To rise from earthly unto heavenly things. Fear perishes, doubts vanish in her light As morning melts the shadows of the nightStrong grows the will when faith her full strength brings; The spirit gives to God its offerings, And strives each day with fervent love of right. Interpreter of truth's unwritten word ; Diviner of the mysteries of life, 'Who gives the evidence of things unheard, The substance of true hope through every strife. Transformer of the mind! sweet joy abides When to the soul's glad victory she guides. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
