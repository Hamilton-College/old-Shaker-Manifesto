LAWS Laws are enforced on us in childhood before we understand the principle. Laws are the shell, the casket containing the jewel. In after years, when the jewel is set—when the principle is fixed in our nature, the law is laid aside. Let the young practice virtue un- der restraint, if needs be, and in age the practice will be natural. What you are at eighteen you will be at forty. When Christ went away he nailed the law of Moses to the cross, but left the morality. He took away the material form, and left the spirit. This was an expedient change. The wisdom of God is displayed in leading men along to look up to Him and trust in Him. Six thousand years of discipline only leave us where we can catch glimpses of the Infinite One, and of our relation to the spiritual universe. That man labors in vain who does not cultivate his spirit. The student studies in vain, and the hero must end his career in dust and dismay. But he who receives Christ, and cultivates His own spiritual nature, may see God mirrored in the brook and flower and cloud and sky, and be led up in adoration to Him who is separated from all materiality and is full of universal love. — Garfield
