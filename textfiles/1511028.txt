TO THE KNITTER. MABTHA J. ANDERSON. Pleasant knitter, knit away, Let the shining needles play; Leg and gusset, heel and toe Will through magic motion grow. Stitch by stitch, around and round, Almost noiseless is the sound, As the skillful knitter plies, And the changing needle flies. O'er the bended finger joint Spins the yarn to gleaming point, In and out, each stitch is caught Seemingly without a thought. Now she sits with steadfast gaze, As if lost in thought's deep maze; Still the work is borne along Like allegro speed in song; Automatic as the time, And as true as perfect rhyme. Lo ! she muses on the past, Memory's shadows are recast, Varied pictures come and go Like a panoramic show ; Shuttles speed, and spindles twirl, Wheels are flying with a whirl, Feet are pacing on the floor Just as they were wont of yore, Drawing out a fibre fixed That is not with shoddy mixed; Warp and woof the weaver takes Firm the fabric that she makes. Spinning, weaving, happy sounds Where the love of home abounds; But, it proves a passing dream, ' And things are .not what they seem, For those halcyon days have flown Onward to the dark unknown. Still one industry she'll hold Of the blessed days of old, With no idle moment spent Rests her mind in sweet content. Art and skill in modern days Have invented other ways, Which have wrought with greater speed Goods that meet the present need. Manufactures fill the land, Over-plus the great demand, Makes the operatives poor, And in feeling, insecure; Gives them meagre homes and food, To the master comes the good. 0 Monopoly ! thou ghoul! Robbing body, spirit, soul. Every man should have a home, Wherein want could never come, And a title deed to land None could rest from out his hand. But the grinding heel of power Robs the widow of her dower; Brings the orphan low estate, Fills the land with crime and hate. Angel justice ! hast thou flown Far away to realms unknown? At thy bar we still would plead; Answer thou to human need ! ***** Rapidly the ball unwinds, As another theme she finds ; Bright her home and pure the life, All with sweet contentment rife ; Where equality for all Blesses both the great ani small. Winter evenings, long and drear Pass away with pleasant cheer; Labor sweetens every hour With its hallowed life and power; Dissipation finds no place In this home of love and grace; Wealth of heart, of soul and mind Are with industry combined; And the muses with delight Often to their feasts invite, While the nimble fingers time Stitches to the passing rhyme. Drawing-room with music's charm Has its avenues of harm ; Envy, jealousy and pride Turn the heart from love aside, And where social castes arrayed, Harmcny cannot pervade. But, in blessing, we are blest, All united, toil is rest; And with sweet communion crowned, Love, and home, and heaven abound. Thus we meet�with noble aim� Duty's high and holy claim. Consecration rules each hour With her blooming wand of power; Hearts that keep her laws of grace Nothing sinful can deface. Thus, are all the threads of thought In some precious work outwrought. So good knitter, knit away ! Let the shining needles play ; In unfoldment of thy powers Well improve life's passing hours. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
