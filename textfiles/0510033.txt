BE NOT MOVED ' Be not moved,' we often say. But who discerns the meaning, When pressed by trials of the day, Too small for even naming? But still they cloud us oftentimes, Though light is round us gleaming, We fear the burdens to be borne, Far greater to the seeming. But this is conquest; when we're wronged By incorrect opinion, To simply keep the way of right, And wait for its dominion. M. W., Canterbury, N. H.
