VICE. Martha J. Anderson. Rum, tobacco and social impurity are among the many curses that demoralize and blight modern society. Despite all our boasted progress in art, science, literature and refinement, these vices are attaining hideous proportions, destroying the fair image of God that should be enstamped on the form and visage of all his creatures. These great evils differently affect several classes of people ; namely, the pleasure-seeker, the remunerated, the victimized and the humanitarian. Those who love their alcohol, their nicotine and carnal indulgence, and those who buy the bodies and souls of men and women through immoral traffic, would hush the voice, and quell the agitation, that arouse the community to a seuse of duty in regard to their suppression ; because self-interest is at stake, and conscience is lulled to sleep. Thousands of suffering spirits could tell a tale of agony and woe, for there are few households that have not one or all of these cancerous spots, eating out its very heart ot joy ; making sorrowful and desolate what might have been a happy circle. From many who realize the situation, a war cry has gone forth against destructive beverages and narcotic poisons ; but when shall a prophet arise to confront Agag�the king of evil�the lust of the flesh, which must be utterly destroyed before peace and happiness shall reign among men ? Drinking saloons are but the glittering entrances to dens of infamy and hell, where souls barter their virtue for gold, and ruin stamps its victims of both sexes by the thousands annually. 'Dew-drop Inn'�literally meaning Do Drop in�was the attractive sign hung out by one of the gilded and illumined halls, where the young, the gay and thoughtless flocked to quaff from the sparkling goblet, what they deemed a little harmless beverage ; but the door was opened to the spider's parlor, and many a silly fly through vain flattery was trapped in the intricate meshes of sin. There are individuals who know somewhat of the ravages of that most seductive and destructive vice, the Social Evil ; and their very souls are filled with horror and indignation ; but few dare speak the truth, lest they be silenced or persecuted by the bold champions of lust, whose infamous debauchery knows no bounds, and whose ill-gotten gains can license or bribe any form of evil they cherish. Every civilized commuoity was shocked by the startling news of London's venal sin ; but what of our own great cities, towns, villages, schools and homes? We need but lift the thin veil of secrecy to behold the social Molech in all its revolting hideousness. The sacred laws of God in nature wantonly disregarded in the relations of life, result in dwarfed and undeveloped specimens of humanity, whose distorted forms and facial expression, bears the stamp of demoralization and degradation, and whose innate inclinations lead the downward course. Our reformatories, hospitals and asylums,�vastly on the increase�are filled with mental, physical and moral wrecks, fruits of our hot-bed civilization, the very sight of which would make the simple children of nature, untutored and unspoiled, blush for shame. Our charities are boundless, and we may provide ad infinitum, but if we do not strike at the root of the evil tree, there will be no end to its productions. One of our modern philosophers truly says, u In all past time there has been no ethical system potent to establish a perfectly harmonious social state, and no system of education competent to lift society to a higher life. Education as it has been, brightens life with literature and art but does not elevate it. The same old element of poverty, misery, disease, crime and insanity, march on hand in hand with the hunting and warring barbarians of the past; and the dull blunted conscience of our time, lulled by the softly solemn platitudes of the pulpit, and the soulless system of education, rebels not against the old social order.' Rebellion and insubordination in children, so marked in the present age, are but the result of passional indulgence ; and when parents lose all control over them�without tracing the consequences to the cause�they are ready to devise means of ridding themselves of the burden ; and seek to place them in some charitable institution or spiritual community, where they soon prove past reclaiming by any reasonable or moral means, and must be cast forth upon society, to become its vagrants, criminals aud anarchists, often ending their days in prison or on the gallows. The most facile pen could draw but a faint delineation of the evils resulting from the practice of a vice, which proves a thousand times more destructive to human beings than liquor, or the many narcotics that craze and stupify the brain, or wreck the nervous system ; because, it pollutes the very fountains of life, and entails untold miseries upon future generations. God speed the good work that some noble individuals have commenced in the field of moral reform, this is the stepping stone to all true progress. Not until humanity rise in the scale of morality, can Christian communism hope for an increase of souls ; for the pleasure-loving world cliug to their cherished idols, and waive all thought of future good, in the vain hope of attaining happiness that is only the result of virtue, self-denial and a life consecrated to the service of God and the good of humanity.
