THE HORRORS OF SECTARIAN SUPREMACY A. B. BRADFORD In Scotland, the Catholics having at first the power, persecuted the Protestants in common. The Prelatists mounted the next wave, and overwhelmed the unhappy Presbyterians. Then the Presbyterians in their time, came into power and wreaked their vengeance on the Prelatists. Then the tide turned under James II, and the Presbyterians had again to bite the dust. Thus it was in England and all over Europe, till the earth was fattened with blood, shed in the unholy cause of persecution. So it would be in this country. Even in this enlightened age, there is no man, no set of men, no church, great nor small, that can be trusted with absolute dominion over the human conscience for a single hour. In the minority and powerless, the ecclesiastical or sectarian passion is as amiable and harmless as an unweaned cub. But invest it with power, and it becomes as ferocious and bloodthirsty as a Bengal tiger! Such is human nature in all ages and countries, when diabolized by the sectarian spirit.
