Watervliet, N. Y. Feb. 1891. Dear Editor:�You, no doubt, would like to hear how we are prospering in Watervliet. We are busy drawing and sawing logs at our mill, for our Society, and our neighbors. We are making full time just now, and are also getting up, and cutting our year's supply of wood. Our ice crop was gathered last month. It was very nice and from twelve to fourteen inches thick. Our stock is wintering well this season. Some of the families are hauling and spreading manure on their meadow land. The weather is cold here and a warm stove is looked upon with a good degree of pleasure. 1 hear the hum of the sewing machines every day, except Sunday, and I conclude our Sisters are anxious to make shirts for the heathen, (or somebody else.) So we are busy helping each other along. We have had enough of winter to last us twelve months and are now looking anxiously for spring. The hens have been on a strike this winter, and refuse to lay. We are in hopes with warm weather, to have the strike declared off. We have not much to complain of, and a great deal for which to be thankful. J. B. Oue ice was harvested some time ago, a goodly store, both in quality and quantity. There has been good sleighing most of the time, and snow in the woods has been a little too deep to please the wood-choppers. The weather is good, bad and indifferent ; and we have had f otir stormy Sundays in succession. In answer to enquiries about our silo�would say that since we have commenced feeding ensilage to our cows, we think the quantity and quality of milk much improved. Br. Daniel in Home Notes of Feb. ISTo. says, there is something lacking or wanting at Watervliet and throughout our Zion homes. What is needed? What is wanting? Talmage, in a recent sermon, says, what the Churches need to-day is, 'Power from on high.' Is it not this power from on high that we need and what Zion lacks? Will it come to us without exertion? and shall we be willing to accept it? Words are not lacking�but the Holy Spirit which is a consuming fire.
