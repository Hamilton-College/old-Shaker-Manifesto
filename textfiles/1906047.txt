A PRAYER. Emily B. Lord. Maker of earth and sea and sky, Creation's sovereign, Lord and King, Who hung the starry worlds on high, And formed alike the sparrow's wing: Bless the dumb creatures of thy care, And listen to their voiceless prayer. For us they toil, for us they die, These humble creatures thou hast made How shall we dare their rights deny, On whom thy seal of love is laid? Teach Thou our hearts to hear their plea, As Thou dost man's in prayer to Thee ! Humane Educator.
