WISDOM. SARAH A. COLLINS. O Wisdom, thou art lovable ; thou art beautiful. U that thou mayest be sought after more and more. Thou art strong, for thou canst calm the troubled waters of life and keep us in the right way which is for our prosperity and well being. When we hearken to thy voice, how much smoother is our path through the journey of life. It has been said by one of old, Wisdom is the principle thing, therefore get Wisdom. Wisdom is better than rubies and all the things which may be desired are not to be compared with it. The simple word itself is beautiful, and how much more beautiful are those who are adorned and by it are daily guided. How can we but admire it, and participate in it while it comprises so much that is praiseworthy? What are we without it?â€”like a vessel without a beacon-light to guide by night, or like a ship without a helm. We need it every hour in the daily walks of life, in times of rejoicing and in times of adversity. Where we see it exemplified the most we find the most perfection. The older we grow, the more clearly we see (or ought to see) the necessity of cultivating this most beautiful virtue. If we seek after Wisdom, earnestly, we will find a measure of it and it will help to keep us from a great deal of unrighteousness. 'Wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.' Without her we are ever straying from virtue's path. If we seek Wisdom now we may some day rejoice to know that in early life we began to find the pearl of great price. Only a barque that is broken, Only a dark, dreary way, And a life of condemnation For those who from virtue stray. Happy the thought that comes o'er me, In Christ there's no dread nor fear; But joy in a life that's holy, And peacH with a conscience clear. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
