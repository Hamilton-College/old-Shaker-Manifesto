Shirley, Mass. May, 1893. The season is very backward. Peas put in about a month ago, give little promise of being ready to pick on the 7th of June, a thing that has been done in Shirley. We are having colds here to some extent and are looking for more genial weather with anxiety. The swallows have come, and shortly the bobolink and oriole will try to make us glad. Have we not enough to make us so any way? Gloom and despondency will not help us, so let us enjoy the good of to-day, each day for itself; and live hopefully, thankfully, and trustingly for the morrow. John WMteley.
