Hamilton DeGraw, Sir:--I have just read... Columbia, Mo. Dec. 27, 1892. Hamilton DeGraw, Sir :�I have just read your article in the Manifesto of December on 'Our Heavenly Mother;' if you will pardon me, a stranger, for thus venturing to address you, I will inquire what Scriptural authority you have if any, for asserting that God is a dual nature, essentially, both Father and Mother. It is my opinion that our Protestant faith is unique in asserting that there is a triune God, each person which is distinctively masculine. Granted that the natural is but a shadow of the spiritual in many particulars, the parallelism if carried out to its fullest extent would lead to absurdities. The idea of a Mother in the Godhead, savors of gross materialism and of the old theologies like those of Greece and Rome which you say had 'the true elements that constitute an enlightened race.' Is not the expression 'Born of the spirit,' a figurative way of speaking ? Jesus said to the carping Jews^ that there is neither marrying nor giv ing in marriage in the resurrection. I do not think many political economists will agree with you in thinking that the evils which threaten our nation have been due to the lack of woman suffrage. You cannot in sincerity deny the superiority of man's intellect any more than you can deny his physical superiority ;�it may be, and likely is true, that 'woman's intuition' is the natural compensation for her lack of intellectual strength. The expressions, 'Bridegroom and Bride' as applied to Christ and the Church are surely figurative expressions, an anthropomorphic designation. Until you can prove from Scriptural authority that there is both Father and Mother in the Godhead it would be well not to speak of a 'triune God as a theological monster.' If a female Deity is necessary, why not argue a female devil also, as necessary to the propagation of evil spirits. I have stated some of my objections to the idea of a female principle in the Godhead: will you kindly give me some of your reasons for supposing there is such a principle ? I simply desire to know the truth as it THE MANIFESTO. 61 is in the Bible; am a student at the University of Missouri. Hoping to hear from you at an early date, I am yours very truly, Herman F. Harris.
