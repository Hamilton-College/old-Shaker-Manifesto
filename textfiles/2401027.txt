Dec. 1893 Elder Henry, Dear Brother:â€”The Books came safely and I was much pleased with what you have published concerning South Union. We have had nice weather and abundant crops of corn. We have to-day, Dec. 4th, the first snow of the season. It was just a few flakes and did not remain on the ground. Thank you for the return of the Books. John W. Perryman
