Longevity of the Jewish Race The average duration of life among the Jews in France, is computed to be five years longer than among Christians. M. Legoyt, a French author, in summing up the causes which lead to this higher average, gives prominence to the following : The 'sentiment of the family,' fully developed among them, assures to these children and to their aged and infirm parents a solicitude more active; to the new-born, the mother's nursing, and to the poor an assistance more efficacious. 'Their charity,' he says, 'is unequaled ; their morality is demonstrated by judiciary statistics : firmness and serenity of spirit are the most marked traits of their character, and proceed from a profound faith and an unalterable confidence in Providence.'
