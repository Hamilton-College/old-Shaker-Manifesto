Our Petition MARY WHITCHER Give us the ballast of a humble mind, That we may not so easily forget The many frailties of the human kind, With which our barque is tossed, like barques beset. And as we stand below our destined place, Let humble thought of what we ought to be Inspire our hearts to reach for perfect grace; But, until there, our weakness may we see. How well it hath been said of Charity, (Though all the other graces are our own,) If wanting this, we lack the purity Of Christian life and love, in this, our home. Then let us strive to gain 'the golden mean,' ' To be to others ever kind and true; ' Again, ' to see ourselves as we are seen,' Would doubtless give us charity anew. Shaker Village, N. H.
