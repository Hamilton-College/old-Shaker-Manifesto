INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY No bleeding birds nor bleeding beasts, No hyssop branch nor sprinkling priests, No running brook, nor flood nor sea, Can wash man's guilty stains away.' Can you unwhipped of justice go Because some priest has told you so? Can you escape the avenging rod That follows evil ways you've trod ? Can you transfer a moral stain ? Can you transfer the burn and pain ? Neuralgia's stings can others bear ? Your hectic flush can others wear? Your scrofula, or plague, or stone Be fastened on to other bones ? And you scot-free allowed to go ? Are there still fools who swear 'tis so ? Since progress is the sovereign rule, To lead from low to higher schools ; Since justice can't for sins atone, Each soul must bear its sins alone. Yet all are taught without disguise That pardon cometh from the skies ; That crimes of every name and hue May cheaply be forgiven you.
