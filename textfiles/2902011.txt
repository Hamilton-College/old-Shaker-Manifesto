Sabbathday Lake, Me. Jan. 1899. Christmas cheer and good-will reigned in our home during the holidays, and the good-will we hope to retain throughout all the days of the year before us. On the eve of the 26 ult. the young people gave an entertainment which pleased all who attended, most especially our good friends from Poland Springs who favored us with their presence. Sister Aurelia is now in Farmingron, Me. where she is superintending the publication of her book upon the life and light of Believers. We wish her every success as she has always been earnest in her efforts to have the life of a Shaker better known. School is in progress and the Singing Classes are working with untiring zea! to further the work so nobly started last winter. We extend kind thoughts and loving sympathy to our dear friends in Canterbury who are now suffering the loss of their good aud.faithf il Leaders, E.dress Joanna and Eldress Dorothy. Ada S. Vmnni'ngn.
