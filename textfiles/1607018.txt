LIGHT. 1. I see the light before me, 'Tis guiding me still farther 2 This glorious prospect cheers me, As onward to the goal I on Along my heavenly journey, Unto my future home, press; The vales of truth seem richer With promises of peace. I climb the rugged heights The skies begin to brighten; And as Rejoice and be exceeding glad, My soul, renew thine ardor; My sorrows vanish one by one And all my burdens lighten. With righteousness of saints be clad, Be truth alone thine armor.
