Remarks Made in Church Service, March 6, 1898. By Eliza A. Stratton. TTTE read in the good Book,'Make melody in your heart to the Lord.' V V How to do this is the precious thought of the morning, that has come with its brightness and freshness. Outward scenes indeed bring to our lips psalms of thankfulness and gratitude, but the Sabbath of Sabbaths which Believers may every day enjoy should, and does, draw forth unceasingly, melody which wells up in the soul, and will increase as all the keys of our oeing are touched by a sacred purpose that brings with its touch ho discord. The tones which make the purest and richest of melody are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance. Would not these sounding through our thoughts, our actions and our words make beautiful melody unto the Lord, and perfect harmony with all of his children? Oh ! a life of good service is the richest of melody ! East Canterbury, N. H.
