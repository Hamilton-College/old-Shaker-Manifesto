If they would really be pretty, and grow up as handsome women, let them remember that it is ' Not costly dress nor queenly air, Not jeweled hand, complexion fair ; Not pearly teeth nor sparkling eyes, Not voice that nightingale outvies.

These outward charms that please the sight Are naught unless the heart be right. She to fulfill her destined end Must with her beauty goodness blend.'
