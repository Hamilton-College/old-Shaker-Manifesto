THE ANCIENTS OF THE CITY. A tribute to our Sister ANNA DODSON. By Cecelia DeVere. One by one they leave us and our eyes Looking on them through the farewell tears, See the glories of the golden dyes Weaving coronals for closing years. See the cast up pathway that they trod Over mire and maze of poisoning thorn, Steep the road the pilgrim's way to Grod� Rough, but radiant with the rays of morn. Noble were the patriots of our land, Zealous to establish freedom's laws, Nobler far the self-denying band Pledged to suffering for Mount Zion's Cause. Pledged to keep the holy helpful vow, To obedience pledged whatever came, We who share their fruits of labor now, Are we lighted by their quenchless flame? Have we reacht the increase�vision seen By the prophets biding but in tents? Have we access to the fountain clean At whose touch the soul to Grod repents? Blessed sister, simple and sincere, Precious link between us and the past, May we often draw thy spirit near, May thy brave example with us last. Sacred consecration unreserved, In a gift of faith by thee was made, Never from thy youthful promise swerved, Never let thy soul's white lilies fade. To thy parents happy was the choice, In the hour when nature's claims assailed, On this mountain thenceforth to rejoice, More than Jeptha's daughter e'er bewailed. Christian sacrifice they understood, Adverse logic gained but doubtful place, T'was a hawk that would destroy their good . E'en though high and circling in its grace. What a triumph when a holy child Filled with courage helpt her parents on, Turned herself from sin's deluding wild Where so many purblind ones had gone. What the pain and marvel still through life, When companions sometimes broke their clasp, And went down to earth's bewildering strife, Phantom joys and sorrows real to grasp. What straightforward loyalty was thine, What pure charity that seemed like prayer, Or like sunshine on a pagan shrine, With a smile concealing folly's glare. E'en when souls long cherisht in thy love Gave ingratitude, thy lips were dumb, Thy reward was with thee from above, While thy thought was but for good to come. Faithful with the faithful hast thou been, Long thy home shall miss thy pleasant ways; Farewell dear one, till we meet again Safe within the pearly gates of praise. As the ancients silently depart, Shall we die in ignominious calm? Make no struggle to sustain our part And ignore the gift containing balm ? Look we up to heaven, or down to earth For the impulse that shall mould afresh? Shall we draw from life's immortal worth Or be swamped in fallacies of earth ? As new palms of victory we take, As we lift the spotless banner high, Every effort doth our souls awake, And we know God's work will never die. O, I hear sweet music roll and swell, Through the life-cloud screening from our view, That fair realm where our beloved ones dwell; Hark! each cadence will glad hope renew . Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
