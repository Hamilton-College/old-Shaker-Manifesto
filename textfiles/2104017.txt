Beloved Elder Henry;�To-day brings us the work of loving hands, sacred to the memory of our worthy Elder Giles. His Autobiography together with the touching mementos of his many friends. It was a beautiful thought to thus coinbine the two. His early resolutions to devote himself to the Shaker life, his entire consecration of time and talents to its cause are so well authenticated by the 'cloud of witnesses' at his departure, that the pamphlet seems like a string of pearls well clasped. And since, 'The lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime.' it is as you wrote us; this Memorial will be one of our best missionaries. Happiness cannot be bought at halfprice, neither can the full satisfaction of our life be reached without the entire de nial of self and selfish interests. But it needs the willing co-operation of every member in Community to make it a success. Also a careful, prayful, watchful spirit that we may have that 'wisdom which is from above, first pure then peaceable.' The living months have come to us again, and impress us strongly to 'look up through nature to nature's God.' As we cast our eyes over the landscape just now we see that the frosts of winter, and the stormy blasts have destroyed the verdure of the past summer. The earth is sere and brown. But what will the sunshine and showers do for it? O beautiful lesson to learn! The life principle is hidden beneath and within this seeming ruin, and ere long the perennials will bud and blossom the annuals will be replanted, and it will soon be verdure and freshness everywhere. Can we not go and do likewise? Though the inevitable vicissitudes of earth-life everywhere may destroy many cherished plans; though our fondest hopes may fail ere fruition; yet the perennial principle of truth within us is ever ready to blossom into life when awakened by the rays of the sun of righteousness; while new resolves and works meet for our daily needs, must like the annuals be 'resown with worthier seed,' and fitted to the toils of our day. We had an unexpected display of lightning on the evening of Feb. 28; though at the time it was quite cold and snowy. Winter lightning is said to show 'that there is solid weather behind' and it proved true this time, for the first week in March has the coldest record of our quite severe winter. A. J. C. North. Family. Mar. 16, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�I received a nice roll of music for which I return the hearty thanks of all the singers. The autobiographies arrived to-day and they look very nice and give universal satisfaction. I thought you might have such a flood of matter connected with the autobiographies, that I would not add to the overflowing vessel. We have had some very cold weather and a great deal of rain. The first week in March I gave our new boilers a thorough test as to the economy compared with stoves. The coal was very carefully weighed and it took just twenty pounds of coal for each joom per day. I took a great deal of pains that all should be warm and all the complaint I heard was, too hot. Nothing special moving, either in the physical or spiritual elements in these quarters. Our labors are mostly directed to raising the money to pay the taxes and hired men. Fishes are not caught very often in our waters that have the wherewith-all in their mouths to pay tribute to Caesar. So we must toil on, pray on. In kindest love, D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. Mak. 1891. It is a general time of health. No one sick. This is a great blessing. Ice and snow are plenty, but we are having a few warm days, and the snow and ice may disappear. The South family have been putting in a hot water heater to warm their sewing room, and it has proved to be a complete success. This is much better than a coal stove as it warms the room more evenly. Believing that cleanliness comes next to godliness, they have fitted up a new bath-room with all modern improvements. There seems to be some rivalry, to see which family will have the best care and present the best appearance. This is a move in the right direction. The Second family have made some improvements in the cooking of food for the stock. They have introduced a boiler for heating the water and also for steaming the food. They also have a silo, and of course the butter which they make must be number one. The gardeners at the Church are sow86 ing their tomato seed in boxes, and looking forward for early plants. We have one hundred lambs from our flock of sheep and all are doing well. As a Community we are prospering in temporal things, and are also striving to gather the fruits of the spirit. J. B. Enfield, Conn. Mar. 1891. 'This one thing I do,' said the apostle, 'forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.' What is the 'one thing' for which we are striving? Let us see to it that it is something worthy the energies of the immortal soul, something worth living for, something worth dying for. Let us strive to work foi the good of others, to uplift some sinking soul, to strengthen and cheer some sin-sick one, or arouse some weak and erring one to better endeavors. Let us make our heaven here. Virtuous living, kindly acts and loving consideration make of home a heaven that one is in no haste to exchange for heaven above. 2440 spaces of cream were sold in February. Spinach and top onion seed that was sown in October, is now two inches above ground, and gives promise of a fine crop early in May. Currants need one good trimming annually, cutting out old wood and thinning the new. A little salt in poultry food is beneficial, but too much is dangerous. Brahmas, Cochins and Games are the best table birds, (roasted.) Crosses of lighter breeds on the above, for broilers. For general purposes, Wyandottes, Plymouth Rocks and Langshans. For eggs, Spanish, Minorcas and Leghorns. For profit a person can secure better returns by selecting according to the variety in which he is most interested. All fowls should be made to scratch and search for a portion of their food. D. Obcutt.
