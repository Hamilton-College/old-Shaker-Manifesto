Enfield, Conn. Mar. 1891. 'This one thing I do,' said the apostle, 'forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.' What is the 'one thing' for which we are striving? Let us see to it that it is something worthy the energies of the immortal soul, something worth living for, something worth dying for. Let us strive to work foi the good of others, to uplift some sinking soul, to strengthen and cheer some sin-sick one, or arouse some weak and erring one to better endeavors.
