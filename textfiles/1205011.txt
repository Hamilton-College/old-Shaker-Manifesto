NON-MONOPOLY MARY WHITCHER The higher up possessions go, The less of land-marks we shall know; God owns the air and the blue sky, In which we share, and nothing buy. But that which is of earthly mold, By man, in turn, is bought and sold: Only in God doth freedom reign, Above each hill, and earthly plane. Then rise my soul and dwell above Where found is universal love; Cast off the bands of self and sin And live as Christ without, within. Canterbury, N. H.
