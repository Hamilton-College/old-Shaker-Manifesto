LET EACH ONE SAVE A SOUL What gem so precious as the soul? For what such earnest toil, To bring above the miry clay And place on virgin soil? Here lies the labor of the good, The work for all the strong, The wise, the patient, who have stood For God and Him alone. Let Zion search her ranks throughout For latent strength and power, To save a soul, each one for one, Lest guilt lie at the door. The talent given is only loaned, Its use we should restore ; If not improved, to be returned And given where there's more. Awake, anew 0 virgin band, And labor while 'tis day, Our further call to understand, Our farther work obey. The lukewarm souls who trust and wait Are not of blessing sure ; But he who works may also eat, And such shall heaven secure. Canterbury, N. H.
