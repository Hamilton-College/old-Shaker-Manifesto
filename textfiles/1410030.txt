NERVOUSNESS IN SPEAKING. A voriiiFUL speaker, nervous at the prospect of addi essing a literary society on its anniversary, was advised by a clergyman to look upon the audience as if it were so many cabbage-heads. The suggestion was not a bad one, provided the youth had thoroughly prepare.! the speech for heads with brains. The young man, though he d'd not know it, held in that nervousness, at least, one claim to a place among orators. For there is scarcely a public speaker whose words move men, who does not feel a similar tremor every time he rises before a great audience' My throat and lips, ' said the late Lord Derby, surnamed the 'Hubert of debate,'' from his dashing, fearless style, ' when I am going to speak, are as dry as those of a man who is going to be hanged. ' Mr. Ma thews, in his essay on ' The Orator's Trials, ' has collected a number of cases to illustrate the fact that the very sensibility which gives the orator his power makes him aervously anxious before rising to address an audience. Patrick Henry usually began with a hesi. tating timidity, which continued until the excitement of speaking threw it off. William Pinkney, a haughty, defiant, and vehement orator, would turn pale when about to speak, and his knees would tremble, as though he were BeJshazzar, gazing at the mysterious handwriting on the wall. Even years of practice failed to repress this nervousness. It is fortunate for the orator that years do not do this. For without the sensibility which begets it, one of the forces of oratory would be wanting. Tristam Burgess, ' the bald eagle of Rhode Island,' while speaking, onjsome important question, in the House of Representatives, suddenly pointed his fore-finger toward his opponent and made a long pause. 'Thatpause was terrible,' said a colleague to Mr. Burgess, on leaving the House. ' To no one so terrible as to me, ' replied the orator, 'for I couldn't think of anything to say.'� ' Nothing but strong excitement and a greaj occasion, ' wrote Lord Macaulay while he was looked upon as one of the orators of the House of Commons, 'overcomes a certain reserve and mauvaise horde [bashfulness] which I have in speaking; not a mauvaise honte which in the_least confuses me or makes me hesitate for a word, but which keeps me from putting my fervor into my tone or my action. ' Dr. Storrs, the most finished of pulpit orators, whose extemporaneous sermons are marvels of rhetoric, thought and eloquence. It is said made a cead failure when he first preached without notes. After floundering for twenty five minutes, lie came to a full stop. 'I sank back in the chair, ' he said describing his mortification, ' almost wishing that I had been with Pharoah and his hosts when the Red Sea went over them. ' ' My Lords, ' said the Earl of Rochester, as he began a speech to the House of Lords, ' I�I�I rise this time�My lords, I�I�I divide my discourse into four branches. My lords, if ever I rise again in this house, I give you leave to cut me off, root and branch forever. ' The lesson taught by these incidents is this: The orator should master, but not eradicate, his nervousness. Canning, one of England's wittiest and most classical of orators, used to say he Avas sure of speaking his best if he rose in a great fright. The more his heart beat the more certain he was that the heart of the audience would soon beat in responsive sympathetic rhythm. Selected.
