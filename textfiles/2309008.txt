SHALL WE EAT MEAT? Ernest Pick. That the columns of the Country Gentleman are open to discussion of the above question is evidence of the generous and liberal spirit of its Editors. The several articles published on this subject pro and con, make it a matter of earnest investigation more than a mere party question for its readers. Still, I consider that vegetarians are pre-eminently justified in treating this subject, because we do not expect a drunkard to be just the right person to give a right view concerning alcoholic drinks, nor a tob: cco-user to speak of the blessings connected with abstinence from tobacco. In the article under the above heading there are some points that need correction. . It is not the 'eating of meat that provides the rich red blood that furnishes the animal vigor necessary to rough sports,' but it is the amount of fresh pure air we inhale and its combustion in our lungs that condition the amount and quality of the i\d blood corpuscles. If the country people of the old country (the robust Irishman and the sturdy Scotchman) should depend on meat for their red corpuscles they would have very few of them and far between�on holidays and exceptional occasions. To state that the various herbivora have been created because the vigor and stamina of the human race are dependent in some degree on moderate meat eating is about as logical as for the cannibals to assume that the meat of their captives in war (or missionaries for a change) \&gt; necessary for keeping up their strength and courage in prime condition. The majority of the inhabitants of the earth prove that we indeed are able to feed directly of all the earth produces for us, for whole nations and 210 THE MANIFESTO. classes do abstain from eating meat� be it out of religious motives or out of necessity�and still (yea for this) maintain vigor of body and mind; whereas the slaughtering of animals for feeding on their often diseased bodies is one of the many sources of the intemperance that produces so much misery and sickness* among men to-day. There is no. reason to fear that 'the day that animal appetites are bred out of the human race, we shall be too worthless to accomplish any work the Lord has appointed for us.' On the contrary we shall then approach nearer the Kingdom of Heaven, with peace on earth and good-will to man, and cultivate the arts, industries and labors of peace. For as long as man will continue to kill animals for food, war will not cease. But I admit that total prohibition of meat eating once established will render us effeminate so as to deprive us of that animal vigor that vents itself in bestial excesses, and of that ferocity which moves our death-dealing hand not only against the harmless creatures of a lower plane, but forges weapons of death against our fellow-man�our brother. 'Thou shalt not kill' will yet be sacredly observed both concerning animals and man ; he who slayeth an ox will be like him who slayeth a man. Before the temperance movement, farmers thought it impossible to go through the arduous requirements of their occupation without the whiskey-bottle. Now many a good-tempered tiller of the soil and his brothers in the different trades prove the contrary to their satisfaction and benefit. That men in different occupations perform the most laborious work witLout the stimulant of meat lood will not be disputed. We need not give individual or general cases to prove it. We are masters of causes but become the slaves of consequences ; sis long as man chooses to kill in oide.1 to eat, to ransack ocean and laud for the gratification of animal appetites and trying to appease the following indispositions by using stimulants like coffee, tea, tobacco, morphine, opium, hashish and so on, he will suffer all manner of diseases and vent his wrath in extinguishing life. But the refined man is a simple feeder, and the temperate enjoys all the blessings of a life worth the living. In the future development of man he will rely for his food more and more on the garden and orchard and less on the pasture and slaughter-house. The law of love will protect all harmless living beings and the life of our brother-man will b &gt; sacred above ail things. No blood will uselessly be spilled in the kingdom to come when love will reign, pt ace bo on earth and good-will to all men. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
