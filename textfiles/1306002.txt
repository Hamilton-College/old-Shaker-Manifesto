GOODNESS. MARY WHITCHER. Selfishness, the soul of sin, Let us'strive to overcome. Good without from good within, Is the goodness to be won. Not a cloak for Christian life Made of 'seeming to be good,' But the real, without strife, Welling up in life to God. Here the accent of the voice Is the breath of love within; With the neighbor we rejoice In his joy, and mourn his pain. . Children of the living God, Born anew through Christ the Lamb, Through his life, which is the blood, We are sacrificed for Him. Here the resurrection stands,â€” Man arisen from the dead, With pure heart and cleansed hands, Doing as the Savior did. Canterbury, N. H.
