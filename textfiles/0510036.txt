KINDNESS Little acts of kindness which we render to each other in every-day life, are like flowers by the way-side to the traveler; they serve to gladden the heart and relieve the tedium of life's journey. Then let us improve each opportunity in performing those deeds of love ; for they will bloom like roses in the memory of those for whom they were performed, which will send forth sweet fragrance long after our departure to spirit spheres. Eunice Bathrick, Ayer, Mass.
