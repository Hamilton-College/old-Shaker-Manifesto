Letter Box. Dear Elder Abraham;—I have wanted to write to... West Pittsfield, Mar. 6, 1883. Hattie Dear Elder Abraham;—I have wanted to write to you a good long while. I am learning to work and to read. I can sing too, I have learned lots of songs. I like my nice home, I have such good times. I have learned fourteen verses in the Testament and said them in prayer meeting. I guess you won't think very queer for a little girl to write you a letter, for little girls do write letters and I have read them in the Manifesto. Please be real glad to get this and my love. Hattie.—Age, 7. P S. Please, I wrote this myself.
