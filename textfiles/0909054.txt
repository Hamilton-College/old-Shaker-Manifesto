Care of Calves and Sheep Lard and kerosene are good to keep lice from calves ; sulphur mixed with salt is good to drive ticks from sheep. Calves, like all animals, should be kept growing from youth to maturity. Here is one place where the profits come in. There is always a loss of time and feed, and more, by allowing young animals to 'stand still' for six months or more of the year. Sheep are well clothed, and need shelter from snow or rain, and perhaps from the very strongest winds, but cold agrees with them. Feed them well ; give them plenty of water, in small flocks ; keep them dry, and they may stay out in the cold and thrive. A close, dark pen is a poor place for sheep.
