SERVING THE DEVIL [Contributed by D. C. Brainard.] In the Town of- - - - -two Christian men 'fell out.' One heard the other was talking against him, and he went to him and said, ' Will you be kind enough to tell me my faults to my face, that I may profit by your Christian candor and try to get rid of them? ' 'Yes ' replied the other 'I will do it ' They went aside, and the former said, ' Before you commence telling what you think wrong in me, will you please bow down with me and let us pray over it, that my eyes may be opened to see my faults as you will tell them? You lead in prayer. ' It was done and when the prayer was over, the man who had sought the interview said ' Now proceed with what you have to complain of in me. ' But the other replied 'After praying over it, it looks so little that it is not worth talking about. The truth is, I feel now that in going around and speaking against you, I have been serving the Devil myself and wish you to forgive me the wrong I have done you. ' Zion's Watchman.
