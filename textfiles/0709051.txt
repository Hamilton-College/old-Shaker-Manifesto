A farmer of Goshen, N. Y.... A farmer of Goshen, N. Y., makes it easy for himself,uncomfortable for the potato-bugs and fattening to the toads by employing the services of a large number of the latter in his potato-patch. He has constructed a pit, into which the toads retire when not on active duty, and at regular intervals they are let out to devour the bugs,which they do very effectively.â€” Chatham Courier
