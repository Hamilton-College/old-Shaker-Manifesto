Beloved Editress : I bless the 'S. and S.,' and will lend my influence to its support. I bid it God-speed, and pray that it may be as an angel of conviction and mercy, bearing upon its golden wings glad tidings of salvation from sin to many weary ami sin-sick souls. May it find its way to different nations and kingdoms of earth, and be a minister of living faith to souls, and lead them to walk in obedience to truth, in the straight and narrow path ol.' self-denial and the cross, and to thankfully make an honest confession of every sin they have committed, with a full determination to forsake it forever. This is the ' Door of Hope;' and those who enter therein 'find rest unto their souls.' I feel that a heavenly invitation is sounding to many souls to come to the fountain of pure waters which is opened in Zion in this day of Christ's Second Appearing. The call is, 'Come all who will, and partake freely, without money or price.' Enter into mansions of peace and rest —rest from the turmoils and confusion that are abroad in the earth —the fruit of sin and wrong-doing. This will be an ample reward for all sacrifices made in leaving a worldly life fraught with so much misery, and entering upon a new life in the kingdom of righteousness and peace.
