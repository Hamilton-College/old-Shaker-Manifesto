NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Although in the home notes for New Lebanon in the Sept. No. 'enough' was the unanimous verdict rendered on the rain question, we have since found that there was 'more to follow.' September rivaled its weeping predecessors ; but the heaviest rainfall since September 1869 in cur locality, was between the 15th. and 18th. of the month. The earth could hold no more and the water seemed to flow in sheets over the surface. We on the mountain side with a succession of ponds and reservoirs above us had some cause for alarm, until after much exertion, at just the right moment the floodgates were opened. But what relieved us, added to the misery of the inhabitants of the valley below, and we could look with commiseration on the spreading water in the valley, while the people there were equally sympathizing with us as they saw the muddy torrents pouring over our hillsides. The under-ground drains became so filled with driftwood, (and even fish) that they refused to secrete the troubled waters, and sent them broadcast almost to our doors; and for a time on the morning of the 17th. we were unable to ford the current by the street fence without rubber boots; and we watched with anxiety as it crept closer to our doors. But arduous and steady labor on the part of the Brethren, at last narrowed the floods to their proper bounds, and we rejoiced that our well-made dams and reservoirs had so nobly proved themselves. It will yet be some time probably before the wash-outs will all be filled in as smoothly as before, for on surveying the premises the next day we could but repeat the poet's words : 'A morning-glory o'er a ruin The blue sky seems to-day So worn and storm-clad is the earth, So prematurely gray.'

Dear Elder Henry :�We have succeeded in securing our apple crop in good condition; picked between three and four hundred bushels for winter supply and have gathered Squashes, Beets and Beans. Cabbages are bursting open badly, partially in consequence of excessive moisture and partly in being transplanted too early in the season. Our people are much pleased with the appearance of the tile flooring in kitchen department. Our Ministry returned here from Watervliet on the 8th. inst., Elder Daniel somewhat improved in health; Elder Giles not so well. Sisters in usual health. \ Your Brother, T. Eatson. Sontli Family. Oct. 3, 1890. Dear Editor:�It is said 'there is a time for everything.' We sometimes think there is, but not much time for writing. We are enjoying these beautiful autumnal days and only wish they would tarry a long time, before the snow comes and our picturesque scenery must go. We will make the best of the coming winter, hoping that Oct. 1891 will find us all better and wiser. We are cutting and drying sweet corn. It is very nice. Brother Henry is securing some good winter apples ; not a full crop by any means. Last Sabbath day we met at the meeting-house again. We have not missed once this season, there has been more speaking than ever. If every one could preach as Elder Frederic Evans did last Sabbath, evil would not long be in existence. Our Saturday evening meetings for prayer are very necessary, but not as substantial as our Society meetings are. S. A. C. Hancock, Mass. Oct. 13. The farm crops are nearly all secured, and we are moving along in 'the even tenor of our way,' preparing for the approaching winter. The fine crop of potatoes of which we made mention in our notes for Sept. are decaying. Then too, the almost perfect weather which we lauded so highly, took its departure immediately, and we have been blest with few pleasant days since. Yesterday was a day of rare beauty. In- spired by the glories that autumn unfolds, and the soft breezes that were borne on the wings of the sweet scented air, we embraced the opportunity to enjoy a ride to the celebrated town of Lenox. It was formerly the Shire-town of our county, and is famed for being the home of several renowned authors. It is also distinguished for being the summer resort of the lovers of the beautiful in nature ; and for people who, weary and worn with the friction, bustle and din of city life, seek retirement and health restoring tonics, that this grand old town, with its salubrious air, glorious scenery and romantic beauty affords. As we wended our way thitherward, over hill and dale, past field and forest, journeying now by the side of a murmuring rill, again passing near a sheet of clear water, formed perhaps by the Omnipotent Creator; then another which may have been artificially formed by man, we were forcibly impressed with the truth, that all things possessing life, whether of the animal or vegetable kingdom, have their seasons to live, grow and decay, while the human being alone holds in its animate form an immortal spirit, which must and will exist eternally. The leaves, which a few weeks ago wore a bright green, have taken on gorgeous hue?, as though in anticipation of a return to mother earth, and the golden rays of the sun beaming upon everything, greatly enhanced their beauty. We do not wonder that the people of densely populated cities are attracted to this romantic town. The Co. who are working our ore-mine think the prospect for obtaining large quantities of iron is bright, as a mountain of the best quality of ore lies below the surface. They have made a new building and will sink another shaft, thus increasing their facilities for more extensive operations. We have in our family an enterprising German boy eleven years of age, who has the past season trapped nineteen woodchucks, and it needs but one more to round up the score, two pole-cats added make good the number. Jack Frost has made us several visits, impressing us thoroughly with a knowledge of his presence on two occasions, by his rude behavior. To close our notes, will state that we are being wonderfully blest with health in our little circle, as there is not at present a name on the sick list. Hoping we may be able to appreciate our manifold blessings we close; wishing you abundant success and prosperity. J. L. S. Enfield, Conn. What more happy thought can we have on leaving this world than that we are better for having lived in it. The only thing for us is to do the present duty, no matter how insignificant it may seem, and trust in God unquestioningly. Let us cherish a high ideal, and try to live up to it; but forget not the little things of every day life and need. Little by little great things are accomplished. The little things are frequently the important ones. Lots of little things can be done now that may save many dollars in the ne r future, when other and more important matters need looking after. The accepted time is now. Swift the flying seasons pass, time is on the wing. It is the constant care exercised over every part of the household, and constant endeavor to improve and apply our be.-t powers to our work, that alone gives peace, happiness and prosperity. Our six thousand strawberry plants Iook vigorous and give promise of a large crop next season. Top onions yielded well. Our dooryard is improved by new fence and plank walk. We may visit farm after farm, and see stables, cattle-sheds and stalls all erected on the most improved style, but not the least provision made for the poor neglected hen, and yet she will pay well if only treated like other stock. Properly managed compared to almost any other business, the returns would be substantial. 'Pratt's Poultry Food' is a good egg-producer. All kinds of grain are best for hens when cooked with other food. D. Orcutt.
