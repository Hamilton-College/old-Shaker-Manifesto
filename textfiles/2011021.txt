Enfield, Conn. What more happy thought can we have on leaving this world than that we are better for having lived in it. The only thing for us is to do the present duty, no matter how insignificant it may seem, and trust in God unquestioningly. Let us cherish a high ideal, and try to live up to it; but forget not the little things of every day life and need. Little by little great things are accomplished. The little things are frequently the important ones. Lots of little things can be done now that may save many dollars in the ne r future, when other and more important matters need looking after. The accepted time is now. Swift the flying seasons pass, time is on the wing. It is the constant care exercised over every part of the household, and constant endeavor to improve and apply our be.-t powers to our work, that alone gives peace, happiness and prosperity. Our six thousand strawberry plants Iook vigorous and give promise of a large crop next season. Top onions yielded well. Our dooryard is improved by new fence and plank walk. We may visit farm after farm, and see stables, cattle-sheds and stalls all erected on the most improved style, but not the least provision made for the poor neglected hen, and yet she will pay well if only treated like other stock. Properly managed compared to almost any other business, the returns would be substantial. 'Pratt's Poultry Food' is a good egg-producer. All kinds of grain are best for hens when cooked with other food. D. Orcutt.
