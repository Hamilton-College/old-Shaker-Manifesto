PURITY. Fidella Estabrook. 'Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and a good conscience.' Our hearts must first be pure that all the beautiful virtues that characterize a Chris- fian may find growth there. Purity is the result of the practice of all Christian virtues and the dispelling of all sin from the heart. We are told that we are the living temples wherein God would like to dwell if free from sin. Our hearts should not be like the Egyptian temples, beautiful on the exterior, but filled with idols within, for God has said 'ï¿½Thou shalt have no other God's but me,' so that when the Sun of Righteousness shines in, it may not find, even in the remotest corner idols so cherished but that under its enlightening power ve shall perceive the wrong and eradicate it. Purity of heart will manifest itself in the thoughts, words and acts of those who possess it. We should be very careful to think only pure thoughts as our words and actions will be of the same import. It is a life work; each time we overcome a temptation we add to the purity of the heart, as every time we yield we tarnish it, but if we rely on God's help we shall be strengthened; for he has said, 'I am with thee alway' 'I will never leave thee' and 'In times of trouble I will deliver thee.' Jesus gave a most precious promise in these words 'The pure in heart shall see God' and they can in part receive the fulfillment of it in this life, for they will see God's hand in every event and feel his presence ar. all times. If at last we attain that degree of purity we shall feel amply rewarded for all our struggles. Hancock, Mass.
