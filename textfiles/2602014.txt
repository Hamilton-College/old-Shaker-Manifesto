Harvard, Mass. Jan. 1896. According to Nature's inexorable laws we have passed the last stepping-stone in the yearly circuit of time. The old year now lies upon his bier, soon to be Luried in the dust of the past, while Boreas howls a mournful dirge in discordant notes. Sorrowful as well as happy memories cluster around the old, while the new born year, is sweetly slumbering upon its couch of joyful promises. Hope's bright star shines upon the future and we journey on, very much as before, till we are another circuit nearer that unknown land, 'where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.' We commemorated Christmas in a manner befitting the day. A morning song announced the hour of rising. In the afternoon the young people entertained us with singing and personified rehearsals. All received some token of kind remembrance and thus the day was happily and profitably spent. May these holidays serve to awaken the latent good in the human heart that the world may be made better by them. In the early part of December winter asserted his powers so strongly that ice eight and nine inches thick was formed. All preparations for harvesting it were made, when the rain descended and in less time than it took to freeze, it was all gone, and we were disappointed. We are now hoping that winter is through his fickleness and we expect better things. Usual health in Society, and all are seeking to do duty in the spirit of 'Peace on earth and good-will to men.'
