Delicate tomato salad A Delicate Tomato Salad. — Many who like tomatoes prefer them most of all in a raw state, as salad, served with various combinations of vinegar, oil and mustard—some using only a little vinegar, others using no vinegar, but a combination of oil and mustard. A great improvement on any of these is made by using the juice of a lemon only. In this way good tomatoes, skinned by putting them in scalding water for a minute, allowed to cool, cut into slices and a good lemon squeezed over them, form one of the most grateful and wholesome dishes obtainable in summer. For salads we prefer skinning with a sharp knife without immersing in hot water.
