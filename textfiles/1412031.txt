Evening Rest is the name given to a little hamlet in the Blue Ridge region of Pennsylvania, remarkable for the beauty of its surroundings and the lovely character of its people. Thither goes a 3Toung man from the East to visit an uncle whom he has never before seen, and Ins experiences during the stay make up the contents of the book. One incident of the story is strongly dramatic in character. A fauiily party, one of the members being the young man referred to, visit a coal mine. While passing through one of the narrow passages the guide fires a pistol to show the effects of the echo. The concussion of the air starts a loose part of the roof overhead and a portion falls in. The little company is shut up in the earth with little chance of ever seeing the light again. They have lights, however, and stumble across some tools, and by dint of many hours hard labor they are at length able to communicate with their iriends outside, who are at last able to rescue them. The author, throughout the story, dwells much upon the sweet and tender influences of home. In Evening Rest he creates an ideal household and community, and strives to show how much they have to do with the formation of character.
