I wish to extend my and our, kind thanks... Enfield, N. H. I 'wish to extend my and our, kind thanks to all who aid, in any way, in the publication of the Manifesto. We hail its appearance every month, as a messenger of good things. Could I have had the reading of its pages when younger, I should have been much better satisfied than with the reading of books I could not and did not understand. Ann Cumings.
