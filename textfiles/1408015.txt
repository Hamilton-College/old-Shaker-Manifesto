Continued from page 147... [Continued fkom page 147.] Now, if language means anything, God is male and female, and Adam stood as embassador for, or Gorl, as supreme rider over the earth. Moses was pronounced God to Pharaoh, to Aaron and to the tribes. The Prophets had the word of God, as Jesus stated, the Psalmist said 'They were called Gods to whom the word of God came. ' One of the Quaker sisters now came and sat by my side, saying ; ' I want to hear all you�ay.' 'Please tell me of your government, for I know nothing about you.' We explained to her, two males and two females form the several orders as the Ministry, Elders and Trustees^ and that these officers ruled among their own sex. She raised her hands, exclaiming,�'Good, male and female government, like ourselves ;' and add ing, ' I like your explanation. ' They were not offended at this plain talk and many seemed to give it a candid hearing. We then stepped to a company that were discussing the creation. By invitation we took part and argued it as true. On closing, all thanked us for throwing light upon a dark subject. It was now the hour for meeting. We ware permitted to attend what they called a social gathering, to hear reports from other Quarterly meetings. Again solicited to speak, we remarked. We came here determined neither to interfere with your theology, nor press our own upon others. We believe the difference of theological views has been the most fruitful source of division, bitterness, hatred and destructive feeling of any evil that ever cursed professed Christianity. It has produced more darkness and spiritual death, than all the other causes put together. We claim the right to declare, there is no person who accepts a higher degree of adoration for the character, standing and Godlike qualities of Jesus, the Lord of the New Creation than we do. This perhaps is saying enough on this matter. The Spirit of Worship. We have greatly reverenced the spirit which hii;* pervaded this assembly. We know the still small voice of the spirit of worship, and have felt it present at these gatherings ; without it, worship is a dead formality ; with it all are clothed with the spirit of devotion. Consecration . There is a striking similarity between your fraternity and ours. As we entered your village, and observed many gathering here, and saw the ample provision marie for their comfort; as we listened to the kindly greetings and words of welcome uttered, we were strongly reminded of the first Christian consecration, after the day of Pentecost, and the witnesses who gathered in mountains and valleys to extend and share their scant temporal blessings, and the more abundant stores and comforts, shared in common among our own people, who,by following the Christ spirit, have long mingled together and shared all things in common. Simplicity of Dkess. The plainness and simplicity of dress handed down by Heaven's own inspiration from spirits of light, to cause a separation between God's people and a proud lost world, to strongly rebuke the fashion, folly and extravagance of sinful men, which was to have been kept sacred and unbroken, is a sign to all. In looking at both people, we think it must be said, that we have been the most plain and uniform, and have best carried out the original intention. The Resurrection. Both you and we hold similar views respecting the Resurrection. We have both written and preached to the world, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. That it is the spirit, and nothing but the spirit, that holds and will share this eternal birthright. On War. In the late war, when our non-resistant principles were unheeded and our conscientious views were set aside, as a last appeal, we offered our prayers to the Rulers at Washington ; and when we appeared there, we found our Quaker friends, who in petitioning for their Christian rights, made common cause with us; and depending on a higher power, we both came off victorious. Silent Worship. You silently worship, after the example of the primitive Christians. Jesus told his disciples to tarry in Jerusalem, till they were inspired with power from on high. The; obeyed, and retired in an upper chamber to pray iu sorrow and silence. This spiritual power brought in by the Comforter, jell upon them, accompanied by one of the most important manifestations ever given in primitive days. All will do well to remember, it was a God-given gift, administered to them in silent worship. Jesus had told twelve illiterate disciples, who could speak nothing but the Hebrew tongue, and that very imperfectly, 'to go into all the world and preach the gospel. ' The mighty question must have come up with fear and force, how are we to do it? But when, with a sound, like a mighty rushing wind, this holy fire fell upon them, like cloven tongues, and they began to speak in other languages, it remained a mystery no longer. When the Jews from the temple came as a multitude to listen and learn, unbelievers scoffed and tried to smother the flame, by crying,�delusion and intemperance. But the fire of God's truth, had with the word, entered many honest hearts ; devout Jews from fifteen different nations who inquired : '' How is it, that we hear these illiterate Gallileans speaking to us in our own tongues, wherein we were born?' This started the primitive church. Jesus said, We have come to bring fire on earth, and what if it be already kindled! This fire brought in by Jesus was now gloriously kindled ; language was given to meet the occasion ; and by this language inspired by the spirit of God, it spread over the earth. Friends, we have said there were strong points of resemblance between us. We will speak of one more and close. Both churches have kept very far from outsiders, we think we are both at fault here ; but both are becoming more liberal, open and inviting; you in holding your awakening gatherings, and we in publishing our testimony to show the world just where we are. Let both toil on, until we come to a full knowledge cf the truth, as it was in Jesus. Please receive a good portion of our best love. Extend to your good Brethren and Sisters, Farewell till we meet in some heavenly place. From your friend, William Leonard.
