WORRYING, One of the hardest lessons in the school of life is the avoidance of worry. Some scholars learn it much faster and more thoroughly than others do. Indeed, they seem to have been born without the capacity of worrying, and those who have not been so fortunate are sometimes disposed to deny that such beings are entitled to any credit for their philosophical behavior.
