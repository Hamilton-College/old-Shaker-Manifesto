Let us all labor for the security of free thought, free speech... Let us all labor for the security of free thought, free speech, free press,-pure morals, unfettered religious sentiments, and equal rights and privileges for all men, irrespective of nationality, color or religion. Encourage free schools, and resolve that not one dollar appropriated to them shall be applied to the support of any sectarian school. Resolve that neither state nor nation shall support institutions save those where every child in the land may get a common school education unmixed with atheistic, pagan or sectarian teachings. Leave matters of religion to the family altar. Keep Church and State forever separate. U. S. Grant.
