AIM ARIGHT. MARCIA E, HASTINGS, It should be our aim to appreciate and love every person and every good quality. We should seek these qualities, look for them instead of looking for defects, unless for the purpose of helping to correct in a kindly, loving manner. Not scornfully spurn, if for protection's sake we must avoid intimacy with contaminating associates. Perhaps nearly every person has some way or ways that are disagreeable and unlovely to others ; let us each watch our own dispositions and try to so order them as not to offend or annoy sensible well-bred persons. Labor to exercise forbearance and loving consideration toward those who we think, (perhaps conceitedly.) are not so high in moral or intellectual attainments as ourselves, not of such noble parentage and excellent inherent propensities. If we can justly perceive that we have been more favored in the matter of transmission from parents enlightened and conscientious, who cared for the welfare of their children, guarded and shielded them from vice and vicious associates, prayed with them and earnestly for them, let us be humbly thankful for our lot and inheritance. Manifest the superior acceptance by our careful godly deportment and large-hearteduess ; thus honor our parents in the Lord. Canterbury, N. H.
