MY ENEMY By Eliza Calvert Hall. I have an enemy. And shall he be A useless thorn to vex and worry me? A dominant discord in life's perfect strain, Marring my dreams, turning my joy to pain, Molding my life to his malicious whim? Shall he be lord of me, or I of him? A bitter stream may turn the mill wheel round A thorny tree may burn to heat and light; And out of shameful wrong may spring the flower Of perfect right. So from my enemy I may demand A priceless tribute of perpetual good; And lead him captive at my chariot wheels, In royal mood. Because my enemy hath cunning ears, That listen hourly for my idle speech, My words shall flow in wise and measured way Beyond his carping reach. Because my enemy has eyes that watch With sleepless malice while I come and go, My days shall own no act I would not wish The world to know. Because my enemy doth hourly wield Some subtle snare to trip me every day, My feet shall never for one moment leave The straight and narrow way. Because my enemy doth hate me sore, I fix my gaze beyond him and above, And lift, as shield to all his fiery darts, A heart of love. And of my enemy I thus shall make A beacon light, to light me to my goal A faithful guardian of my house of life A spur and whip to urge my laggard soul; And though our strife may never have an end I yet might call this enemy, my friend.
