IN MEMORY OF ELDER AUGUSTUS BLASE. RACHEL E. MCDONALD. Farewell, our Brother dear, farewell, This tribute brief we give ; Thy life so well and nobly spent, In memory long shall live. A sower thyself in manhood's prime Of the rich and golden grain ; When the Reaper came, lie found thee ripe, Thy life without a stain. As oft in Worship's sacred hour, In songs our voice we raise ; We shall miss thy sweet notes leading In our hymns of prayer and praise. Farewell, 'tis hard to part with thee, But to the cross we bow; And to kind guardian angels' care, We give thee sadly now. But hushed be the voice of sorrow, And glad the song of love, That shall welcome 1hee our Brother, To thy fair, bright home above. Shakers, N. Y
