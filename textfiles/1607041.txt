THE HOME FOR THE SOUL , Is found where charity covereth a multitude of errors in the faltering yet honest soul; where all sin is brought to light by honest confession, followed by genuine repentance ; where unselfish love guides the steps of the wayward and where the sterling principles of mtegrity and uprightness alone are recognized as the foundation stones of God's spiritual temple. Here no self-interest can find an abiding place, and here wisdom dwells and crowns each faithful overcomer with unspeakable satisfaction. Canterbury, N. H. J. J. K.
