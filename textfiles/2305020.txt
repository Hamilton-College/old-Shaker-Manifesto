The Credibility of the Christian Religion The Credibility of the Christian Religion, by Samuel Smith, M. P. is a beautiful little Book of about one hundred pages. The author, 'as a man of business' says he 'is not entitled to deal with the subject except in a plain and practical way.' This very friendly manner in which the work is written will make it a pleasant companion, to many a thoughtful mind. Published by H. L. Hastings, 49 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
