A METAPHYSICAL PREACHER. The Eev. John Jones was a preacher of the metaphysical type. He had signified his desire to preach on a certain Sunday in the village of H- - - - -, where he had formerly served as pastor. His application was favorably considered by the pastor, who in order to make up his mind wisely, consulted Jonathan Sykes. The latter was a steward and class leader, a man advanced in years, whose educational advantages had been limited, but whose common sense was without limit. He was a man of great influence in the community, always at the head of every good work. 'Brother Sykes,' said the pastor, 'the Kev. John Jones wishes to occupy our pulpit next Sunday. What shall I say to him?' Laughing heartily, Brother Sykes answered: 'The Rev. John Jones always reminds me of a great big fish in a little pool of water. No sooner does he get in than he gives two or three flops and flounders, and gets it so muddy that you can't see in, and he can't see out.' We would commend the above to some preachers who are not of the Methodist persuasion. Christian Standard.
