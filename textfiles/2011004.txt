Correspondence. Dear Elder, F. W. Evans:--Your kind letter of 17th... Carlinville, Ill. Sep. 1890. Dear Elder, F. AV. Evans :ï¿½Your kind letter of 17th. inst. received. I have not given up the idea of going to Mt. Lebanon, by any means. I long to be there : I crave the spiritual food that can be obtained there only. Nay, Elder, please do not think that I love the world : I am sick of it. I have a partially invalid brother residing here, to whom, my mother at her death, requested me ever to be a friend; he it is that begs me not to leave him: my heart bleeds at the thought of leaving him. And may not the spirit of my mother hinder me ? Was it her that made me sick when I purposed leaving here for Lebanon ? You can now see the difficult situation that I am placed in. It keeps me in constant distress, not knowing what to do and do right. I have prayed often for spiritual guidance in this matter, that I may do what is pleasing to God: and any light or guidance that you may give me will be thankfully received. I somehow feel that there will be a wray opened before long, that I may go to Lebanon. Yours in love and respect J. W.
