Hot Water for Wounds Hot water in the treatment of bruises and wounds is strongly advocated by certain medical authorities. In proof of its efficacy, the New York Medical Journal states the following case : The hand of a workman in a machine-shop was crushed under the fall of a trip-hammer weighing 700 pounds. The hammer was arrested when within a halfinch of its bed, but the palm of the unfortunate hand receiving the blow was reduced to a pulp. The metacarpal bones were extensively comminuted, yet, in the hope of saving the member, it was kept immersed in hot water for two or three weeks, and then taken out and dressed.. In three months the patient was dismissed from the hospital, and in nine months was able to move his fingers and demonstrate that he still possessed a useful hand. The temperature of the water employed in such cases should be about 103 deg. Fahrenheit.
