TIME AS A WEAVER MARTHA J. ANDERSON How swift the shuttle flies that iveaves thy shroud!' â€”Young. Time with a swift momentum flies, As through life's web his shuttle flies; Twining the fiberd that fate has spun, All through the years since life begun; Threading the woof of hours and days, Drawn through our devious winding ways; Gathering the tangled ends of time, Weaving them all in rhythmic chime; Bending the broken ends of thought, Each by his skillful fingers caught. Soon shall thy garment woven be, Ere thou sbalt enter Eternity. But, O thou mortal! be not proud, Time with his shuttle weaves thy shroud. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
