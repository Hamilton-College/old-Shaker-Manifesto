BENEVOLENCE. Mabel E. Lane It is more blessed to give than to receive. Few realize the import of this beautiful saying of the good Master. It is lightly passed over by the majority who profess to follow him, because human nature is selfish ; and each one seeks his gain, regardless of his neighbor's comfort and happiness deeming it more profitable�if not more blessed�to receive than to give. A selfish disposition knows not the sweet peace and contentment that flows from true benevolence. Have we not all sometimes felt the joy of giving, or ministering to the needs of others ? We feel happier in distributing blessings, than in storing up for ourselves earthly treasures; and even when we make little sacrifices in the every day duties of lite for the comfort of our brother or sister, it imparts to, us greater pleasure than if we lived for self alone. There are some who are constantly hoarding up treasures, and only thinking and caring for their earthly wants without a thought for the future or for their spiritual needs ; such are not laying up treasures in heaven. To live to do good should be the end and aim of our existence ; if we would be happy and realize the true blessings of living we must subdue selfishness, and strive to possess the spirit that actuated the lowly Jesus, who went about continually doing good. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
