SIGNS OF PROGRESS In the British House of Commons, on the 8th inst., Mr. Henry Richard, member for Merthyr Tydvil, and Secretary of the London Peace Society, moved, That in the opinion of the House, her Majesty's government should communicate with foreign powers for the purpose of improving the international law, and with a view of establishing arbitration as a permanent resort for the settlement of differences between nations. Mr. Richard, in a speech in support of his motion, stated that he had received a large number of letters from America, expressing sympathy with his proposition. He proceeded to show that danger of war kept four millions! of men armed annually in Europe, rendering necessary a taxation of two thousand million dollars, and payment of yearly interest on war debts of seven hundred and fifty millions. In addition to this, the value of labor withdrawn from industry wag estimated to be twelve hundred and fifty millions. In Germany conscription forced an emigration which was depopulating the country, and Russia, France, and Italy were financially crippled by the expense of their enormous military establishments. Mr. Gladstone opposed the motion. He argued that it would defeat its own object, because continental nations held widely different views on the subject. He asked the gentleman to withdraw the motion. Mr. Richard declined to withdraw, a'nd the House divided. The division resulted in a tie â€” ninety-eight yeas to ninetyeight nays. The Speaker gave his casting vote in favor of the motion, which was adopted.
