MANY THANKS We truly feel grateful for the tangible remembrances from the friends of the Manifesto, in response to the call ' To the Generous.' We would still kindly petition for action on the part of those whose bills are due, and would plead with the generous who feel able to help us to do the honorable in our duty to our publishers. There can be no doubt that money so deposited will produce a harvest very pleasant to think of when time with the loaners will be no more.
