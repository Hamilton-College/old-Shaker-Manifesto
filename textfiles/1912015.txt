Enfield, Conn. Our ensilage corn is stored in good condition. It was a large crop. Buck-wheat good. Apples a fair crop and of excellent quality. A good quantity of pears. 282 baskets of peaches were marketed and plenty reserved for home use. One plum tree blossomed in Oct. The dwelling house is improved in appearance by some outside painting. The poultry house, with new fence, shows to advantage, and the hens are encouraged to give a good account of themselves. They should not bs crowded, and they should be kept warm and comfortable. Provision should be made for fresh air in proportion to the number of liens. Egg producing food must be given in sufficient quantity and material for shell, such as ground bone, oyster shells, &amp;c. Poultry pays if properly managed. D. Orcutt.
