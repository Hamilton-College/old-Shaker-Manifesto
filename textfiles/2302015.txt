THE ANGEL'S SONG. There's a song in the Heavens, a beautiful song, To welcome a saint to the throne; [sang 'Tis clearer and sweeter than when angels 'Glory to God in the highest.' Triumphantly sing 'Hosanna,' again. Children re-echo the gladsome refrain, Wide floats the banner, the emblem of love, While angels escort thee to mansions above. THE MANIFESTO. 41 Come, enter the portals, they're open to you, [true; Son of the Kedeemer, brave-hearted and Brilliant thy crown, and thy robe peaiily white, [light. Thy countenance shining with hallowed Canterbury, N. H. Angelina B. Clifford.
