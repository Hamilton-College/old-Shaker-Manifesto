The Pall Mall Gazette prints a letter... The Pall Mall Gazette prints a letter from an unnamed person whom it calls an American Shaker to an English vegetarian. The Gazette thinks it may be interesting to some readers and amusing to the rest, and for the same double purpose it is reproduced below : I am deeply interested in the spread of vegetarian ideas in England, believing as I do, that England will never cease to learn and practice the horrible art of war until she hears the Divine command, ' Thou shalt not kill, ' and religiously obeys it. Of course, a new land system would logically follow, for the war system originated the present land system. Meat-eaters, sword in hand, took possession of the land by force. Possession is nine points in law, and they made the law to secure to themselves title to the remaining tenth part. I am religiously converted and conscientiously convicted that riotous eating of food from the butcher is a direct cause of war, land monopoly, intemperance, and their concomitant evils. You speak of forming a colony of vegetarians in England. Do it by all means. My opinion is that such a colony would soon become a Shaker family, holding their land in common, laboring in common, all being teetotalers and non-resistants. Also they would refrain from increasing the population until, to all who do exist, life was a blessing. All truths have a family relation ; they go together. A Southern planter who owned many slaves, prohibited his daughter from introducing the use of brown bread into his family, saying, ' I have observed that vegetarians all become abolitionists, and brown bread is the first step to vegetarianism. ' Why not found Shaker societies, on the basis of vegetarianism, as above suggested, to check population and emigration ? Religious celibacy is Nature's balance wheel to the population faculty in humanity. Try it.
