Deaths. Frederic Sizer Frederic Sizer, at Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Jan. 27, 1897. Age 90 years, 3 mo. and 25 days. For the few past years, he has been gradually declining, until his earthly tabernacle becoming uninhabitable, the spirit, the real man, vacated it and sought a more acceptable dwelling place. Our Brother has proved himself a noble, honest, upright, faithful, prudent, devoted, consecrated man of God. Having been trustful over the things put under his care, having honorably discharged the duties of this lower sphere, the call now to him is, come up higher. Brother Frederic joined our Community when he was twenty-two years old, and has spent sixty-nine years in unselfish service. The pursuit of a secular life was open to him. lie had a profitable trade and was proficient therein. He did not espouse Shakerism through poverty, but because he felt that he could live more acceptably to his own understanding of what he felt was the requirement of God. All without or within our Community have deep respect for Brother Frederic Sizer. C. G. R.
