THE CURRENT OF LIFE. [Contributed by L. Willard.] Don't look for flaws as ycu go through life. And even when you find them It is wise and kind to be somewhat blind, And look for the virtue behind them For the cloudiest night has a hint of light Somewhere in its shadows hiding; It is better far to hunt for a star Than the spots on the sun abiding. The current of life runs ever away To the bosom of God's great ocean. Don't �et your force 'gainst the river's course, And think to alter its motion. Don't vaste a curse on the universe� Remember it lived before you; Don't butt at the storm with your puny formBut bend and let it go o'er you. The world will never adjust itself To suit your whim to the letter; [long Some things must go wrong your whole life And the sooner you know it the better. It is folly to fight with the Infinite, And go under at last in the wrestle; The wiser man shapes into God's plan, As the water shapes into a vessel. Selected.
