A Tribute to the Memory of Sister JANETTE ANGUS. By Orrin Beaver. Loving Sister thou hast left us, Laid life's heavy burdens down, For a home in yonder mansion, For the faithful soul prepared. 266 THE MANIFESTO. Long a patient toiler here, In the vineyard of the Lord, For the good of all around thee, Ever has thy life been found. Many souls have cause to bless thee. For thy kind and loving care, So unselfishly bestowed, On every child of Mother's fold. Never did thy faith forsake thee, Though many faltered at thy side; But trust in God sustained thy spirit, Through each dark and adverse hour. Oft we've heard her precious counsel, To the young in days of yore; Pleading with their thoughtless spirits To uphold this blessed cause. To live a pure and virtuous life, Renounce the vanities of youth; For treaures that can never die, As lasting as eternity. True unto each earthly trust, Through the shifting scenes of time; We feel thy pure and gentle spirit, Has found a home of rest at last. Where many souls who' ve gone before. To realms where dwell the pure in heart Will hail thee as their guiding star, Blest savior from a life of sin. No greater joy can souls possess, Who consecrate their all to God, Than love of kindred souls in Heaven, Who from all evil are set free. Then let us bear a daily cross, Against each secret inbred foe; That would involve our souls in loss, While dwelling in this lowly vale. That when our work is done below, And our mortal race is run; We may meet our Sister's spirit, In mansions of the justified. Shakers, N. Y.
