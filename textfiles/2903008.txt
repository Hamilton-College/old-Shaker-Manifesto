AN ILLUSTRATION. By Elder Abraham Perkins. AMONG- the good words spoken by Elder Henry C. Blinn in our Service, I was deeply imprest with his reference to the testimony of Eldress Polly Reed of the Ministry of Mt. Lebanon, who years ago said to us in this place, that we are to be individually our own Elders, yet we realize the liability to so construe and apply it in a manner as to remove us entirely from the foundation of genuine Christianity. The remark was simply and altogether an illustration of the making of Christian life practicable by so cautiously guarding all our thoughts, words and acts, so completely controlling our spirit, that no emanation or influence from our lives should leave a blot on our character as Christian disciples or work weakness in other souls by drawing them into a condition of independence, thus removing from the school of Christ its members, who are to become as children easy to be taught and to be subject to the order and polity of the institution. Elder Henry carefully added in his remarks, the necessity of a pilot at the helm, a guide to preserve the harmony of the body, which among the truths of the gospel is an essential item for the safety and redemption of the Christian traveler. To the disciples of Jesus, it was his closing and special charge that his baptism was to be their baptism, his life and testimony they were to handle and preach, giving the assurance that he who accepted and received it receiveth him and Him that sent him. No clearer revelation could be given of the order of a central ministration in the house of God, unto whose teachers he gave the power of loosing and binding on earth as is the order and law in heaven and the means alone for heirship and rightful claims in the heavenly kingdom.
