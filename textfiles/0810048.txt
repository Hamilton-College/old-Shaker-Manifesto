FARM and GARDEN Land Measurement —In order that the farmer should keep an account with his field, it is first necessary that he should ascertain its area. If he provide himself with a straight, stiff pole one rod long and notched into yards, he will be able to ascertain the area as follows: If the sides of the field are all parallel, multiply its length in rods and divide by 160—the quotient will be the number of acres in the field. Second, if the field is triangular in shape multiply the longest side in rods by the greatest width in rods, and divide half the product by 160, and you will get the area in acres. Third, when the sides of the field are irregular and unequal ones, run a line from one extreme corner to the other, and then find the area of the two triangles as above, and add them together. This will give you the number of acres in the whole field. Fields, no matter how ir- regular, may be measured in this way by dividing them into triangles.—Tournat of Ag- ricultu 'e.
