SUCCESS IN PRACTICAL LIFE If you speak the right word at the right time; if you are careful to leave people with a good impression ; if you do not trespass upon the rights of others; if you always think of others as well as yourself ; if you do not forget the courtesies which belong to your position, you are quite sure to accomplish much in life which others with equal ability fail to do. This is where the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong. It is where you make people feel that you are unselfish and honorable, and truthful and sincere. This is what society is looking for in men ; and it is astonishing how much men are able to win for self-respect and success and usefulness who possess these qualities or good breeding. It is almost the turning point of success in practical life.
