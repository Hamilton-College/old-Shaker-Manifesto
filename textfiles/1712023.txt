The Bible from a Printer's Standpoint. Printers might like to know that the entire Scriptures contain 2,275,260 ems in diamond and 2,807,840 ems in nonpareil. It would take a printer a year and a half to put the Scriptures in type, at the rate of 5,000 ems per day. The quantity of metal required in nonpareil would be about 6,500 pounds, in bourgeois 13,000, and in pica 26,000 pounds. Baltimore Labor Free Press.
