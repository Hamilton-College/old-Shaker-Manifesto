WHY IS IT SO [ Contributed by L. M. K. V. | ] Some find work where some find rest. And so the weary world goes on, I sometimes wonder what is best,ï¿½ The answer comes when life is gone. Some eyes sleep when some eyes wake, And so the dreary hours go ; Some hearts beat where some hearts break, I often wonder why 'tis so. Some hands fold where other hands Are lifted bravely in the strife; And so through ages and through lands Move on the two extremes of life. Some feet halt while some feet trend, In tireless march, a thorny way ; Some strangle on where some have 11cd Some seek where others shun the fray. Some sleep on while others keep The vigils of the true and hrave ; They will not rest till roses creep Hound their names above a grave. Selected.
