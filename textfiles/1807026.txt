SPEAK KINDLY. Abigail Crosman. Reflection, how sweet, when reviewing the past, To find on its pages, no envy o'ercast, But Peace and good-will, the Savior's first call, In love to each other, speak kindly to all. Thus home is made pleasant, wherever we dwell, Our friends, true, confiding, no language can tell. The inward approval, when thus we can say, So acts of unkindness, are found in our way. To friend, or to foe, domestic or child, Our words should be kind, parental and mild, In this is concealed the conqueror's power, From the peasant retired, to the monarch and tower. How quickly the beast, when to servitude called Appreciates the word, whether angry or mild. If the latter, how grateful, he looks at his friend, As the source from whence mercy alone can extend. Justice, with judgment, severely must rest I On the hand that would willingly torture a beast! Our Creator was their's to serve us, designed, Then why?ï¿½thus abuse, or treat them unkind? Kind words, fitly spoken, how quickly remove Revenge from the heart, and relax the strong nerve! Melt the soul in contrition, that mercy can flow, Thus forgiveness and love of a Savior they know. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. [Sister Abigail was born Nov. 9th. 1807.]
