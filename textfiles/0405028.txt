MY CREED I hold that Christian grace abounds Where charity is seen ; that when We climb to heaven, 'tis on the rounds Of love to men. I hold all else named piety A selfish scheme, a vain pretense, Where center is not, can there be Circumference ? This I moreover hold and dare Affirm where'er my rhyme may go, Whatever things be sweet or fair, Love makes them so ; 'Tis not the wide phylactery, Nor stubborn fast, or stated prayers, That make us saints ; we judge the tree By what it bears. And when a man can live apart From work, on theologic trust, I know the blood about his heart Is dry as dust. J. G. Whittier
