AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JOHN RANKIN. [The following very interesting biography of John Rankin was furnished to us by the friends of South Union, Ky. Ed.] My parents emigrated from Ireland to the state of Pennsylvania, while in their 37outh. Both of my parents were educated in the Colonistic church and adhered to the doctrines in the Westminster confession. ?Jy parents after a suitable acquaintance entered into that civil connection natural to the human family, who design living according to the order of the first Adam. I was born Nov. 27, 1757 in Guilford Co., North Carolina. When nearly three years of age, my father was removed by death, and my mother was left with two little children. While but a mere child, my mind was given to religious subjects, and my mother instructed me in the catechism, and had me commit to memory the creed, and some passages in the Psalms. In this I understood but little that I had learned although it made a serious impression on my mind. In addition to this she was careful to warn me against all sin, either in myself or by the example of others. I was taught to abhor intoxication and to detest the company of blasphemers. A kind parent ever solicitous for my welfare, taught me to beware of effeminate company. By this education and a protecting Providence, my mind was armed in a good measure with a shield against outbreaking sin. While I was receiving the above verbal education, a sufficient supply of religious books were put into my hands for my information and entertainment in leisure hours, and in particular on the Sabbath day, which had to be observed almost to Jewish scrupulosity. This observation held me under restraint and formed in- me a habitual and easy subjection to order, whether religious or civil. Some of the books were highly Calvanistic, and held forth their doctrines in general, with all the practical duties of religion as taught in their system. This course gave me a relish for reading and for research into those difficult scriptural doctrines. Having these lively impressions, my mind preponderated in favor of the New Light doctrine, and I greatly desired a living religion that would reach my understanding. I was now nineteen years of age and SEPTEMBER, 202 THE MANIFESTO. rationally feeling and scripturally convinced that I was destitute of what was called living religion. While under these impressions I made a practice of praying to God to illuminate my mind and bring me to the knowledge of the truth, to save me from temptation and sin. If I conversed on religion it was on the topics of the day. I dared advance no further, but at the expense of a sneer. In 1776, I was warmly solicited to obtain a classical education preparatory to becoming a theological preacher, or a preacher made by men. After mature deliberation on the subject, I embarked in the enterprize. I knew I was destitute of that which was said to be the effects of the gospel in that day and therefore made no determined choice of a profession, only on certain conditions, which were�that if God, in the course of my studies should enlighten my mind, and lead me to be a subject of his favor, I would then apply my education to public usefulness. I proceeded assiduously through Roman and Greek literature, and was entertained by a history of the exploits of their heroes, kings and emperors. Also with the account of the heathen mythology, a course of reading much better calculated to inspire a youth with inclinations to become a Julius Caesar or an Alexander, than to lead him to the gentle waters of eternal life. In my laborious study I lost my taste for reading the Scriptures and other religious books. Against Saturday eve-n ing my mind would be so fatigued with study, that I required the Sabbath to refresh myself for the labors of the following week. I went from home to the town of Charlotte and entered the academy in Mecklenburg County. Here I heard a man deliver a discourse that quicken d my feelings and created in me strong desires for living religion. On Sabbath evening I retired to a thicket where I had frequently spent some time in meditation. I fell on my knees in grief and earnestly called on God to have mercy on me, and deliver me from the burden of sin. It now occurred to me, that it was worse than vanity to attempt to preach a gospel which I had not in possession. Instantaneously I declined all prospects toward the gospel ministry and resolved that I would pros cute my learn ing and if possible, become a proficient in some branch of education by which I should be qualified for a teacher in some public institution and could live an honorable life. After a few months, I left the academy, to which I never returned. Our peace and prosperity was clouded by the desolating approach of war. Civil and literary improvements were laid aside, and the struggle to defend the country, was the great object. Annies were marching and counter marching in every quarter; scenes of blood and carnage were presented to the eye, and a cruel foe marked with desolation, for three years their whole route in the South, when their career fell by the arms of their triumphant captors. Things now began to wear a new aspect. Victory had brought peace. During the unsettled state of the nation and the return of peace, my mind was generally occupied with the chang- THE MANIFESTO. 203 ing scenes of the day. I applied myself to regular business, if possible to retrieve my loss, and I was successful in obtaining a profitable employment. About this time I heard of a Methodist preacher, who had visited our place, and I was desirous of hearing him. I reached the place of meeting too late to hear the first part of his sermon, but one remark that he made, entered my heart never to be forgotten. He said,�'I know I am alive to God.' My heart rejoiced; that is the life I want, but how to obtain it is beyond my comprehension. In this state of perplexity I continued to pray to God for light and wisdom, but could obtain no consolation. By industry and economy I laid by a sum of money to answer purposes I had in contemplation. On the 5th of Dec. 1786, I entered a new relation in life and settled in a family capacity. In this situation new duties devolved upon me, the religious part of which I found myself inadequate to perform to the satisfaction of my conscience. I had been baptized with water, but had no evidence of the remission of sins, but had evidence of the condemnation for sin. I now resolved to obtain the all-important treasures of the gospel. Accordingly I arranged my business in such a manner that I could attend all the principal meetings without inconvenience. The light was appearing. I had not put the above resolution into practice long, until on a memorable morning in great heaviness of spirit I retired to a sequestered spot for meditation and prayer. In composure of mind I arose from my knees and returned to the house, and instantly this passage of Scripture came to my mind,�'He which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.' Under these considerations I was encouraged in the performance of every duty. In the mean time, I made no more profession than formerly, but kept the operations of my mind a secret, as much as possible. Time seemed to pass almost imperceptibly. My mind was chained to the subject of Divine aid, so that I wrestled day and night, and would take no denial. Again the messenger came to my soul,�'Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.' I believed it came from God, and applied to my case. New consolation came to me and my hope revived. After this encouragement I determined to persevere in the path of duty let my condition of mind be what it might. A favorable opportunity offering, I opened my mind to one of the leading preachers of the revival, respecting my belief in the promises of God, and he frankly told me I had religion. I said I was not satisfied. He told me to persevere and I would be better satisfied. On another occasion being in company with a preacher who was very learned, I stated my situation to him, and he also said that I had religion. (to be continued.)
