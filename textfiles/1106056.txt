Solid words SOLID WORDS. Ignorance is the mother of all evils. Common sense is not a common thing. Constancy in mistakes is constant folly. A good character shines by its own light. No man can be wise on an empty stomach. Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand. He who has lost his honor can lose nothing more. Love dies of disgust and is buried by oblivion. One ungrateful man injures all that are in distress. Politeness is the expression or imitation of social virtues. No conflict is so severe as his who labors to subdue himself. In love there are no treaties of peace; there are only truces. A grand safeguard for doing right is to hate all that is wrong. In the world there are so few voices and so many echoes. True merit is like a river â€” the deeper it is the less noise it makes. Favors of every kind are doubted when they are speedily conferred. Philadelphia Republic.
