Selfishness There is no bar to thorough and wide culture so insuperably fatal as selfishness, nor any external disadvantage so contracting to the intellect as pride and ;ontracted affections. It is possible to be full in sympathy, in one place as well as in another, with all that is human, and with all that is noble; and there are few more honorable ambitions than to put your whole strength, with a willing and a cheerful mind, nto the work and the opportunities of goodwill which lie near you.
