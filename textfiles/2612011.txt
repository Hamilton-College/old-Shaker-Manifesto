Shakers, N. Y. North Family. Nov. 1896. One more stroke of the annual timepiece, and, to use an electrical phrase, the circuit will be closed with the record of the past year. Its anticipations and disappointments, in our material life we are glad to let go where they will take their place with the mouldering volumes of the receding years. The future is before us; but only in the present moment we live, To the student who pursues the religious and political writers of the day with a desire to come into rapport with living and moving thought, must notice that there is an anticipation of something beyond the ordinary: that the hour of destiny has struck, and the old must pass away, that the new may have room for development. We trust it will not be in the whirlwind or the tempest, but in the still, small voice which is the only medium through which can come the highest manifestation of divine truth. We are enjoying a delightful autumn which is giving farmers an opportunity to perform the duties necessary: to closing the agricultural campaign of the year. The 'Hints to Writers and Speakers' in the Nov. Manifesto is acceptable, and we will boil down our subject; and when we have finished, be sure and stop. Hamilton DeGraw.
