I may not reach the height nor depth... Canterbury, N. H. I may not reach the height nor depth Of God's great love to me; Nor view the Hand which turned my feet From harm, Â¦ I could not see. But this I know, I've felt its worth, And trust its saving power; I ask this searching, guiding light, In ev'ry passing hour.
