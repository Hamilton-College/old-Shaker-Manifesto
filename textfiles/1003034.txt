Remedy for Ear-ache .—The Journal of ¦Health gives the following: There is scarcely any ache to which children are subject so hard to bear and difficult to cure as the ear-ache. But there is a remedy never known to fail. Take a bit of cotton batting, put upon it a pinch of black pepper, gather it up and tie it, dip it in sweet oil, and insert into the ear. Put a flannel bandage over the head to keep it warm. It will give immediate relief.
