NOTES The establishing, growth and final decay of the primitive Church is one of the most eventful instances in religious history. Its advent had been heralded for thousands of years and a wonderful anxiety had pervaded the Jewish nation which anticipated the honor of becoming the favored people. The word of God came and dwelt among men. The testimony of the two edged sword was used as only God's devoted messengers could use it. A light was upon the earth which could comprehend all darkness. False coverings were of no avail for God through these ministers of his word declared that what had been hid should be manifested, and that which had been done in secret, should come to the light. It was the wonderful day of God's power. It gave evidence of this in the external demonstrations of healing the sick, giving sighi to the blind and hearing to the deaf; even the dead were raised and came forth praising God. After the falling away of this first Christian Church, and during the long period of spiritual darkness, many faithful messengers of God appeared from time to time and permitted their light to so shine that others were led to glorify God through them. In the Revelation of St. John they are called the Two Witnesses, and indeed, they were witnesses, as they represented the family of man, and as fully and faithfully the two gospel dispensations. They were the living Avitnesses of the word of God and their united testimony was given with great power against the subtle and pernicious doctrines of antichrist's kingdom. Other witnesses arose to speak the word of God. Faithful to the divine voice, they maintained the testimony of truth, and many were called to lay down their lives in defence of the faith. These were the celestial lights that were to be seen more or less distinctly during the long and gloomy night when ' darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness the people.' This church of Christ was established through the revelation of God, and in proper time gave to the world the benefits of its spiritual light and power. It was the temple that the prophet saw in his beautiful vision.ï¿½'; Come ye, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths, for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.' Isa. xi, 8. This church, so long as it stood faith- ful to the cause of trutli was a swift witness against the sins of the world and could not be overcome. Not even the gates of hell could prevail against it. It was, however, in the charge of human agencies. Servants of God, more or less faithful were the guardians of the heavenly treasure. In process of time another element was found to be gradually working its way into the order and finally to overcome the church so effectually that it was said to have been trodden under foot and the blessings of religious liberty largely driven from the earth. More witnesses continued to arise and testify boldly against the powers of darkness. It was the midnight of aatichristian reign and ruin, but their voices were heard and the force of the persecuting spirit began to decline. Truth and light again dawned upon mankind, religious liberty was brought forward, and receiving the support of such able advocates as were to be found among men, it continued to increase till liberty of conscience found a permanent resting place, once more upon the earth. Gifted classes arose under the name of heretics, fanatics, enthusiasts, Puritans and New lights, and testified of the incoming of a wonderful work of God among men. 'Liberty of conscience was a remarkable display of the providence of God in favor of this divine work. At this time the spirit of life from God entered into the witnesses and they stood upon their feet. In obedience to the voice of eternal love which called them, they rose up in the life and power of their testimony, above the power of antichristian tyranny and all its corrupt principles and doctrines. But from the time these witnesses began to rise, it was a number of years before they could gain real possession of the holy city. ' Prophetic numbers led us along from year to year, till the word of God became established in the order of a church which should bear the testimony of eternal life. Of this we now become the active witnesses. Light and truth has beea revealed and we are made partakers of His unbounded love.
