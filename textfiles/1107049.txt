BOLTING HIS FOOD Sam Slick tells us the story of the Honorable Alden Gobfoie, secretary of legation in England, who was dyspeptic, so he goes to Abernethy, the great English physician, for advice. ' What's the matter with you V says the doctor. 'Why,' says Alden, 'I presume I have the dyspepsy.' 'Ah,' says he, 'I see â€” a Yankee, swallowed more dollars than you can digest.' 'lam no American citizen,' says Alden with great dignity ; I am secretary to our legation at the court of St. James.' ' The dickens you are ! ' says Abernethy ; ' Then you'll soon get rid of your dyspepsy.' ' I don't see that inference,' said Alden. ' But I tell you it does follow,' said the doctor, 'for in the company you'll have to keep you'll have to eat like a Christian.' It was an everlasting pity Alden contradicted him, for he broke out like one distracted mad: ' I'll be hanged,' said he, 'if ever I saw a Yankee that didn't bolt his food whole like a boa-constrictor. How can you expect to digest food that you neither take trouble to dissect or time to masticate ? It's no won der you lose your teeth, for you never use them ; nor your digestion for you overload it; nor your saliva, for you expend it on the carpets. You Yankees load your stomachs as a Devonshire man does his cart, as full as it can hold and as fast as he can pitch it in with a fork, and drive off. And then you complain that such a load is too heavy for you.'
