GRATEFUL THOUGHT. Martha J. Anderson. Not for a favored spot alone The sun its radiance gives, But for the wide world's joy Its blessed influence lives. The lone pine on the mountain top. The floweret in the vale, The verdant grass and waving grain All tell the same sweet tale. 'Thou art my sun' is whispered softly From each living thing, And day bears up this grateful thought Upon expanded wing. So, with effulgence God infills This universe of life, And none so low, or sad, or worn With Time's embittered strife; But may look up with confidence To light and love divine And say, O Father Mother God, I feel that Thou art mine. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
