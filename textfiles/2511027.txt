The Church Monitor The Church Monitor is a four page monthly. Edited by G. T. Welcome, of Union Mills, Ind. Its doctrinal points are obscure, but as it presents the paper'Our Hope and Life in Christ' as the best family paper published in the west, we conclude The Monitor must be a Second Advent paper.
