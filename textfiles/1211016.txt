GENEROSITY Catherine Allen Why should we not always be kind and generous ? If through cold indifference, or intended selfishness, we withhold from others that sympathy and love which is in our power to bestow, and express in deed and word, or sometimes in little gifts of material things, we may perhaps pass more hours of this fleeting existence in comparative ease; may have SHAKER MANIFESTO. 253 more time for arranging little articles of personal convenience and taste; and may accumulate for individual keeping, a few more of the things that perish. But what can these avail the soul? At best we can only hold them through our brief span of time, and all that we gain at the expense of another's comfort, will become as a gnawing canker worm to consume the gift of peace that should attend the hours of meditation. The soul is really impoverished by every effort of selfish grasping, or keeping. Nothing can be of benefit to us beyond that which we can put to actual use ; and just as surely is true wealth increased by every act of self-denial, especially of Christian sympathy and mercy toward others. We cannot do anything through personal sacrifice to promote another's weal, without at the same time enriching our own souls. Mt. Lebanon, N, Y.
