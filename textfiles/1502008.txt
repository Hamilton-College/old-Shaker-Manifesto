ALFRED, ME., No. 2. BY ELDER OTIS SAWYER. Origin of the Shakers in Maine. New Light Baptists, called Merry Dancers Come-outcrs, etc. 'The New Jerusalem has come down from God out of heaven; Christ has come the second time, and if you want to be saved, you must confess your sins and take up rt full cross against the lust of the world, the lust of the flesh and every sinful indulgence or you can never enter the kingdom of heaven.' The interview with James Jewett was then related, and the guidance to the home of that good man, believed to be by the spirit of truth. John now communicated all that he had seen and heard ; that he had confessed his sins, one by one, as he had committed them, and when he had done that work honestly, he was filled with the gift and power of God. John and Sarah Barnes were well prepared to receive this testimony, and it entered deeply into their hearts, and John was led by the spirit to say,�'This is the woman we read of in Revelation, clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet. ' Be fore the sun went down the next day John and Sarah had confessed their sins to God, before his witnesses. John Cotton lost no time in conveying the joyful news to his New Light brethren, and also to his neighbors and friend-, a few of whom received the glad tidings. By special agreement between John Cotton and James Jewett some of the ministers from New Lebanon were to come to this place as soon as convenient. John arrived home the iirst of June and the iirst of July the trump of the Arch-angel was sounded by three messengers of God, who .shouted with a loud voice, calling souls to ' come to judgment, and confess your sins. ' This voice the whole neighborhood heard while yet afar off, and long before the messengers could be seen. The people, however, know the meaning of the voice, and rushed from their houses to meet the sacred messengers. These were found to be,� James Jewett of Enfield, N. H. ; Ebenezer Cooley of New Lebanon, N. Y. and Eliphalet Comstock of Hancock. Mass. Such a joyful meeting was never before known in this place. These ministers were received as the ambassadors of Christ, and they were filled with the message of salvation, which they communicated with a zeal, life and power. They also went from house to house, holding meetings and preaching the word of God, so that many were converted, confessed their sins ami received a baptism of purifying Jire. The family of Benjamin and Mary Barnes seemed ripe for the harvest, and all accepted the faith. These three ministers, before mentioned, held meetings with good effect in Alfred, Lyman, Waterborough, Gorham and Windham, accompanied by John Cotton and John Barnes. Kbenezer Cooley was the leading spirit and a powerful preacher. The Lord blessed their labors and the seed of faith that was sown took deep root in good soil. In all these places which they visited were found many of the New Light Baptists who were prepared for a higher and more progressive work. Finding the fields so promising in the province of Maine, as it was then called, other ministers soon followed and held meetings, and by the blessing of God, many able men and women were gathered into 'the fold of Christ. It would almost seem as though a line of I communication had been laid by spirit intelligences from New Lebanon through Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine, and then more particularly^ Alfred, Waterborough, Lyman, Gorham, Windham, New Gloucester, (called Sabbath Day Pond,) Poland and Falmouth. The fire of truth which these messengers kindled, flashed like lightning into all these places, and convicted many souls of the necessity of living a higher life in the true Christ order. Individuals, from all the towns named, were gathered into this Society, among whom may be named, Nathan Freeman, Joshua Harding, Josiah and Aaron. Whitney; all of whom had families. In a younger class we find Kobert McFarland, Ezekiel Hatch, Joseph Whitney, Elisha and James Pote. All the above were from the town of Gorharo, Gowen Wilson and family were from New Gloucester. Eliphaz Ring and family from Poland, and Thomas Cushman and family from Buckfield. Thomas Cushman was a wise, judicious man, and subsequently became a member in the order of Ministry. Among the unmarried young women we find the names of Dana Thorns, Mary Hatch, Abigail Cotton, Dorcas Cotton and Lois Kneeland. These were also residents of Gorham. The head-quarters of the Believers in this section was at the house of Benjamin Barnes, which occupied the place where the Sisters' shop, at the Second Family, formerly stood, and his farm extended from the Massabesie Lake to the Bunganut pond. Benjamin was one of the first to consecrate his property and this became a nucleus around which the domain grew to the present extensive dimensions. The following account belongs more properly to the history of New Gloucester, but it may with propriety be incorporated in the history of Alfred, as so many, whose names are here given, were gathered to this Society. In the month of August 17S-4- a company from Gorham and Sabbath Day Pond, chartered a small vessel of Greenfield Pote of Portland, called ' 77te Shark. ' The vessel was of twenty eight tons burden, and was to be titted out to go to New York and up the Hudson river to Albany. The object was to make a visit to Mother Ann and the Elders, who lived in Niskayuna. Samuel Brown was appointed to act as captain and Enoch Wake as assistant skipper. Thirteen Brethren and twelve Sisters formed the company for the pilgrimage. Eobert McFarland, Barnabas Bangs, Thomas Bangs, Nathan Freeman sen., Samuel Brown, Moses Hanscom, Nathaniel Stevens, Ezekiel Hatch, James Merrill sen., Nathan Merrill, Solomon Twombly, Gowen Wilson and Knoch Waite. Dana A. Thorns, Lydia Freeman, Barbara Brown, Mary Hatch, Catharine Bangs, Betty Cotton, Hannah Whitney, Betty Stevens, Molly Merrill, Rachel Merrill, Molly Wilson and Hannah Starbird. Several of the Brethren were good sailors. The little craft was well manned ami amply supplied with stores for the voyage out and to return. With a favoraUe wind they sailed pleasantly out of the beautiful harbor of Portland and directed their course to New York. It was high tide when they passed through Hurl or Hell gate. The sisters, particularly, had dreaded this place, as the passage, at times, was extremely rough and very dangerous. The Sisters were made quite happy when told that they had unconsciously passed the fearful place unharmed. They waited in New York a short time for a favorable wind and tide to bear their little craft lip the river to Albany. Barnabas Barnes would often relate the struggle they were obliged to make, to stem the current before reaching Albany, and said he was amused to see how adroitly the skippers would tack and beat against the tide. Those not immediately engaged in manning the vessel did not remain idle. Their time was improved in catching fish which they carefully packed, and of these were able to present several barrels to the little family at Niskayuna. They also made presents of other stores which they carried from home for that purpose. Several of the Brethren remained in Albany to care for the vessel, while the others of the company walked to Niskayuna, a distance of seven miles. Mother Ann and others saw this company, in vision, many days before their arrival, and requested that preparation be made to receive them. Postal facilities were limited, and slow at that, and the custom had not obtained in that day, as now, of writing letters to apprise friends of expected arrival of company. (To BE CONTINUED.)
