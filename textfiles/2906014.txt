East Canterbury N. H. June, 1899. 'Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home' floats out upon the spring air to the rhythm of the scraping and scouring, the dusting and draping, the painting and polishing, which regularly succeed one another in the sweet symphony of our home life at this special season. We have indeed stirring strains in every sense of the term, muscular Christianity holds full sway six days in the week. The principle of godliness is evidenced by the practice of cleanliness; and we above all other people, purpose to prove its existence among us. Vegetation has risen to the occasion, and bud and blossom are up to date. Six acres of potatoes, two early and four late varieties, are now planted. Green peas were sowed on the 20th ult. Asparagus fell under the knife the 11th inst., and rhubarb will, no doubt, be the next victim. The spring term of school opened on the 2nd inst. under pleasant auspices. There are twenty-one pupils registered, and all have our kind encouragement in their important work. Our good Editor has just establisht an interesting little institution near the child- THE MANIFESTO. 93 ren's dwellinga veritable summer-house for the birds. The purple martins are the invited guests, but the white-bellied swallows were present at the raising, watched the proceedings with keen interest then hastened to take the new quarters and would not be driven out though measures i were promptly taken for evacuation. They pugnaciously hold the fort by right of discovery and the invited guests are happily unaware of the gross insult. Kind greetings in advance we send to our good friends at Enfield, Conn., who have at last evolved the idea that intervisiting is a good foundation-stone in our church work. We recommend the idea for universal adoption. Jessie licuns.
