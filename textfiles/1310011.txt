A MORNING THOUGHT. FLORA WILLIAMS. Many Authors have found the morning the best time for study and composition ; hence, it has been called the '-frierd of the muses.' It would be easy to prove that it is equally a friend to the graces and to the duties ; it is the finest season for reflection and devotion. How much there is in the morning to call forth the voice of thanksgiving, as we awake from our slumbers invigorated and refreshed, secure from accident by fire and from other calamities. And with how many of theso merciful nights have we been favored! How strange that what increases the greatness of our obligation should diminish its realization ! For by the interruption, the suspension, or the want of comforts we are taught to value them. Let us guard against this ingratitude, and remember that though our mercies are common, they are greai and numerous, and thus increase the claim to our prayer and praise. And shall our gratitude like volatile vapors pass away in a mere morning acknowledgment? Shall we not, according to the mei'cies of God, dedicate ourselves to his service in the morning, at noontide, and at evening and seek the gentle dews of refreshing through the inspiration of prayer? We should be influenced and encouraged by the command and promise, 'Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not on thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths.' Canterbury, N. H.
