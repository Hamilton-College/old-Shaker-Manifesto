DUALITY IN DEITY. NANCY G. DANFORTH. We cannot see how persons of strong thinking powers should so construe the Scriptures as to form to themselves three persons in the Godhead, and these all in the male order ! In Genesis we are told that ' God said, Let us make man in our image, in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them.' The same as saying plainly that the attributes of male and female, Father and Mother are united to form the Godhead. To come down to later times, the apostle speaking of God says, 'The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are already seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead. ' What can be more clearly traced through all the works of creation than the two forces, positive and negative, or male and female elements? ' The eternal creative power of Deity, preceeding from the order of the Godhead, is the most clearly seen and distinctly represented and demonstrated in nature, by the procreative power of the male and female principles as existing and eternally producing beings and things in their own image and likeness, or after their own kind, throughout all the ranks of creation. These two principles then, are the foundations of all worldsï¿½natural and spiritual.' As we pass through the realms of reason and test our theories from this standpoint, it becomes impossible to conceive of the attribute of fatherhood without the corresponding element of motherhood. We find this union in all animate beings. Whence comes it ? From the source of life ; the Eternal Father and Mother of all created things. Why has this idea been so long held in disrepute? Ever since the fall of man and the curse pronounced on woman, she has been held in subordination, as a being quite inferior to man. Through the many ages that have intervened, in the estimation of man, woman has hardly held a place above the brute beasts ; but now, that the seed of the woman is bruising ' the serpent's head' light is dawning from the spiritual world, showing that she is the true help-meet and companion of man, his equal in all things. More than this, some rays of light are falling on the darkness which has so long veiled the Godhead, in the mystery of a trinity ; a mystery conceived by the Romish church, fought over for many years, and at length, in the fourth century, canonized and decreed to be an article of faith, which all must subscribe to, or, be punished as heretics. Such is the inconsistency of man, to think to dictate another in that faith which ' Is the gift of God ! ' Jesus never claimed that He was God. If the expression, 'I and my Father are one' proves that He was God, then were the disciples gods, for He prays ' that they also may be one in us.' Shall we, then, worship the followers of Christ? True, the apostle says, 'they were called gods to whom the word of God came,' even, were this the case, there would still be as many female as male gods, which would overthrow the doctrine of a trinity. After all that can be said, it is well to go back to first principles and examine the subject carefully, and thus we shall find that there is an Eternal Two in One. Canterbury, N. H.
