STAR OF PURITY. Union Village, Ohio. 1. O brighter than the morning star, Is the heart that's pure, and free; 2. The gems within the ocean deep, And the wealth her caverns bear, And the light that's ever glowing there,ï¿½The Star of Purity. Let the ocean and her caverns keep, In darkness hidden there. The sun shall wane, the stars go down, And reign of time be o'er; But the But O, almighty Father, send Thine angels from above, To living light in the heart that's pure, Shall shine forevermore, kindle in my heart a fire Of purity and love.
