TEMPEST-TOSSED. ' I will be glad and rejoice in Thy mercy; for Thou hast considered my trouble.' Psalms, xxxi, 7. Canterbury, N. H. 1893. O sing, my soul, in accents clear That God did hear thy prayer, And through the depths, when tempest-toss'd, He sent His angels near, He sent his angels near. The message came in words of love, 'Hold on thy way, brave soul All heights are mine, all depths I scan, The waves will I control, The waves will I control.'
