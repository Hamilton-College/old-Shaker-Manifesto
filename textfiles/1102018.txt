THE WEST POINT APPOINTEE We wonder at the inordinate compliments that are being bestowed upon General Howard, who lately displaced General Schofield at the military THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 41 academy at West Point, N. Y.! We have long been aware of the eulogiums conferred upon 0. 0. Howard as a very Christian gentleman. Our religious contemporaries have been very liberal in their compliments of his Christian character. We ask all such, and the General himself, to consider for a few moments how Christian he or any man can be, who believes in war. and the instruction of war to the as yet uninitiated? We ask them to recall the testimony of General Schofield on the Whittaker trial, wherein he asserted that ' The Bible may teach such foolishness as turning the other cheek when one is assaulted, but we teach no such foolishness here ! ' We simply would assert, in repetition of the first best Christian, ' My servants will not fight! ' and we would simply add that Ave opine General Howard is either no Christian, or that the U. S. Government has made a mistake in the appointment, or perhaps better, Howard has gone there in the interest of the Lord to convert that devilish institution into a peaceable array for the Lordâ€”than which the U. 8. Government could expend its funds for no better 'purpose.
