FAITH'S REWARD Our earth life is fleeting, and passes away, As mists of the morning in brightness of day, The few pleasure moments allotted us here, Come sparkling like bubbles, and then disap- pear. The friends whom we love, that 'we fold to our hearts, Pass from us as glory of evening departs ; And though by their presence our spirits are blest, We cannot retain them from angelic rest. We pluck the sweet flower, and behold its fair form Soon withers and droops, as if torn by the storm ; And, while we are seeking our sorrow to hide, We ask, in our hearts, is there naught can abide 1 A brightness comes o'er me, a soft whisper near, It says, Child of earth, 0 dispel doubt and fear. The spirit, released from its casket of clay, Aloft soars in freedom to bright realms of day. The loved ones you cherish, the friendship so dear, Shall yet be your treasure in yon happy sphere. No sin, nor affliction, can find entrance there, For deep love and wisdom pervade everywhere. The delicate flower, so fragrant and sweet, Will bloom with new life, and with beauty replete; No mildew nor blight in the bud can destroy The fruit or fair blossoms of that land of joy. Then toil on with ardor, with hope ever rife, Before us are riches of immortal life ; Our Heavenly Father and Mother will crown All those who in faith have their own lives laid down.
