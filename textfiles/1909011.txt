CHRISTIAN WARFARE. Emily Offord. 'Comb forward ye noble, brave-hearted soldiers, Stand for the cause in which you've engaged; Fight for the victory, gain a crown all-glorious, For lo! the trumpet soundeth, the war is waged, The call is for warriors with undaunted courage, Those who will stand the test in each trying hour; I will be one, for my faith I have planted On the Bock of Ages, an eternal power.' The above song was sung mauy years agQ by earnest truth-loving souls. In looking over the songs, and recalling to mind many sayings of those whom we term 'The Old Believers,' we find this figure of speech often used, warfare, mighty battles against a crafty and insidious enemy, while to-day we seldom use such expressions. Love, union, peace, are more generally spoken of now. It is said that extremes balance each other. Our gospel predecessors were intensely religious, ardent, enthusiastic and thoroughly sincere ; imbued with ideas firmly impressed by their previous orthodox education, and intensified by the soul struggle they had to go through in order, as pioneers in a newly advanced cause, to break off old habits and leave old associations for the purpose of forming new and better ones. And is there not still a necessity for earnest labor? and must we not still carry on an .internal, relentless, individual I warfare in order to subdue in the heart ' those giant evils, 'the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye aud the pride of life,' with all their concomitants, carnal thoughts and desires, vanity and frivolity, arrogance and selfishness? These are not of the divine Father aud Mother and do not build up the new heavens, but continually destroy the peace of society ; and not only to subdue, but to utterly destroy them is the duty of every Christian ; this holy warfare we are called to engage in, aud all who fight this good fight will Lot fail to find growing in the heart the principles of love, union, peace, brotherly and sisterly linduess toward each other ; no longer will be heard railing, backbiting and slander, but harmony and concord will abound. But it is a fact true as truth. lliat the latter is never gained until the former is experienced. Yea I know of a truth that to love my brother and sister with pure Christlike love, I must sever all carnal fleshly, selfish ties, and this is the blessed privilege of each aud every one who enters into the gospel desirous of becoming a follower of the blessed Savior. In my youth I vowed to my God that I would consecrate my life to this cause and from time to time have renewed my earlv vows aud boldly testify that I find comfort and happiness herein, and I1 am bound to continue in this conflict, | not only in this life, but in the life beï¿½ yond, till I can say. as did Jesus 'the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me.' Yea till all longings and desires for the earthly and inferior are displaced by the possession of the heavenly and superior. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
