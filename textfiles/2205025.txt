Dayton, Ohio. Beloved Eldek Hesky:We have just finished putting up a set of laundry machinery, consisting of a new mill, two galvanized iron tanks, a tub for rubbing out clothes and a tub for boiling and bluing the clothes. We had August Frederick from White Water, helping us put up the machinery and another Brother, John Tyler, came with him as a visitor, but instead of visit, ing he went to work and helped us put up the machinery. [Our best love to Br. John for his new style of visiting. Ed.] Brother Moore Mason is busy setting out plants and transplanting them from one bed to another. He has a fine lot of them. We are also tearing away the old laundry building. Brother Moore and the writer had a very pleasant visit at Union Village, a few weeks ago. We enjoyed the company of the Brethren and Sisters very much and on the Sabbath had a very good meeting. Elder Napoleon Brown preached an excellent sermon and several of the Brethren and Sisters spoke. When we returned home, Elder Napoleon returned with us. The Ministry were with us on the 15th of February and the Sisters returned on the 18th but Elder Oliver stopped with us over the Sabbath. Our meetings are good, especially on Sunday P. M. On Thursday evenings we have a singing school and a Sabbath school on Sabbath morning and a prayer meeting in the evening. Good gospel testimonies are spoken and sung in our meetings. The month of March was very rough and cold with a good deal of snow and rain. We will send our love to all the Societies who read our home notes. H. W. F.
