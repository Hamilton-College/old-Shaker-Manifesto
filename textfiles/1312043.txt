I welcome the Manifesto with delight... Enfield, Conn., 1883. I welcome the Manifesto with delight. It is better every number. I can scarcely wait from one number to another. I read it all, and find many articles worth four times its cost; they are exceedingly interesting, and such as I put away to review often. Gladly would I deprive myself of other privileges for its pleasant companionship, bringing as it doesâ€”bright truths to cheer Miy heart, and teach me that the lessons learned here, however bitter, are but stepping stones to the higher life.
