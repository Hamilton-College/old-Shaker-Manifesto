Christian Progress To those who can recall the precepts of preaching and writing of only onequarter of a century since, must be forcibly and happily impressed with the mighty strides which pulpit and practical Christianity have made toward the teachings of the model Christian. There is a greater love of Christ manifested to-day than ever before — manifested too, not through adherence to technical, theological points, but in the acknowledgments so often heard that Christ's life was and is best for Christians RomanCatholics were never so stirred among themselves, that their best representatives should copy at least one peculiar feature of Jesus and apostles—that of celibacy. Celibacy THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 65 for greater righteousness' sake obtains greater respect and encouragement among the purest thinkers of all denominations, Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant alike, than ever before. The horrors of war are deprecated more than ever everywhere; and the more peaceful methods of arbitration and non-resistance have assumed possible and real engagement of the reflection of nations. The great Gladstone, of England, has lately invited all ' Europe 'to engage in a general disarmament! The rush of the Communists, wild and unwise though it seems, has for its calmer meaning 'Share and share alike,' something like Pentecostal days. We are living in grand times. The millennium is approaching faster than we are apt to think that it is ; and where souls are living as Christ did, and dying unto the world as Jesus did, the millennium has already come, and come to stay.
