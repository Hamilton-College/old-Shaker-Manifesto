Correspondence. E. I. Lindh, Secretary United Christian Association... Shirley, Mass., Aug. 6, 1895. E. I. Lindh, Secretary United Christian Association, Cambridge, Mass., Dear Friend :After reading the reports of the Ayer Conference of July 30, I much- regretted that I had not arranged to be there, so that I could have enjoyed the pleasant interchange of thought. We know that it is the expressed wish of Jesus that his disciples should be one, not two, much less that they should be divided into hundreds of organizations, and it does seem lamentable there should be such diversity, even if those organizations were at perfect oneness within themselves. Still, if there is an assurance of growth toward a divine oneness, as would seem to be the case, there is reason for hope and encouragement to work for so desirable a result, individually and collectively. Few, very few, if any, have attained that growth of perfection that would justify them in arrogating to themselves the right to dictate a standard for others. Nor is there any need of it, for what other foundation can any man lay than is laid in the life and testimony of Jesus the Christ, and its everlasting increase. I rejoice, as every true disciple will, in every manifestation of growth or endeavor toward this increase, wherever found. There is much to be done, and a blessing will come to every true-hearted worker. We find no antagonism in Christ, except against wrong in whatever form it may be found; and that antagonism will find its most fruitful labor in the warfare against the wrong in each one's own heart. Then, in union with those like minded a power for good will be developed that will be effectual, for they will love each other dearly, whatever their other ideas may be, of God in his Oneness, a Trinity, or as God the Father and Mother of all. There is no disunion in God. United with Christ we shall be one with God. Let us strive for this union first, then all will be well. Yours very truly, John Whiteley.
