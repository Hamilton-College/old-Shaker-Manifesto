AMEN! Enfield, N. H., July 3, '76. Elder F. W. Evans â€” Dear Friend: I feel strongly impressed to write you, though briefly. For nearly thirteen years I have been head miller for the Church Family of Shakers, peaceable and friendly with the Society ; have been, and am a subscriber to The Shaker. To my mind, it grows better and better. It feasts my heart and soul with spiritual truths, new and old. The present No. (July) contains truths, by your pen, for which 1 am so thankful as to cause this ex pression. I sincerely hope it may be the means of turning the tide of humanity from Priestcraft and Sectarianism, to true and genuine Christianity. Yours for the truth, Wm. G. Dennison
