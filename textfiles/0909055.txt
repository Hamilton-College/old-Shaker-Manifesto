Straw for Horses A small quantity of straw might be fed to working horses without injury. Straw fed only once a day to a working horse is an entirely different thing from straw morning, noon and night. And it is the same with fattening animals. I have known straw to be fed to those in small quantities with some advantage. With milch cows it is different, and they may be fed considerable quantity of straw and not affect the flow of milk. The most important thing, and something that is usually neglected, is to keep the appetite of the stock always good. This is easily accomplished by judiciously feeding straw and hay together. I think a greater quantity of hay and straw can be fed together than of either alone. It is a serious mistake to give cattle a surfeit of straw, and, indeed, of any thing else. Country Gentleman
