Enfield, N. H. July, 13, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½We thought the July Editorial, unusually fraught with valuable instruction, making clear to any thoughtful mind, that the Communistic principle, consequently the celibate life, (as the 'my and mine' element could not exist there,) must be the foundation of the true Christ life. These vital points are discussed too little, and we suggest that the basic, essential principles upon which our faith is founded be concisely formulated, and make a standard article in tjie Manifesto every month, as it i&amp; constantly passing into new hands. We have admired the Universalists' plan in thus doing and why should not our Church do likewise? It is true, people who cannot execute their plans, should be slow in suggesting, yet, we are always pleased when any one attacks a principle, and elucidates for the benefit of our young people, as well as strangers to our Order. Our Society enjoyed a pleasant and profitable open air meeting on July 4th. Remembering that Jesus very aptly said on an appropriate occasion, 'Render unto Ceasar the things that are Ceasar's,' we tried to render unto the Fathers and Mothers of this great free country, the honor due them, and it proved very interesting. The children gave extracts from History relative to the struggle for freedom, with music and singing interspersed, and they, no doubt, received a lasting impression, that liberty of conscience was bought with a price, and that through this Declaration of Independence, and separation of Church and State, it was made possible for the founders of the Shaker church to obey their convictions of duty. Supper was served under the trees, afu-r which we sang America and adjourned, with the firm conviction, that notwithstanding it costs something to arrange for such a gathering, in discipline and change of thought it pays.
