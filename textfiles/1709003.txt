AS JESUS TAUGHT. JOSEPH H. WOODS. Jesus for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God. When the council of the Jews had punished the disciples and commanded them that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, the Apostles departed, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer shame for his name. The doctrine which Jesus taught of regeneration, the virgin life, breaking up of earthly selfish ties, the forsaking of all that a man hath for Christ's sake, was treated with contempt by the Jews ; and such as confessed that Jesus was the Christ, they cast out of the Synagogue. Jesus said, 'Whosoever is ashamed of me and my words of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in . the glory of his Father with the holy angel?. ' Herein is the Christian's duty clearly exemplified. Let us more closely follow in the footsteps of him who so encouragingly testified to his followers 'Be of srood cheer for I have overcome the world,' that we may be worthy to sit down with him in the Kingdom of our God.
