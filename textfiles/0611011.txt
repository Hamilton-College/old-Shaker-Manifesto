Hyde Park, Mass., Sept. 19,1876 Mr. F. W. Evans—Dear sir • Two years ago, while in the cars, traveling in New Hampshire, I bought several small books of a Shakeress. They were explanatory of certain things, but I did not get the particular information I was seeking. When entirely convenient for you, I would be pleased to receive answer to the following questions: 1st. Did Ann Lee profess to be inspired by the Spirit of the Living God like the Prophets, whose writings are received in the bible? 2d. Did she profess to be the woman foretold in the twelfth chapter of Revelations ? 3d. Did she ever say she was authorized, or permitted, by the Lord, to claim the promise made in the beginning —that her seed should bruise the serpent's head? 4th. Do the writings of Ann Lee, or any other Shaker or Shakeress, resemble, in any respect, those of Joanna -Southcott, of England ? As you may be aware, Mrs. Southoott published many books, claiming the above. Yours truly, Geo. L. Richardson
