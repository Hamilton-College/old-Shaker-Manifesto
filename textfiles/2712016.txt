Enfield, N. H. Nov. 1897. I see by the Progressive Thinker, that there is a large band of Anti-Spiritualists banding together, to suppress all mediums from their labors, also to stop the spreading of Modern Spiritualism. I hope that every fraud medium will be shelved. To assert that the teachings of Spiritualism, contain no elevating influences, no truths that Jesus the Clnist taught and lived, is self-accused ignorance of understanding the lessons of life, of him who said, Let him who is without sin, cast the first sfone. Neither do I condemn thee, go and sin no more. Before I answered to the call of Shakerism, Spiritualism was the divine guide that kept me in early life from many of the courts wherein sin and folly slowly and surely sinks below the waves of moral degradation, thousands of young people. As I glance over the lai'ge volume of Shakerism, I see that Ann Lee like Jesus, received revelations from intelligences, not of themselves also wrought out in life, marvelous works of spirit power. Otlu-r &gt; have, and which all tlie Anti-Spirituaii s can not do. If those spirit manifestations were the result of human trickery, then let us learn the trade, to heal the sick, give impeachable messages of spirit return, preach pure, honest living to God, and fill the world with literature, art and music, radiant with divine wisdom and beauty, as is the strife of the true cultured Spiritualist. We are pleased to report a very pleasant visit with Eldress Elizabeth Haskell, Sister Aurelia Mace and Elder William Dumont of Sabbathday Lake, and Elder Henry Greene of Alfred, Me. George H. Baxter.
