To be logical it should be named December instead of October. To be Astronomical, its proper name according to number should be Uni-december; but it does seem the more unnatural statements are made, the better people in general are suited. Theological creeds and dogma's evidence this. For example; The Trinity, Vicarious atonements, heaven, hell, the fall of man, etc. Well, notwithstanding all the inconsistencies of names, October has been quite a favorable month. It has given us but one rainy day, so we have had an opportunity to prepare for the oncoming cold winter. It has also f urnisht us some pleasant associations. We have had gospel relation from Watervliet, N. Y., Harvard, Mass, and Union Village, Ohio. Oct. 14th our lawsuit terminated in our favor, for which we thank kind Providence. Oct. 31st we had an unusual meeting. We assembled in the Meeting House and listened to a lecture by Ernest H. Crosby of Brooklyn, N. Y. The subject; 'Single Tax' as advocated and promulgated by Henry George, lately deceased. The lecture was given by request. It occupied an entire hour, and was very interesting. This closes public meeting for this year, In the evening we had a meeting composed of the Church and North families. Ernest H. Crosby was present and was deeply affected by the spirit of the meeting which was truly inspirational. The Angel bands were with us. We felt their heavenly influence. Meeting occupied at least one and a half hours. Our visitor thought we did not do right in not spreading our doctrines through the aid of missionaries of our faith. Elder Joseph sent me a note stating that the Ministry would leave Enfield on Nov. 4th for Hancock. The probability is that befora-many months an electric R. R. will run from Greenbush through our place to Pittsfield, Mass. Work has commenced on it already. No death to report this month. It is a time of usual health in the Community. Calvin O. Heed. North Family. Nov. 1897. Among the list of visitors we had the pleasure of entertaining the past month is the name of E. H. Crosby, an earnest worker in the social as well as political movements of the day. Spending the Sabbath with us, he was invited to address the assembly on the 'Moral and Religious aspect of Single Tax.' As it was Sunday he took (as he usually does on such occasions) his text from the Bible. 'The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's, but the earth hath he given to the children of men.'�Psa. cxv., 16. While he does not believe that the Single Tax movement is the beginning and end of all things, yet he recognizes the fact that the taxes should be placed on the valuation of the land instead of the individual labor of improving the homestead, which necessarily raises the taxes, to the discouragement of the laboring classes. The land belonging to the Lord who has a right to monopolize it! They who own the land also own the people who live on it, proving his statement by quoting from Gen. xlvii., 23. 'Then Joseph said unto the people, behold have I bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh; lo, here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land,' showing forth the fact that the command of tlie landlord requires obedience or expulsion. In the course of his very interesting discouse he alluded to Elder F. W. Evans1 writing. 'The practical principle which Christ instructed Jesus, was brotherhood, to love his neighbor as himself, and not to appropriate to his own selfish uses to the exclusion of those on the same plane, either of the life elements�earth, air, fire or water.' Roger W. Montgomery a traveler and writer, also spent a week with us. With the many opportunities of giving as well as receiving we find our measure filled with the good things of God. Sarah J. Burger. Shakers, N. Y. Nov. 1897. As we read in the Nov. Manifesto the testimony of Aaron Wood, that dear Father in the New Creation, we thought of many of those blessed saints who have past on before and we askt; Are they still interested in us, their children, to help ns by their heavenly influence, giving strength to the weak and encouraging the faint-hearted? In the silence of our meditations the answer came; 'We are still with you and our influence is growing stronger as the years roll on.' When we read of what they suffered for the Truth's sake we are ashamed even to think of crying the burden of the Lord. As we see the portends of the coming upheavals in social and religious life we feel that strong souls are needed to meet those conditions with a courage befitting the times. The testimony of the new life is not dead neither doth it slumber, for like a mighty army with banners cometh those sainted souls from the summer land with love and power and their march is one of triumphant victory. In conjunction with our singing school Sunday afternoon, an effort is being made to establish a school for moral and intellectual development, on the lines of original thinking. A subject is announced at one meeting and essays are written or spoken upon that topic the succeeding Sunday; the object being to develop the latent powers of the young by providing that which is both interesting and instructive. Hope that success will crown the effort. Hamilton DeGraw. Harvard, Mass. Nov. 1897. Summer has ended, the harvest is past, but among all the daily duties we look within and find gratitude in our hearts for the measure of prosperity we enjoy. We haryested about a hundred tons of hay; raised about three hundred bushels of corn and a large crop of herbs. Potatoes not so good; were troubled with rot. Think we have enough for the winter. Apples a failure, especially winter fruit. We gathered five barrels tho very poor. This month came in with a.fine rain which was very much needed. Water was very low in the springs and ponds. Our milk keeps up to the mark having a good quantity for market. We have leased our Rural Home to Dr. Watkins for a Sanatarium, and he is now putting in the necessary appliances. Eldress Eliza Abbott is smart and carries her ninety years with grace. Health of Society good at present. While we are laboring for and enjoying the material things of this life, we do not forget the necessity of laboring for spiritual blessings which our souls need, as much as we need the perishable things of earth. Marcia M. Billiard. Narcoossee, Fla. Nov. 1897. The persistent, want to accomplish all things; nothing is impossible to it. It travels on the 'Get There' road and it always makes schedule time. It recognizes no failure. It is the conqueror of everything it undertakes, even to the making of a home in the wilds of Florida, where everything is ripe for testing a man's patience, from the tiny flea to the Palmetto and Pines which cover the land as far as the eye can see. [Not the fleas but the Pines.] An experience of three years has tested our integrity. Not only being 1300 miles from all our gospel friends and debarred from all our former associations, we have to meet the changes of climate, which told fearfully on some of us for the first two years. Patience and a clear conscience, have been the remedies for mental and physical sorrow. And they have workt wonders. Cold and rainy October has past, but it gave us a good opportunity to put in our fall crops. The lakes have risen 3 ft. 2 in. and that is one foot too high for cultivating the low muck lands. Our northern potatoes which were nearly all planted on these low lands, have rotted, but as the weather seems settled we shall replant them. In the past two weeks we have cleared another three acres of pine and oak land, for the spring crop of sweet potatoes. A good measure of health abides with us, and an occasional ride through the pine groves affords us some of nature's best remedies to keep off malarial troubles and may be other diseases. At this season of the year the pine groves of Florida are beautiful and fragrant. Thousands of flowers are in full bloom which nature has so bountifully given to this lone state. Andrew Barrett. Shaker Station, Conn. Nov. 1897. Of most importance has been the visit in their usual course, of our beloved Ministry. _ After imparting strength, comfort and counsel to us, and stimulating all by their stay, they are preparing to leave for other parts of the vineyard. Considering the season, our crops of hay, grain, tubers and fruits are fair. Sufficient for the usual needs of the family and some over. Our dairy stock is now occupying the new barn, with every prospect of passing the winter comfortably. The last week of Oct. was made very pleasant to us by the presence, for a too brief visit, of Sisters trom the South family of Watervliet. They introduced themselves to us at the opening of onr Sabbath meeting and won our hearts at once by a beautiful gift of song, rich in ministration of Angelic love and power. Our social unions with them dining the visit were also very enjoyable. We aie always pleased to meet gospel fririvls. Walter S. Sheoherl. Sabtaathday Lake, Me. Nov. 1897. Just now we are rejoicing over the safe arrival of our good Elder Wm. Dumont and Sister Aurelia Mace who have been visiting our kindred in the Granite State in company with Elder Henry Greene and Eldress Elizabeth Haskell of Alfred. Indeed we are glad to have them with us again. They brought many blessings oi love and encouragement to us, the greatest of these is Sister Ednah Fitts, who is kindly sent by the Society at East Canterbury as a teacher of music. We realize the sacrifice it must be to her and her people and also the great benefit to us. In her we find a true and faithful worker for Zion. One with whom we have pledged ourselves to be loyal. The young Brethren have been doing some ditching for the improvement of the farm, also ploughing and fencing, working faithfully during Elder William's absence, thus proving that their interests are truly centered in our consecrated home. 'In Union there is Strength.' This motto is true for when we are all at home together, even tho our numbers are small, we feel strong, and naught shall ever sever the bond of love which unites us. Br. Frank Stanton from Harvard is with us. We trust he will receive much good from his visit here, and may he return to his home and kind friends, renewed and encouraged to continue the work which he has so bravely commenced. We extend a loving greeting to all our gospel relation. Ada S. Cummings. West Pittsfield, Mass. Nov. 1897. The lovely autumn days have past. Days of beauty ever new; of fresh glowing tints on trees and shrubs; of magnificent sunsets, when the mellow tints of day meeting the darkening shades of night uniting in rich harmony flood the earth with glory. And the clear nights! As we look at the cloudless sky, perforated with its numberless shining stars, we think how aptly Longfellow describes it;� 'Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven, Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget- me-nots of the angels.' Certainly we can not doubt the loving care of a Father who thus proves his remembrance of us. In the early history of our Society there leaned upon the side of the mountain, rising at the west of our valley, a barn, famous for its spacious apartments. In these rooms Eld. James Whittaker often spoke to large audiences the simple and powerful words of life. As years past on, like other barns, less famous, it became useless and was destroyed, but the beams marking the pulpit of the noted preacher were preserved and placed in the new barn which was built upon the site of the old one. For nearly fifty years it has stood like a fort, its walls painted by sun and rain in Nature's water colors, its doors and windows smiling a welcome alike to summer tramp or wealthy traveller seeking a shelter from the storm. On the 27th ult. flames were&gt;een ascending from its roof and encircling its sides. And so it fell, leaving a pleasant memory and a good insurance. Some forest fires have also visited our mountains. One burned about eight acres making quite a desert in the thick wooded hills. Sr. Catherine Allen of North family, Mt. Lebanon is sharing our home for a few days, and we are grateful for the opportunity thus given of enjoying the presence of one so earnest and true. Thus life passes! We can not call the daily work a duty, if we partake freely of the spiritual life which Jesus said should be like a fountain of water, overflowing because its waters are constantly supplied from unfailing springs, for we shall transform these duties into glad privileges. Fidelia JSstabrook. Union Village, O, Nov. 1897. After a long and painful drouth, which dried up our pastures and threatened to destroy all our wheat and barley prospects on the 1st of Nov. it began to rain moderately and about three inches of water have fallen, very much to our advantage � and comfort. On the 25th of Nov. we shall be able to render due thanks to our Heavenly Father for his mercy and kindness in this as in all other matters in which he has kindly noticed us during the present year. The greatest by far, of all these blessings, is the Gospel which enables us to walk in innocence and purity, as good Elder Matthew used to phrase it. I suppose that none are so unfortunate and unhappy, as those who having been blest with this unspeakable treasure have turned once more to the beggarly elements of the world. Let us hope that through this crucible of misery, they may eventually be restored to a better estate. Well�we are trying to carry the Institution along as nearly according to the principles of godliness as the conditions will allow, giving no license to anything we think would compromise these principles. Through joy or sorrow, what better can we do? We are repairing some, burning hedgebrush and trimming trees, and the young people have been on two or three expeditions into the woods for nuts. It is raining again this morning and our fall pastures will do nicely and our wheat and barley 'take root downward and bear truit upward,' with the blessing of the good Father and Mother of all upon it. So we are under heavy obligations to our Heavenly Parents, for so much blessing and let us not forget that he that is unthankful, is unholy. We have had no cholera among our stock so far this season, and it is all in fine condition. What a heavenly thing it is to forgive. No wonder our Savior insisted on it so strongly. When we forgive an injury it can give us no more pain, and will give the offending party a great deal of pleasure, besides exciting him to a radical reformation. It is such a blessed thing to forgive that I never need any apology for injuries;�I can always forgive without any such apology so far as I am concerned. 'Mercy is seasonable in times of affliction, as showers of rain in times of drouth.' What an invaluable blessing it is to be improving every moment of life in getting more and more imbued with charity and purity. I never felt so clear of the lower proclivities of our common nature in my life as now, still I must progress and persevere forever. If I should cease to grow my existence would become an unbearable stagnation and monotony. Mother Ann said,�'If I could, I would make all the world full of peace and happiness.' I feel just so myself. May The Manifesto float the glad tidings of Salvation to a rudimental and a needy world. Oliver C. Hampton. Enfield, N. H. Nov. 1897. I see by the Progressive Thinker, that there is a large band of Anti-Spiritualists banding together, to suppress all mediums from their labors, also to stop the spreading of Modern Spiritualism. I hope that every fraud medium will be shelved. To assert that the teachings of Spiritualism, contain no elevating influences, no truths that Jesus the Clnist taught and lived, is self-accused ignorance of understanding the lessons of life, of him who said, Let him who is without sin, cast the first sfone. Neither do I condemn thee, go and sin no more. Before I answered to the call of Shakerism, Spiritualism was the divine guide that kept me in early life from many of the courts wherein sin and folly slowly and surely sinks below the waves of moral degradation, thousands of young people. As I glance over the lai'ge volume of Shakerism, I see that Ann Lee like Jesus, received revelations from intelligences, not of themselves also wrought out in life, marvelous works of spirit power. Otlu-r &gt; have, and which all tlie Anti-Spirituaii s can not do. If those spirit manifestations were the result of human trickery, then let us learn the trade, to heal the sick, give impeachable messages of spirit return, preach pure, honest living to God, and fill the world with literature, art and music, radiant with divine wisdom and beauty, as is the strife of the true cultured Spiritualist. We are pleased to report a very pleasant visit with Eldress Elizabeth Haskell, Sister Aurelia Mace and Elder William Dumont of Sabbathday Lake, and Elder Henry Greene of Alfred, Me. George H. Baxter.
