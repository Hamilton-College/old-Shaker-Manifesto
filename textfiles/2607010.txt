Enfield, N. H. June, 1896. Not in the recollection of the oldest members of our Society has there been such a confluence of unwelcome life, as was manifest in the unfolding foliage of our fruit trees and shrubbery this spring. Woven among the leaves and blossoms was the vail webbing of the insect commonly called the apple-worm. Appearances indicated they had come to stay, but some of us thought otherwise. Accordingly, with poles, tar and kerosene oil, fourteen Sisters and four Brethren invaded their chosen homes making sad havoc, not only of their nests, but of themselves also. How they regarded our intrusion will never be known: possibly they look upon us in the same light that the poor Armenians do the cruel Turks. We were able to combine much pleasure with our disagreeable business, that of partaking of our dinner and supper at the sugar-camp, where two hundred and forty-two gallons of syrup was made the past season. The loftiness of our position which gave us an excellent opportunity to view the picturesque landscape about us, which, inspires the mind with a love for the Infinite goodness of our Maker and when incorporated into the characters of human beings, broadens and strengthens the intellectual faculties, and transmutes all low instincts into spiritual forces that deify life, and cause the soul to worship only at the shrine of its ideal Spirit of truth and holiness. George H. Baxter.
