TO AN EARLY SONG SPARROW. A. J. Oalver. O merry little songster, on the wing, Where is thy hiding-place through winter drear, That with the first slight token of the spring, Thou art so near. Thou didst not wait till wintry hours were spent, And skies were always to be blight and clear; But with the first warm sunbeam to us lent, We find thee here. We find thee here to tell us though the snow, The ice, the storms of winter still may come, That thou hast learned to catch each spring-tide To fill with song. O merry little birdie, it is mine, To learn a lesson from thy song to-day, To wait not for the sun to always shine, But catch each ray. To wait not for some great, some noble deed, To prove how deep our fount of Christian love, But e'en a smile, a kindly ward in need, Its depths may prove. And still another thought comes to my mind, As I respond to thy soul-cheering lay, A corresponding warmth we always find, To every ray. Then let me pass the kindly action on, And cheer another as thou cheerest me, Until the influence of thy little song, Bids sorrow flee. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
