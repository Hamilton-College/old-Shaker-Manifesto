South Union, Ky. Mar. 1892. Elder Henry:We write you of the death of our good Br. John. We are sorry that he has been taken from us. Weather here is extremely inclement. The spring birds have been with us, but now have all left and we cannot see where they have gone. We are pleased with the Manifesto land hold it as the true Standard Bearer of our religious faith.
