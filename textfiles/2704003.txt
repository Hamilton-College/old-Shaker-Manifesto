''Dreadful things slip off one's tongue when angry, things that spring up at the moment and come out hot, and which one afterward repents of having said-' The only way to curb this unruly member is to use it in slaying the life of nature; this tames it most effectually. Let us take heed that we sin not with our tongue. Anna White.
