My Dear Sister Ida:--On my return from Mt. Morris... Groveland, N. Y. Mar. 1888. My Dear Sister Ida :ï¿½On my return from Mt. Morris last evening I found a letter from you. Of course the writing was purely voluntary on your part, and no urging was given by Sister Asenath, but she has sanctified it by a few words of her own and that makes it so much better. Happy will you be if a good Sister like Asenath, can always, in the future, endorse all your correspondence whether to persons in or out of our Society. It brings such a comfortable feeling to know that we are in the light. It must make one feel so wretched to have any sly or underhanded conduct, and particularly any written correspondence that is concealed from the Elders. I do not believe you or I could feel very happy in this way and wre will not try it. I would have all my dear, young Sisters to be the soul-of honor, and to live su strictly and so honorable with each other that no shame will blight sweet memories of the past. The rules of our Society forbid all partial or private correspondence, and if we violate this rule we act a lie and are untrue to our profession. Do you know why I am glad to have you write to me? I will tell you one reason. I take it for granted that you feel very resolute in your faith, and are determined to become a 'Rock Maple Shaker ' and the Rock Maple is a synonym of solidity and sweetness you know. This is so well understood that we need not say much about it, and I only allude to it that you may see what confidence I have in you. These older Sisters ask ' How is' the little girl whom you took home with you some years since ?' I reply, she is no longer a little girl, she has become very womanly, she loves home, she loves her friends, and still better, she loves the pure life of Believers. Her testimony in meeting is earnest and heartfelt, and we are comforted in the thought that she will prove a dependence and a blessing. Now if I have given too good an opinion of you, you must either write to these people and correct my statements, or you must deserve this opinion by future endeavor. I can only reply to them from my own impressions. I know, every body knows who knows any thing about it, that you have ' chosen that good part that will never fade away,' and any other choice will lead to bitter disappointment. The path to Heaven is not altogether a thornless one, but it leads to Heaven and that is enough. But how about the thftrns? You have friends who pray for and sympathize with you in all your troubles, yet they realize that you must grow strong by experience, even as the child learns to walk by learning to depend on its own strength. Thank you for writing. Love to all the good and those who wish to be good. Ever your friend and Brother, N. A. Briggs.
