Correspondence. Eld. F. W. Evans, Dear Sir:--In coversation this evening... Smith &amp; McNeil's Hotel, New York, March, 22, 1888. Eld. F. W. Evans, Dear Sir :�In conversation this evening with a gentleman who seemed to know much of your Socie'y, I was pleased, beyond my ability of expressing my admiration of its aims and qualities. It is just such an organization as it would be my desire that the whole world might become, of its knowledge and belief. I have a great longing to know more of its aims. If you have books or pamphlets on bye-laws and constitution, that set forth your teachings, please send me such as you have, that I may know who and what you are, and ' how it is that such a Society can exist and be so little known of. I thought I had heard of almost every kind of belief and existence of societies ; but I never heard of yours till to-day. Hoping an early answer, and success to your noble undertaking� I am, with great respect, E. M. Trowbridge. E. M. Trowbridge, Respected, unknown, friend:-- Your note of 22nd. inst. at hand... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Mar. 24, 1888. E. M. Trowbridge, Respected, unknown, friend :� Your note of 22nd. inst. at hand. You are surprised that, with your knowledge of men and things, the order of Shakers, consisting of some seventeen Societies, was to you unknown until a day or two ago. It is because the Order is ' not of the world.' It is not numbered with the sects, but dwells alone, like Israel of old. It is the 'kingdom of heaven,' for which Christians have been constantly praying for the last 1800 years. It has come ; but not as the orthodox teachprs arranged it. The infidels, like Jefferson, Paine and Washington, came nearer to the truth, in constructing a government securing 'to the greatest number the greatest good,' than did Luther, Calvin, or the popes. The son, who said, '1 will not do your will;' but went, and�unwittingly�did do it, was accepted and blessed. While the son, who said, 'Certainly, father, I will do your will;' and then proceeded, in Christ's name, to establish Bible and Tract and Missionary Societies, and to encompass sea and land to carry a gospel to aboriginal peoples�as in the Congo, introducing amongst them rum and tobacco, and the syphilitic diseases, making those simple souls more the children of hell than they were before, and ten times worse than are they themselves�has utterly failed to do God's will. To them, in tones of thunder, comes the voice, from the Christ heavens, 'Depart from me, ye workers of human misery ; I know you not. While directing the attention of your duped, fanatical followers to an imaginary heaven, ye take possession, by means of your unjust laws, of the land upon which they stand, from which they derive their food�their 'daily bread'� anr! thus constitute them your slaves� either chattel or wages slaves. Verily, I know ye not.' Dear friend, the above may be too 'strong meat;' or if it be that you have been taught of God�by his Spirit, and draw towards the kingdom�as those had been to whom, when Jesus saw them, he simply said, 'Follow me,' and they left their nets to become disciples ; if, having read what I sent you, you still are desirous to know more of a people who turn the world upside down in reality, practically�can you not visit us? If so, come to New Lebanon depot, one mile from the North Family. Love to you. F. W. Evans. Ed. of Manifesto:--We read in Jno. iii., 3... Pleasant Hill, Ky. Apr. 1888. Ed. of Manifesto :�We read in Jno. ill-, 3, 'Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.' How are we to be born again? Shall we know when we are born again ? Jesus explained the new birth to Nicodemus, but he did not understand it. Those only can understand, who have experienced it. 'The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou nearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell wThence it cometh, and whither it goeth ; so is every one that is born of the spirit. Jno. iii., 8. When the new and living seed of the Son of Man, the word of God, is received into the heart, it strikes root and grows, day and night, and we know not wherefrom it comes or where it goes. We see, however, that it makes a great change in our lives, and we feel the spirit of it in the heart. Our love to God grows stronger and stronger and is manifested in our thoughts and acts, with the naturalness that children love their parents. True love to God comes by the new birth. It increases as the new man grows, and makes us the children of our Heavenly Father and Mother. In this love it will be our comfort and our joy to do those things that olease God, and manifest a spirit of kindness and good-will to all our gospel relation. In this we shall remember the poor and needy who may come to us for aid and in God's name never turn them harshly from our door. God's blessing is better than covetousness, and indeed, it is better to give than to receive. Your Brother Lars Erickson. My Dear Sister Ida:--On my return from Mt. Morris... Groveland, N. Y. Mar. 1888. My Dear Sister Ida :�On my return from Mt. Morris last evening I found a letter from you. Of course the writing was purely voluntary on your part, and no urging was given by Sister Asenath, but she has sanctified it by a few words of her own and that makes it so much better. Happy will you be if a good Sister like Asenath, can always, in the future, endorse all your correspondence whether to persons in or out of our Society. It brings such a comfortable feeling to know that we are in the light. It must make one feel so wretched to have any sly or underhanded conduct, and particularly any written correspondence that is concealed from the Elders. I do not believe you or I could feel very happy in this way and wre will not try it. I would have all my dear, young Sisters to be the soul-of honor, and to live su strictly and so honorable with each other that no shame will blight sweet memories of the past. The rules of our Society forbid all partial or private correspondence, and if we violate this rule we act a lie and are untrue to our profession. Do you know why I am glad to have you write to me? I will tell you one reason. I take it for granted that you feel very resolute in your faith, and are determined to become a 'Rock Maple Shaker ' and the Rock Maple is a synonym of solidity and sweetness you know. This is so well understood that we need not say much about it, and I only allude to it that you may see what confidence I have in you. These older Sisters ask ' How is' the little girl whom you took home with you some years since ?' I reply, she is no longer a little girl, she has become very womanly, she loves home, she loves her friends, and still better, she loves the pure life of Believers. Her testimony in meeting is earnest and heartfelt, and we are comforted in the thought that she will prove a dependence and a blessing. Now if I have given too good an opinion of you, you must either write to these people and correct my statements, or you must deserve this opinion by future endeavor. I can only reply to them from my own impressions. I know, every body knows who knows any thing about it, that you have ' chosen that good part that will never fade away,' and any other choice will lead to bitter disappointment. The path to Heaven is not altogether a thornless one, but it leads to Heaven and that is enough. But how about the thftrns? You have friends who pray for and sympathize with you in all your troubles, yet they realize that you must grow strong by experience, even as the child learns to walk by learning to depend on its own strength. Thank you for writing. Love to all the good and those who wish to be good. Ever your friend and Brother, N. A. Briggs.
