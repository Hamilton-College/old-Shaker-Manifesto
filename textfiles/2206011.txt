INQUIRY. No. 4. What is the difierence between the Unitarians and the Shakers ? The same may be said in reference to this question as was said concerning the Quakers, (See No 3. in Apr. 1892,) with these exceptions; the doctrine of non-resistance and the Trintarian mystery. The Unitarians, like their evangelical brethren, teach their disciples to fight, and during a war, to kill both their friends and enemies, although in violation of the sixth commandment, and even pray to their war God to give them victory over brethren belonging to their own church.
