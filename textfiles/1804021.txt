SPIRITUALITY. By Archdeacon Farrar. [Contributedby Wm. L.Lincoln, of North Union, O.] ' But put ye on the Lord, Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.' Rom. xiii., 14. The Eastern mind not only delighted in metaphors, but found them indispensable. The Hebrew language for instance, is one continual picture; every fact and every emotion is rendered visible by an image. Had it not been for the pictures, the similes, and the parables pi Holy Writ, we should have had a far less vivid impression than we now have of the facts of spiritual lite. Now there is one central fact of the spiritual life which the Apostles try to impress upon us again and again. It is the necessity of nearness to Christ, of union with Christ, as the most essential element of true life. Now, this truth that Christ is life, and that apart from Christ is no life, is set forth by our Lord and his apostles in many different ways, and most often by vivid metaphors. Sometimes Christ is represented as the true vine, and the members of his church as the branches of that vine. Sometimes the Church is pictured as one living body, and all its children as members belonging to that one body, which can have no feeling and no life apart from Christ, who is the head. Of all the Apostles, no one realized these truths more fully than St. Paul. He, without any metaphor, speaks of himself and of all the saints of God as being 'in Christ. ' When he spake of faith in its highest sense, he did not mean a passive assent, a blind orthodoxy, an unreasoning belief, a torpid assuranc. , the feminine aspect of mind which dares not inquire; he was speaking of something very different�namely, the mystic communion of the believer with his Lord; he meant the being lost in Christ, the being found in Christ; he meant the death of self the life hid with Christ in God, which is the human and the animal life no longer, but is the oneness of man's spirit with Christ's spirit. This is what he means by such a sentence as 'It is now no more I that live, but Christ that liveth in me,' and such thoughts reach their culminating intensity of expression when he says 'For me to live is Christ.' All that he regards as real in his own life is the transforming energy, the permeating glow, of that spirit of Christ which pervades and overfloods his heart and leads him with no will but the will of his Lord. Such, then, is the general significance of the metaphor; but what is the meaning to us, its practical meaning. Whether when we know the meaning, we choose to make it for us a reality�that, alas! is a very different question. The first part of the meaning, then, of the metaphor, 'Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, ' is try to be like Christ, walk in the footsteps of Christ, imitate the character of Christ, iearn to love what you know that Christ loved, and learn to hate what you know that Christ hated. The very next clause helps quite clearly to explain this part of the meaning, by giving us its opposite. ' Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof. ' The one is the opposite of the other. Using the same metaphor, putting on the robe, the apostles often say, 'Put off as the beloved and the elect of God, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communications out of your mouth; lay aside every whit, and the close fitting sin, put on the whole armor of righteousness, put on the merciful heart, kindness, meekness, long suffering; tie humility about you as a robe with a knotted girdle ; put off the old character, put on the new creature '�they are the metaphorical ways of saying ' Be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind; ' they mean that in Christ Jesus no outward rite or ceremony or profession avails anything to new creation, they mean walk in newness of life; they mean walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. If we are living in flagrant violation of our consciences we cannot feel the renovating glow of Christ's awakening spirit and transforming power; there must be some answer on the part of our souls to the call of God; we must break through the thick conventionalities of our worldliness and of our religion, and when we begin to make the Sun of Eighteousness the centre of our desires, and not this low earth; when we do from the heart desire to be holy, pure and good, then none but Christ can help us. The Church is a glorious thing; but it will not do to trust the Church or Church ordinances between us and Christ; if we do we shall only deceive ourselves by the traditions of men. The Bible is a blessed gift; but it will not do to trust the Bible between us and Christ, for without his present spirit, and without the direct contact with his personality, the Bible will be for us but a dead book. The true Bible is that which Christ writes on the freshened table of our hearts. Suoh then, my friends, is the meaning, in part at least, of this Divine message to us, 'Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.' It means, first vf all, break with your past self and that you will be able to do this; it means to come to Christ, that you may have the strength you need, and by prayer to Him and earnestly seeking Him, be healed, be raised, be quickened, be transformed, be made a new creature, be born again. And as it means this hope for the future and this strength in the present, so also it means forgiveness for the past; it means 'Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
