Good manners... [Contributed by E. Hart.] Good manners are among the greatest charms a person can possess, and everybody should cultivate them, especially young people. They are something money cannot purchase, for there is only one way of obtaining them, and that is by habitual practice. We know a good mother who used to say : 'Always use good manners at home, and then when you go among strangers you need never be alarmed, for it will be perfectly natural to be polite and respectful. ' This is true, and we have always thought that the best and easiest way to do anything right was to get into the habit of doing it right. Hardly anything is of more consequence than good manners and politeness in a boy or girl. They render those who possess them favorites with their relations or friends, and prepossess strangers towards them. Politeness costs nothing, and at the same time is of the greatest value. Selected.
