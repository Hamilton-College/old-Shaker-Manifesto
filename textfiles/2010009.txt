THE RAT HOLE. [Translated from the French by Louis Basting.] At the corner of an ancient mansion built in a style half gothic and half Roman, a large breviary�the daily prayer-book of the Roman Catholic Church�richly adorned with illuminations, may be observed. It is protected from the rain by a little pent-house, and from thieves by an iron grating, which however permits the turning of the leaves. By the side of the book is a narrow arched skylight, cross'ed by two iron bars, which is the only opening that permits the entrance of a little light and air into a small cell located within the wall of the building. The quietness which reigns there is the more profound and the silence the more gloomy since the noise and the crowd of one of the most popular squares of Paris surrounds it on every side. This cell had been famous for centuries. Madame Roland, who mourned deeply the loss of her father who had perished in the crusades, had caused it to be excavated in the wall of her own mansion, in order to confine herself within it forever, retaining nothing of all her possessions but this poor lodging, whose door was walled up and whose skylight was open to winter and summer alike, giving everything else to the poor and to God. The desolate woman awaited death in this anticipated tomb for twenty years, praying night and day for her father's soul, sleeping in ashes, having not even a stone for a pillow, clad in a black sack, living only upon the bread and water which the pity of some passer-by deposited upon the little shelf in front of the opening; thus receiving charity after having been charitable herself. At her death, when about to pass into the other and final sepulchre, she bequeathed her cell in perpetuity to such afflicted women as had great cause to pray much for others or for themselves, and who choose to be buried alive on account of great grief or great penitence The poor of her time buried her with tears and benedictions; but to their great regret the pious daughter failed of canonization on account of lack of influential friends. Those among them who were somewhat bold in their opinions expressed the conviction that that matter would be more easily accomplished in paradise than at Rome ; but the greater part were content to hold Madame Roland's memory sacred and to venerate the tattered remains of her garment as relics. The city on its part, according to the intention of the lady, provided and maintained a public breviary by the side of the cell, not so much for the purpose of inciting to prayer as to draw attention to the poor inmates who had become heirs to Madame Roland's cell, and to prevent their dying from hunger and neglect. This sort of tomb was not at all rare in the middle ages. One met them in the most frequented streets, in the very middle of the noisiest markets, under the feet of the horses and under the wheels of the carriages, a cave, a pit, a walled-up hovel, with iron gratings, where a human being prayed night and day, voluntarily devoted to some eternal lamentation, to some great expiation. And all the reflections which so strange a spectacle awakens in us to-day; that horrible cell, a sort of an abode between a dwelling and a grave, between a city and a cemetery ; this living cut off' from human companionship, being regarded outside of it, numbered among the dead; that lamp consuming its last drop of oil in the shadow ; those remains of life flickering in a ditch ; that sigh, that voice, that prayer eternal in a box of stone; that face forever turned towards the other world; that eye already illumined by another sun ; that ear pilloAved upon the wall of the grave; that soul prisoner in that body, that body prisoner in that dungeon, and under that double prison of flesh and granite, the moaning of that soul in pain : nothing of all that was perceived by the crowd. The piety of those times was not very rational nor very delicate and did not regard an net of religion from so many points of view. It; accepted the fact unquestioning, honored and venerated the sacrifice, but did not attern t to analyze the sufferings and commiserated them but indifferently. It carried occasionally some pittance of food to the miserable penitent, looked into the hole to see if he were still alive, ignorant of his name. hardly knowing how many years had passed since he commenced to die, and the stranger who inquired of the neighbors regar ing the living skeleton he saw in the cave was simply answered : ''It is the recluae.' It was on a winter's day of the year 1482 when some charitable women who had remembered the poor inmate of the cell situated on the Place de Greve approached it with some food at d drink. The populace had named the poor woman living there La, Sachette on account of the sack she wore, and they called her abode le trou aux rats� the rat hole : probably a very realistic appellation. It was a sorrowful sight that presented itself to the women aa they peered through the grated opening into the interior. Upon the bare stone floor of the narrow cell crouched the figure of a woman. Her chin rested upon her knees, her arms were folded before her. Clothed in a brown sack which covered the entire form in long folds, the long fjray hair falling even to the feet, it was a strange spectacle to see. It was like a spectre one see-, in a dream, pale, immovable, sinister. Hardly could one dit-eern in the dark twilight the severe lines of a pale emaciated countenance; hardly could one perceive a bare foot upon the frozen, rigid floor of stone. The little one could see of the human form clothed in that robe of mourning, made one shudder. That figure crouched upon the flags appeared to have neither movement, thougnt nor breath. Under that thin robe of linen, in January, lying upon that bare floor of granite, without fire, in the shadow of the dungeon, where the sunlight never entered, she did not appear to suffer, nor even to feel. One could have said that she was stone with the dun- geon, ice with the winter. The han ds fold ed, the eyes fixed. At the first glance one took it to be a spectre, at the second for a statue. But from time to time those blue lips half opened for a sigh, and from those mournful eyes went forth a look ineffable, profound, lugubrious, imperturbable. Such was the creature inhabiting le trou avx rais. When the spectators at the window perceived this immovable attitude they said to each other in low whispers, 'Let us not trouble her; she is in her ecstacy; she is praying.' But when they finally decided to make their presence known, they clled many times: 'Sister! Sister!' before the slightest motion gave evidence that death indeed had not overtaken the miserable woman. Then a long shivering fit seemed to run through her body from head to foot, her teeth rattled, she took her feet in her hands and said: 'Oh, they're terrible cold!' 'Poor woman! do you wish a little fire?' She shook her head. 'Well, then take this flask of spiced wine; it will give you some warmth.' Again she shook her head and said, 'Water!' 'No, Sister! that is no drink for you in January: take this wine and eat this cake we have bought for you.' She pushed back the proffered cake and said: 'Black bread!' Then one took off her warm woolen cloak and endeavored to have her accept it, but met with the same refusal. At last she said : 'Give me some water : I have had none for two days, the world has forgotten me, and why should it not?' [These acts of severe and unreasonable self-mortification, whether practiced by Christians or Hindoos, have their origin in the religious instinct which seems to be more or less common to all mankind. It is the doctrine of works pushed to the extreme. The reaction against that system culminated in Calvin's dictum : 'Only believe!' Both systems, carried to the radical ultimate, are absurdly unreasonable. If faith without good works is dead, then are works that of themselves are not good, also dead, though they are done in the name of faith. A simple, peaceful life of virtue and usefulness is the best evidence of repentauce, the only atonement sanctioned by revealed religion and by common sense ; it is the highest act of human devotion possible. To live that life requires more of self-denial than La Sachette was ever called upon to practice.]
