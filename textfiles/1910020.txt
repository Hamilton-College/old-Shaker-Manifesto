Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Aug. 18. Beloved Elder Henry :�Who would care for any notes about our home? Well, we have not, in my remembrance, had such a season as the past. For eight consecutive days we could do nothing in the hay field, and in July we had rain for fifteen days. Not a single Sabbath have we staid at home from public meeting on account of rain. [Good ! such a record as that is worthy a place in the Manifesto. Attend the public Service, and if it rains, dress accordingly. Ed.] Now, if we take fifteen rainy days and four Sabbaths out of a month, we have only twelve days left. This makes the farmers look rather blue. To see much of the labor of the season, with the fertilizers and manures that were spent on the potato crop,� so great a loss, to say the least, is quite discouraging. Some of our sheep have been destroyed by the dogs, and all in all it makes a mournful story. In the near future all this sadness may be turned to sunshine, and our notes to joy. D O. Aug. 27. Sister Amelia has a night blooming Cereus, and at 9-30 P M., she cut off a flower that was nine inches in diameter. By placing it on the ice, it kept fresh all the next day and could be placed on the table at meal time. The plant has produced three flowers this season. On Sabbath August 18th. Elder Calvin G. Reed and brothers Washington Jones and Dr. Carl, with several Sisters went to Lebanon Springs to attend a camp meeting. The place of the meeting is two miles from the Shaker Village. [We trust they imparted and received much good, and were persuaded to go the second time. Ed.]
