South Union, Ky. July 21, 1897. Beloved Bkotheb;ï¿½It has been some time since we heard anything through The Manifesto about South Union. We have past through a very heated and dry season, the thermometer ranging from 100 to 105 degrees. From the first of May to the 10th of July we had but very little rain and the land was intensely dry. Within the last ten days we have received about one inch, with a prospect of more. As it is we have great reason to be thankful. We have been bountifully blest in a good wheat crop, and the Society has thresht some 5700 bushels. This we now have on hand waiting for a satisfactory sale. The prospect for a fair corn crop is good, but the hay harvest is quite limited. Our home in the valley will afford us but few peaches, but there will be a better crop on more elevated land. Apples will also be scarce. Of blackberries we shall have an abundance and then best of all, our Society is not in debt. In the East family we have canned not less than fifty gallons of blackberries, while the other families may have done as much or even more. John W. Perryman
