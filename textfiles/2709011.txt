Grass crops have been very abundant, but the month has been so very wet we have barely commenct harvesting the crop. 16 rainy days giving us 15 inches of water, averaging about half an inch a clay the entire month. One continuous rain gave us *l% in. in twenty-four hours causing the water to overflow our dams, and making the valley below a lake from two to four feet deep. It has been such a month that we desire never to see another so destructive and so wide spread. It has spread E. W. N'. S. destroying millions of property and multitudes of lives. One woman with her two children and house were taken by a tornado, carried to the center of the Hudson Hirer and sunk and they were drowned. There might be a volume written if the entire sr.d catastrophies were chronicled that have occurred during July 1897. With all the prevailing destruction, we are very much blest. At present we have plenty to eat and to drink. We are well clothed and housed from the storms. We have purchased cement and paint to preserve the roofs of the Meeting House, Office, Infirmary and Laundry, so they will not leak, if paint, cement and solder will prevent it. A half mile more of the State Eoad between us and Hancock is being constructed. This will prove an additional blessing to travelers. We have gathered from our garden thirty-three bushels of strawberries and nine bushels of raspberries and have more of the last named to gather, then will come the blackberries. The early apples are fit for use. Cherries have been abundant. Our fruit crop is good, and abundant. The hot weather is injuring potatoes. Sister Amelia Calver has become an apiarist. She has at present eight swarms. Yesterday she was taking up box honey. In doing so she became a veiled Nun. Elder Timothy Kayson is a Shaker Trustee. He takes Br. Benjamin Gates place who has resigned. Thursday July 22nd the MinistrMount Lebanon, and are now at Colonie. They left here in usual health. At present it is healthy among us. No one is in- disposed to my knowledge. Calvin G. Reed. Shakers, N. Y. August, 1897. The past month gave us a taste of tropical weather. One hundred in the shade! We were careful not to make any uncomplimentary remarks about 'Old Probabilities' for we might regret it when the blizzards of December were blowing; but we thought of the pleasure of Professor Andree's trip in an air-ship to the North pole or of Dr. Nansen's arctic explorations. But we will try and be philosophical and make the best of it whatever the variations of the temperature. Those grand and inspiring words of Gladstone in the Manifesto were like a benediction rebuking the narrow spirit of sectarianism that would contract the sphere of human thought making it less able to comprehend the universality of truth which is the true goal toward which life is advancing. We admire the character of the man and have his picture framed in oak guarding the doorway of our domicile. We think our little Manifesto is doing even better than the son of Erin's isle who said he had 'started with nothing and had held his own.' May blessings be with those who have the burden of its publication, and if interest could be quickened to the extent that would make it a semimonthly, its work in the missionary field would be strengthened. Hamilton DeGraw. Shaker Station, Conn. North Family. August, 1897. It is needless to say that we are having more cloudy than sunshiny weather, for this seems to be the general complaint. Farm work is much delayed by almost constant rain. The Sisters have been, several times, to the distant hills, some two or three miles away, for huckleberries, but success did not crown their labors as the berries are quite scarce. Two of our Sisters, Angeline Brown and Florence Staples in company with Eldress Sophia Copley of the Church family are about to return from the sea-shore after an absence of sixteen days. They have been selling Shaker bonnets, fancy goods, confectionery etc., with considerable success. Since our tarry in Enfield we have had occasion to attend one funeral,�that of Clarissa Lyman. She was an aged Sister of eighty-three years. Her acquaintances all declare her to have been a good, true mother. Elder George Clarke is busily engaged in the laundry, making everything as convenient as possible. We have alreadj a large engine and boiler combined, an improved mill, and at the end of another week our new wringer will be completed. We bless the labor of consecrated souls and great will be their reward. Edith E. Shu felt. [As the following letter was received too late for insertion in the August Manifesto, we have thought best to hold it for the Sept. number. It contains some items that may prove profitable reading for many months to come. Ed.] South Union, Ky. July 21, 1897. Beloved Bkotheb;�It has been some time since we heard anything through The Manifesto about South Union. We have past through a very heated and dry season, the thermometer ranging from 100 to 105 degrees. From the first of May to the 10th of July we had but very little rain and the land was intensely dry. Within the last ten days we have received about one inch, with a prospect of more. As it is we have great reason to be thankful. We have been bountifully blest in a good wheat crop, and the Society has thresht some 5700 bushels. This we now have on hand waiting for a satisfactory sale. The prospect for a fair corn crop is good, but the hay harvest is quite limited. Our home in the valley will afford us but few peaches, but there will be a better crop on more elevated land. Apples will also be scarce. Of blackberries we shall have an abundance and then best of all, our Society is not in debt. In the East family we have canned not less than fifty gallons of blackberries, while the other families may have done as much or even more. John W. Perryman
