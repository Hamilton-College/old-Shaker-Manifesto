PRENTISSIANA THEOLOGY BOILED DOWN. ' Let us make man' of our birthright inheritance the germ of the Eternal Duad ; let us make man, male and female, in the likeness of God. The germ, our highest, holiest aspiration, must germinate and be diligently nurtured by holding the lower law influences in subordination to the germ. Our knowledge of God and of all thereunto appertaining, is and will be in proportion to the growth of the germ. RELIGION VS. SCIENCE. To primordial man, religion and science are antipodes. As, by slow and toilsome processes, humanity revolves, religion and science meet and embrace each other. Bigot and infidel, with expanded views of God and humanity — of God in humanity— meet, and like kindred drops, mingle into one. The day dawns ; the day star is rising ; darkness shall flee away. Love must govern the world.
