Nansen, the greatest living explorer... Nansen, the greatest living explorer of the extreme North-land says: 'My experience leads me to take a decided stand against the use of stimulants and narcotics of all kinds, from tea and coffee on the one hand, to tobacco and alcohol on the other. The idea that one gains by stimulating body and mind by artificial means betrays, in my opinion, not only ignorance of the simplest physiological laws, but also want of exp?rience or perhaps want of capacity to learn from experience and observation.'
