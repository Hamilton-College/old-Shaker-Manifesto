South Union, Ky. Center House. Sept. 1893. Dear Editor:ï¿½While musing about some of your able correspondents of the past from this place, I thought I would write a few lines for the Home Notes in your magazine. South Union is still here, fair and beautiful to behold. Earth, air, sky, and vegetation retain all their loveliness and original beauty. The pines, cedars, and maples that were planted here by zealous and earnest hands have grown to be large trees, and the stone walks are worn smooth by the steady march of tireless feet. The dry and warm summer days of 1893 are gone, and the initial days of autumn are here with all the grandeur of roadside and forest scenery. The golden' rod is waving its yellow plume in every wind that blows. The sassafras has taken on the hue of velvet plush, and the vine that twines its tendrils around the oak is a sight worth seeing in the evening twilight. We have finished making preserves for THE MANIFESTO. 243 this season, and a busy time it has been. The last bottle was not placed on the shelves in the cellar before an order came for fifty cases. That is encouraging, for quick sales are the life of trade. We canned strawberries, raspberries, cherries, plums, blackberries, pears, peaches, and quinces. These preserves are made of the very best of fruit and the very finest of granulated sugar, put in weight for weight. They are very rich in flavor and good to the taste. We also put up grape jellies. We are in usual health, and have three in the family who are up in the nineties. Our family is making good progress in financial affairs. Elder Henry, come and see us, and you will find that Kentuckians make friendship a virtue. James Carr.
