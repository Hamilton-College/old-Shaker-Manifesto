MINISTRATION. 'The ministration of the spirit is glorious.' --2 Cor., iii., 8. Canterbury, N. H. Blow, Heavenly breezes, blow, Waft, waft us inspiration; Grant us thro' this vale below, Sacred ministration. Bound by all that's good and true, To perfect our journey, Thou wilt daily strenght renew,-- We shall triumph fully.
