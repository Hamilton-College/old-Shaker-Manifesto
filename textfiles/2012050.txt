Within a few yeacs a great change has taken place in the business. Glass and Crockery lamps have given way to Bronze, Iron and Brass. In Connecticut alone the following cities and populations are largely engaged in the manufacture of Bronze and Brass lamps: Meriden, 22,000; Waterbury, 30,000; Birmingham and Ansonia, 20,000; Bridgeport, 50,000; Total, 122,000, people. The business has increased immensely since the 'Rochester' bronze lamp was introduced with its perforated cone burner, about five years ago. There are over two million Rochester lamps in use, and over half a million a year are regularly sold.
