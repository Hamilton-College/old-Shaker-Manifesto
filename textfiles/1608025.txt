The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for July has for its ' leader ' a biographical and phrenological sketch of Prof. James B. Richards, M. A. The portrait is of unusual excellence and the character sketch must take rank as one of the best of Prof. Sizer's instructive contributions to the fast-growing literature which looks to the general weal of mankind. The sketch is at once a study of causes and their eft'ects; a eulogy on the greatest of greatness, practical humanitarianism; a tribute of affection to a dearly beloved friend and co-worker. It is especially interesting to thoughtful parents and progressive teachers. The reader's sympathizes are at once enlisted with the work to which Prof. Richards was so fully wedded, and in which he attained such remarkable success. Who is worthy to wear ' the royal mantle which he has let fall? ' Is it a fact that ' Familiar Talks about Phrenology for Young People ' grow in interest, or is it because the reader is being coaxed into the editor's way of thinking, that each installment seems better than the last? 'Dublin, Ireland,' is finely illustrated. 'Latter Day Pilgrimages to Mecca,' 'The Use of Phrenology in Business, ' ' Some Floral Gossip, ' are brief yet condensed information. ' People of an Old Massachusetts Town ' is written by one who knows whereof she writes, and the sweet face of Mrs. Elizabeth Taylor Ames, that illustrates it will delight the reader of the article. Every young girl should read ' Whose Fault? ' ' Asthma ' may bring consolation to many sufferers. ' Water Treatment in Typhoid Fever. ' is timely as well as sensible. ' Notes on Science and Industry' is brimiul of good things. Editorially this number of the Joubnal is up to high-water mark. The ' Correspondents ' are numerous and the questions asked and answered are always of general interest. $2.00 per year; 20c, per number. Fowler &amp; Wells Co. Publishers, 753 Broadway, N. Y.
