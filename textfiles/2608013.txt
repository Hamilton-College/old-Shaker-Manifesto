TRIBUTE. By Henry Hollister. To repeat choice thoughts from the last Manifesto moved me to write. From the first all impressive article, The editorial, and the subject Trust,all is included, with an especial memory for the line in quotation marks in the subject Tenderness. I would be a vigorous opposer of evil, and a joyful, humble receiver of every light given. From those appointed to disperse light first, and from my daily companions next. This is our Ideal. Sometime, sooner or later, we shall understand and be content that the Truth is unto us and not of us, until nothing weak nor false remains. What though we have fallen short of the great glory in store for the steadfast and innocent souls; there is yet a glory and a work for us wherein our industry can wear out the memory of a wayward past. Have we been saved? Yea, surely! Do we need a continuing salvation? Verily! Obedience was the beginning of salvation and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land. Narcoosee, Fla.
