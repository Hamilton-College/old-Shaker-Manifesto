Dear Brother; In answer to your question... [Edjtok, M^nijtsto ; 'JbisletU r �s&gt; witun to my Brother. I send it by request. J. E. R.] Shirley, Mass. Apr. 1884. Dear Brother ;�In answer to your question, Why the Shakers do not marry, I would say; *ve have many reasons why we do not. First, Because we regard the teachings of Christ as being of the utmost importance, and he very emphatically says, 'that they who are counted worthy of that world neither marry nor are given in marriage. ' And if any one love father or mother or houses or land, yea, his own life more than me, he is unworthy of me. And you will find that the example of both Christ and St. Paul and their teachings establish the fact beyond dispute that a celibate life is more in harmony with Christian duty and the requirement of the Gospel. Second, The mind kept free from carnal desires is capable of rising to a higher and holier state of devotion. The soul approaches nearer the beatitude of angelic life when the pure stream of consecration is untainted by the animal propensities. The Shakers are not the originators of this doctrine. They accept the teaching of Christ, practically, and thus become not only hearers, but doers of the word, and is it not more noble in the Christian Soldier to take up arms and fight against the Lusts of the flesh than it is to submit to this insidious enemy of our peace, and of our soul's salvation? I am aware that many try to throw a roseate hue, about the married life, but God knows and he only how many are groaning under matrimonial burdens. Whence come suicides, broken homes and broken hearts? Ask the gray haired sire whose son sets him at defiance or whose daughter sets at nought his parental authority. The power of the Beast should have no dominion over us. It is against this gigantic evil, this wholesale slaughter that the Shaker takes his stand. Against the reading of lewd stories that inflames the imagination. Against the indiscriminate marriage, which binds two uncongenial natures, two antagonistic spirits to fight life's battle out as best they may; against all such things the Shaker lifts his voice. And such will continue to be the case until the pulpit and press and men in high places cry mightily against this hydra headed monster, (Sen.sunlity,) even if it does wear the mask of matrimony. It is even so. Dear Brother, be not deceived ' Evil communications corrupt good manners. ' When I look upon my gospel relation I rejoice to know that there ar? so many, at least, who have given their hearts to religion and to God. J. E. Rhodes.
