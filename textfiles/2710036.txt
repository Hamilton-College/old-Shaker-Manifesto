Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly There is something to interest nearly every kind of reader in Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly for September. The diversity and timeliness of its contents and the great profusion of its illustrations make this number a particularly attractive one. The leading article gives much interesting information about the historic Wallkill Valley, in New York State, and tells of the troubles with the Indians, the founding of a Huguenot village, the first meeting of the State Legislature, etc. It is written by John P. Ritter, who personally visited the places described, taking many excellent photographs, which are reproduced with the article. In 'Cycle Touring in Ireland.' R. H. Herron writes of a trip through the most important towns of the Emerald Isle. The college article this month treats of Wellesley, and is by Virginia Sherwood. A paper of great interest and value is 'The United JStates Marine Hospital Service,' in which Joanna R. Nicholls tells of the history, work and officers of that important branch of our government. The old city of Bahia, in Brazil, is the subject of an article by Henry Greyson; Garrard Harris writes entertainingly of 'Plantation Life in Dixie;' the American Cities series is continued'with a graphic account of Pittsburg, by Charles Thomas Logan; there are several good short stories; an exciting installment of the serial, 'The Catspaw,' is given; the department of stories and verses for young people is as bright as usual; and there are some pithy paragraphs in the Leslie Portfolio.ï¿½ Frank Leslie's Publishing Houset New York.
