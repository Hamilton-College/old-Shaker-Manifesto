The True Ring The Churchman says : ' Men judge of Christianity by the lives of those who profess and call themselves Christians,' which we most assuredly agree with others, is a truth worth heeding in our Church. If we desire to proclaim our doctrines, we must live them. To Those Interested We hold ourselves open to lecture engagements for any further fuller exposition of ' Shaker Faith and Principles,' also upon ' The Jews, Jesus and Christians,' ' Spiritualism among the Shakers,' ' The False and the Truth of Spiritualism' 'The Gospel of Common Sense.' Our only stipulation would be to be paid our expenses in transitu, and a sum equal to twentyfive subscriptions for The Manifesto.
