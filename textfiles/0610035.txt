'THE WORLD'S SAGES, INFIDELS AND THINKERS.' The Book reviewer of The Shaker says of this extraordinary work : ' We congratulate the publisher, and the public generally, on account of the good judgment displayed in supplying so copious and compact a compilation (1000 pages) in one volume. It is a biography of the greatest minds that ever lived; and is intended as an improver of minds of this and every country. We trust that the publisher will be well repaid for the arduous labors he has made for the moral and mental development of all classes. It is a valuable treasure. We with pleasure invite the attention of the public, to a book that must be found in every well-selected library. D. M. Bennett, New York, Pub. ' Burdett Hanks, 'Reviewer.'
