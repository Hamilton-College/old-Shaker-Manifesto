Herman F. Harris, Esteemed Friend... Shakers, Albany Co. N. Y. Herman F. Harris, Esteemed Friend :�Your letter of enquiry received. The words of Emerson came to me. 'Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker.' I see by the tone of your letter that you have been thinking and am glad of it, as that will lead to investigation and to enlightenment. You ask what Scriptural authority I have for asserting the Dual principle of the Godhead? I will quote Genesis i., 26, 27. 'And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness�So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.' Now mark the exact reading where it says, 'let us make man in our image, male and female created he them.' What can be clearer than that sentence to prove the dual principle of the Godhead? Also Romans, i., 20. 'For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.' You 'grant that the natural is but a shadow of the spiritual in many particulars,' why not in all? What absurdities would it lead to when it is stated that the invisible are clearly seen by the things that are made even the Godhead ? Now I would ask how could God create man in his likeness, male and female, unless those attributes were in the Godhead? To my mind there is where the absurdities are, in supposing that he could be created male and female, (the word he and him are used in the generic sense meaning the race as a whole) when the creative power did not possess those attributes. You state that the idea of a 'Mother in the Godhead, savors of gross materialism.' Far from that. So we understand, it appeals to the most spiritual part of our being. Thinking of our earthly parentage and the loving, tender care of a Mother and to realize that it is the earthly representation of our Heavenly Mother, awakens emotions that are the antipodes of a Materialistic mind. You misquote me when you say that I said, Greece and Rome had the true elements that constitute an enlightened race. What I did say as you will see by referring to the article, that the nineteenth century had been weighed in the balance and found wanting in the elements that constitute an enlightened race and like the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome are destined to dissolution if the eternal principles of progress were not complied with. You ask 'is not the expression 'born of the spirit' a figurative way of speaking?' I do not think it is. Jesus told his disciples that they 'lmist be born of the spirit or they could not enter the kingdom of heaven,' and then he told them that the 'kingdom of heaven was within,' in their own spiritual being and not in some far remote place or locality. Nay, my dear friend it is not figurative, but real. 62 THE MANIFESTO. Every one that is earnestly striving to evolve higher and better conditions in his life is traveling towards the spiritual birth, to that condition where they can in truth be 'born of the spirit.' Whether this spiritual birth is attained here or in the spirit world, it is the final goal to which all mankind are traveling and will ultimately attain. I do not believe that souls will be forever lost but they will have to suffer in tribulation until they are willing to renounce the follies and sins of their lives and travel away from them, some will be longer and some a shorter period of time in doing the work. The resurrection as we understand the term is not a physical one but spiritual, and truly, as Jesus said, 'they neither marry nor are given in marriage.' I use the term for the want of a better one as a large majority of people only think of it in a material or carnal sense ; when the true meaning of the word implies a union and that union may be a spiritual one entirely removed from any carnal desires or relations. In my allusion to the Heavenly Bridegroom and Bride I used the name in a figurative sense to indicate the growth in the minds of the people of the true understanding of the Godhead in relation to the Mother spirit. I do not claim that all of the evils that exist in our modern social and political life are caused by not granting the right of suffrage to woman, but I do assert and without fear of successful contradiction that unless man is willing to recognize woman as something more than a political chattel classed with idiots and insane, willing to have her stand by his side in perfect equality in the brother and sisterhood of humanity just so surely will the strong hand of the iconoclast smash our boasted civilization. In the words of Whittier:� 'All grim with toil and brown with tan, I saw a strong one in his wrath, Smiting the godless shrines of man along his path. O justice, when will thy eyes be opened and thou be ready to mete out to all of earth's children a true and righteous recompense? And when will mankind cease to be half orphaned and acknowledge that beautiful truth that to be spiritually developed they must have a Mother as much as they needed the maternal bearing spirit to unfold their earthly existence. You say that man's intellectual superiority cannot be denied. I believe that to use a homely phrase they are 'six and a half dozen.' That there are individual men who are the intellectual and moral superiors of some women there is no doubt, and so there are women that possess these qualifications in a greater degree than some men, but ou the whole they stand equal. My dear friend, I have tried to make my reasons clear and hope I have succeeded. Remember that it is a dangerous experiment to get into the path of a cyclone, so it is not safe to say or do anything to hinder the onward march of man to a higher comprehension of the duties and requirements of life. Should be pleased to hear from you again at any time, and may your efforts to attain the truth be successful. In kindest regards, I remain, Your friend, Hamilton DeGraw.
