The Future Work of Spiritualism As Spiritualists, our work measures and overarches all the reforms of the age. To continue it successfully requires brave, enthusiastic and self-sacrificing men and women; Media passive, pure and holy in every aspiration; speakers with tongues of lire, hearts pulsing with prayer, intellects rich in genius and culture, and souls touched with the baptism of the living Christ. We are in the Second Coming. The angels are already in the clouds of heaven. There is about to be a religious revival such as the world has not seen for eighteen centuries. Christians will be converted; outsiders will inquire the way to Zion; Christ spirits will lead them; the white faces of martyrs will illumine their pathway. After the cross, the crown. The very foundations of the old social, political and theological religions are being shaken. ' I will shake earth and the heavens also,' said God by the prophet. The world is becoming literally a world of Shakers. The most stupendous drama In history is now unfolding. The sixth trumpet has sounded. The books are open. The world is the stage; nations the actors. The fig tree has put forth. The angels of the spiritual dispensation are calling us to judgment. My soul pleads for you ' yet a little longer,' and the 'spirit and the bride say come.'' Are your lamps trimmed and burning? Answer as in the presence of God's angels. Let us, Oh Spiritualists, be true to our convictions; true to our moral and religious natures ; true to the principles of purity and right; then should our mortal barks speedily strand, or go down even, they will only sink to rise yito those calmer seas that make divinely beautiful the love-lands of the angels.
