Beautiful Things MARIA WHEELER A spirit that harbors no malice, but forgives as it would be forgiven. A soft answer given when the heart prompts a harsh one. It is a beautiful thing to frankly acknowledge an error we are conscious of committing toward another ; and a more enjoyable thing to know we are wiping away the tears of pain our thoughtless words have caused. The ready smile of a cheerful spirit, and the encouraging words of a time-tried companion, are beautiful things to the eyes of angels. A friend, who loveth at all times, through evil and through good report; through sorrow unto joy ; through sin and suffering unto repentance, is more beautiful than the stars in the firmament above ; more to be desired than all the wealth of Golconda. A pure heart is the crown of all beautiful things. Union Village, O.
