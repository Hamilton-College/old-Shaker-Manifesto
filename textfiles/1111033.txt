To Soften Putty and Remove Old Paint .â€” Take three pounds of quick stone lime, slack the lime in water, and then add one pound of American pearl-ash. Apply this to both sides of the glass and let it remain for twelve hours, when the putty will be softened, and the glass may be taken out without being broken. To destroy paint apply it to the whole body of the work which is required to be cleaned; use an old brush, as it will spoil a new one ; let it remain about twelve or fourteen hours, and then the paint may be easily scraped off.
