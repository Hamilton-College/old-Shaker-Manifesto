Home Topics An attractive and economical tea cake... An attractive and economical tea cake, and oue which might appropriately be called 'children's delight,' is made by taking enough white bread dough to make a small loaf ; knead into it a tablespoonful of butter or lard, two tablespoonfuls of English currants ; let it rise until it is very light, then bake in a moderately hot oven. If you have any of the tin cans in whicli tomatoes are put up, use one of them for a baking tin, and bake this cake in it. You will have a pretty round loaf, and the size and appearance of the slices are also pleasing. Graham bread seems actually to taste better if baked in one of these tins. To Soften Putty and Remove Old Paint .â€” Take three pounds of quick stone lime, slack the lime in water, and then add one pound of American pearl-ash. Apply this to both sides of the glass and let it remain for twelve hours, when the putty will be softened, and the glass may be taken out without being broken. To destroy paint apply it to the whole body of the work which is required to be cleaned; use an old brush, as it will spoil a new one ; let it remain about twelve or fourteen hours, and then the paint may be easily scraped off.
