The risen and living Christ is to be preached to the Church of the future. The presence of the living Christ is what we all need. We need to 7iave Him walk with us and work in us and among us. He can do His mighty works for us and in us only through His spiritual and divine presence. If we have not His divine presence we are without God in the world.—Dr. S. F. Dike.
