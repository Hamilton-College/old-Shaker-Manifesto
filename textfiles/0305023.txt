FRUGALITY How infinitely wise and bountiful, is the great Creator of the world; yet in all his bounty He allows no waste. Of the four elements earth, air, fire, and water, of which the world is composed, there is nothing wasted. Man may make use of these elements, but he cannot destroy them. The decomposition of matter in the vegetable kingdom is a preparation for giving life to another growth. The majestic trees of the forest derive strength and vitality from their own foliage, and in all the works of Nature we see this important truth verified, that nothing is lost. Jesus when on earth went about distributing blessings. His example of feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fishes, and when the meal was passed, of commanding them to ' gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost; ' is one worthy of imitation and attention. Mother Ann was remarkable, both in principle and practice, in regard to prudence and economy. She was frequently known to wait until others had finished their meal, then go to the table and make her repast of the fragments, and say, 'It is good enough for me; it is the blessing of God, and must not be lost! ' Her counsel to her children was, ' You must be prudent and saving of every good thing.' Let us follow her beautiful example of frugality, and gather up the fragments. For this was the pattern which Jesus did set, and his good example we should not forget. The practical Believer in Christ will heed the counsel of the Apostle, who said, : Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.' A modern poet says : ' We find of those bounties which Heaven does give, That some live to eat, and some eat to live ; That some think of nothing but pleasing the taste, And care very little how much they may waste.'
