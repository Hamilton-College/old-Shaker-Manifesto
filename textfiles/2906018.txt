BLESSINGS OF THE GOSPEL. By Sadie J. Pineo. We read that God sendeth his rain on the just and on the unjust and maketh the sun to shine on the evil and the good. So it is with the gospel. Salvation is offered freely to all souls who will come and drink of the waters of life, no discrimination being made between high and low, rich and poor, for our Savior said, 'I caine not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.' Souls having a knowledge of the higher life but being unwilling to walk in the strait and narrow way, realize the fulfillment of the text, 'If the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness.' But those who accept Christ and willingly become his disciples, leaving all for his sake, become participants in the joy promised to the pure in heart, the meek, and those who hunger and thirst after righteousness. 'E'en though stricken 'neath the rod,' the true child of God is confident that the hand that chastens deals in tender mercy, for a divine parentage knoweth that we have need of these things. The gospel takes souls from nature's garden and transplants them into the garden of Grace, where they are nurtured by the rain and the sunshine of Heaven. As the spotless lily comes up from the blackest mud, so the soul, touched by the power of the gospel, rises from the mire of a fallen nature, and blooms in fragrant beauty, having struck its roots so deep that neither storm nor flood has power to destroy it. THE MANIFESTO. 95 The Christ spirit says'Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up,' hence the necessity of the injunction, 'Watch and pray,' lest while men sleep the enemy comes and sows tares, which, when grown will choke the good seed. East Canterbury, jV. H.
