JUSTICE JUSTICE D. M. HERSEY Where are the men for this dark time, Strong men and women for the right ? Firm leaders in the coming fight Of right and wrong in every clime. Where are the noble and the brave, Who love their country, free from blame Who weep to see their country's shame, Nor stoop to be a party slave ? O, give us men of honest deal, Who scorn a bribe, and hate a lie ? And statesmen, who would rather die Than from their country's treasure steal. God grant that those who rob the poor, When outraged Justice strikes the blow, May never sink in hells as low As thousands of these slaves endure. O, man, how long wilt thou withold The help thy brother sorely needs ? Go, bind the broken heart that bleeds, And give from out thy stores of gold ! Oh ! shame upon a cringing press, That dares not brand Lthe wrong it sees, But, pamper'd with the rich man's fees, Withholds a mighty power to bless. I know not, in the coming strife, The ways that Justice will pursue; I only know, if we are true, We shall not vainly give our life. Vineland, N. J.
