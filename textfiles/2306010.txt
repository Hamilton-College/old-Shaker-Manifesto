AVERTING SUNDAY SICKNESS. It can hardly be questioned that with the average person, young or old, there is a greater liability to that measure of sickness which will keep one at home on Sunday than on any other day of the week. Men will succumb to a Sunday sickness who would battle against it on a week-day. Women will find it dangerous to leave their homes on Sunday in weather that they would resolutely brave for a day's shopping or concert attending. And children who can be out of doors all of Saturday, are often too indisposed to attend Sunday-school on the day following. In the Sunday-school of the Washington Street Congregational Church at Toledo, Ohio, a prescription for one type of Sunday sickness has been proposed, which is worthy of consideration elsewhere. In 'The Helper,' a monthly paper issued by that Sunday-school, the facts in the premises are given as herewith:� Where are those 161 scholars? What 161 scholars? We will show you:� Average enrollment for past quarter 603 Average attendance ' ' ' 442 The difference 161 In other words, 161 of our members are absent from the school every Sunday. They surely are not all out of the city! It does not seem probable that 161 of us could be sick every Sunday for a whole quarter, but, strange as it seems, it is true. It is a fearful malady that has broken out among us, and it requires very prompt and heroic treatment. We do not run a 'free dispensary,' but out of 'pure love for the patients' we prescribe the following Unfailing Remedy. On Sunday morning, rise at six; use plenty of cold water on the face; eat a plain, hearty breakfast. Then mix and take internally a dose composed of equal parts of the following ingredients, namely: Will. Push. Energy. Determination. Self-respect. Respect for God's day. Respect for God's house. A desire to be somebody. Stir well, add a little love just to make it sweet. Repeat the dose every three minutes till Sunday-school time, unless relief comes sooner. If the day is stormy an external application of over-shoes, rubber coats, and umbrellas will be beneficial. We shall confidently look for many wonderful cures among our 161 patients.� Sunday-School Times.
