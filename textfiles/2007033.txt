'White Water, O. North Family We have been doing considerable fixing up at this family this spring and I suppose it will interest all good Believers to know what the different Societies are doing. We painted buildings of the Church, the upper and lower halls, the dining-room and kitchen, also the fence by the highway. We had a very nice shower just in time to help our crops, which look well in this section of the country, Two Sisters from Mt. Lebanon and a Brother and Sister from Union Village are visiting us at present. I hope they enjoy a nice time. We enjoyed a very nice time with them. We do our own painting here, indeed, I do that myself. We also had rods attached to the dwelling, the church, the Sisters' brick shop, the cow-barn and to the milk-house. H. W. Fredrick.
