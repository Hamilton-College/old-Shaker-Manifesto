Sabbathday Lake, Me. June, 1895. June comes with all her beauty; the most perfect month of the year! The birds commence their songs of rapture early in the morning and sing throughout the long day. We are having fine sunny weather; just what the vegetation needs. A few days since the gardener came into the kitchen with a large basket of spinach saying 'Who wants to goto Florida?' It had grown from seed in twenty-eight days. We think that is doing well for this state&gt; especially as the weather has not always been favorable. The Maine State Building from the World's Fair, Chicago, is now erected at Poland Springs and will be dedicated the 26 inst. Some ot the Officers and a great many people will be present. The Proprietors have very kindly invited us to come with our fancy work; a privilege which we shall gladly accept. Of this eventful day we will tell you in our next Notes. Ada S. Cummings.
