Sabbathday Lake. Oct. 14, 1890. We thought a few words from our home might not come amiss among the home notes of the Manifesto. Elder William has purchased a Potato Digger which he uses with great success He says that with it he can dig out potatoes enough in two hours in the morning to keep ten men at work picking them up the rest of the day. Our flower garden has been a 'thing of beauty'' and very profitable to us during the summer. Our sales at Poland Springs will close this week (Oct. 15) and I would like to add that during all our goings to .that place (which have been frequent, being four times a week) we have been treated very kindly at both hotels by the guests and proprietors. We would he pleased if each Society of Believers had such a place to sell their wares and be as cordially received. Rev. W. H. H. Murray was met by the sisters at Poland Springs last evening and to-day he has been down viewing our home from the highway. School will commence the first Moti. in Nov. and continue sixteen weeks. We are aware that winter is close at hand and are now quite busy preparing for the same. A. S. C.
