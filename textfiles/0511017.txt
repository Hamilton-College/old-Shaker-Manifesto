SEA OF GLASS To stand upon a sea of glass, is to become a new creature, dwelling in light. The natural man and woman are one thing in another, having an outside and an inside. The heart, of such, is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. Why? Because their inmost thought, imagination and feeling — their own selfhood — are distinct from their outward, whether by looks, dress, walk, or speech. ' The poison of asps is under their tongues. With their lips they use deceit.' They are not what they seem to be — claim to be.— Life, with them, is a falsehood. It begins with the boy and girl. The sphere of childhood has its under current of craft and finesse — its secrets. Anon, as young men and women, they have a little world of their own ; from which the old folks — parents, guardians, seniors, —are carefully excluded. Knowledge — useful information — which might have been imparted, at the proper season, was withheld. That dependance, of the younger, upon the elder, and the confidence created, by a gradual impartation of practical truth, are not sustained. The love, of the boy, for mother, of the girl, for the father, is, in nature, transferred to wife and husband. It should be normal. Then, when called to forsake all natural relations, for ' Christ's sake and the Gospel,' the transfer of affections would be possible, the yoke easy and the burden light.
