AGAINST OATHS. Sir John Miller, an English Judge, is quoted in a recent paper, as follows : 'Profoundly convinced by a long judicial experience of the general worthlessness of oaths, especially in cases where their falsity cannot be tested by cross examination, or be crimi- nally punished, I have become an advocate for the abolition of oaths as the test of truth; but I would retain the punishment for false declarations wherever at present the law prescribes a penalty for a 'false oath.' An honest man's testimony will not be made more true under the sanction of an oath, and a dishonest man will only be affected by the dread of temporal punishment.' Messenger of Peace.
