Pleasant Hill, Ky. We have been favored with a brief visit from Eldress Elizabeth Downing of Union Village, Ohio. We are always glad to welcome her to her old home. She was called here to see Sr. Sarah Weatherford, an associate Eldress of Eldress Adaline Wells, who was vei-y ill, even unto death, but now she is pronounced out of immediate danger. Our kind physician and brother, W. F. Pennebaker, has safely carried many patients through La Grippe as well as other ills. We feel thankful that so many of our aged ones have been spared to us. March came in with storms, but in a day or two all was as calm and pleasant as May. The sun shines brightly, the grass is springing up, the birds are chirping their matin songs of praise, and who could fail to appreciate a home amidst such surroundings. Our district school has just finished its winter term and the interest has been kept up thoughout the session. The Trustees have been faithful to the teacher, and she in turn faithful to the children. On the 22nd of Feb., the school held suitable exercises. Recitations, select readings and songs appropriate to the birth, life and death of Washington, who paved the way to freedom, and liberty of conscience. We have much, indeed, to be thankful for, in this home of liberty, and we pray that no cruel war shall again devastate our fair land. We love our little missionary and we trust many may, from its perusal, become converted, and 'Cease to do evil and learn to do well.' With these notes please accept our love and kind wishes, and may we realize that 'All things work together for good to them that love God.' M. C. S.
