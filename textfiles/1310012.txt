IN THE SPIRIT. NANCY G. DANFORTH. John was ''in the spirit' on the Lord's day: Why? In the first place, he had given his miud to medication and prayer. He had thereby drawn around himself the ministration of Angelsâ€”the holy influences of the heavens. Then again, his mission was peculiarly one of love. He breathed love and good will to all, not only to the faithful and upright, but also to the erring whom he followed with tears and entreaties, that they might return to their allegiance to duty. In the same manner are the followers of Christ, in this age, called to be in the spirit on the Lord's day. As the testimony of full and final salvation from all sin is now freely proclaimed, it becomes our duty to esteem every day as belonging to the Lord. Therefore, if all time is the Lord's, it necessarily follows, that we have none in which to look after selfish ease and indulgence ; but we should each hour, be seeking greater consecrations, and striving more earnestly to do all the righteous will of God. In this strife we can live, and be filled with the spirit at all times, and receive the manifestations of divine love and guidance through all the burdens and cares of life ; although in the world, yet living above its influences, 'redeeming the time knowing the days are evil.' Canterbury, N. H.
