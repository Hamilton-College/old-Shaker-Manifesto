' Gentle and Easy to be Entreated, without Partiality and without Hypocrisy.' No. 2. WILLIAM LEONARD. When he had struggled up far enough to look about him, could see none who had the least care or concern for him, and that he tad nothing of value but a strong determination to make a man, and to back up this, had proved to the world that he had energy enough to carry it into effect. You and I have seen such, who, in the midst of great temptation, stood truthful, honest; without a teacher, became learned, and gathered substance without capital. One who, standing upright, became beloved ; without friends in childhood, could count his friends by thousands in manhood; and from an errand boy, had arisen to some of the most useful stations in society, and a strong pillar to support all the radical reforms of the age. I have studied such biographies with thrilling interest. Here let me say that this character is the best phototype of a Shaker, that ever existed. Such a character arises to be a man without the shadow of partial surroundings, and so does the Shaker. A true body of Believers, in our faith, are self-made men and women. To God they give all the glory for their uprising in a spiritual resurrection. When called into this order and awakened to an understanding of sin, by the Holy Spirit, they see that they must rise out of the lost state that they are in by bearing the cross of Christ, and that none can do the work for them. Nothing of their old character will answer now, they must have one entirely new, and they cannot get it till they toil and suffer for it, and earn it. Like the pilgrim at the gold diggings without capital, if they secure the precious dust, they dig it, wash it, cleanse it, for none are partial enough to do it for them. At the door into this church, there is no partiality ; the poor candidate who will show his lost condition, will pass in before the rich who will not do so. The reckless or the thoughtless, who have been rude, will pass before the moralist who needs no physician. I have seen the ignorant pass through this door while the learned was barred, out. He whose name never stood on any church record has been accepted, while the great professor had to stand back. It matters not whether a candidate is a religionist, moralist or a rude man of the world, as Christ makes all things new, they must obtain a new set of thoughts, words and actions. They can obtain them by constant effort, watchfulness and prayer; no other price will purchase them. Since the Christian religion was plasted on earth, no joint interest was ever carried out so perfectly as it has been among the Shabers, upon religious equality. Our own experience teaches us just hoWtall partiality was struck down in the pentecostal church. Our co�cnant relation was formed in the very spirit of the compact. It gives to all the social comforts of life, in health and sickness. The proceeds of all labor, income and consecration, goes into the hands of one set of Trustees, 'Who buy and sell as though they possessed not,' to be appropriated for the good of ajl. Dwelling rooms and work rooms are furnished alike, convenient for all the inmates, and all trades impartially, from Elders to all grades of members. The same church order and law meets us all, and must rule us all. The same seasons for labor, as each has ability, goes to sustain the whole, without favoritism in any quarter. Now, when the apostle says in the text, without partiality, if all this does not bring us within his exact meaning, I see no way for Christians to get there, and it is easy to discover that all who come up to this state of things must be in reality without 'hypocrisy.' Here, then, is the conclusion of the whole matter. No oue can carry out the principles of Christianity, except ne is strictly candid and free from all duplicity and hypocrisy. It has been a maxim with us for years that if the gospel does not make a professor free from all . guile and double dealing that it does but little for him. In the political world many screen themselves from sight in the under-current of policy and the unreal, but such hypocrisy will not do for a Christian. We have started on the Christian course we have endeavored to describe, and have found it to be a pure way. Honestly have we continued it through life thus far, and find it to be the path of peace, quietness and comfort, and honestly will we. pursue it to the end of our course, that we may justly expect to find our names written in the ' Lamb's Book of Life. ' 'We must all come up to the moment when we step from time into eternity. We, then, above all things else, desire to pass into the unknown world with the certainty that it has been our highest ambition to successfully carry out in practice ; '' Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, and! whatsoever things are of good report.'�This will give the departing spirit of a child of God, when he looks upon the last setting sun, full confidence to expect a ' city which hath foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God.'
