Elder H. C. Blinn, Dear Brother:--We in our western home... Pleasant.Hill, Ky., Feb. 1891. Elder H. C. Blinn, Dear Brother :ï¿½We in our western home, read with some degree of pleasure the Manifesto and derive benefit therefrom. There are many writers and contributors, who have committed their missives to your little sheet, and we hope that the 'bread they cast on the waters,' may return to them with an increase of an hundred fold. Much has been written of the 'law of kindness,' and it is an inexhaustible theme, like a fountain, the more drawn from it, the more may be drawn from it. 'Woman's Mission,' has attracted much attention from the Sisterhood, and we bid the writer 'God speed.' True Politeness adds much to the charm of a home, among Believers, or elsewhere, and as it costs so little, it should not be a scarce commodity, with us. How much more pleasant life would be if in place of angry words we could give the 'retort courteous.' But alas for human nature, the case at times seems almost hopeless. We were all grieved to hear of the demise of our beloved Elder Giles. May his successor, Elder Joseph, be enabled to do much good and bring many to know the truth, as proclaimed by the living witnesses of 'The Second Appearing.' Truly, 'the harvest is great and the laborers few;' yet we know the promise is only to those who are faithful and endure to the end. We wish you success with our little Messenger. Your Sister, Mary C. Settles.
