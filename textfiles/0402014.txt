There is one thing in which the Jews excel the Christians... There is one thing in which the Jews excel the Christians : and that is, funerals. The Jewish service is exactly the same for rich and poor. They consider the grave a leveler. Thus, at the recent funeral of Sir David Solomons, the eminent English Jew, there was a magnificent absence of all displayâ€”no elaborate trappings, no plumes, no gaudy hearse, no gold-mounted coffin. It is well to live as a Christian, and die as a Jew.
