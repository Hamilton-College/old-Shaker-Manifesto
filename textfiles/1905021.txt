FROM THE COPTIC BIBLE. The original of the following is a chapter in an ancient Coptic Bible manuscript preserved in a museum in Pans, and translated by a French orientalist. The English translation was sent to the Humane Journal by J. F. C. Kuhtmann, president of the Great German and International League to Protect Animals, with headquarters at Bremen, Germany. And it came to pass that our Lord departed from the town together with his disciples and crossed over into a mountain district. And they came to a mountain whose side was steep; there they found a man with a beast of burden; but the beast had fallen down for his master had overloaded it and he beat it so that it was bleeding. But Jesus drew near to the man and said, 'Man, why dost thou beat thine animal, dost thou not see that it is too weak to bear its load and knowest thou not that it is suffering pain!' But the man answered and said: 'Why trouble thyself about it? I may beat it as I will, seeing that it is my property for which I have given a large piece of money. Ask of those who are with th'ee, for they are acquainted with me and know of the matter.' And some among the disciples said: 'Yea, Lord, it is even as he says. We saw him buy the beast.' But the Lord said: 'Do ye also not see how it bleeds, and do ye also not hear its lamentations and cries?' But they answered and said; 'No, Lord, we do not hear it lamenting and crying.' Then Jesus was sad and cried out: 'Woe unto you that ye hear not how it cries and complains to the heavenly Creator for mercy, but thrice woe unto him who hath caused it to utter these cries and complaints.' And he drew near and touched it, and the beast got up on its feet and lo, its wounds were healed. But Jesus said to the man: 'Now, proceed on thy way, and from henceforth beat it no more, so mayest thou also find mercy.' Humane Journal.
