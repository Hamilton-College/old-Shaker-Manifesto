A Cement unequaled by any in the World 'There is an excellent cement, which ought to be used freely by everyone. This cement is good for family jars and social cuts. It heals wounds, and leaves no scars; mend life; binds enemies together; mends damaged reputations; and is splendid for hun feelings. This universal cement is love Love is a thing to be cultivated, as you woulc a solitary stalk of wheat, supposing that there was not another grain of wheat in the world.' The above was copied from the Am. Phren. Journal, and sent us by Joseph Slingerland of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. It is very good cement,—good, like gold; its scarcity making it extremely valuable. Of this cement, an ancient Shaker hymn thus engages : [s pure love and union my only free choice? And do I this union possess? When others are honored, then do I rejoice And pity all those in distress ? Is my heart delighted, when others are blest? And do I their happiness seek? Or am I e'er striving their peace to molest? I call on my conscience to speak! For by this criterion I now can decide, And know just the truth of the case; If I have that love that will ever abide, It will selfish nature abase. I shall not be lofty, nor haughty, nor high ; But little, and simple, and mild! I'll learn to esteem others better than I, And be an obedient child. And the hymn goes on et cetera. If this cement proves cankerous, caustic, clashing, and contentious; corroding, corrupting, lustful, or longing for lascivious legitimacy; if on the tongue's end always, and never in the active heart's engagement, the same is composed of spurious materials, and should be refused immediately. As good pudding is best known, sometimes, by 'chewing the pudding-string,' so let us test all so-called love by what if heals,—what it does that hate cannot do! 'And though its name Has been usurped by power, And profaned to unholy uses through all time, Still the eternal principle is pure '— pure love. And where in the world can we find it? **
