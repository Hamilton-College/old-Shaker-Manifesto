Who can tell the value of a smile... Who can tell the value of a smile? It costs the giver nothing, but is beyond price to the erring and relenting, the sad and ch erless, the lost and forsaken. It disarms malice, subdues temper, turns hatred to love, revenue to kindness, and paves the darkest path with gems of sunlight. A smile betrays a kind heart; the pressure of the hand, an affectionate brother; a cheerful word, a friend in n^ed; kind and courteous deportment toward all, a Christian heart. Kindliness adds a charm to beauty, and adds beauty to a homely face.
