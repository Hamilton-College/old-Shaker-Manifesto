I CAN DO SO LITTLE! ]&gt;Warner Snoad. [Contributed by A. G. Hollister.] So little! Why? 'tis not dreamy pride Self-righteous preaching will bring content But just the task you have thrown aside, There lies the way that your Master went! Your lot to-day is no thrilling deed No martyrdom that all eyes may see; But common duty�and this your meed 'Ye do it all for the sake of me.'' The quiet stand for the true, the right,� A sharp retort�for his sake kept down, The hard work done�aye, with all your might These form the gems of a victor's crown. For work is worship, and patience prayer, Not mere eye service that all may see, But humblest toil done with faithful care And then the guerdon ' 'Twas done for me.' Selected.
