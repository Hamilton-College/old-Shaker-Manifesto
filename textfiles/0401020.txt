The social evil, as a public question... The Social Evil, as a public question, has submitted itself to legal adjudication in St. Louis. The decision contains the following correct sentiments by Judge Calvin: 'The judge says further, it is a special law in its application to but one sex and not to both sexes. In this it is against the spirit of the Bill of Rights. The law should operate uniformly. The offense charged in the information cpuld not be, if the other sex were not participants in it. It is unjust and unfair that of the parties to the offense one should be required to conform to multitudinous and grievous and burdensome regulations, while the oth er party does not even receive a tacit recognition.'
