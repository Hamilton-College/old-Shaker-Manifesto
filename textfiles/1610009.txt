The Law of Moses vs. the Law of Christ. AGNES E. NEWTON. The law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ. The law was the governing principle of an oa;thly Institution. Life upon the lower or fundamental plane. Perfect in all its bearings towards that plane to which it was specially confined. St. Paul referring to the mission of Moses, speaks of his faithfulness as that of a servant in his master's house ; but that of Christ as a son over his own house ; and again of the law as of a schoolmaster which should bring us to Christ. Jesus, speaking of his own mission, said, ï¿½'! came not to destroy the law but to fulfill;' and add thereunto, his life declared. While the Mosaic law enjoined strict justice, the law of Christ presented the new commandment, 'That ye love one another ; ' and more than this, ' Love your enemies ; bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you aud persecute you.'' The law of Moses gave no intimation of soul life,; while all of the teachings of Jesus Christ, pointed more or less directly to the life beyond ; as he himself declared, ' My kingdom is not of this world. ' How plainly marked the duty of all who would become his followers, in the injunction, ' Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness. ' Obedience rendered to the law of Moses makes perfect the physical and moral character. Guided and molded by the Grace and Truth which came by Je- sus Christ, the spiritual nature of mankind becomes developed ; fitting them to become heirs of the heavenly kingdom, to an inheritance that fadeth not away.
