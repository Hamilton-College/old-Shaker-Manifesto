Dear Sister L; As Sister Asenath gave the... Shaker Village, N. June 13, 1883. Dear Sister L ;â€”As Sister Asenath gave the scholars the privilege to write to the sisters that we would like to talk with, so I thought I would write to you and tell you how I am getting along in school. I feel more interested this year than I did last summer. I study Physiology, Grammar, Arithmetic, Geography, Heading, Spelling, Writing, Drawing and Singing. I know a good deal in all these studies, I like Physiology the best. I know a little about many of the bones in the body. To show you what I know about the arm and hand I will tell you all the bones in them. There is one bone in the arm the name of it is Humerus; two in the fore-arm, Kadius and Ulna; eight in the wrist, nineteen in the hand, fourteen in the fingers, three in each finger, two in the thumb. This is all I have to say about my studies. Now I will tell you about the cherry tree by the East House. Sister Edith told me that the robins would eat all the cherries on our cherry tree so Lizzie and I planned to make a scare-crow and put it in the tree so as to keep the robins away so that we can have some cherries. I often have wished to thank you for taking care of me. With love I close, Blanche.
