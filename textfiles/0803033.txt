Speaking of salt... Speaking of salt, brings to our mind an instance of its beneficial result, when applied to trees. It will be nothing new to old fruit raisers, that Quince trees will bear but little, unless salted annually. Where we now reside, previous to our possession of the place, were two Quinces of good growth; but they had never borne a single specimen previous to our occupation. We surmised the cause, and the first fall applied about a pint of salt to each, scattering it about the tree, on the ground. The result the next season was three fair specimens. The following fall we repeated the experiment, and obtained, for our trouble, a fair yield of good fruit. We have applied salt every year since, and have never failed of a crop. Salt your Quince trees annually by all means; they require it even more than that best of vegetables, asparagus.
