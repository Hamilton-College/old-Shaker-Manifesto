OUR HOLY FAITH. Martyn W. Miles. At a recent Society meeting, an Elder remarked upon the desirability of our keeping before us the doctrines of the Church. This I endeavor to do, and in regard to the main tenets of the Society of Believers or Millennial Church, I desire to bear my humble testimony thereon and to confess the faith. We hold (if I state our views correctly) that the primitive Christian church, spoken of in the book of Acts of the Apostles, was established on right principles ; that the Gentile Christian churches rapidly and fatally fell away from it; and that our order has returned to those original and true doctrines and practices. Prominent tenets of the Pentecostal church were, a life of celibacy ; community of property ; confession of sins ; separation from the world; (marriage and private property being regarded as emblems of a lower order of society.) If we value the teachings of Jesus Christ it is surely logical and right to endeavor to really carry them into practice, as the apostles did ; the New Testament abounds in teachings directly or indirectly bearing upon the principles just enumerated ; one text, for instance, being:�''Sell what thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure iu heaven.' That is Christian communism,�it is equivalent to saying, 'Let there be as little inequality as is practicable,' the doctrines of Jesus being utterly opposed to the prevalent system which divides society into rich and poor�an inequitable system which is nowhere more tenaciously upheld than in England, 'making God's work of none effect.' The same fundamental idea has been expressed by many good men who have had a passion for justice. It pervades the writings of the poet Shelly, as in the line�'Foremost of things, divine Equality!' It is expressed by that grand axiom, 'Each for all, and ail for each.' Shakspeare does not omit to touch upon this subject:� 'So distribution should undo excess, And each one have enough.' In a brief narrative, St. Luke describes the primitive Christian church :�'And all that believed were together, and had all things in common, and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all as they had need,' and these words have had a remarkable power over the human mind in all ages since they were written. _ � Iu this Community, for my own part, I find my highest aspirations realized, and I esteem the privilege of being permitted to work, in the place appointed for me, in the vineyard of the Lord. But, holding the sociological views that I do, I was not very happy in the outer world, because, there, the social system by which 1 was environed worked counter to my belief iu the right and the best. Then there is the doctrine of the motherhood as well as fatherhood of God, from which we can derive much help and comfort. It has been well observed�'The Jewish Jehovah and Gentile Christian God was forceful, revengeful, and on occasion even hateful. This one-sided Creator lacked all that plenitude of benignity which, united with a manhood of correspouding wisdom, is truly worthy of reverence. And Christendom waited seventeen centuries for a woman to declare the duality of the deific essence.' I also especially prize the principle adopted by our order of separating ourselves from the influences of the world; in which respect it resembles the religious bouses of the Middle Ages. Now, it is well to endeavor to exert a leavening influence, for good, upon the world, while dwelling and moving therein, as the Society of Friends and other religious denominations do; but what if, on the contrary, we find the world gradually leavening us so that we realize, with St. Paul, that 'when we would do well, evil is present with us?' This used to be my own experience ; I therefore value the spiritualized every-day life to be found in this order, where, in retirement from the world, it is our privilege to seek to strengthen one another in the Lord, and in whatsoever i3 righteous and virtuous. Among the names of several eminent men who have written favorably of the Society are those of Henry Vincent, Hepworth Dixon, H. W. Beecher, C. Nordhoff, and Horace Greeiey. The latter wrote that 'they presented the sublime and hope-inspiring spectacle of a Community founded and built up on the conquest of the most inexorable appetites. When he had stood among the quiet homes of this people, and marked how they had steadily, surely advanced, from poverty to ample competence, how could he refrain from thinking lightly of that blind dogmatism which asserts the impossibility of inducing men to labor except for their own self-gratification?' I pray that God will aid me, by his strength, to faithfully practice so enlightened and spiritual a creed as that of the Millennial Church ; that he will enable me to crucify the life �f sin; to keep the faith ; to dedicate myself to his service ; and to go assiduously and zealously forward, witlNnyyvGospel kindred, in the work to'which he has called us.
