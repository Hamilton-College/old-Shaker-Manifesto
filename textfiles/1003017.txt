QUERIES AND ANSWERS 1. ' Will you please give us the best and liortest definition of a Shaker life ?' Certainly : A life that is pure, peaceable, unworldly and heavenly, like Fesus Christ's life. 2. 'Do you consider it necessary to become ascetics in order to be Christians?' Only as Christ was an ascetic. 3. ' In your opinion, must we live celibate ives, to be followers of Jesus Christ ? ' How can we follow where Jesus did lot lead ? 4. ' Would not 'the world become extinct if all should so live ? and is it desirable that such should be the case ? ' (1.)

To the « few ' who ' are able ''and willing so to live, the questions of desirableness or undesirableness, declarative of generations, never occur as germane considerations. 5. ' Did not Jesus have great respect for the institution of marriage?' As a worldly, civil institution, he did; so does every sensible person. As a Christian practice, he did not, nor can his genuine followers. 6. ' Did not Jesus advise the selling of coats for the procuration of swords ? and what were these swords to he used for?

It is a safe, Christian rule to sell as many coats, and procure as many swords with, the proceeds, as Jesus did, and only as many, and to use the swords after thus obtaining them just as Jesus did. See ? 7. ' Did not Jesus show a spirit of physical violence and retaliation in driving out those who were defiling the temple ? ' It is said, in disapprobation of this chronicle,that 'the zeal for his Father's house had nearly ' destroyed his Christian equanimity. Jesus could sorrow for his mistakes. 8. ' In 'Plain Talks,' you say the first requirement of Shakerism is an honest con- 66 THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. fession of one's sins. How is this following Jesus?' It is going down into the Jordan — judgment — to some one representing a confessor, like John Baptist, and imitating Jesus by rendering an account of the way you have lived, good, bad, or indifferent to your best light and understanding. The confessions of Jesus to John made it apparent to the latter that a better man than he stood before him ; hence John's remarks. Would to heaven it might similarly be your case when making your confessions to some Shaker elder; and the elder's response, ' I have need rather to be baptized of thee.' 9. ' What advice would you give me if I believed in Shaker doctrines of life and my wife did not ?' 'Act your faith.' 'Liberty of conscience' is guaranteed to every American citizen, in this living faith, no less than in the belief of dead creeds, nor in the prosecution of selfish indulgences under the civil con tract, called marriage. 10. ' Could I engage in the trial of Shakerism in any of the societies with the understanding that if I did not like it, I could return to my present, married life with my family ? ' We would be far from advising any such proceeding. Shakerism is ruinous to marital felicities; and you could not return to former, fleshly indulgences and selfish aggrandizements with the same satisfaction, after tasting Shakerism, as before. Regrets that you ever heard of Shakerism would ensue, if you should return to the habits of your worldly life ; or remorseful reflections would follow, that you had recanted a better way of living. You have heard of ' the sow that was washed, returning to her wallowing in the mire' — this means the return of a woman from Shakerism to her worldly life ; and ' the dog that returned to his vomit' — this would mean you, returning to eat again what you had thrown out of your spiritual stomach as hurtful to you as a Christian. See? 11. ' What social permissions are granted the sexes among the Shakers ? Do or do not the rules of the societies create a disrespect and coldness, the one toward the other?' Our founder, Ann Lee, was a woman of great affection and love toward both males and females. Discerning that 'poor man, while under temptations to the flesh is always in danger,' she carefully removed from the practice of her children aught that would arouse the semblance of passion. She demonstrated, as the Shakers now do, that there can be a warmer, purer affection manifested by the sexes toward each other as gospel brethren and sisters, subject to rules that forbid physical contact, than by the conjured worldly idea, that there can be no love without sexual embraces of some kind. This love gets cold. Shaker love ' never grows old ' nor cold, ' but is new every day.'
