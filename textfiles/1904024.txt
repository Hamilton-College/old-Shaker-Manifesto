As disciples of our divine Teacher we must learn of him, and our obedience to his word and work will determine the blessing that will crown our efforts in righteousness. Jesus tells us that 'We must work the works of Him that sent me, [Christ] while it is day ; the night cometh when no man can work.' This is and ever will be an admonition to all who may accept any form of missionary duty for the elevation of the human race. We have abundant evidence of the fruitlessness of those who are lukewarm and of those who are engaged in personal selfishness, and we no less have living witnesses of the growth of righteousness in those who consecrate soul and body to God and to the prosperity of the gospel cause. Jesus in the giving of this incentive to duty could readily foresee the necessity of an active service. It was given to those who were or who would be his disciples. This was an imperative lesson, 'We must work the works of Him that sent me.' It was to preach the kingdom of God and its righteousness. Nothing else could take the place of this heavenly mission. This gospel testimony must be preached in the light, it must be received in the light, and it must be lived in the light. It can have no fellowship with any of the works of darkness. The age, the condition of society, and in fact, everything demanded that the mission of Christ should be placed, immediately, before the people, that they need not have this mournful excuse. 'The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.' He knew so well the natural inclination of man to procrastinate, that he proffered this stimulus in the name of the Savior. In the world of labor, it may generally be expected that those who do not work, who fail to become actively industrious will not be expected to prosper in their temporal interests and the same is equally true when applied to that which is spiritual. The parable of the man who gave all he possessed to purchase a field in which he was well assured that he should find a pearl of great price, is a beautiful illustration of a Christian worker. He gave all he possessed for the privilege to work in the field, through hope of obtaining that beautiful treasure. This story seems to close quite differently from the one that was told of the man who concluded to give only a part of his possessions to the Lord, and to reserve the remainder for a rainy day. He evidently had the foresight of a modern Christian and no doubt, saved his house and some land, but spiritually he was a failure. He neglected to work honestly during his day of salvation. We seem to have good and able witnesses who are ready to testify to the blessings that are found in the path of earnest work for righteousness and who do not hesitate to warn us of the danger of neglecting to improve the advantages that are placed before us. It is in the revelation of truth which has been given to man, leading him on in paths of righteousness, that we are enabled to know something of God and of his divine goodness. This, at once, adapts itself to our finite understanding and takes away all mystery. It tells us that 'As many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God,' and that those who accept the wisdom that is from above, are pure and peaceable. In the W. C. T. U. N. C. held at Nashville, Term., the prayer was addressed to�Our Mother�God. Why not? We have long been accustomed to say, 'Our Father who art in heaven,' and why not equally as consistent to say, 'Our Mother who art in heaven.' Can the fullness of manhood exist where the qualities of motherhood are rejected? Does not the term Father, imply with equal force to that of Mother? or how can we speak of the Son? This form of prayer leads one of the Churchal brethren to manifest his ! wisdom and he calls it, 'either presumption or blasphemy.' Perhaps he could see blasphemy in this much easier than he could in the sensational prayer of his own order, that was made recently, in the New York Senate, and for which the Rev.- - - - - -was called in question. That the overshadowing infinite power is just the same now that it ever has been, there is not the least doubt, and that it is now the incomprehensible to us poor, finite creatures, as it ever has been, is equally true. Those men or those churches who have assumed to make out an order of Deity, and then demand others to believe, would have done more credit to themselves if they had consulted, for a few moments, the Book of Job. 'Canst thou by searching find out God ? Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection ? ' This same worldly wise man informs us that ' God and Jesus and the Holy Ghost, each takes to himself the masculine gender.' A masculine Deity, indeed! but in all probability just suited to those who formed it. He fails, however, to afford us any proof of his statement either in or out of the Bible, and we may, as heretofore, continue to address our prayers to 'Our Father and Mother�God. Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Give us day by day our needful bread. And forgive us our sins ; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. Leave us not in temptation.' Amen.
