RESPECT AND VENERATION DUE FROM YOUTH TO AGE. NO 2. WILLIAM LEONARD. I do not remember of ever suffering the least harshness or unkind treatment from one of these men, nor of ever giving one of them an impertinent word, though I lived with divers of them for several years. This habitual feeling of respect has continued with me thus far through life, and although I am now over seventy years of age, I retain quite a portion of my young feeling of giving precedence to persons much younge-r than myself. This habit of feeliug and acting has been of gveat advantage through life ; it has made the path of obedience and compliance to the feelings of superiors easy, and I may say natural, though to some it seems hard and unnatural. It has enabled me to live in peace, and gain the good-will of all the variety of persons and characters with whom it has been my lot to associate, so that I do not remember an instance for over fifty years in which there have been difficulties and hard feelings existing between myself and others. I am aware that youth sometimes labor under peculiar disadvantages. They live and work with all gradations of age, from youngest of themselves to the most aged, and it is difficult to define the starting point where this feeling of respect should begin. Add to this that there are always some of adult age, and even some that are aged, who expose their weakness to such a degree as almost to cancel their claim to respect. Although these are serious disadvantages, they are not without remedy. Generous minded youth, as a first step and incentive to action, will urge themselves deeply to consider and appreciate the great moral worth of character, which the genuine principle of Christian love, and consequent politeness and true benevolence, gives to all who possess them. This pure prin- ciple is the only sure fountain from which this respectful feeling of which we are speaking can uniformly now. In order, then, to acquire this heavenly principle, we must exercise it, practice it, must give it scope in actionï¿½must cultivate it whenever an opportunity offers. Bather than fail of attaining it, we had better bestow our kind and loving feelings on our yom.ger companions, and train ourselves to treat every one, young and old, with due refinement, respect and kindness, let their treatment to iis be what it may. If this is practiced toward the younger, it will be surely easy to bestow it on those more advanced in years. We have thus found a remedy for the first named disadvantage. The same principle would, Ithink, be also found a sufficient remedy for the second ; but we will add an additional consideration, which will help us wholly out of the difficulty. All the weakness, unworthiness and coarseness of manners which we are displeased with in older persons, are the result of their not having acquired the true principle and practice of politeness in their youth, and we shall be just like them unless we succeed in gaining that principle. This we cannot do if we imitate their manners, and and treat them as they treat us and others. The only use we can make oi their imperfections is to let them stand as a beacon to warn us of our danger, and induce us to ply every means to escape their sad condition. We must not adopt the practice o: being polite to those who are polite to us, and rude to those who are rude This would show decidedly that we have no principle of goodness or politeness o our own, or in ourselves, but that our actions depend wholly on those of other people. As we cannot admit a man to je just because he deals fairly with some people while he cheats others, so leither can a man be polite who treats some respectfully and others rudely. If youth have to associate with older persons who through their weakness and disagreeable qualities forfeit respect, still will it not be best to treat them with respect for the sake of the principle? Will not this be quite as effectual in disciplining and refining the manners and spirits of young people, as if the object were more worthy? Undoubtedly it will, and much more so, as it will be a victory and triumph over greater obstacles. Respectful manners, or politeness, comes under the same law as that of love, of which our Savior says, 'If ye love them only which love you, what thank have you ? Do not even the publicans so?' And we may as justly say, '' If you are polite to those who are polite to you, What thank have you?' This but places you on the very level of uncultivated nature, without the least refinement of manners, since the very savages will do the same ! But by the practice and attainment of showing kindness and respect to all, regardless of their conduct to us, we are brought up to the threshold of a still higher and more Godlike principle, namely, to ' love and do good to our enemies!' This our holy religion requires ; but if we cannot love and be kind to our aged friends because they have some faults, how can we love, pray for, and be kind to our enemies, who are seeking to do us injury? But if we gain and practice the former, we shall have made a near approach to the latter. As we cannot love and do good to our enemies merely because they have evil dispositions and are injurious to us, we place our actions on a higher principle, we will love and bless them because Christ requires it, and for the sake of imitating the Divine Benevolence, who sends the bounties of his rain and sunshine on the bad and unthankful; we can love them with a love of pity and compassion, knowing how unhappy they are, and must continue to be, while under the influence of hatred. On more rational grounds we can descend so low as to love them for our own sakes, in order to put ourselves as far as possible from their deplorable condition, i. e., full of hatred. We will call nothing love that does not manifest itself in deeds of kindness. So reflect on two human beings, one of whom is constantly using every opportunity of abusing and ill-treating the other, while this other is as constantly improving every chance to show kindness in return, is making a contrast of character which it is hard to find language to express. Every rational being, however, will at once decide which is infinitely the more excellent of the two, and would of course prefer the possession of the good and Godlike character and disposition, rather than of the bad one. There are, however, few, if any human beings, so debased that they cannot be overcome with kindness ; and how noble and Godlike is such a deed ! I remember to have read an account of a very depraved convict which will illustrate this. The said convict had been several times confined in the penitentiary, and had several times broken out, and was considered very dangerous and unmanageable. At length he was put in the Massachusetts penitentiary, whose keeper was noted for his ability to manage depraved cases. The convict had not been long confined before he attempted to break out, and being discovered, got badly wounded by the guard in preventing his escape. The keeper called the physician, and took great pains to have the wounds well dressed, and with great kindness had the convict conveyed to his cell, and everything done necessary to make him comfortable. This was in the evening. Near midnight the keeper arose and went to the convict's cell and examined his wounds, and kindly inquired how he felt; told him, he had felt so uneasy about his sufferings that he could not sleep, and thought perhaps he could do something to alleviate his pain. He gave him good cool water to drink and redressed his wounds. This was too much even for this hardened convict. He burst into tears and wept, saying, 'Sir, everybody has for years treated me as a beast, but you treat me as a man. I regret trying to break out and giving you so much trouble, and I now promise to make no more such attempts. ' He was as good as his word, and under the influence of that kind keeper he left the penitentiary a reformed man. I would rather be the author of such a deed than possess all earthly wealth. To attain to such sublime heights of excellence, we must begin early in youth to train ourselves to kind actions ; and the very lowest beginning point in this work is to treat our equals with fairness and justice, and our superiors in age with good manners and due respect. We must, if we expect to succeed, set out in earnest in this matter. We must have no condition, but resolve, let others do as they will to us, we will treat them, 1st, Politely ; 2d, Kindly ; 3d, Lovingly ; and so persevere till we arrive at the sublime height of pure Christian love !
