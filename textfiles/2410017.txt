'The summer is past.' After a few hot days and all is over. Possibly summer has been all that it could be in central New Hamphire, and has wrought out for the farmer and the summer tourist, a wonderful salvation in big crops or may be in rural pleasure. Well, it has brought more, much more than this, and we are rejoicing as did the prophet when he was the recipient of pleasant manifestations from kindred souls, 'Beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who bring glad tidings.' Messengers of this order are with us to-day and they bear to us blessings of the gospel of peace from dear friends in the states of Ohio and Kentucky. Coming as they do on a journey of a thousand miles, and from the beautiful and fertile fields of the west, they must witness a great contrast on reaching the farms of New England which are so hard to cultivate, aud so liberally covered with permanent and movable bowlders. It is with the most rigid economy that we are able to move on from year to year, and yet as the old farmer said in illustrating the fertility of his patch,'We have some pumpkins.' Well, on the cutting of our corn field, of a few acres, we discovered some pumpkins which have developed to an honorable size and may be reckoned by the hundreds. Pumpkin pies belong to an earlier generation and have given place to the finer qualities of the squash. We are now commencing our first experience with the silo, and have just finished one llxll^o and 32 ft. deep. Its estimated capacity is 101 tons. We planted five acres of Sanford sweet corn, some of which reached eleven feet, and after stiipping off the ripened ears, the stalks were cut for the silo. The pieces were about two inches long. After being filled it settled several feet, but the ensilage on the five acre lot will be all that can be forced into the silo. We shall now wait future developments and see what may be the advantages of this new article of food for milch cows and other stock. A tower has just been wised' to the height of thirty feet upon which has been placed a wind mill, to be used in forcing water from a well into a tank in the attic of a house of three stories. II. C.
