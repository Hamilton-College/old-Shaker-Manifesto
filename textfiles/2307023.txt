Enfield, N. H. North Family. June, 1893. During the past month we have parted with two worthy Sisters,ï¿½Eldiess Ann Cummings and Agnes Parker. They return to their former home in the Church family. We also welcome Sisters, Marinda Iveniston and Nellie Hamlin. in contemplation of the consecration of such noble, devoted souls, one can but contrast the grand difference between those characters which ennoble all those within the radius of their influence, and that other class of beings which may well be likened to human cobwebs. We end this subject by quoting the Shaker text, 'God bless our Sisters.' A long felt want is being supplied in our Dwelling house in the arranging of two toilet rooms. Br. George Kirkley of the Church family is doing the work, and as we realize our young Brother's many capabilities in doing good, we breathe a prayer for his continuous prosperity. In communistic life where mingle various temperaments and grades of mind, there naturally flourishes varied graces and abilities; and as recognition of the good, manifested by those around us helps to mature inherited or acquired talent, let us be ever zealous to give our aid in the best manner calculated to stimulate one another to continue doing good and utilize the talents which beautify and honor our Zion home. Cheese making has become a summer industry. Eecently, we had an order for three hundred pounds of maple sugar. And thus with 'hands at work, and heart to God,' we receive the blessing of prosperity. George H. Baxter.
