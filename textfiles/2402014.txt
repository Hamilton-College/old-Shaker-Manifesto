REGENERATE LIFE, No. 2. By E. P. Sevester. A SOUL indulging his lower, carnal, selfish nature, his higher, spiritual nature dies within him; he dies to all nobler, finer feelings, having no aspirations to live above the lower plane of life. Although he lives, yet he is dead, a spiritual death far more to be dreaded than the physical death. 'The soul that sinneth, it shall die;' this does not refer to the physical death, because Adam lived more than nine hundred years after the transgression. The most glorious truths, Mother Ann Lee advanced more than one hundred years ago, and which were wholly unknown to the people at that time, now prominent men advance; teacn these very same truths, and they are believed in by thousands. Mother Ann's prophecy is now in process of fulfillment. She said, 'The time will come when this Gospel will be preached to all nations and they will come as doves to your windows to hear the word of the Lord.' Do we not see this occurring in this, our day? Mankind are gradually leaving their low, sensual, lost condition and growing into better, higher, more spiritual conditions; living purer and nobler lives. God is preparing his people to serve Him. We live in a most remarkable time; a flood of spiritual light is poured out over all nations of the earth. 'Watchman, what of the night,' the night of spiritual darkness ? The blessed dawn is breaking; soon the glorious day of truth and righteousness will appear. Oh, may we be ready to receive souls and administer unto them the word of God. Can we in the spirit of Christ administer the bread and water of Life to those who call upon the name of the Lord ? Or leave we them hungering and thirsting with but husks to feed upon ? Oh the winning of souls unto God! How important our mission. Let us be awake to the necessities of our day, having fitted ourselves to be messengers of peace to the sin sick and wandering.
