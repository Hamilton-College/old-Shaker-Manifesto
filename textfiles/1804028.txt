NURSING RESENTMENT. Most of them would die of themselves but for careful nursing. Many resentments are really without cause. Some arise from simple misunderstandings; many more, so far as we have observed, from wounded vanity. And there is nothing so easily wounded. The egotist is easily hurt. His harness has only 'joints, ' and they are all open. A random arrow can't miss him. A presiding elder, friend of ours, lost the friendship of a country brother whom he esteemed, and years afterwards found out the cause. It seems that the brother saw the presiding elder in the crowded street of a city one day, and bowed to him. But the presiding elder�a little near-sighted withal�did not see him, and so did not return the brother's salutation. The brother never forgave him for what he took as an affront. Moreover, he nursed his resentment and told the story of his wrongs, till at last he concluded that the presiding elder had done him a real injury. He would hear him preach no more. Eesentments do not need nursing; it is better to nurse vipers, for they will only sting the bosom that warms them into life. Resentments nursed will sting the heart that nourishes them. Many a man has embittered his whole life and set a neighborhood by the ears, because he fancied that somebody had slighted him. It seems, to use the mildest word the case allows, excessively foolish. One must think his life of vast con sequence to spend his life nursing little viperlings in the shape of resentments. One other thing should be said�it is very wicked. It is not the spirit of Christ, nor does it lead to Christ. What a waste of time and feeling it involves if there were no greater evils in this foolish weakness! Charlotte Bronte says on this subject, quite conclusively: 'Life appears too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. ' Selected.
