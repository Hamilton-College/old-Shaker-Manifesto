How to Manage and Feed Working Oxen In managing working oxen let the law of kindness be strictly obeyed. Never use the whip except from necessity. When I about to strike the awkward young steer or full-grown ox, ask yourself, ' Will he know what I am striking him for? ' Let each ox have a name, and be sure he knows it. Never speak a word to an ox without meaning; lave a particular word to start the team with, hat all may pull together. Never hurry the :eam while riding behind them, lest they earn to pull apart. Oxen should be shod with a broad shoe to travel on hard roads; :he shoe on the fore foot should be set back at the heel nearly half an inch further than ;he hoof bears upon it. Oxen are frequently amed by short shoes. The best feed for oxen at hard work is to give to each two quarts of meal, wet, mixed with good chopped hay, three times a day, and as much hay as he will eat.
