GENTLE MANNERS. Henry C. Blinn. In the cultivation that is wrought upon the mind, a tender regard should be manifested for its growth into the beauty of holiness. Manners should be more than a formal system of external rules ; they should be the representation of life itself, pure, peaceable and full of good works. To reach this state of pleasant anticipation the sons and daughters of God must be the subjects of constant discipline, and these lessons of care and loving kindness should make their first impressions upon the lives of the children and youth. This interest in ;m education which is calculated to reach, in some degree, every quality of mind, from infancy to old age, and at the same time enhances the peace and satisfaction of our own lives, is accepted with pleasure aud affords us the privilege of walking with the children, and then with them passing on to more advanced age. Gentle manners which are so essential to our happiness in this life, cannot be too cautiously guarded. Experience has taught us that the care and cultivation expended upon those who are young often becomes to them an essential glory at a future date. It is very true that many of the ettrly impressions, either for good or ill are permanently traced upon the young and delicate mind, and it not unfrequently happens that aged persons will make reference to that which transpired in the days of their childhood, while events of more recent date are not retained in the memory. Some teachers have aptly illustrated this by comparing the mind, in its first years, to those substances that in their plastic state are so susceptible of impressions that time fails to blot them out or to wear them away. We are fully persuaded that while gentle manners aid in forming the crowning glory of the youthful mind, beautifying as they do the language, and the general deportment, they will at the same time keep pace with the growth of intelligence and pleasantly bear us company through all the varied changes of our earthly pilgrimage. In the acceptance of this treasure we have something that never grows old, and never comes as an unwelcome guest. It introduces peace into the cottages of the poor and righteousness into the homes of the wealthy. Neither the heat of summer nor the cold of winter can have any influence upon this beautiful and coveted gift. Lytton has said :�'What a rare gift is that of manners ! Better for one to possess them than wealth,, beauty or talents ; they will more than supply all.' The cultivation of gentle manners forms an excellent foundation upon which to build for future usefulness. They are the first lessons that lead to an honorable or Christian life, and cannot be neglected without great loss, any more than truthfulness or honesty can be neglected in the formation of a good character. Even in the humble walks of life an agreeable address and a manifestation of the ordinary forms of civility do not fail to produce a good effect, and certainly a still more careful cultivation of the rules that belong to well ordered society must have a corresponding influence for peace. The youthful mind susceptible as it is to the multiplied presentations, often manifests a singularly checkered experience. We sometimes find in those who have strong inhereut tendencies to conscientiousness many deviations from a straight course ; a singular combination of the good and evil influences of society ; often accepting coarse and vulgar expressions instead of using chaste and correct language. This state of the mind presents nothing more than its normal or natural inclinations. Like the neglected garden it soon becomes the fruitful soil for the growth, of weeds, and often for plants that are actually poisonous. More devoted to his duty should be the guardian of the growing, active mind, which in scriptural language, becomes the living soul, to eradicate this coarse and improper outgrowth, than is the faithful laborer in the earthly garden who works diligently for the preservation of his tender plants. lie protects the good while those in which he has no especial interest he destroys. Whatever success is accomplished in the cultivation of gentle manners or in the acceptance of moral principles, must be largely through the manifestation of the love of God. Guardians who have a wish to develop the best qualities of the mind must hold in loving remembrance the words of wisdom spoken by the beloved apostle:�'Whatsoever a man soweth that also shall he reap.'
