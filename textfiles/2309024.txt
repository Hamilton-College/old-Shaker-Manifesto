Sabbathday Lake. Aug. 1803. We are having very warm days with little or no rain. The water supply is becoming short The reservoir for the Laundry is dry and we must resort to the oldfashioned way of pumping for our washing next week. We have enjoyed a refreshing visit with our Canterbury Sisters, Emeline Hart and Bertha Mansfield. They kindly gave us two or three days from a business journey and one of those days was the Sabbath. We united in worship; in the freedom of the Spirit and in the songs of Zion. All were especially glad to meet Sister Emeline as she is one for whom we gained great love in former days when her home was with us, and now our dear Sister Bertha will always be lovingly remembered after enjoying this extra privilege with her. Our barns are filled with hay and the cattle and horses will have an abundant supply for another winter. With these few lines we send our best love to all our Gospel friends both far and near. Ada S. Cummings.
