Parsees 'As a race, the Parsees are intelligent, active and energetic ; with business capacities far above the average, they are usually successful in amassing wealth, while they are extremly benevolent in dispensing their gains for both public and private charities. For private benefaction they have, however, but little call among themselves, since a Parsee pauper would be an unheard-of anomaly. They burn upon their sacred altars fire which they brought from Persia, and which has never been extinguished since it was kindled by Zoroaster from the sun 4000 years ago. They think it can never go out till it has consumed all evil from the earth and the good has become universally triumphant. * * * Memory fails to recall the case of a single fire worshipper who was not strictly upright in his dealings. * * * Commencing with the worship of the sun and of fire as his emblem, the Parsee grew into a sort of reverence for the elements of air, earth and water. The air must not be contaminated by foul odors, and of necessity no filth could be tolerated anywhere, in houses, street or suburb, and to this reverence for the purity of the atmosphere may be traced the absolute cleanliness for which fire worshippers are everywhere noted.'
