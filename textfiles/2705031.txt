The Book of Daniel in the Light of the Higher Criticism The Book of Daniel in the Light of the Higher Criticism; by I. D. Steele. The object of the author of this little pamphlet, aided by the timely Notes of Br. H. L. Hastings, is to prove that the Prophet Daniel and the Book of Daniel are just what they purport to be. True to the man, and true to his writings. Sometimes the Higher Criticism makes sad havoc with the prophets anil apostles, an 'I ii they had it all their own way they would soon make the Hible smaller than a pocket testament. It is a good thing to see men zealously defending what they eonseien tiously believe to be right. One of the writers makes this remark, 'Everything concerning the world's so-called snere.l writings, is a proper subj' et for investigation. Their origin, authorship, date, claims, teachings and histo' ry, all must pass in review, and if we have been misled or mistaken in any of these particulars, we must revise our conclusions in the light of establisht facts.' This is J.ind ami considerate and the skeptical mind must so accept it. I'ublisht by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Bcston, Mass.
