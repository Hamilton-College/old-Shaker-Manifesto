LOST BIRTHRIGHT If ten thousand years were due me, And I held the globe at cost, What, pray what, would all avail me, If by it my soul were lost ? Said the Lord, the great Exemplar, Not a night shall pass from here, Till the soul, whose life is endless, Will be in another sphere. Sold ye fast your claim —your birthright — To a life in endless bliss; All this world, with all its treasures, Cannot be compared to this. Should I misimprove my calling, Waste my summer-time in sin, Where, or when, or how, 0 tell me, Can I get my time again ? Who will run and overtake it, Chain and bring it back to me ? Place me in the same surroundings Just as all were wont to be 1 I've refused the good Physician, Scorn'd the balm she oifer'd me, Set at nought her kindly counsel, Till I'm left to sink, you see. All my light has turn'd to darkness, All my comrades gone on by, I am left alone to perish ; But, alas ! I cannot die. All the past comes up before me, All my work to do again! None to help me, none to pity ! None to cure or share my pain! Though I cry with heartfelt sorrow, Howl in bitterness of soul, None to hear me ! dread dilemma! No companionship in hell! G. R.
