Here is religion. Mysterious is a wornn's way. Several weeks ago, a lady, with bright face and pleasing manner, elegantly ressed, arrived in Columbus, O., and after breakfasting at a hotel, went to a station louse to apply for a lodging. She was given cell on the first floor, with the privilege of the prison, and she immediately began to brighten the lives of the poor prisoners. She made a decisive onslaught on the cockroaches and on the bed-bugs by scrubbing her cell again and again. When the wood work was as neat as soap and water could make it, she hung some pictures on the walls, and every day she has a bouquet of fresh flowers. She has books in her cell, and sometimes she takes a short walk, but whenever there is anything' to be done for any prisoner, she is ready to do it. When a drunken woman is brought in and laid on the floor, the strange lady busies herself during the night in bathing the poor creature's head, rubbing her hands and feet, and bringing her to her better self. The expense to the city of keeping this ministering angel in its prison fs not great: She lives on bread and water.
