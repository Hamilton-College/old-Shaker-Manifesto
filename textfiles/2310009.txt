PARABLES. Martha J. Andekson. 'On, sacred soil his sandals pressed, Sweet fountains of his noonday rest, Oh, light and air of Palestine, Impregnate with his life divine I' A common mode of instruction in the Orient was by parables, proverbs and allegories. All Asiatic nations held this method in high esteem. Truth couched in comparison or similitude seemed to reach the understanding and arrest the attention of the hearers more readily than when given directly to the point; and when the meaning was too obscure, it provoked a spirit of inquiry or explanation, w Inch served to fix the idea it was intended to convey. With the ancients, a parable or proverb formed the principal illustrative point in the discourse. Sometimes the parable took the form of allegory and again of fable. This method of teaching is prominent in the ministry of Jesus. 'And he spake not to them without a parable.' In his expansive view there was a near kinship between the natural and spiritual, and his words had a twofold meaning as had the Jewish Law; to the enlightened there was an interior germ of truth not perceived nor appreciated by the plebeian mind, which, occupied solely with material things, received but a vague understanding of his words; and yet, only language borrowed from the outward visible world, served to meet their condition. Under the clear sky of Syria, beside the sea, on the hillside, and by the fountain where he fain would take his noonday rest, multitudes flocked from the 234 THE MANIFESTO. neighboring towns and villages to hear the gentle Nazarene. Through the wonderful miracles performed in the region round about Jordan, his fame had spread throughout all Jewry, and even to the cities of Samaria; and though the proud Pharisee and learned Scribe denied his heaven-ordained mission, the common people heard him gladly, because his was a gospel of divine love and faith in humanity: the key-note to universal brotherhood. He had taught in their synagogues, and in the temple at Jerusalem without a parable, but his direct teaching was met with scorn, hardness and unbelief. He was wearied with carping about doctrine with the learned doctors of the Law; he had no love for theology, but longed to reach the souls of men and women with the truth he had received from heaven ; to show them the better way, and to lift them up to higher planes of thought and action. 'All outward symbols disappear To him whose inward sight is clear.' The blessed Master saw the tokens of his Heavenly Father's beneficence on pastoral hill and vale, where the quiet flocks grazed, and the honest husbandmen went forth to sow the seed of fruit and cereal; where the earth teemed with green herbage and lovely flowers and the noble forests lifted their verdant fronds in the pure, sweet air ' of Palestine, which seemed infilled with the life and light of a new dispensation which was about to dawn upon the world. 'Bent on his Father's mission !' How wrapt the reverie, as with sandaled feet he walked the green fields, contemplating the utter folly of human life, when material blessings alone were sought; and as his flowing garments brushed the dew-moistened lilies, they bowed their heads and dropped a tear of sympathy, then lifted their sweet faces only to meet his thought, for they had suggested to his mind a suitable theme for discourse. Ever uppermost in all the Savior's teaching is the grand ideal he cherished : the establishment of the kingdom of God upon earth, wherein would be actualized all that was lofty and noble ; the unfoldment of the hidden possibilities of redeemed and regenerate humanity; but, like all great reformers, he lived only to see the seed of that kingdom spring up in a few hearts whom he had imbued with the spirit and life of his soul-elevating testimony. Even those who were the direct recipients of his ministration failed to understand the import of his words; they were dark sayings to the chosen twelve, for when they were alone with him, they asked him to declare unto them the parable of the tares, and inquired of him why he spoke in this indirect manner to the people, and he answered them thus. 'Because it is given unto you to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not, for their heart is waxed gross, and their senses are dull of understanding.' Nor as yet are mankind able to receive the full measure of the truth. Sensuality beclouds the mind and bars the soul's receptivity to spiritual influx. How beautifully the good poet expresses it. 'Lord what is man whose thought at times Up to Thy seven-fold brightness climbs, While still his grosser instinct clings THE MANIFESTO. 235 To earth like other creeping things? So rich in words, in acts so mean, So high, so low, chance�swung between The foulness of the penal pit, And truth's clear sky Millennium�lit!' After eighteen centuries of manipulation and distortion to 'make all things to all men' as Paul expresses it or excuses his digression from Christ's teachings pure and simple, we see a grandeur in, and feel the power of those principles laid down by the great Captain and Pattern of our salvation, designed to disenthrall humanity from the baser selfhood of the two-fold being, and in our souls we feel the expanding, developing and uplifting influence of the Christ inspiration, the holy anointing which made Jesus the Son of God. Under this divine illumination we scale the mount of beatific vision, and behold the day-dawn of the golden prophecy when truth shall rule the world. The grand evolution of the race is on the upward scale, and the climax of the centuries' throes will be the new-born child of immortal virtue, whose garments will know no stain, and whose life will be the love universal of the Dual Christ, replete with the perfection of Wisdom and Love.
