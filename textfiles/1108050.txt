WASTE OF MANURE It should be a cardinal principle with every farmer to economize his manure. Upon it depends his success, and without it his labors must, to a very great extent, be without profit if not attended with absolute loss. If it is necessary to have the barnyard on a hillside it is equally necessary to have the lower side of it protected by a wall or some other arrangement by which the escape of liquid manure may be prevented. It is almost equally important to have a spout to convey rain water from the roof of the barn in some other direction than immediately through the barnyard. It is bad enough that the manure heap should be exposed to the rains which fall directly upon it, without adding to it the droppings from the roof of the barn. If such improvident farmers were to behold the actual value of the fertilizing material thus lost, rolling from their purses in the shape of dollars and cents, how energetically would they labor to prevent this waste. The loss of a single little gold dollar would stir them up to a greater activity than the direct waste of a hundred times that little gold dollar's value in the form of liquid manure. Year after year, silently the golden streams are flowing from their purses. Tell them of their ; error and they acknowledge it, but rarely does it happen, that being reminded of it in a friendly manner, they make a single effort to correct it. How many are there who, after a life-time of steady unremitting toil, find themselves no richer in lands aud money than when they began. They cannot explain the reason. Other causes may have led to such discouraging results, but if the drain of liquid manures from the barnyards had been checked when they began farming, very many of these unsuceessf ul ones would have been as prosperous as their more provident neighbors.â€” Western Rural.
