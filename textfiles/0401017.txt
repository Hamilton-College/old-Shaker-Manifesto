Dear Eldress Antoinette We would say a word to you concerning the ' SJmker and ShaJceress.' It is a blessing to the woz-ld, and we want it continued ; for it is among the brightest stars that ever shone in the New Heavens, or lighted the New Earth May no dark cloud ever obscure its brilliancy or dim its lustre! Though it was small in its beginning, yet it has thrown great light upon inquiring minds. Believers need it, to guide their feet up the high hills of Truth, and through the greei fields of progression. When the toils of the day are over, we can look upon its pages and find inspiring thoughts and glorious hopes, and are lifted in spirit above the perishable things of time, and feel joy anc rest. It is a comforting Angel! Gospel Truth s written upon its wings of snowy whiteness. '.t is like a beautiful banner of purity waving n the soft breezes of love, which blow from ;he summer land, which lies just beyond. It nust not, shall not fade away ! I send a few thoughts upon ' Woman ;' and if you think proper, please give it a little corner in the ' Shakeress.' Eldress Mary A. Gillespie, Alfred, Me.
