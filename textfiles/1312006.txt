NEWNESS OF LIFE. AGNES E. NEWTON. The mission of Chi'ist was the fulfillment of the beautiful prophecy of Isaiah : 'For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth ; and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind.' Isa. xlv., 17. Paul boldly affirmed, 'Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.' 2 Cor. v., 17. 'The outward fulfilling of the law availed nothing.' Gal. vi., 15. Throughout the Bible we find many references to a day when all things should be formed anew. Jesus testified, 'Behold I make all things new.' Rev. xxi., 5. Again, 'A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another.' Johnxiii., 34. Paul very frequently enjoined upon the would-be-followers of Christ, the necessity of obtaining newness of life. We find him at one time exhorting the Brethren to, 'Purge out therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new lamp, as ye are unleavened.' 1 Cor. v., 7. The redeemed were to sing a new song, and have a new name written in their foreheads. To attain to tin's newness we must forsake the old way, nor continue in sin, even though grace abound, for an exceeding righteousness and purity of life in the new birth should much more abound. Can one whose life is hid with Christ, having become, as the text avers, a new creature, continue in trespasses and sins ? How fraught with meaning the following injunction ; 'Like as Christ was raised from the dead, (dead works,) by the glory of the father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.' Rom, vi., 4. They who would follow Christ, need to arise in the power of the Holy Spirit and put Christ fully on ; living as He lived, thus becoming members of his Church, which is, as the apostle declared 'Without spot or blemish or wrinkle or any such thing.' The prayer of the Christian should hourly be : 'Teach me duty, teach me beauty In the new and living way ; To the surest and the purest I would give my life away.' Canterbury, N. H.
