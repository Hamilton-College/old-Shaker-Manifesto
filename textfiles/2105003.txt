MEDITATIONS. Oliver C. Hampton. 'I and my Father are one.' Jno. x., 30. Consider, O Soul, thy individual nothingness. What thou gloriest in, and callest by the several names of individuality, personality, identity and ego, are only softer names for pure selfishness; separateness from God. Let me look solemnly into this matter of At-one-ment, so boldly asserted by my Savior, Jesus Christ. If Jesus and the Father were, and are one, then I and my Father ought also to be one. Because Jesus prays that 'they all may be one, (meaning his disciples) as Thou, Father, art in me, and I in Thee; that they also may be one in us. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.'ï¿½Jno. xvi., 21, 22. Verily, here is a theme of mighty magnitude. When I have put off, ignored, and once for all, absolutely and irrevocably abjured my little egotistic self, I am utterly stripped of all consolation from a selfish source ; then it is that I am forced to calmly sink into the 'divine inmost' of my being, shunning all resources of outward comfort and selfish satisfaction or excitement. Down in the indescribable recesses of my being, I reach a point where I am not apparently, but actually, merged into the infinite possibilities of the Infinite God. Here, having laid down my selfish life, I take it up into the infinite, eternal life of God. What is left of me, has become 'the Word, and the Word is with God and the Word is God ; the same which was in the beginning with God.' Here the plenitude of power and energy is mine to possess; not at all for my own aggrandizement, gratification or glory, but for the good and assistance of others for all time and all eternity. In that state I know the spirit is able to say, not only to that sycamine tree, but to every disease of body or soul, ' 'Be thou plucked up and cast into the sea' of negations and they shall obey. The source of Divine Love (God) is to be discovered in the deep, soundless silence of private meditation and retirement from all outward objects, and utter, passive surrender of one's self to the higher affinities of the Universal, the serene depths of the All-Good. But this discovery is only the incipient step of the initial process to the possession of the same. After this sublime discovery comes the solemn ordeal of preparation for its enjoyment. My own will, which desires self-gratification, must be totally abandoned in all directions. My time, instead of being devoted to selfpleasing and emolument, must be devoted to the promotion of comfort and peace for others. My appetites and unworthy proclivities must all be left behind, and labors and interests of benevolence toward others, foes as well as friends, substituted in their place. My selfish interest in a salvation for myself and a few others, must give place to, and be merged in the salvation of all souls in all worlds. When this is accomplished, the everlasting assimilation to the Universal Good (God) will be found to have taken place. No sorrow, no fear, no pain nor agony, physical, mental or spiritual, disturbs the peace of that realm of Infinite Love. No impatience nor despair can disturb the calm waters of existence forever. 'When we see all that is carnal, All that men call good and great Sacrificed for tilings eternal. Matters of a better state; If lie's not a good Believer Who makes such a sacrifice, Then was Christ a grand deceiver, And the Scriptures, pointed lies.' Then the evil one shall come but shall find nothing in me whereof to create torment or unrest. Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be within me, and I shall need to go no more out to seek for a fugitive peace among the frivolities of Time, nor the rudimental pleasures of sensuous things. Be assured that all this unspeakable glory is attainable in this life ; even absolute immunity from sorrow, sickness or unrest; even eternal peace and content. Union Village, Ohio.
