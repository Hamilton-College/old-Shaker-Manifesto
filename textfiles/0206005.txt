Success to the Shaker. AN ACROSTIC â€”BT SARAH A. NEAL Sad though thy march, lovely pilgrim, toil on! Unaided by many, rejected by some; yet Continue thy course, fair Shaker sublime, Cease not to sow good, for now is seed time. Each virtue engraven upon thy fair face, Shall yet merit love from the whole human race. Speed on, (hen, forever, thou herald of truth, To the far distant nations of earth go ye forth. O ! halt not at trifles; climb the rough, rugged road To perfection's fair height, in the kingdom of God. Heaven opens in splendor, the day now doth dawn, Earth's joys are dispersing as dews of the morn. Soar aloft, then, O, Shaker ! and quicken thy speed, Henceforth be thy motto, to sow the good seed. Angel bands will attend thee, and give thee success; Kind friends read thy columns with great earnestness. Eternal the truths, on thy banner arrayed, Right shall yet rule the day, and cast wrong in the shade.
