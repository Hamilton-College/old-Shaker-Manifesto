NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Average of Weather at Mount Lebanon. June.. Thermometer. Rain. 1890. 66.10 2% in. 1891. 66.16 3)4 in. Geo. M. W. Center Family. July 12, 1891. Otjk farmers are deep into haying. Youth boys are picking cherries, of which we are having a plenty and to spare. Had new potatoes on the 4th and to-day. They seem a third larger, though still small and not more than half grown. Have two in- quirers here, who seem to be far advanced in spiritual perception, as to the fitness of our work to the present needs of the world. Mark M. Pomeroy and wife spent the Sabbath here, a few weeks since, and has given us a rosy description in his July Advance Thought. He seemed pleased with his visit and with the way we conduct matters and to rightly appreciate our place and work in the world. We view such as indicators of the world's advance in spiritual enlightenment, if no more. * The past month has been a very fruitful one. Strawberries have yielded very abundantly, and extra fine. Cherries are just splendid, and the boys are about tired of picking them. Gardens are looking exceedingly well and promise a plentiful harvest. We enjoyed a beautiful visit with our gospel friends from Enfield, N. H. Only one fault to find; there were no Brethren. They were the most prompt company I ever had the pleasure of waiting upon, always on hand at the appointed time in every instance. Am very sorry to learn we are to have no more visitors this season; perhaps they are being reserved for 1892. We have commenced haying, but oh! the weather; much better for setting out cabbages than for making hay. We have set up, ready for use a hay loader; big stories are told about it, we shall have a story to tell bye and bye. We also have a reaper and binder alreadj to put in the harvest field when the time comes. It costs a good deal to keep up with all the various improved machinery; but I rather think it would cost more to keep on in the old way. Life is a continual problem solved one day at a time. We can generally see afterward where we could have done better. Thanks for new music. In kindest love, D. O. Bk. Daniel's notes slipped off from the end of his pen and into the mail before we were aware he had written them. I thought we would give the account of the strawberry crop, which has been so bountiful this season. According to the size of the patch which yielded best, .we think there would have been over one hundred bushels to the acre; the berries were marvels as to size, and delicious in flavor, I think they are mostly of the Sharpless variety. Here is the aggregate account. Picked 37 bushels and 19 quarts. Preserved 55 gallons. Sold 7 bushels and 22 quarts. Gave away 2 bushels, and 26 quarts. Finished picking the eleventh. Desiring that our love and best wishes may be communicated to one and all of our gospel friends at Canterbury, I am as ever your gospel sister, M. J. A. Watervliet, N. Y. July 1891. Elder Henry :�I send a few notes from the north family. We are busily engaged at farming and the making of brooms. We commenced the cutting of hay the 27th of June. We are anticipating some fruit from the apples, pears, plums, peaches, quinces and grapes. Elder Nathaniel Fry, who is 88 years of age, has raised and picked five bushels of strawberries this season. Pretty good for one of that age. We have about an acre in raspberries, of the red, 'Cuthbert variety. We are all interested in the Manifesto as a medium of communication between the Societies'. The Home Notes are a good thing. J. L. Hancock, Mass. July 12, 1891. We have recently been blest with refreshing showers, but the weather is quite warm and the earth has become so parched that more rain is needed. Our farmers have commenced haying and find the grass crop lighter than that of last year. North Family. We have also been spiritually refreshed by the interchange of love, sweet association and intercommunion with those dear, true-hearted Zion travelers who recently visited here. Mav the reflections of their brief sojourn here, be as pleasing to them as it is to us beneficial. We notice that the death of our beloved Sister, Anna Pool, was not recorded in the July No. of Manifesto, owing doubtless to our negligence in sending it. The heavenly riches are hers. She has been a resident of our Society for fifty-five years, was a worthy Sister devoted to the cause in which she had enlisted, and was loved and respected by all who knew her. Our school having been in session for twelve weeks, closed on the 10th. inst. for a short vacation. The closing exercises were witnessed by several spectators and were alike creditable to teacher and pupils. Br. Ira who has been quite sick the past week, is, we hope and trust, recovering. J. L. S. Enfield, Conn. July 3, 1891. Jests said: 'Blessed are the merciful,' not blessed are the unkind, the cruel, the oppressive, but blessed are the beneficent, the compassionate, those who are kind and willing to forgive. This quality is one of God's characteristics. Those who possess it are like Him, in that respect. In Psalms cxxxvi., every verse ends witli the words, 'For his mercy endureth forever.' If all were merciful what a beautiful world this would be. Even the lower animals might feel that they were in paradise, for 'the merciful man is merciful to his beast.' Notice the last part of this blessing; 'for he shall obtain mercy.' This promise was given by one 'who spake as never man spake,' and he is able to fulfill it. May we grow in this divine characteristic, for our own good, and for the good of others. 50*75 spaces of cream were sold in June. A space of cream is simply a certain measurement of cream, about 34 inch, established by the Brattleboro Vt., Creamer Manufacturing Co., and recognized by buyers of cream in the northern and western part of New England as the standard quantity at a certain price. The former system of measuring cream was by inches, but there were fractional parts difficult to reckon. In the present system there are no fractions. Strawberries will yield a larger revenue from a given area than any other berry, though more labor must be given than raspberries or blackberries require. Small hens may be good layers, but small eggs by the dozen are not desirable. It is the state of mind of the poultry keeper that causes failure in poultry keeping, not the state of the market. Chicago Gluten meal for chickens is excellent. D. Orcutt. We are made aware of the flight of time by the arrival of our beloved little messenger the Manifesto, which we hail with pleasure, as we prize the soul-inspiring truth it contains. The Home Notes are cheering and edifying. The busy season is now approaching, haying has commenced, think it will prove two-thirds of an average crop. The rye field is also nearly ready to harvest and looks uncommonly good. Corn and potatoes looking well, although we have had a dry season thus far. The strawberries have surpassed our expectations, and yielded over 250 quarts; not half the amount of one year ago, on account of the drouth. We have a much larger bed set out this spring, of a better variety, from which we hope to realize something superior another season, but 'Paul may plant and Apollos water, but God giveth the increase.' The garden is bringing forth a good supply of early vegetables, and many are the blessings which surround us as time goes swiftly on and for these may we ever return heartfelt thanks. M. Witham. Harvard, Mass. Again our little messenger of glad tidings comes to us freighted with the choicest of inspiration. Each month we wait with patient feelings to hear from the dear ones in the different parts of our Zion home. Lessons of wisdom are written on every page, and as we glance over the words of truth and strong testimony we often find the initials of loved ones who have, hand in hand with us, fought the battles of life, and are now giving evidence of the blessed salvation they have found to the young and inexperienced, who are now stepping into the ranks and putting on the armor. Let us, Brethren and Sisters, give them all the courage we can, that they may have the true planting and be established in right principles. An aged brother once said to one caring for children:�'You must still love them with all their faults.' This, at times, may seem almost impossible, yet I believe it is the only redeeming quality of mankind. Without love life is scarcely worth living. With it the worst blows of fortune fall comparatively harmless. So long as we love and are beloved we can bear the whips and stings with stoical equanimity; but when love fails us or our beloved are taken from us, then we begin to feel as though our armor of defence was gone. This principle of love shone out brightly in the life of Ann Lee when establishing upon earth the everlasting gospel of salvation. Called to forward these principles to mankind at a time when the country was involved in the severe struggle for its liberty and rights of conscience, she was compelled to meet a class of minds whose whole theme was patriotism and love of freedom; and to meet these minds she found this God-given principle was stronger than the rifle or sword. Why should not this same spirit be as powerful to-day, in reaching the souls of poor humanity who are crying�Lord, what shall we do to be saved�and show them where salvation and a rest for their souls can be found? The three day's rain last week has done untold good. A7egetation has taken a new start and we are in hopes of saving part of our crops from early frosts. Haying has commenced, but the crop looks to be about two-thirds as large as last year's. On the 13th of June we were once more called to witness the departure for the spirit land a dear loved one, Sister Mahaleth Pratt. She has been one who has seen a long life in the work of self-denial and has proved its full benefits. She was a woman of strong faith and had the force of spirit to speak her faith under any and every condition. The pride and fancies of the natural mind never hindered her from living to her full convictions of spirit. A. D. B. Canterbury, N. H. July 9, 1891. The praying people of N. EL, who are trying to secure their hay crop, may with propriety ask for an extra share of patience. To have the rain pour down from day to day just as the hay is ready for the barn, involving an abundance of extra work and increased expense, is not quite so agreeable as one would like to have it. But then there is another side to this subject equally interesting to saints and sinners. All the small fruits are made better by a liberal supply of rain, and those who watch the vines and the bushes are anxious for rain while the hay-makers are sitting cross-legged, for good luck to come, in fair weather. Br. Watson Andrews of North Union, O. called on us the 19th of June. Seventythree years have already been recorded in his favor, and although quite feeble at present, he has our union in adding to his life, as many and even more years than King Hezekiah obtained in answer to his prayer. Br. Watson left us on the 8th. of July for K'o. Union, expecting to call, for a short visit, at Watervliet and Groveland. John Connelly, better known as Blind John, of the salvation army, made us a visit, while on his way home, to Campton, N. H. He entertained our family with some very interesting items in his experience as a Salvationist and although blind he has been an able and industrious worker for the army. With an Autoharp he played an accom- | paniment to his singing, which reminded | us of the meeting's of the Salvationists. The hour was one of pleasant satisfaction and profit. The garden which adds so much to our physical comfort during the summer and autumn is now a joy to the eyes, not only to the manager, Br. Arthur, but to all of his friends. One can almost hear those beautiful plants, the tomatoes, potatoes and corn whispering so sweetly, day and night, 'I'm coming.' The initial visit of the peas was on the 26th of June. Quite early for this locality but very acceptable. Early peas are magnetic. The eyes are made better for seeing them and the stomach decidedly better for receiving them. I had almost forgotten the beans, but not so the gardener. He has lots and lots of them marching along in all their glory. Our welcome for the beans will be ready on the very day that the corn is ready for the table. Delicious succotash! All the Narragansetts, Mohawks, Pequots and Pennacooks may be remembered with pleasure on that day. Whoever eats a dish of siiccotash should remember the red man, with thanks. But we should not say much about eating, it savors of commonness, and our excuse now is that the foregoing plants will help to form redeeming dishes. But,�but�and it is too bad to know it, that a spiritual being, made in the image of God, should not only be a common eater but an omnivorous eater. The civilized and Christianized are as yet but a slight remove from their savage ancestors. A little more thought on this subject may do some good and need do no harm. July 10th. New potatoes are ready for digging, and the yield promises to be all that could be expected. They will average 3% oz. each.' The strawberries have all faded from sight. Br. George furnished our family with seven bushels and twenty-two quarts. The berries were large and of an excellent quality. Alfred, Me. July 12, 1891. Beloved Elder Heney :�Many thanks for the package of pencils. They were so nicely pointed. If there are no points in 'Home Notes' it will not be the fault of the pencils. Elder Harvey under date of June 3rd. says they were having the last of their strawberries�the first of ours came a little later, and our first green peas the 24th. or three weeks later than at South Union. So it takes from three to four weeks to measure the difference in climate 'from Alfred to Kentucky's plains.' Field strawberries were unusually plenty this season, and blueberries and huckleberries much more plenty than last season. The Brethren are in the midst of the hay harvest. About three-fourths as much hay as last year is the verdict. June is supposed to be the best month for cream and butter. Yet our May record is better than June, the one giving 4253 spaces and the other 3859 spaces. The cause for this should perhaps be credited to the provender given in May. The summer term of school closed July 3rd. F. C.
