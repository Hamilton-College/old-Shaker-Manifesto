Alfred, Me. July 12, 1891. Beloved Elder Heney :�Many thanks for the package of pencils. They were so nicely pointed. If there are no points in 'Home Notes' it will not be the fault of the pencils. Elder Harvey under date of June 3rd. says they were having the last of their strawberries�the first of ours came a little later, and our first green peas the 24th. or three weeks later than at South Union. So it takes from three to four weeks to measure the difference in climate 'from Alfred to Kentucky's plains.' Field strawberries were unusually plenty this season, and blueberries and huckleberries much more plenty than last season. The Brethren are in the midst of the hay harvest. About three-fourths as much hay as last year is the verdict. June is supposed to be the best month for cream and butter. Yet our May record is better than June, the one giving 4253 spaces and the other 3859 spaces. The cause for this should perhaps be credited to the provender given in May. The summer term of school closed July 3rd. F. C.
