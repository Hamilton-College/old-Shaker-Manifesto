WHICH IS THE BETTER WAY? How many of us when we come into collision with another think that he also may be hurt? A little boy bumpt his head against the wall, and ran to his mother crying to be kissed. She said: 'What a bad wall to hurt poor Willie! Go hit the wall!' Another day he bumpt his head against a playmate, and at once struck him to punish the injury. Another child, with a wiser mother, hurt himself, and after the spot had been duly kist, the mother said: 'But who will kiss the poor chair? You hit the chair when you tumbled against it.' When he fell against his little brother, and they both got hurt, he remembered the lesson, and said: 'Kiss Harry, too.' Which is the better way, and which child will be more likely to grow up kind and considerate in all the relations of life?
