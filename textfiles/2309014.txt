More than all other things combined... More than all other things combined,�the prosperity of a Community depends upon the Christian union that is to be found to exist among the several members who compose that body. Brotherly love has a wonderful, magical effect upon the mind to dispel all doubt and fears, and to make the burdens and trials of life grow light. No amount of wealth, nor extent of worldly possessions, nor multitudes of people can bring to Community, the peace and prosperity which is found to unfold so beautifully in the cultivation of the precious gift of union. This in its fulness is the love of God to man. It creates, holds and remolds till degree after degree is passed, and a life obtained that may, very properly, be said, to be 'hid with Christ in God.' 'By this shall men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love another.' In this is the key-note of success for the followers of Jesus. This divine gift of love was an out-pouring from the presence of the Lord,�it was a manifestation of the refreshing that was promised to come upon the earnest seeker after righteousness, and was no less a baptism into a new and spiritual life. Neither wealth nor poverty, are in the least calculated to develop that love which Jesus was so anxious should be known among his disciples ; and yet he promised them an hundred-fold of all the blessings in time, if they would become the children of God. This prDmise of such abundant blessings in this world, was the introduction of the Ministry of wealth, through which so much good might be accomplished for the happiness of the race of man. This had no reference to the accumulation of wealth for selfish purposes, which might be consumed as is the wealth held by the children of this world, but should be used for the peace and prosperity of all who entered the religious communion. THE MANIFESTO. 213 Gold and silver are as essentially needed in the dissemination of the glad tidings among men, as is the daily bread in the maintenance ol the physical life. To secure a healthy, active, religious Community, there needs to be a constant liberal expenditure to keep pace with the perishable property and to meet all the demands of the general household. Poverty on the other hand is not at all to be desired, even though a religious communist in his consecration to God has given all he possessed into the treasury of the Lord. With this disposition of time and talents and worldly treasures, he is by no means poor, unless the Community, as a whole, is poor, which indeed, must be the visitation of a sad affliction upon the faithful workers of the cross. Here again, comes the greatest of all treasures, and the surest road to ultimate success, as the love of God and the union of the brotherhood is consummated in the daily life of the Christian disciple. This transcends all things else, in that it gives assurance of a present happiness and an unfolding prosperity. It was our Mother Ann who foresaw the great need of the Communistic life, and impressed this saying upon the minds of her people. ' P ut your hands at work, and give your heart to God.' She well knew that an industrious people would never need beg for bread nor suffer from the want of any temporal blessing, and yet at this same time, Mother Ann was suffering intense cruelty from the hands of violent persecutors, and often reduced to a very low point for the want of her daily bread. In all of these sad afflictions, her hope rested permanently on God. and she could praise him for his boundless mercies to her and to her gospel companions. Parallel with this was the experience that Jesus passed through while on his gospel mission. At the same time that he was exhorting his followers to maintain their integrity in God, and promising them an hundred-fold for every sacrifice that they would make, he also gave them to understand that as a selfish man and in the accumulation of private property, he had not where to lay his head. The members of a Christian Community can readily understand the position which Jesus occupied in the forming of his little family of Believers. There is not the least doubt but that every phase of selfishness was manifested in them, that had previously occupied their minds. It was the conversion to a great work and to a wonderful experience in practical self-denial for Peter, Andrew, John, James and others to give all they possessed into the common treasury, that all might share equally in the blessings of the little family. This unselfish, consecrated life 214 THE MANIFESTO. was the all in all to Jesus and brought out that beautiful and oft-repeated saying which is so .imperfectly understood. 'By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.' In fact there was no other way to know it. Whoever reads the history of Peter and John and James and Judas would wonder how such diverse dispositions could ever harmonize with each other. They were emphatically, the men of the world, while their love for themselves was above all other considerations, and it was only by having this love one for another that their Christianity could be determined. Can we not as a Community learn from this, a lesson that may be of value in our Community life ? Shall we be any better known as the disciples of Jesus the Christ, than the world at large unless we manifest a Christian love and union for each other ?
