THE VOICE OF AGE. MARCIA E. HASTINGS. As we become advanced in years we should never allow ourselves to morbidly settle down in ease and unconcern, feeling that our day of activity and improvement is past, even though we may have toiled laboriously and earnestly for many years in efforts to promote Christian principles and heavenly graces. Nay, the older we grow and farther we advance in spiritual travel, the more we should be stimulated by our maturer appreciation of the riches, the triumph and the glory attained and attainable, to continue our active interest in the blessed Christian cause, both for ourselves and our younger struggling companions and growing spiritual sons and daughters. We have many times felt a loathing and dread of a state of apathy and lukewarmness into which we are liable to settle if we do not maintain a watchful, prayerful spirit, as we advance in years and find we have conquered our most inveterate enemies,—those pertaining to the lower animal propensities,—and thus neglect and overlook other insidious lurking foes, such as selfishness, peevishness, a vaunting sense of acquired righteousness and extensive gospel travel. It is well to be on the alert, and see that these do not hold dominion over us. We wish to be actuated by a living spirit and loving heart to the end of our earthly existence ; be a brightness and encouragement to the young, a comfort and stay to the aged. Be sure, work and pray with the faithful loyal burdenbearers, whom we love and bless, and would much prefer to lighten their multiplied burdens rather than add needlessly one trifling weight.
