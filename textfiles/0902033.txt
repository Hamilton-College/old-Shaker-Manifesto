Rice snow Mice snow. Put to cook four spoonfuls of ground rice—it can be ground in any coffeemill—-in one pint of water; stir well and cook about fifteen minutes, then add two spoonfuls of butter, a little salt, two spoonfuls of white sugar, and a few drops of lemon essence; have boiling one pint of milk ; pour it over the rice; stir well and let it boil until thick ; then pour into a dish for table. It is excellent, either warm or cold.
