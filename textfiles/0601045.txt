CARRY THE NEWS Go, little Shaker — fly over the land and waters—carry the good news, that the Lord is come, and the power of the Christ. ' Shake all nations'; and fill every house with glory, through the brightness of thy coming. Visit the fatherless and motherless; teach them of their Father and Mother, God. Comfort the mourner ; feed those who hunger after an increasing righteousness ; give hope of better days to the prisoner, and sound the trump of gospel freedom to every creature. Friends of the truth, help us to extend it. Subscribe liberally, for others than yourselves; and may every Sixty Cents so consecrated, meet you with untold gratitude in the eternal world. Jgp Bear in mind, subscriptions are to be sent to N. A. Briggs, Shaker Village, N. H. Exchanges and contributions to The Shaker, Shakers, N. Y.
