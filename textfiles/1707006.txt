CHRISTIAN LOVE. M. J. TATTERTON. By Christian love is meant the spirit Christ manifested towards mankind, a love not for his followers alone, not merely for those who believed in him, but for all. The more degraded or diseased in mind or body, those whom he met iu his path of life, so much more did his loving compassion reach out toward them; and by the great gifts and power that were his, he healed them of their infirmities; and by his words of love, and encouragement, he taught them of the Higher Life, and filled their souls with that comfort and joy which always follows obedience to new light. Oh! the grandeur of the love of Christ as portrayed by him when with lips white with the agonies of death, he prayed for his enemies, 'Father forgive them for they kuow not what they do. ' Such an example of true charity and Christian love, was never before witnessed. Knowledge and appreciation of the love of God is the result of soul growth and development. When the Christian is in full possession of this love he is then able to bear with patience all burdens, endure the buffetings of temptation and suffer persecution for Christ's sake. Jesus said, 'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends' and also declared the seal of discipleship to be, ' If ye have love one for another. ' Well might the disciple whom Jesus loved, when grown too feeble and aged to render service, physically, in the Master's cause, often present to the church the words of him they professed to pattern. 'Little children love one another. ' ' Love one another, love, love, each other, By this Christ's followers are known. ' Canterbury, N. H.
