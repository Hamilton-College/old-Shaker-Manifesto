Encompass'd here we find we are... Encompass'd here we find we are, With many who will witness bear, That 'neath the cross is found a prize, Concealed from the great and wise ; Then let us cast aside each weight, And every sin which us beset; And, with a courage firm and strong. Toil on, till we the race have run. Think not the future with success will shine, Unless the present time you will improve; Neglect the moments, and the years (you'll find) Will soon elude your grasp, afar to rove. Grant me, O Lord, a heart inclined to Thee ; A soul enrobed in truth and purity; A mind in whose recesses Thou art found ; Yea lips which move, my Maker's praise to sound. Give me a tongue which speaks what Thou canst own, And hands which work for Thee, and Thee alone; O give me feet which tread thy righteous way; May my whole life be spent for Thee each day. A. Gainer, Mt. Lebanon
