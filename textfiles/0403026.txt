We hail the anniversary of our Redeemer's birth... We hail the anniversary of our Redeemer's birth, And we bless the God of missions who sent him to the earth; We acknowledge him our Leader, the chosen 'King of kings,' And join in hallelujas for the peace his Gospel brings. With angel choirs above us, we'll unite in songs of joy, And, with spirits who surround us, our choicest notes employ, Tor the light that Star has given, thus far, to lead us on : May it still illume our pathway, till we reach the shining throne. Try. P. Hale, Canterbury, N. H.
