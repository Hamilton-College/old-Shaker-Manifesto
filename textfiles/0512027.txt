SUNSHINE IN HOUSES The time very n*kely will come when sunshine or sunlight will be so utilized as to be the entire remedy used for very many diseases. That it is a wonderful fertilizer none can doubt who know any thing about it. But how many houses are constructed with a view to getting all the sunshine possible, especially when so much is needed in winter and spring? The living or sitting room, at these seasons of the year at least, should have full Southern exposure, with large windows to let in the sunshine. All sleeping rooms, closets, wardrobes and passage ways should receive the cleansing, vivifying influence of the sun. Sickly persons should court the sunshine as much as possibleâ€” sit in it, lie in it, luxuriate in it. It doesn't cost any thing, only appreciation. A room warmed neither by sun nor by fire is unhealthy, and not fit for human habitation. It is a poor theory that sends men, women and children off into a cold room to sleep on healthy principles, when warmth has been excluded for a day or week, or perhaps months. The change in the temperature of a room having both fire and sunshine, after the sun goes down, is exceedingly marked. A perceptible chill is felt.
