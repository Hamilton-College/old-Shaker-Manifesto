NOTES. OUR DISCIPLESHIP. That the Church of God, in its manifestation upon the earth, must be a church of spiritual life, led arid governed by a growing inspiration is quite evident from the testimonies of Christ and his immediate followers. Belonging as it does to the resurrection order of souls, it must stand above and beyond all that claimed a fellowship to the old dispensation or worldly inheritance. The Church now becomes a laborer and occupies the place of the sower that went forth to sow. Some of the seed may fall on good soil, and some may fall on poor soil, all of which will be determined in the day of harvest. W the Church, through neglect, fails to sow the word of God, the apostle warns us of what will be sure to follow. Whatsoever a man, a family or a Church soweth, that also they shall reap. God's law falls with equal force upon the just and the unjust. lt He that overcometh shall eat of the iree of life. He that walkcth uprightly and worketh righteousness, and spcaketh truth in his heart. ' This comes from God and those who live in this light and in the testimony of Jesus Christ, can never die any more than Christ, the Son of God, can die. The Church must be the living exponent of the peaceable fruits of righteousness, which will aid mankind to become friends of humanity and earnest advocates of the much anticipated millennial age. In the consecration which is demanded, the bodies as well as the souls are to be included. 'Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto the Lord, which is your reasonable service. ' ' Ye are the temples of the living God, He that defiles this temple, him will God destroy.' These religious lessons so well calculated to promote this new order of life are brought forward and forcibly impressed upou the mind as imperative for the obtaining of a full reward of the proffered earthly and heavenly treasures. The acceptance of the testimony of Jesus, in its fulness, positively assures the disciple of an hundred fold reward of God's blessings on the earth, and in the world to come, Eternal life. Iu this church the disciple is to learn that good will, is to be the ruling element, and that all men will become brothers and the children of one creative mind. The voice of the peacemaker so essential to our happiness in this life will have a loving influence wherever the spirit of the Lord finds a place of rest. We are well assured that the children of this world have been diligent workers for the increase of mammon through many thousands of years, and that the care of self and selfish relations have reached the ascendency that quite overshadows all the better qualities of the mind. The dark state is so apparent and the daily transactions of life so clearly manifest that even the most careful among men, at one time, thought that the evil quality largely predominated, and that no mas could be found that did good, no, not one. The tendency has seemed to be powerfully toward the interest of the earth and to the cultivation of its relations in the soul. In the time of all this darkness Christ came as a spiritual light and his message is, God's love to r.-.sin. On this foundation, his church is built. Peaceful relations will follow and these, in time, will bring that prosperity which has been promised to all the fa'tlit'ui Sons and Daughters of God. The Church of God is ihe home of the resurrected sou!, a place where the poor in spirit may find rest, far away from the passions which rule the lives of the children of this world. It is the privilege of the seeker after righteousness to share ii the blessings of this heavenly tinier where the treasures of the Kingdom can never be harmed by moth or rust, and which the wicked can never take away. Our faithfulness in the consecrated inheritance of God's people is the sure test of our discipleship, and we shall do well to regard, in all carefulness, the apostolic advice,ï¿½ ;iHold fast that which thou hast gained, let no one take thy crown.
