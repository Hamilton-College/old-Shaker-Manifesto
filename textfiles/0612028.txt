A HORSE-SPARER The German War Minister has lately caused experiments to be made with an apparatus devised by M. Fehrmann, and called a Pferdeschoner (literally, horse-sparer). 'It is meant to diminish the fatigue of horses in drawing vehicles, as also the chances of rupture of the shaft or traces. It consists of a number of Indiarubber rings separated from each other by iron rundles; the whole is contained in a cylindrical metallic case, and a metallic rod, fixed to the last rundle and traversing the case, is a means of compressing the caoutchouc rings. The length of the system is 0.30 m. (about a foot). Two are required for each horse. They are interposed between the traces and the trace-hooks, thus forming an elastic pad between the horse and the weight to be drawn. In beginning to pull, horses do not make a gradually increasing effort, but generally precipitate themselves on their traces with a sudden shock, wasting their strength and probably doing injury. Fehrmann's apparatus remedies this, by the gradual compression of the caoutchouc rings. The initial effort required of the horse is less, and then it progressively increases.' According to the report of the experiments, the effort required under various circumstances is diminished from 18 to 40 per cent by the use of this contrivance, which is certainly a sensible one, and ought to come into general use throughout the world. It is simple and inexpensive withal.
