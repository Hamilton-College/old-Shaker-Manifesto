LIFE IS WHAT WE MAKE IT. [Contributed by M. Witham.J Life is, in a great degree, what we make it. And how shall we succeed if we pass by heedlessly life's precious opportunities? Little opportunities of doing good, little lessons that may at present seem unin:portant, help materially to lay the foundation for a great and useful life. Our faculties for exercising an influence over others are so many and so great that it is difficult to conceive how two persons may sit and converse together without exerting a mutual influence; and every one who critically examines himself, his intellectual and moral state, will observe that however short his interview with another person may be, it has had an effect upon him, and this influence is usually exerted when we think little about it; but we have left impressions which will never be erased. This influence and consiancy has often great power. A single instance of advice, reproof, caution or encouragement may decide the question as to man's respeetabilitj, usefulness and happiness for a life-time. How important then that we improve every opportunity to make our life a blessing to others. Zion's Herald.
