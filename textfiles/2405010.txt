The chewing or smoking of tobacco... The chewing or smoking of tobacco should not be practiced by any Christian Believer. An animal should not be allowed to suffer for lack of proper care. Workshops should be left clean and tidy at the close of the week, and a regard for neatness and order should be the work of every day. Lanterns must not be carried to the haymow nor opened in the barn, and they should not be opened in any place where sparks would be liable to set any thing on fire. We can not be too careful in the use of lights of all kinds.
