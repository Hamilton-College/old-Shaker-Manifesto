BOYS, READ AND HEED Many people seem to forget that character grows; that it is not something to put on ready-made with womanhood or manhood; but day by day, here a little and there a little, grows with the growth, and strengthens with the strength, until, good or bad, it becomes almost a coat of mail. Look at a man of business—prompt, reliable, conscientious, yet clear-headed and energetic. When do yon suppose he developed all those admirable qualities ? When he was a boy ? Let us see how a boy of ten years gets up in the morning works, plays, studies, and we will tell you just what kind of a man he will make. The boy that is too late at breakfast, late at school stands a poor chance to be a prompt man. The boy who neglects his duties, be they ever so small, and then excuses himself by saying, 'I forgot; I don't think !' will never be a reliable man, and the boy who finds pleasure in the suffering of weaker things will never be a noble, generous, kind man—a gentleman.
