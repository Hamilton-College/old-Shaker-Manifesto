[Many of our readers will be interested in the following article, setting forth the Experience of John Dunlavy, formerly a Presbyterian Preacher �td.~\ Dearly Beloved Brethren :�I am informed that my uu worthy name is in some measure known to you already. But having sold all I had to buy the field with the true treasure, I desire to become more intimately acquainted with that body in whom the spirit dwells, and to find a lasting and uninterrupted union with them. I take the opportunity offered me, to write my faith. My earliest education such as it was in things pertaining to God, was in the Presbyterian, or Calvinistic order. I entered on the Ministry, and continued for some years, until after the work of God broke out iu Kentucky. When standing in ne ir connection with others, and in particular, our dearly beloved and ever faithful brother Richard Me. Nemar, I began through him as the instrument, to learn that salvation is brought to men in the gospel of Christ, in a much more liberal and equitable measure than I had, heretofore, understood. The increase of light I received by slow degrees, in the first dawn of it. But as soon as I became clearly satisfied of any oue point, that it was truth, and saw that it tended to open the door of salvation to sinners, I gave forth my light to the world freely as 1 had received it, in the pleasing hope that others would hear, embrace, and find salvation. I greatly lamented that so few regarded those things which made for their peace, and that my labors were so unfruitful, yet all praise to God, they were not all lost; for God made use of so unworthy a creature as me, to do something toward preparing the way for the true gospel. But I have now to lament while I behold the fruit of my labors in those to whom I have become an enemy, because I tell them the truth which I now begin to know, and in which I feel determined to abide, though at the expense of counting my past gain, loss, and my former attainments, dross, that I may win Christ, and be found in him. Tn those times, I often felt that the great reason of my little success in preaching, was the shortness of the work of God in my own soul. How to remedy this defect, I had little or no knowledge ; the dregs of the old antichristian forms of waiting for God to do his work, being not yet purged out, though I had in some measure learned the folly of it. Add to this, the extreme length to which the doctrine of justification by faith was strained, and the useless fea,r of laboring to do the will of God, and overcome all sin in order to find acceptance with God, and obtain true peace. For the right understanding of these things, the true and perfect light was wanting. Therefore, when I felt myself under guilt, for quenching the spirit, by falling into sin, I had no strength to keep myself entirely free I found a law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which was deeply rooted in my members. Yet there was a work in my mind which could not be easily checked, and my soul stretched forward to the work of God which I apprehended was before me. I began before long to lose my attachment to the literary works of men, and to all the antichristian forms, and to search the Scriptures, comparing all things with them as my best guide ; for I had not yet learned that God dwelt in a living temple, nor that his word was there to be found. In this pursuit, however, God blessed me, and led me through many of the dark mazes into a good degree of the light of the gospel, which, as fast as I found to be expedient, I opened to the people, though often obliged to cover the clearest of my views, for a time, in the shade of old phrases, because the people were not able to bear the light. I learned that Christ was not the minister of sin, that we ought to have the very faith of the Son of God, and to walk as he walked, to be like him in all things, and follow him into the holiest of all, into which he had entered and opened the way for us through the vail, that is to say, his flesh. I was now not far from the kingdom of God, and believed there was a way out of all sin, but how to perform that which was good, I found not; how to perfect the things which I had learned, I knew not. And that was not all, I really found an unwillingness to have it done in me, so that .when I would do good, evil was present [to dispute the way.] This was strictly Calvinistic religion, but now it would not do for me. I found the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and the latter was not willing to die. I longed for clearer light for the benefit of myself and others. In this situation, the witnesses from New Lebanon found me. And however strange, it is true that the sight of them produced in me more pain than as if I had met an enemy. I sought to escape the death, but all in rain. I could not renounce the light I had received before, though sometimes I fought against it; yet not directly against anythiug which I felt to be truth. The light continued to break in upon me, one flash after another, and to draw me nearer to the point where I found ease when I could. I soon found 1 was left of God as soon as I felt against the testimony which these witnesses bare. I began to feel love for them, and a kind of union with them, but was obliged to conceal my faith. Awhile ago, if I felt against the testimony, I could not preach to profit. I could not hold the people. Yet they understood not what was in me�and now, I dared not let my faith be known ; they would have shut their hearts against me. I ;iad long offended the world and lost much of my name, and now I might have recovered all, had I rejected the finishing stroke. But to attain to the resurrection from the dead was more to me than all besides. I was determined to know Christ, aud be conformed to his death. The world and the flesh were strong in me, but these were dying things ; they did not fill my poor soul. This is a short vi-^w of that traTel in which 1 drew near to death, and came to the conclusion to renounce my carna hopes, and recall my fond desires for the world and the flesh, and to aim for a better world, even the kingdom of God. For God in the riches of his goodness has reached even to me. The work which now began in me, was faintly shown me years ago, when I did not understand it. I felt in me a nature against holiness, aud that I felt to be the flesh�but did not understand how it was to be destroyed ; neither was I willing. But now it has come to me in the order of God, and I bid adieu to the world aud the flesh, with all their pollutions, and all their charms, to seek union with him whose nearest kindred are those who do the will of their heavenly Father. I find some increase of faith and strength, though my growth, or skill in the work of God is scarcely worth naming. Yet, if there is so much bounty in the church of God as to feel any union with so unworthy a creature as me, I can gladly lie down at their feet, and worship God in his holy Temple. My desire is to be strengthened in the way of God. to learn to do his will, to serve hia interest in the world, aud to have my labors and my rest among the saints. I find, indeed, the truth of the present testimony, its being of God, in the effects of it in my own soul. To remove all the strength of corruption, and to extirpate every root of bitterness, to deliver the creature from the very root of that nature which is against God, and to save from that fear which hath torment, to regenerate the soul into a union with God in the way of his own manifestation, and to fellowship with the saints, are things which cannot come from any other source than God. By the grace of God I am what I am. I have by this grace been enabled to testify, and to feel my testimony true, that the foundation of this work in which I now stand, is no other and can be no other than the one true and eternal God. But O how unworthy of such grace. I cannot boast of my own faithfulness, as I do of God's grace, goodness and love. I have, indeed, set out to be saved from all sin, and to be cleansed from all uncleanness. I count not myself to have apprehended, yet one thing I begi i to learn; to forget the things which are behind, and to reach forth to those before. If any of the brethren feel a gift to communicate anything to me, I trust it will be accepted as from a brother in the Lord. Dear brethren accept the offer of my love to you, and let me be united to you in the same bond. John Dunlavy.
