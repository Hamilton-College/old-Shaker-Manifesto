Dear Friend: it is now quite a long time since... Dayton, Ohio. Jan. 1884. Dear Friend: it is now quite a long time since you have been with us in work and worship. The oversight which is required of us compels us to remind you, that if for any reason, you cannot be with us and are not likely to be, you ought to ask for a letter of dismission, that you may be received in an orderly way into the church where your lot is cast. We greatly regret to lose our members; but when they are absent from our bounds and not likely to return soon, it is certainly best to observe the direction of our Book of Discipline, and seek church connection where they reside. If you hope to return shortly, and desire to have your name retained on our roll, you have only to say so, and it will be retained. If you request a letter please name the church you hope to unite with. Please reply as soon as convenient. We are about to publish a revised roll, and we aim to have it state only the facts. In Christian regard, and by order of Session of M. P. Church. J. R. H., Pastor.
