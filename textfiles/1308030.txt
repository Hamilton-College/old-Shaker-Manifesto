Worms —'The Formation of Vegetable Mold through the Action of Worms' is the title of Mr. Darwin's latest book. He says that every English earth-worm—a creature which is little else than a digestive apparatus—probably passes, on an average, about twenty ounces of matter through its body in a year. It brings this matter to the surface of the earth, and there deposits it, and brings it up in a very different form from that in which the matter existed before it passed through the worm. The earth is digested or triturated in the gizzard of the worm, and combined with the fibrous parts of the leaves on which it feeds and with which it lines its burrows. The moid that results is what is known as 'vegetable mold.' He says: 'When we behold a wide turf-covered expanse, we should remember that its smoothness, on which so much of its beauty depends, is mainly due to all the inequalities having been slowly leveled by worms. It is a marvelous reflection that the whole of the superficial mold over any such expanse has passed, and will again pass every few years, through the bodies of the worm. The plough is one of the most ancient and most valuable of man's inventions : but, long before he existed, the land was in fact regularly ploughed and still continues to be thus ploughed, by earth-worms.' In many parts of England, Mr. Darwin estimates that more than ten tons of dry earth annually passes through their bodies, and are brought to the surface on each acre of land. Supposing that in Great Britain there are thirty-two millions of such acres, three hundred and twenty millions of tons of earth are brought to the surface by them, in Great Britain alone, in a single year.
