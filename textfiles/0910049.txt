Soaked corn for workers Soaked Corn tor Workers. â€” The American Express Company is noted for the extra quality and appearance of their horses. It is understood that all of their horses are fed on corn, unshelled from the cob; but the corn is allowed to stand in water for twentyfour hours before it is given to the horses. As much may then be fed to a feeding, with. out harm, as the horses will eat, having fully swelled before going to the horses. We recommend farmers to try this, and report to us.
