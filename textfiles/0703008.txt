Little Lou, Weldon's Wishes EZRA T. LEGGETT I'd like to be an angel, But not to sigh away My bonny, golden hours, That brighten life to-day. I'd be a dimpled angel, And laugh, instead of cry, Till every dark, unsilvered cloud Was driven from my sky. The angel from the better land, That comes to me at night, And smiles upon me in my dreams, Oh, she is my delight. I want to be the angel, While dwelling here below, That takes my heaven with me, Wherever I may go. My moments are too fleeting, Too few my promised years, To let my heart be beating To unrequiting tears. So I'll gather all the gladness From the seasons as they roll, And make the better angel For the sunshine in my soul. Union Village, O.
