Enfield, N. H. Jan. 1897. We extend our thanks to our friend Simon Emery, for his practical interest in circulating our Church literature, also for his timely suggestion that we act our part as is becoming a class professing the name of Christ. What does it profit a society if its ability to help humanity is kept in a nutshell of spiritual apathy? If God helps those who help themselves, gospel kindred what shall be the harvest of this New Year? Golden grains of sentiment only? No souls gathered from the quick-sands of engulfing evil? Society aud individual betterment is gained by toil of mind, heart and hands. The spirit of indecision falters as it reaches the stairs of tedious circumstances, yet they who would reach their ideal of Christianity must expect to become weary sometimes. Storms are necessary gifts of creation; they invigorate more than they destroy, and no mortal can under all conditions be full of merry, rippling joy, for the innate elements that crave better qualities must expect hard trials and only by a strong spirit of decision that sounds a genuine yea to right and a decided nay to wrong, can reach the top of progression's steps, where victory over all that debases stands radiant in her glory, giving to all victors her rewards of joy, rest and soul happiness. On Christmas evening, we enjoyed an entertainment, in which thirty of the younger members took part. The manufacturing of nine hundred corn planters is claiming the attention of several of the Brethren, and harvesting of ice, ten inches thick, is in operation. General health and prosperity prevails among us. George. II. Baxter.
