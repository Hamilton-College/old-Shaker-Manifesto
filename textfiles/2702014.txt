Editor Manifesto;�I have just been filled with the life-giving spirit of the gospel, having freely partaken of the bread and waters of life fresh from the spiritual conservatory of heaven. To-day the North family met with the Church in worship and the heavenly avenues were opened and the indwellers of the celestial temple were with us in spirit and in truth. Elder Giles was with us as a minister of the power of the world to come. He repeated some things that he had spoken befoi'e, viz: Hear ye my people! The Lord's work is in its infancy. You will be surprised at the manifestations of his power. There is light emanating from the Spirit world that will prove the fulfillment of the prophecies delivered to the Shakers during the period of time between 1837 and 1846. Ministering spirits are busily engaged in sowing the seeds of a Spiritual Revival among mankind that will raise them from the mire of worldliness and its degradation into a higher life emanating from God the Father and Mother of all the souls of the human family. There will be a sifting and a separation of the chaff and the wheat. The wheat among my people will be pure, and will yield unto the needy and the hungry, the bread of life and living fountains will pour forth for the thirsty, the waters of eternal life. They that truly drink thereof, shall not thirst again for the bitter waters of Sodom. Tribulation lies in the pathway of my people. I see it rise like a dense, dark cloud. When the harvest day shall come, those who shall garner the wheat, will need the whole armor of God. Our meeting was one that will not soon be forgotten by the thoughtful who attended it. Many were deeply imprest, as the emanations of their overflowing spirits clearly indicated. It is a time of general health in our family, also of the Society, and a spirit of unity prevails, feeling� 'Fis selfishness only that hides from another The things that we so greatly enjoy: [other, Then keep not the heaven-born thots from each For selfishness will real pleasure destroy. Calvin G. Reed. South Family. Jan. 1897. 'Old things have past away, behold all things have become new,' even a New Year, the year of our Lord 1897. Righteousness belongs to the Lord thus ; 'Holi- ness unto the Lord,' is a fitting password for the present year. The past season is pleasantly remembered by the visit of Eldress Alvira Conklin and Sister Harriet Jones of the Albany Co. Community. Sister Harriet was formerly a member of the Philadelphia Society. By kind invitation, a party from this place, attended the Christmas Entertainment held at the Second family. The afternoon was devoted to musical recitations and dialogs. The singing of that choice hymn, 'There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,' contained in the Christmas number of the 'Christian Herald and Signs of our Times,' was one of the fine features of the Sociable. The musical dialog, 'What did Jesus say?' was most creditably rendered by six young Sisters. The military march given by the junior members added largely to the interest of the occasion. Br. Henry Hallett's personification of an English Auctioneer, Dry Goods' Merchant and Landlord, produced a spirit of mirth among his audience. Another lively event of the proceedings, was the rendering of a dialog on Physiology by three boys; the article was prepared by Br. Ernest Pick. 'The Coming Woman,' perfectly executed by four little girls. At the close of the program, dainty refreshments were liberally served. We were all blest by the pleasant service, and we live in the pleasant anticipation of another reunion at the next Christmas day. Oenevieve DeGraw. North Family. Jan. 1897. To-day, as on several previous Sabbaths, we attended religious service in the Church family's home chapel. They have a most beautiful room, large and convenient for seating a goodly company in the centre and for exercise in the march when the outer circle is formed. We have been greatly strengthened in spiritual union and Christian fellowship, by frequent mingling and commingling of soulful gifts, uplifting testimony and inspiring song. How pleased we would be, to meet with all the families in turn during the winter months. Our dear Canaan friends spent the Sabbath with us at the close of the year and we were only too glad to have them feel that we loved them as only gospel kindred can love. We would be happy if some generous hand would give them a lift in building up and sustaining their lovely home. May God bless all Zion through his instrumentalities, that prosperity and peace may reign in her courts. The spiritual cause is first in our hearts; but while we are inhabitants of this mundane sphere, we are under physical necessity and have material needs. Job said that 'He never saw the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread.' So if we work along the lines of righteous endeavor in earning our bread, and keep free from the entanglements of the world, we shall be 'blest in our basket and in our store.' We have no sleighing as yet; mountain roads are rough. Brethren are threshing by water power, and sawing wood when the mill pond is low. There are five members in our home that were not here at the beginning of the past year. Our good Brother, Levi Shaw, now nearly eighty years of age, is an honor to the Christian Communism, a shining light among the upright in character, and a blessing in his home where he is much beloved. Beloved Brother Alonzo Hollister, who occasionally attends our Sabbath evening meeting, is always a welcome visitor; his beautiful, chaste spirit wears the mark of angelhood. Love, joy and peace be with the whole household of faith. An especial blessing to those who sustain and continue our monthly Manifesto. May the increase of precious truth, be borne on its leaves for the uplifting and 'healing of the nations.' Martha J. Anderson. Shakers, N. Y. Jan. 1897. Beloved Eldeii Henkst;�We thought while our Christmas celebration was being enacted, how nice it would be if our Editor was with us to view the characters as they were portrayed by the actors. The young people managed the entertainment, which reflected great credit in selections and rendering. We send program as it was enacted Christmas evening at the South family. Our home talent from the North being represented in the following. Golden Bells, Song. The Seasons, Dialog. What ailed the Pudding, Recitation. The Banker's Charity, Holy Song, Song. Little Nut People, Recitation. The Geography Demon, Christ is Incarnate, Song. A Bad Cold, Recitation. Charity that Pays, Dialog. Song by Quartet, The Last Hymn, Recitation. The Fountain of Peace, Dialog. The King of Nations. Song. The young people of the South family entertained the company with the following, which was very nicely rendered. Twelve Christian Virtues, Dialog. Jesus' Seat, Recitation. The Answered Advertisement, The Ship of Life. That ancient and honored prophet of the Lord, Melchisedek, appeared in the entertainment, clad in the robes of his priestly office, on his mission of collecting tithes, with which he set up an altar and offered a burnt offering. The entertainment lasted from 4 till 7 p. m., when, adjourning to the dining-hall, refreshments were served. We have been both entertained and instructed, in the perusal of some of the writings of Thomas A. Kempis. Living in what is termed the dark ages of the Christian era, his was a mind largely free from theological bigotry and had an understanding of spiritual gifts, which places him in the ranks, as one of the inspired teachers of the race. He was translated in the year 1471 at 91 years of age. Our friend, Simon Emery hits the nail on the head in his letter in the Jan. Manifesto. We fully endorse the sentiments there exprest. Whoever receives the gift to minister the gospel, must let their light shine, and proclaim from the house-top, that testimony which has been unfolded to their spiritual understanding. Hamilton DeGraw. Alfred, Me. Jan. 1897. The Christmas and New Year greetings will have long been past before this comes to the readers of The Manifesto. Yet is not every day that comes to us a part of the New Year, and shall we not strive to make it a happy one for our fellow men? Lite is made up of such little periods and if we would live righteously one day at a time, not only one year would be pleasant and happy, but the whole lifetime would be filled with true pleasure and happiness. Christmas witli us was a very pleasant season. Santa Claus did not forge t to visit the children, much to their delight; neither did he pass the older ones by; every one from our aged fathers, who are in the eighties, to the little one seven years old. The Christmas dinner was a feast of goodies. Our meeting was a season filled with rejoicing over the victories won through the faith and life of Him whose birth we celebrated. Peace on earth good-will to all was our theme, with many new resolves to walk more closely in the footsteps of our blessed Lord and Savior. In the evening the members of the Bible Class and Sunday School, gave an entertainment, which consisted of singing, reading compositions, written expressly for the occasion, and reciting dialogs, all of which occupied two hours. The time was very pleasantly and profitably filled. At the close, Elder Henry Green made some very appropriate remarks and all were invited to the diningroom where they partook of ice-cream, cake and chocolate, after which 'Good Night to all' was sung and we retired to rest, feeling it had indeed been a Merry Christmas. It is hoped that love and good-will filled the heart of every one. At this writing, the ground is bare. Ice thick enough to cut, but prefer sledding before harvesting it. Two carloads of apples shipped this week to Boston. Health of Society is good. May peace and prosperity attend the inmates of our Zion homes, is the prayer of your Alfred friends. Fannie Casey. West Pittsfield, Mass. Jan. 1897. Since our last call at the 'Home Corner,' the holidays have come and gone, with all their messages of love and courage. We have exchanged the 'Merry Christmas' greetings, and have felt the renewal of the Christ spirit, a new birth into the divine life, so many years ago personified. The New Year has presented us its sealed volume, and as we commence the daily writing, we resolve to follow closely each line of the divine copy, that each day present a well written page in the year's history. Tho we know not how difficult may be the lessons on the pages that follow, yet with true Christian faith to control and direct, we will endeavor to pen each page with care. Snow has not been very plentiful with us as yet. At present there are a few lone flakes, wandering in an aimless, bewildered manner through the air, as tho uncertain that they had appeared in the right place, and finally falling to the earth and disappearing from sight. The channel of life, connecting our world with that above, is flowing smoothly at present. We feel daily the blessings borne on its waters, to us, and our gratitude flows back in an equally warm and bountiful current to the wise Giver of these blessings. Still amid its ebbs and tides, which once in a while, rise above the daily mark and threaten our coast, one has visited us by the illness of Br. Ira. We trust it will break and roll back to the sea, foaming and bright, for the greater force of its action. Our hope and earnest prayer is, that our loved Brother may soon recover. Yet not selfishly would we desire it alone, but that we might see him free from the suffering which his illness involves. We see in the morning, the sturdy teams ascending the rugged mountain sides, and judge that the wood-choppers are wielding their axes to advantage. Cruel indeed, as when in the early colonial days, men were mercilessly snatched from their native homes, by the greedy invaders; these kingly trees are torn from their forest homes, to be slaves of their owners. We hesitate about sending our New Year greeting when we look at the calendar which says '10 days past,' but reading further, we find, 'to come, 355,' and conclude that a sufficient number of days are left before the year grows old. So to all gospel kindred, far and near, from the rugged mountain home, to the leyel plains, we extend our best wishes for a happy and blessed New Year. Fidelia Estabroolc. Sabbathday Lake, Me. Jan. 1897. 'He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his^name's sake,' are the words printed at the top of a calendar some good friend presented to the writer at Christmas time. Surely I have been led in the paths of righteousness where the Lord is my Shepherd and I need never want, while I rely on his promise; 'Lo, I am with you always.' Winter set in quite cold, and froze the ponds and streams at an early date. Ice is said to be 16 in. thick on the lake and our Brethren prepared for cutting it, but a warm spell came, accompanied with heavy rains, which covered the ice and that business had to be suspended. As it is colder now, they will complete the work the coming week. There has been no snow to speak of in this section thus far. Our good Br. Samuel altho feeble speaks of the Brethren and Sisters and is continually blessing them. He often notices the faithfulness of Br. Pliny who is seen about the place these cold days with fuel to keep the fires burning brightly. The Brethren have sold 1,000 cords of fire-wood on the stump to the Kicker Brothers. At this time the cellars are full of apples, and no sale for them. Flowers are blooming in the greenhouse for us, and this is indeed very cheering. Flowers, by some, are considered among the non-essentials, but they certainly are beautiful, and cause one to have pure and holy thoughts that are uplifting, inspiring and divine. A'la S. dimming*. Enfield, N. H. Jan. 1897. We extend our thanks to our friend Simon Emery, for his practical interest in circulating our Church literature, also for his timely suggestion that we act our part as is becoming a class professing the name of Christ. What does it profit a society if its ability to help humanity is kept in a nutshell of spiritual apathy? If God helps those who help themselves, gospel kindred what shall be the harvest of this New Year? Golden grains of sentiment only? No souls gathered from the quick-sands of engulfing evil? Society aud individual betterment is gained by toil of mind, heart and hands. The spirit of indecision falters as it reaches the stairs of tedious circumstances, yet they who would reach their ideal of Christianity must expect to become weary sometimes. Storms are necessary gifts of creation; they invigorate more than they destroy, and no mortal can under all conditions be full of merry, rippling joy, for the innate elements that crave better qualities must expect hard trials and only by a strong spirit of decision that sounds a genuine yea to right and a decided nay to wrong, can reach the top of progression's steps, where victory over all that debases stands radiant in her glory, giving to all victors her rewards of joy, rest and soul happiness. On Christmas evening, we enjoyed an entertainment, in which thirty of the younger members took part. The manufacturing of nine hundred corn planters is claiming the attention of several of the Brethren, and harvesting of ice, ten inches thick, is in operation. General health and prosperity prevails among us. George. II. Baxter.
