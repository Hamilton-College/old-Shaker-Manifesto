South Union, Ky, Beloved Elder Henry :�But little transpired here the past month worthy of notice. Sheep-sheering day, Was first of May, since which time 600 have been changed from winter to summer dress. Average fleece about 6 to 7 lbs. worth .23 per lb. Some 200 lambs sold at $3 50 per. head,� future delivery. Gardens late but looking well, peas about a foot high with sticks in rows for climbing. Other things as usual; Strawberries very late; have had them on table here on my birthday, April 28th; will do well to get them on the 28th. of May this year. Have an eighteen inch Lawn Mower to keep w^eds and grass down in meeting-house lot and dooryard, just one acre including buildings and evergreens. The mower is more fatiguing than the scythe, but much nicer. Wish you could sec Ministry's yard now, you would be delighted. H. L. E.
