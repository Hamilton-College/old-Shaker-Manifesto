THE SHAKER COMMUNITY. By Elder Henry C. Blinn. TO form a Community on a religious basis, is to change the life of men and women from one of selfishness to that of universal interest and care. The doctrine of me and mine must give place to that of consecration to the Lord, and for the good of his people. The Community is a family on an enlarged plan and requires more care in its management to meet the increast want, and to secure the protection of all the members. Officers must be appointed to direct the varied occupations of those who are expected to take a responsibility in protecting the temporal interests and in securing the peace and happiness of every member. An Order of Ministry presides over two or more Societies. Elders are appointed as the spiritual advisers of a family. They are expected to be present at all religious services and to take the general management. They also instruct the family in the Rules and Regulations which have been adopted and call in question any deviation from these rules, as well as assist in settling any misunderstanding that may have arisen among the members. Other persons may be appointed to take charge of the branches of business and be responsible for their own faithfulness in their respective duties. Upon the Elders, however, devolves the first care and a family that numbers one hundred or more persons, of all ages, all temperaments, and with all the habits common to the race of man, must have some system of government that will make the family one of peace and harmony. The office of Trustees includes several persons who buy and sell and trade in the interest of the Community and hold the deeds of all real estate. These Orders form a committee for the general prosperity of the Society. The Shakers retire at an early hour, and rise early in the morning, allowing some eight hours of rest to all who may wish it. Some families take their breakfast at six o'clock throughout the year, while others prefer a later hour. All due consideration, however, is made for the aged, for the sick, and for little children. No arbitrary rules could be enforced as the age, health and protection of the members need judicious care. Every person in the Community, who is able, is expected to be engaged in some manual occupation, unless other duties prevent. Each family manages its own domestic affairs, agreeably to its own interests. Monday in most Shaker Villages is 'washing day,' and something unusual must occur to throw it out of place. As there are some fifty or more families among the Shakers, there may be not less than fifty ways of managing this indispensable branch of business. While some do most of the work by hand, or with a small amount of machinery, others have all the improvements that can be found in a first-class laundry. The Shakers regard the Sabbath quite like our Puritan fathers and engage in no temporal business any farther than may be absolutely necessary. It is expected that the day will be devoted to the cultivation of a religious thought especially in the reading of books, pamphlets and papers. All the Societies arrange for seasons of religious devotion, but in this, they are governed by the circumstances that surround their own homes. Some are able to maintain commendable Bible classes or Sabbath Schools, while religious services aie held more or less during the week. The Shakers accept the doctrine of Jesus the Christ and speak of him as the anointed Savior or the Son of God. Jesus was the father of the New Creation of God, and his work was to lead his people into the spirit of God that they might become sons and daughters of God. He led them from a life of generation to a life of regeneration. It was difficult for the Jews to understand this change of discipline when they were already God's chosen people. They were blinded by their carnal commandments and to make them understand this fact, Jesus told them in plain language; 'That which is born of the flesh, is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit, is spirit.' Adam and Eve were the parents of the old creation. God told them to multiply and they rendered the same obedience to God's will in this respect as did the beasts, birds and fishes. In the ministration of this office all the creation of God are on a level and for six thousand years no improvement has been made in the law. The Shakers admit marriage to be a civil right and properly placed under the authority of the laws of the country. As Jesus never entered that relation, he never gave his disciples any advise to enter it. On the contrary all his testimony was against the selfish life of the world, and against that relation which forms the selfish life of the world. Tolstoi says that if he should see a bear about to strike down a human be- ing, he would settle an ax into the brains of the beast, but he would not do that if he saw one man murderously approach another. Peter in his zeal to defend his Teacher, drew his sword, and Jesus rebuked him, 'Put up thy sword, for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.*' His people are represented as a peaceable people, dwelling in peaceable habitations. Celsus, a heathen philosopher, who wrote against the Christians near the close of the second century, brings this charge against them as enemies of the state,ï¿½'They refused to bear arms even in case of necessity,' and they refused because it was contrary to the Christian principle. A funeral among the Shakers is conducted agreeably to the customs of their own order. All the members of the family where the death occurs are present and sometimes those residing in other families. At an appointed hour all enter the chapel and the services are opened by a short exhortation from the officiating Elder. This is followed by the singing of a hymn. Liberty is then extended to any one who may feel so imprest to make a few remarks. During the meeting several pieces may be sung, and in this manner the service continues about an hour when the body is taken to its final resting place. Persons entering the Society become probationary members and may retain the lawful ownership of their property, but the interest accruing therefrom must be devoted to the benefit of the family in which they reside. If they ever become covenantal members, the property will be dedicated and become a part of the consecrated interest. It must be obvious to all, that persons coming into the Society must necessarily have a time of probation in order to prove their faith and integrity, before their sincerity can be tested and their ultimate union as faithful members be establisht.
