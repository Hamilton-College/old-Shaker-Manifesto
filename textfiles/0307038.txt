PAST AND PRESENT In the region of Jewry, and coasts round about The river of Jordan, did come A people, to be in its water baptized, Confessing their sins unto John. But a greater than he in their midst then did stand ; The same has come forth unto us ; Who baptized their souls with the spirit of fire, And gave them the true Holy Ghost. In that dark, cloudy day, although great were his works, Were many the Lord did not know; While sunny our day, and quite equal its work, Yet many are ignorant now. As then, so it is now; they the water did choose, And shunn'd the baptism of fire; They, John and the Prophets did very well know, But Jesus they did not desire. They then persecuted, and persecute still; E'en 'mong the disciples found place That spirit which now maketh desolate homes, And many a heart layeth waste. There is no more a willingness now to admit The truths of a progressive day, Than was found when Jesus did walk upon earth, And taught man the new living way. Man is obstinate now, as in days that are past To oppose and resist ev'ry law Subserving to bring the subversion of sin, From destruction his aid to withdraw. From this age of the world, and the light which is given, How much can humanity boast ? There is more cause to-day to hide in our shame, Than glory in such depths of loss. God's work must go on, we have bided it long; And what has been found by the way ? A curse ov a blessing awaits ev'ry soul: That's final â€” the great judgment day. In a summary manner, with every man, The work of decision is left; Heaven's offers accepted, the kingdom is his ; Rejected, of mercy bereft. Elder A. Perkins, Canterbury, N. H.
