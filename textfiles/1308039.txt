ARAB PECULIARITIES. An arab is a queer fellow. On entering a house he removes his shoes, but not his hat. He mounts his horse on the right side, while his wife milks the cow on the left side. In writing a letter he puts nearly all the compliments on the outside. With him the point of a pin is its head, whilst its head is made its heel. His head must be wrapped up warm even in Summer, while his feet may well enough go naked in Winter. Every article of merchandise which is liquid, he weighs, but he measures wheat, barley and a few other articles. He reads and writes from right to left. He eats scarcely anything for breakfast, about as much for dinner ; but after the work of the day is done, he sits down to a hot meal swimming in oil, or better yet, boiled butter. His sons eat with him, but the females of the house wait till his lordship is done. He rides a donkey when traveling, his wife walking behind. He laughs at the idea of walking in the street with his wife, or of ever vacating his seat for a woman. He knows no use for chairs, tables, knives, forks or even spoons, unless they are wooden ones. Bedsteads, bureaus and fireplaces may be placed in the same catagory. If he be an artisan he does work sitting, perhaps using his feet to hold what his hands are engaged upon. He drinks cold water with a sponge, but never bathes in it unless his home be on the seashore. He is rarely seen drunk, and is deficient in affection for his kindred. He has little curiosity and no imitation; no wish to improve his mind, and no desire to surround himself with the comforts of Life. Frank Leslie's III.
