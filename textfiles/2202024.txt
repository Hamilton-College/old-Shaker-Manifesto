Pleasant Hill, Ky. Jan. 1892. As the Jan. number of Manifesto failed to come as early as usual I did not send my few items in time for Feb. number, so I will now tell you that our mutual enemy, La Grippe, entered our home at Center family and sought for victims the choice part of the flock. Our good Eldress Adaline succumbed to the foe but she gained the victory and is now convalescent. Elder James at the same time was ill and had to remain in the Infirmary. There were twelve persons sick at once, but thanks to a kind Providence, all are slowly recovering. We have had winter in earnest, and as, for three years past have very little cold weather and no ice, we began to think our climate was to be like Florida, but the illusion is dispelled, and now the ground is covered with one mass of ice, and to the luckless pedestrian who is not careful, the scripture is apparent, that 'sinners (and saints) stand on slippery places.' We had our usual social on Christmas eve at our school house. A tree laden with fruit that made glad the little ones, with music, songs and recitations by the junior classes. Truly 'it is more blessed to give than to receive.' After New Year the seniors gave an entertainment which was carried out very successfully; good order and thorough mas- tering of the subjects gave those who managed it great pleasure. Trusting all are now on the way to recovery, we send love to all. M. C. S.
