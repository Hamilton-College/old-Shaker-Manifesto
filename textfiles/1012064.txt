BE CONTENT JOHN G. WHITTTER . It may not be our lot to wield The sickle in the ripened field ; Nor ours to hear, on Summer eves, The reaper's song among the sheaves. Yet where our duty's task is wrought In unison with God's great theught, The near and future blend in one, And whatsoe'er is willed is done. And ours the grateful service whence Comes, day by day, the recompense ; The hope, the trust, the purpose stayed, The fountain, and the noonday shade. And were this life the utmost span, The only end and aim of man, Better the toil of fields like these Then waking dreams and slothful ease. But life, though falling like our grain, Like that, revives and springs again ; And, early called, how blest are they Who wait in heaven their harvest day ! Hannah More says that there is one single fact that one may oppose to all the wit and argument of infidelity, that no man ever repented of Christianity on his death-bed.
