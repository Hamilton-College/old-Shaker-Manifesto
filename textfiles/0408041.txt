KEYS OF REVELATION 1. The type of life progressive, Viewed by a seer of old, The pure and shining way, The messengers of heaven Ee visit earth today. To the enlightened vision In meaning doth unfold. Ascending and de Bcending They come, O earth! to bless thee, Their loving mission hail! They sow beside all waters The seed that cannot fail, Truth's precious germs upspringing Shall fruit immortal bear, Rich prophecy of blessing Which many souls will share. The ministry of angels Shall light the darkened land, 'Till earth's benighted children God's power will understand; 'Till Babel towers of error To their foundations reel, And gilded temple glories A mighty shook will feel. 4. The keys of Revelation, Which long were doomed to rust, Now open the golden portals Of saving faith and trust; The soul unfolds her opinions To rise from nature's gloom, For strength of resurrection Lies not within her tomb.
