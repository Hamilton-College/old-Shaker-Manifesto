Enfield, Conn. At the outset of the new year, new thoughts and new plans should be formed in our minds. We must rise to higher degrees of goodness, not merely to do better work on the farm, but to cherish better purposes of soul culture, and to make our influence more and more felt for good. It is a great mistake not to fill up the spare moments with something useful. While the world is advancing all around vis, we must not stand still. Let us cultivate the heart as well as the land. It will be the best investment we can make. We should begin the new year with a will to make the most of time. The years are made up of months, weeks, days and hours, and it is for us to improve them the best we know how. Let us walk in the right pathâ€”it is plain. A change of food now and then seems to suit the taste of a cow as well as that of a man. Cows are most sensitive to cold and hard fare, and the food we give them ought to be such as to keep up the heat of the body as well as the supply of the elements that increase the secretion of milk. Because a hen may be forced to eat almost anything, we should not give her bad food and then expect well flavored eggs. Hens should not be obliged to drink bad water. Hens with low combs are the best layers in winter. The combs are not apt to be frosted, in which case hens never do well. Care, caution, and common sense will raise more chickens than all other remedies. D. Orcutt
