WHAT AN ACRE OF LAND PRODUCED. A farmer living in Maine makes a statement of what he has raisedsthis year on an acre of landâ€”almost enough, we should think, to support a family. He planted one-third of his acre in corn, and he usually produces thirty bushels of good corn. This quantity was sufficient for his family use, and for fattening two or three large hogs. From the same ground on which the corn stood, he raised two or three hundred pumpkins, and an ample supply of beans. From a bed of six rods square he usually obtains sixty bushels of onions; these he sold for one dollar per bushel, which amount purchased his flour for one year. Thus, from one-third of an acre and an onion bed he obtained his breadstuffs and two or three hundred pounds of pork. The remainder of the ground was appropriated to all kinds of vegetables, for both Summer and Winter use. He also had a flower garden, raspberries, currants, gooseberries in great abundance, and also a few choice apple, pear and quince trees.
