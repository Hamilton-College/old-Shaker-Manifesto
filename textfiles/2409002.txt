THE GIFT OF OUR MISSION MEETING. By Cecelia DeVere. We felt upon our spirits, rest A burden of the Living Word, And zeal that fluttered in each breast, Was like a captive message bird. Vibrations thrilled affection's chain, Back to the source of life's great good, To hearts beloved that here remain In Father and in Motherhood. Dear guardians of that Mercy Seat. Brought out from types remote and dim ; That throne of Truth where souls retreat For freedom and its morning hymn. We knelt in prayer, a circling calm That held a central strength from heaven, Warm waves of blessing, mingling balm As unction to our souls, were given. Ah, then it was within the veil, Parental supplication rose, As perfumes, incense sweet exhale, When snow white lily leaves unclose. Our Mother kneeling when we knelt But symbolized united hearts, Where Zion's every pulse is felt, Where Zion's tide of blessing starts. Our duty saw no halting fear, The banner of the Light was ours; An eager multitude drew near, As if to reach the holy powers. Our vision had extended scope Through all that life's fruition mars, While reasons for each Gospel hope Were bright as midnight's crown of stars. Plant faith, 0 God, the earth hath need, Of other harvest than she bears; Glad rain, fair sunshine, and good seed Are folded in abiding prayers. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
