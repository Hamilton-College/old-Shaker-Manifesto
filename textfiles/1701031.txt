Enfield, Conn. 1886 Dear Children :â€”Another year has joined the past. How swiftly and how silently the fleeting moments fly ! Begin the New Year right. Take another step toward the heavenly goal. ' Good to begin well, better to end well.' The reward of '\vell-doing is^a priceless treasure. ' Be virtuous, that is more than wealth Do right, that's morefthan place; Then in the spirit there is health,. And gladness in the face. ' Virtue is strength. Never stop for little troubles or give up for great ones. It is unmanly to ' look back. ' God will give you strength and power, trust Him and labor, hour by hour. Keep good vows so firmly that temptation shall be powerless for evil. Good vows and good efforts will win. Faith and good works will save your souls, though raging billows round you roll. Review the past and profit by its lessons. Profit by the mistakes of others and shun their penalties. ' Make your record clean. ' A sure way to win ' a righteous name' is to deserve it. Examine your lives, weigh your motives, watch your conduct. Fill this hour with worthy work and you will be ready for the hours that follow. Carefully guard your innocence. Grow in purity day by day, keep in mind to watch and pray. Purity is a rare jewel. Would you enjoy a conscience clear, and blessings that endure? Be pure. A clear conscience is an eternal inheritance. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt
