ONE THING I KNOW. GRACE H. BOWERS. One thing I know to be divinely true, That God is dual, male and female tco v A holy Fatherhood and Motherhood, Embodying all that's beautiful and good.. By earthly things we all may plainly see The First Great Cause is not a Trinity, Composed of Father, Son and Holy Ghost All worshiped by the vast angelic host. I pray unto my Heavenly Father wise, To bless me in my daily sacrifice; [near The while my Heavenly Mother draws me Unto Her pure embrace, why need I fear'. And many sons upon the earth have trod, Most true and worthy in the sight of God While sainted daughters from all sin made Adore their God in perfect liberty; [free, For with the Holy Ghost their souls are [filled, While on the rock of truth alone they build. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
