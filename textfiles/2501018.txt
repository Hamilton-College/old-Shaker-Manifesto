Second Family Dec. 1894. The New Year will soon be ushered in. How quickly the moments pass away when hands and mind are employed in well-doing. It seems but a short time since we began 'Notes' for 1894. How the seasons come and go! So it is with humanity. As one steps off the stage another steps on. In consideration of this should it not urge us to well improve our day and time not know, ing how soon the reaper will call us home. The light patches of snow here and there, declare the commencing reign of winter, but if we have stored in provisions for the occasion, we shall be numbered with the wise virgins. Our creamery that we started last spring is proving a success, and a decided improvement on the old system. The only trouble is to keep supply equal to demand# We hail all our gospel kindred with kindly greetings. The aged in Zion our fathers and mothers, those in full vigor of manhood and womanhood, the youth and children. We wish you one and all a happy New Year. May the blessings of God and an innumerable company of angels be with us all the coming year. Isaac Anstatt
