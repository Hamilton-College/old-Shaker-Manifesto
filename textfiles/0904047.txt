Put a little sulphur in the salt for sheep... Put a little sulphur in the salt for sheep, not enough to make the mess distasteful to them, and you will drive away ticks. The best time to give it is immediately after shearing, then the ticks will drop from the wool easily. In winter if the hens can be with the sheep they will pick off the ticks when thev come to the surface of the wool.
