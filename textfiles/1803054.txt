Brother White was convinced that it 'warn't no use a-flyin' Brother White was convinced that 'it warn't no use a-flyin', nor a-fleein', from the wrath of heaven, ' which he charitably assumed to have fallen upon his rival. 'For there's the wind, and the whirlwind, and the tornado to overtake,' said he. 'And there's the thunder a-rollin' and a-clappin' to warn. And there's the rain a-down-fallin', and the rivers a-uprisin' to drown. And there's the lightnin' a-dartin' forrards and a-rekilin' backards to strike. And there's the hail a-slantin' ind a-slitherin' to smite. And there's earthquakes, and there's seaquakes to swaller up. And there's wild beasts a-ragin' and a-roarin' and a-gnashin' of teeth to devour. And there's all manner of pestiferous creatures acreepin' over and a-crawlin' under. And there's pits and pitfalls, and traps and trapfalls, and no man maketh a way to escape in that day. And wherefore? Whatever is to be, will be, whether it cometh to pass or doth not attain to it, and when the time for the fulfillment of purpose scomes it will not stay its hand for John Shore, nor ten thousand thousand thousand sich.
