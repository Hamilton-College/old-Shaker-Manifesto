Rules for Pleasant lines. � V book published a year ago, 'The Five Taleuts of a Woman,' gave the following rules for beauty of expression, which the writer of the book claimed was much more attractive than beauty of features : '1. Learn to govern yourselves and to be gentle and patient. '2. Guard your tempers, especially in seasons of ill-health, irritation, and trouble, and soften them by prayers and a sense of your own shortcomings and errors. '3. Never speak or act in anger until you have prayed over your words or acts. '4. Remember that, valuable as is the gift of speech, silence is often more valuable. '5. Do not expect too much from others, but forbear and forgive, as you desire forbearance and forgiveness yourself. '6. Never retort a sharp or angry word. It is the second word that makes the quarrel. '7. Beware of the first disagreement. '8. Learn to speak in a gentle tone of voice. '9 Learn to say kind and pleasant things whenever opportunity offers. '10. Study the characters of each, and sympathize with all in their troubles, however small. '11. Do not neglect little things if they can effect the comfort of others in the smallest degree. '12. Avoid moods and pets and fits of sulkiness. ''13. Learn to deny yourself and prefer others. '�14. Beware of meddlers and tale-bearers. '15. Never charge a bad motive if a good one is conceivable. '16. Be gentle and firm with children.'
