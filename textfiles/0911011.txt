THE MINISTER I like a preacher to strike hard and straight With fiery scorn, at wrong, deceit, and hate ! Nor compromise a thought of his true feeling. Or of the Holy Gospel's just revealing. The human heart his occult study make, His strifeâ€”the finer sentiments to wake ; To rouse the slumbering manhood of humanity, And rescue hearts from worldly pride and vanity. Turn the fierce rush of thought to noble action, Fill selfish streams with tides of benefaction ; Teach scorn of policy and compromising, From mammon's bondage aid the spirit's rising. Beiore each soul to place a motive glorious, Till high ambition upward turns victorious !
