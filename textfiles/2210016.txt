Shaker Station, Conn. Sept. 1892. The golden autumn has arrived with all its beauty, and precious freight. The weather is cool and frost has been feared the past few days. Co.n is being cut down, and we expect a very good yield. Potatoes are a very good quality but not a great quantity. Blackberries are abundant. Fruit is a failure, not any apples to speak of in our orchards. But seedtime and harvest have come in their season, according to promise. We hear the song of the reaper pouring forth his joy as he stands amid the plentiful crops that crown his labors. And are not his feelings those of confidence and trust, in a higher power that assures him of a golden harvest in its season. Bountiful Father! praise to thee for thy kind, and generous .providence. Thou hast not permitted the promise of springto die, but hast watched over the seeds and tender plants, and kept away the destroying frost, and the blighting mildew. And as the hour is near at hand when the Husbandman shall gather in his harvest, it becomes us to be ready and laden with fruit. In the midst of plenty we are often reminded of those who live in poverty and desolation. And why? because they are unwilling to make the sacrifice required to live this pure life that the Believer enjoys. A good home, with pleasant arrangements and comforts. We would that more were willing to accept the invitation of the gospel. 'Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.' M. Witham. The Apostle says, Labor therefore, to make your calling and election sure. Not only to be called, but to be Christians. The labor is a great and unceasing one, and a self-denying one, but the reward is also great. The rules for the work are plainly laid down, as is also the way of ascertaining when one has acquired the right of being called by this blessed name. 'For the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, faith, meekness.' Those who are striving for these virtues, and are true Christians, are assured that 'neither things present nor things to come shall separate them from the love of God.' A first-class hen-house' does not make first-class hens. Unless gravel is sharp it is valueless for hens. Hence hens prefer sharp shells or grit to round gravel. The reason they eat more shells or grit when laying is because, when laying, more food is required, and consequently more digestion and assimilation. It pays to give fowls the best of care. Kindness to the hens returns through the egg basket. The Cochin is a good layer, very hardy, unexceptionable as a mother and not given to excessive incubation and good for the table. Ground or broken bone is one of the best substances that can be fed to hens. Fowls that moult late should be disposed of and their places filled with pullets. D. Orcutt.
