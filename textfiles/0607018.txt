GRATITUDE For every blessing I receive — For every gift that comes from heaven — For every ill which I relieve, And every smile that's to me given, I would give thanks. For precious love, unspoken by word — For each endearment understood — For music of the soul, yet heard, And growth of a continual good, Thanks, more than thanks. And while amid these silent meads, My home must be upon the sod, While my humanity has needs Which seek supplies from thee, my G od — Oh, fail me not the blissful thrill — A brother's cheer, a sister's love — With these my soul has measured fill; Without them there's to me no God !
