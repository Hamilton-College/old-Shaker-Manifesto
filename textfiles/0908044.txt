TRUE STRENGTH We must measure a man's strength by the power of the feelings he subdues, not by the power of those who subdue him. And hence, composure is often the highest result of strength. Did we ever see a man receive a flagrant injury, and then reply calmly? That is a man spiritually strong. Or, did we ever see a man in anguish, stand as if carved out of solid rock, as if mastering himself ? Or, one bearing a hopeless, daily trial, remain silent and never tell the world what cankered his home peace ? That is strength. We too often mistake strong feelings for strong character. A man, who bears all before him, before whose frown domestics tremble, and whose bursts of fury make the children of the household quake, because he has his way in all things, we call him a strong man. The truth is, that he is a weak man; it is his passions that are strong â€” he, mastered by them, is weak.
