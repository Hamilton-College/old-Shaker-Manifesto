Encouragement HORTENSE HOOSER Let all who believe in the second appearing Of Christ, the anointed, through good Mother Ann, Resolve to go forward, by faithful crossbearing, And practice true peace and good-will unto man. By daily obedience and strict self-denial, The soul is enabled to prosper and grow; Through many earth-conflicts and many sore trials, Be joyfully leaving all sorrows below. Remember, this work is not done by the slothful, The crown is not won, nor the treasure se cured, Except by the brave, the devout, and determined, And such have their passports to heaven insured. Should all within Zion live to their profession, How sweetly and smoothly the moments would roll! The weak, inexperienced, be nursed and pro; tected, And love's cheering pinions wave peace to the soul. The streamlets that flow very small at beginning,— They deepen and widen while rippling along; Just so doth the soul that's established in Zion Gain strength,—swell the ranks of the glorified throng. Then let all unitedly move on together, The life-giving water will bear us safe through; While angelic guards are surrounding the faithful, Diffusing rich blessings like heavenly dew. This earth-life is only the time of probation, Through which living pilgrims are willing to go; Well-knowing elysian fields lie before them, Where shortly they'll reap all the good seed they sow. With hearts of thanksgiving, we'll adore God forever, That we have a place in his kingdom of peace; With hearts of thanksgiving, we'll praise Christ and Mother, Whose fountain of love will forever increase.
