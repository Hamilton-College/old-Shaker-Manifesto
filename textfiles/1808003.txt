OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Agnes E. Netwton. Over and over again The self-same lessons are taught; Over and over again Until in the mind inwrought. Creation, in its every phase, is one grand repetition of the Divine plan. Well might the wise preacher declare,� ' The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun.' 'Practice makes perfect,' is a truism that cannot be disputed, and it is the over and over again, so to speak, that reveals the hidden treasures of knowledge, new to the discoverer, but as old, in reality, as the Eternal law, by which they were fashioned. The world's benefactors, in all ages, have been found amorg those, who have worked at their task 'with a resolute will, Over and over again.' We find this theory aptly illustrated and sustained by the story of a certain King's observance of the persistent spider.� The persevering efforts of the great Naturalist in boyhood wisely directed by an excellent teacher, in dissecting and studying the first specimen of Natural History examined by him.�The success of the famous tragedian and elocutionist, in being able to render, with such marvelous effect, the Lord's prayer after thirty years of devoted study.� The brilliant achievements of the Swedish Nightingale in the realm of song after repeated disappointments and defeats in early life ; and surpassing all these, and other examples equally worthy, the untiring devotion of the disciples of truth, who amid the most cruel forms of persecution have investigated the labyrinths of social, moral and religious science ; revealing truths which have rent the vail of superstitious darkness ; guiding humanity from error into the perfect light of God. Then welcome the labor, as well as the results of the tireless unceasing 'Over and over again;' everbearing in mind that we are following in the footsteps of the Master who never wearied in performing the mission of his Heavenly Father ; which was so imperfectly understood and appreciated even by his immediate followers. The cup of cold water given in the name of a disciple, the unselfish act, kindly word and earnest prayer, repeated 'over and over again,' will insure ultimate success and an entrance to the pearly gates where will await the blessing of Him who uttered the golden text, ' Be ye therefore perfect eve_i as your father which is in heaven is perfect.'
