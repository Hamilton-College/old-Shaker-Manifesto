OUR EXCHANGES The Student's Journal, is devoted to Graham's Standard Phonography. â€¢ Publisht by Andrew J. Graham &amp; Co., 744 Broadway, N. Y. The Student's Journal is the oldest and best phonographic Journal in America. Each number has eight pages of lithographed phonography. News of importance to phonographers, portraits, biographical sketches, and facsimiles of the reporting notes of prominent phonographers are frequently given. One book firm advertises for sale, 'A Shaker Bible,' and the statement is quite misleading. The Shakers use the same version of the Bible as is used in all the Christian churches. The Book which some are pleased to call a Shaker Bible is largely a history of the Catholic and Protestant churches. 'Kind words are the music of the . world, they have a power which seems to be beyond natural causes. It seems as if they could almost do what in reality God alone can do, soften the hard and angry hearts of men. No one has ever been converted by a sarcasm, crusht, perhaps, if the sarcasm was clever enough, but drawn nearer to God, never.' Those who write for 'Home Notes' should not forget the order of that department, and write an essay on either religion or domestic duties. An article of 350 words will do quite well. The above is from The Manifesto of May 1895, page 119.
