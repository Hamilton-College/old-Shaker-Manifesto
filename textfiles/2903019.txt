ALWAYS SOME ONE BELOW. By Ella Higginson. On the lowest round of the ladder I firmly planted my feet, And lookt up in the dim, vast distance That made my future so sweet. I climbed till my vision grew weary, I climbed till my brain was on fire, I planted each footstep with wisdom Yet I never seemed to get higher. For this round was glazed with indifference And that one was glazed with scorn, And when I graspt firmly another I found under velvet a thorn. Till my brain grew weary of planning And my heart strength began to fail, And the flush of the morning's excitement Ere evening commenced to pale. But just as my hands were unclasping Their hold on the last gained round, When my hopes coming back from the future, Were sinking again to the ground, One who had climbed near the summit Reacht backward a helping hand And refrcsht, encouraged, strengthened I took once again my stand. And I wishOh I wishthat the climbers Would never forget as they go That, tho weary may seem their climbing, There is always some one below. Journal of Education.
