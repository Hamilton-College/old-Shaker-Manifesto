Editor Manifesto:--I send you the following poem written... Sonyea, Livingston Co., N. Y. Nov. 1888. Editor Manifesto :ï¿½I send you the following poem written in memory of our 'Angel Mother' Eldress Betsy Sneeden. I was visiting the Society at Groveland at the time of her departure for the upper home, so could not attend the last services rendered in honor of our precious mother. I have been personally acquainted with Eldress Betsy for nearly forty-eight years and have ev57 er found her to be one of the loyal, truehearted souls, dealing justly with all, at home and abroad. Our Society at West Pittsfield fully realizes our loss, kuowing that a bright Star has gone from our midst, gone but to shine brighter in the Spiritual Firmament. Maria L. Doane.
