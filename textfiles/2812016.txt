A BOY AND HIS MOTHER By Annie Armour. Can a boy get away from the prayers of his mother, Or sink to a depth that her love can not reach? Can the billows of time pile so high on each other, That he can't see her form on the white, shining beach? Can the dark clouds of sin fold, so closely about him, That the light of her faith does not shine on his way? Can he feel all the friends of this world spurn and doubt him, While his mother has faith, love and trust to still pray ? Ah, no! not a boy can escape from the pleading. Ascending each day from her bedside to God. He will still hear the tones of her voice interceding When the dear form is laid 'neaththe flower strewn sod. Then pray, motherSj pray while the boy still is breathing, And pray if Death's angel has sung in Ms ear, That God in his mercy the boy is receiving, For the sake of the prayers you have said for him here.
