Kind Words. The Manifesto is hailed every month... Enfield, Conn. March 1884. The Manifesto is hailed every month with joy, by myself, and by others. As a sterlingfriend of truth and virtue, 'it wakes loud echoes. ' It never disappoints. Something to comfort, to cheer and to encourage in every number. It stands in the front rank in regard to lurity of tone, and high aim in advancing true lappiness. ' God bless you ' for a periodical that I can feel safe in recommending to every one. Daniel Orcutt.
