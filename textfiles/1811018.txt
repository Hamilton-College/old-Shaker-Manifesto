All God's passages have been fulfilled literally and wonderfully... Elder John Couch All God's passages have been fulfilled literally and wonderfully. I am looking for the Lord from heaven in a very few months. Do you, said one,ï¿½believe he will come in 1889. Yes, I do. There I have said it. He may come before then, but I don't see how he can tarry much longer. We can't get away from the 45 years of waiting time and that period brings us just about to 1889.
