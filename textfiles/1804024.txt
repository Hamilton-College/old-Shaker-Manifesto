To the Memory of LYDIA LEWIS. Katie Boyle. Her weary spirit so long encased In the tenement of clay, Has rent at last her earthly bands And has torn herself away; Away from earth and earthly cares So long and patiently born, Until the summons came for her To enter her future home. At crosses great she murmured not, They were too heavy to bear; Nor did she flinch when duty called On her to perform her share; But with a Christian's fortitude, She gave her might and main, Knowing a recompense was sure For all her toils and her pains. When her cup so full of sorrow Seemed e'en full to running o'er, She would quaff the bitter contents Meekly whispering, one drop more; For she claimed to be one chosen By the Fathc r, who in love, Chasteneth the child he loveth, And doth guard their every move. All her life has been a lesson We should daily strive to learn; Charity her motto ever And love toward her fellow-man. E'en when her last sun was sinking And death on her brow was sealed, Her visage bespoke God's praises For his love to her revealed. Her footprints on the sands of time, They can never be erased; Nor pictures of her memory left, They can never be effaced; But as a grand memorial ï¿½ Will stand erect evermore; As a beacon in the distance * Aiding to perfection's goal. Truth was inscribed on her banner While treading the upward way Leading to life everlasting In that land of endless day; Where cometh no sin nor sorrow But peace eternally reigns; Where the sunshine of love so bright Will banish gloom and despair. From our midst we oft shall miss her Now her voice is hushed for aye, But we could not think to hold her Since she could no longer stay. So now, kind guardian angels, We commit her to your care, Trusting she'll find you waiting, And the beautiful gates ajar. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
