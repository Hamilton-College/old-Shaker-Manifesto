Dear Manifesto;-ï¿½January 23, 1883, my Grandfather asked for a home and my Father placed me with the Shakers. Just three months before this happened my Mother was attacked with a serious illness, called Spinal Meningitis. After six weeks of suffering she expired, or her spirit passed out of her body. Her last words were, 'Father take me home, ' often did she repeat them. Her greatest anxiety was that her children, a little brother and myself, should be kindly and wisely cared for, after she was gone. I know many children who can tell the sad experience of an irreligious Mother, not so with mine. I often wondered why Mother prayed with us so many times and read the Bible so much, now I think perhaps she thought she should not live long and so she tried to teach us how to be good that we might be protected when she should leave us. Had my Father not placed me with the Shakers, I should have missed my dear Mother very much. I think I love her as I cannot tell and I think she loves and watches over me, I would love to speak to her so much. I am a favored child and I will try to be just as good as I can to repay my kind friends who are my Mothers so I am not an orphan. I have written this so that if there are any little children abroad who read the Manifesto and who lose their mothers they may ask for this good home with me. They must be willing to leave all their naughty ways. Address, Maud Mansir.
