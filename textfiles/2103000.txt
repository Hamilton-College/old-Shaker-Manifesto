THE KENTUCKY REVIVAL. By Richard M'Nemar OF Usrioisr Village, Ohio. Published in Albany, N. !'., in 1808. No. 3. Of the first appearances of the extraordinary ivork, in different parts of Kentucky, in 1800 and 1801. The first extraordinary appearances of the power of God in the late revival, began about the close of the last century, in Logan and Christian counties ; on the waters of Gasper and Red Rivers. In the spring of 1801, the same extraordinary work broke out in Mason County, upper part of Kentucky; of which I was an eye witness, and can therefore, with greater confidence, testify what I have heard, seen and felt. It began first in individuals who had been under deep convictions oi sin, and great trouble about their souls, and had fasted and prayed, and diligently searched the Scriptures, and had undergone distresses of mind inexpressibly sore, until they had obtained a comfortable hope of salvation. And from seeing and feeling the love of Christ, and his willingness to save all that would forsake their sins and turn to God through him; and feeling how freely his love and goodness flowed to them, it kindled their love to other souls, that were lost in their sins; and an ardent desire that they might come and partake of that spiritual light, life and comfort, which appeared infinite in its nature, and free to all. Under such an overpowering weight of the divine goodness, as tongue could not express, they were constrained to cry out, with tears and trembling, and testify a full and free salvation in Christ, for all that would come; and to warn their fellowcreatures of the danger of continuing in sin. They entreated them in the most tender and affectionate manner, to turn from it and seek the Lord, in sure and certain hope that he would be found. Under such exhortations, the people began to be affected in a very strange manner. At first they were taken with an inward throbbing of the heart; then with weeping and trembling: from that to crying out in apparent agony of soul; falling down and swooning away till every appearance of animal life was suspended, and the person appeared to be in a trance. From this state they would recover under different sensations, which will be more particularly noticed hereafter. The following extract of a letter, dated Caneridge, Jan. 30, 1801, gives a striking account of the work, as it first appeared in the lower parts of Kentucky and Cumberland. 'The work is still increasing in Cumberland. It has overspread the whole country. It is in Nashville, Barren, Muddy, Grasper, Redbanks and Knoxville.' 'J. M. has been there two months ; he says it exceeds anything he ever saw or heard. Children and all, seem to be engaged: but children are the most active in the work. When they speak, it appears that the Lord sends his spirit to accompany it with power to the hearts of sinners. They all seem to be wrought in an extraordinary way. They lie as though they were dead, for some time, without pulse or breath; some longer, some a shorter time. Some rising with joy and triumph ; others crying for mercy. As soon as they get comfort, they cry to sinners ; exhorting them day and night to turn to the Lord.' * * P. H. It is worthy of notice that a work by which God intended to bring down the pride and loftiness of man, should begin in little children. By this it was manifest who were the furthest lost from God, and what course must be taken in order to return. At a sacrament, near Flemingsburgh, the last Sabbath in April, the power of God was very visible among the people through the whole of the occasion ; under which there was much weeping, trembling and convulsion of soul. What was the most solemn and striking, was the case of two little girls, who in the time of meeting, cried out in great distress. They both continued for some time praying and crying for mercy, till one of them received a comfortable hope ; and then turning to the other, cried out 'O ! come to Christ! Take hold of his promise and trust in him. He is able to save to the uttermost! O ! I have found peace to my soul! O ! the precious Savior! come just as you are ! he will take away the stony heart and give you a heart of flesh! You cannot make yourself any better. Just give up your heart to Christ, now! You are not a greater sinner than others. You need not wait another moment!' Thus she continued exhorting, until her little companion received a ray from heaven, that produced a sudden and sensible change : then rising with her in her arms, she cried out in a most affecting mannerï¿½'O here is another star of light!' These children were perhaps nine or ten years old. The Sabbath following about twenty persons were struck in the congregation of Cabin-Creek, Mason Co. Among the first who cried out in distress, was a girl about twelve years old. Their convictions of their lost state, from a sudden opening of that pure holiness to which sin stands directly opposed, were quick as the lightning's flash; and came with such weight, that had they not, in some way or other, opened their case, they must have sunk into the horrors of despair. It was dire necessity which at first obliged them to expose themselves to public view, as objects of pity ; for everything of the kind was looked upon by the generality, even of professors, as wild enthusiasm, or the fruits of a disordered brain. There were, however, a few who understood the disorder, and were ready to fly to their relief and proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that were bound. Here a new scene was opened, while some trembled like one in a fit of the ague; wept or cried out, lamenting their distance from God, and exposedness to his wrath; others were employed in praying with them, encouraging them to believe on the Son of God and to venture upon his promise. To give up their wicked, rebellious heart, just as it was ; for God to take it away, and give them a, heart of flesh ; singing hymns and giving thanks to God, for the display of his power, without any regard to former rules of order. At this, some were offended and withdrew from the assembly, determined to oppose it, as a work of the wicked one. But all their objections only tended to open the way for the true nature and spirit of the work to shine out; and encourage the subjects of it to set out with warmer zeal to promote it. Accordingly a meeting was appointed a few evenings after, to which a crowd of awakened souls flocked, and spent the whole night in singing hymns, praying and exhorting one another. At this meeting one man was struck down and lay for about an hour, in the situation above mentioned. This put the matter beyond dispute, that the work was supernatural ; and the outcry which it raised against sin, confirmed a number in the belief that it was from above. From small beginnings, it gradually spread. The news of these strange operations flew abroad, and attracted many to come and see; who were convinced, not only from seeing and hearing, but feeling; and carried home the testimony, that it was the living work of God. This stirred up others, and brought out still greater multitudes. And these strange exercises still increasing, and having no respect to any stated hours of worship, it was found expedient to encamp onv the ground, and continue the meeting day and night. To these encampments the people flocked in hundreds and thousands, on foot, on horseback and in carriages. At first appearance, these meetings exhibited nothing to the spectator but a scene of confusion that could scarce be put into human language. They were generally opened with a sermon, near the close of which there would be an unusual outcry; some bursting forth into loud ejaculations of prayer, or thanksgiving for the truth. Others breaking out in emphatical sentences of exhortation. Others flying to their careless friends, with tears of compassion, beseeching them to turn to the Lord. ' Some, struck with terror, and hastening through the crowd to make their escape, or pulling away their relations. Others, trembling, weeping and house; who, like so many corpses, covered a considerable part of the floor. There were persons at this meeting, from Caneridge, Concord, Eagle-Creek and other neighboring congregations, who partook of the spirit of the work, which was a particular means of its spreading. The next general camp-meeting was held at Concord, in the County of Bourbon, about the last of May. The number who attended on this occasion was supposed to be about four thousand. Seven Presbyterian ministers were present, four of whom were opposed to the work and spoke against it. On the fourth day about noon, the evidence became so powerful, that they all professed to be convinced that it was the work of God. One of them addressed the assembly with tears, acknowledging that notwithstanding they had long been praying to the Lord to pour out his spirit, yet when it came they did not know it, but wickedly opposed the answer of their own prayers. On this occasion, no sex nor color, class nor description, were exempted from the pervading influence of the spirit; even from the age of eight months to sixty years, there were evident subjects of this marvelous operation. The meeting continued five days and four nights ; and after the people generally scattered from the ground, numbers convened in different places and continued the exercise much longer. Even where they were not collected together, these wonderful operations continued among every class of people and in every situation; in their houses and fields, and in their daily crying out for the Lord Jesus to have mercy upon them: fainting away till every appearance of life was gone, and the extremities of the body assumed the coldness of a corpse. Others surrounding them with melodious songs, or fervent prayers for their happy resurrection in the love of Christ. Others collecting into circles around this variegated scene, contending with arguments for and against. Under such appearances, the work would continue for several days and nights together. I will now mention particularly, some of the meetings of this kind, with a few concomitant circumstances, from which the work took a general spread in the year 1801. The first was held at Cabin-Creek. It began on the 22nd. of May, and continued four days and three nights. The scene was awful beyond description ; the falling, crying out, praying, exhorting, singing and shouting, exhibited such new and striking evidences of a supernatural power, that few, if any, could escape without being affected. Such as tried to run from it, were frequently struck on the way, or impelled by some alarming signal to return : and so powerful was the evidence on all sides, that no place was found for the obstinate sinner to shelter himself but under the protection of prejudiced and bigoted professors. No circumstance at this meeting appeared more striking, than the great numbers that fell on the third night; and to prevent their being trodden under foot by the multitude, they were collected together and laid out in order, on two squares of the meeting- employments, falling down and crying out under conviction, or singing and shouting with unspeakable joy, were so common, that the whole country round about, seemed to be leavened with the spirit of the work. The next camp-meeting was at Eagle-Creek, Ohio. It began June oth. and continued four days and three nights. The number of people was not so great, as the country was new, but the work was equally powerful according to the number. At this meeting the principal leading characters in the place fully embraced the spirit of the work, which laid a permanent foundation for its continuance and spread in that quarter. The next general meeting was at Pleasant Point, Kentucky, which equaled if not surpassed any that had been before. Here, the Christian minister, the common professor, the deist and debauchee, were forced to take one common lot among the wounded, and confess with equal candor, that hitherto they had been total strangers to the religion of Jesus. From this meeting, the work was spread extensively through Bourbon, Fayette, and other neighboring Counties, and was carried by a number of its subjects to the south side of Kentucky, where it found in the hearts of many, a permanent residence. The general meeting at Indian Creek began the 24th. of July, and continued about five days. To this meeting the subjects of the work were generally collected from all quarters, and abundantly strengthened each other in the exercises of prayer, exhortation, singing, shouting and leaping for joy. But there was very little appearance of that power which strikes conviction to the heart of the sinner, until the third day. A boy, by appearance about twelve years old, retired from the stand in time of preaching under a very extraordinary impression, and having mounted a log at some distance, and raising his voice in a very affecting manner, he attracted, in a few minutes, the main body of the people. With tears, he cried aloud to the wicked, warning them of their danger, denouncing their certain doom if they persisted in their sins, expressing his love to their souls, and desire that they would turn to the Lord and be saved. He was held up by two men, and spoke for about an hour, with that convincing eloquence that could be inspired only from above. AVrhen his strength seemed quite exhausted and language failed to describe the feelings of his soul, he raised his hand and dropping his handkerchief, wet with perspiration from his little face, cried out, 'Thus, O sinner! shall you drop into hell, unless you forsake your sins and turn to the Lord.' At that moment some fell like those who are shot in battle, and the work spread in a manner which human language cannot describe. (to be continued.)
