PRECEPT AND PRACTICE An ingenious writer has made a good point at the expense of those whose advice is better than their practice,by comparing them to the wood-pigeon, which cries. 'Do, do, do,' all day, but never does any thing itself. The value of good advice to the hearer does not always depend upon the character or performance of the speaker, but this fact hardly excuses the volunteer counselor for being stone deaf to the wisdom which he dins into the ears of others, nor does it promote the speedy acceptance of his suggestions. After all, people not unreasonably expect a guide to be somewhat familiar with the ground over which he professes to lead others.
