HUMAN ASPIRATIONS. The splendor of a path untried; The matchless glory�just ahead; The something that has time defied; The mysteries around us spread; The unattainable�how fair! The fruit that hangs above our reach, The pleasure that awaits somewhere, The lesson life has tried to teach. Ambition's sails are ever set To stranger lands by man untrod, While nature holds her revels yet, Watcht only by the eyes of God. No matter if the pathway be Markt by a line of martyr's graves, Man struggles on at last to see, Unsatisfied, the goal he craves. We measure countless miles of space; Turn to grand suns each twinkling star, And planets in their pathway trace, And know the worlds, both near and far. We tell how swift a ray of light, Will travel through the ether wide, And soar to Nature's grandest height� And yet we are not satisfied. The glory of each newness tux'ns Our thoughts unto a higher round, Yet something in our being yearns For something that we have not found. And then we learn, as years go by, Joy is not found in paths untried; And, pausing, vaguely wonder, why The soul is never satisfied. Selected.
