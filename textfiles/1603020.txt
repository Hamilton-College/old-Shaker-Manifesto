AMONG THE SHAKERS. NO. 1. Successful Communism at Mount Lebanon�Interview with Elder Evans�A Lunch�Principles of Faith and Practice�Spiritual Guidance� Modes of Life�Practical Keligion, Ok a recent tramp through the Berkshire Hills I veered out of my track for fifteen or twenty miles to call on the Shakers at Mount Lebanon, N. Y., the headquarters of the sect. It was a bright, cool Autumn morning when I strode out of Lee, and the church bells were ringing as I passed through Lenox. Dudes with English clothes and single barrelled eye glasses were dawdling through the streets, and important looking persons were speeding down the elm shaded avenues in glittering coupes, driven by coachmen in livery. People go to the country to cut that sort of figure ! An easy walk across the mountains, rich in panoply of gold and crimson, took me to the village of Hancock, which is occupied almost entirely by Shakers, and there I paused for lunch. What was set before me is here set down : Cold beef, Potato cake, White bread, Apple pie, Brown bread, Milk, Butter, Pickles, Boiled rice, Cream cheese, Baked beans, Cottage cheese, Blackberry jam, Cake, Blackberry pie, Doughnuts, And the bill was twenty five cents ! I reproduce this bill of fare because it is characteristic of the Shaker cuisine. The cooking is worthy of Delmonico's though the habitues of that restaurant might regard it as limited in scope. For breakfast and dinner, however, eggs, tea, coffee and all the fruits and vegetables of the season are added. The elder to whom I was referred as capable of yielding information respecting the modes of life of his peculiar people, shook his head when I began to ply him with questions, and said that he would not talk with me on the Sabbath, but would do so on any week day. Time being precious I took the road again, crossed the State line and was shortly at the head of a long, curving street, descending into a lovely valley, bordered by large three and four story buildings, some of stone and some of wood, that a stranger might suppose were factories or Summer hotels. This was Mount Lebanon, and the buildings were the residences of the communities, or 'families' as they are called. Not a face was seen at the windows, not a man, woman or child was in the street. Sabbath repose was over all. But as I passed the large meeting house services were under way. At intervals I heard a loud and joyous song, and through the windows could see the circle of worshipers as they half marched, half danced about the singers. The music was singularly bright and inspiring, well defined in melody, simple in harmonic arrangement and possessed of notable spontaneity and spirit. It was sung by a choir of voices as sweet as any that one will find in our city churches, and the voices were not less sweet than hearty. There is but one public service on Sunday in this church and as I was too late for it I Cogged down the silent street to the house oc cupiedbythe 'north family,' where lives Elder Frederic Evans, most noted of the apostles of Shakerism. He is a tall, grave, quiet man, on the shady side of middle life, dressed in the simple and sensible garb of his associates and suggesting, when furnished with cloak and staff and wide brimmed hat, one of the pilgrims who colonized New England. Such serious, earnest, thoughtful men must the Puritans have been ; such simple, prayerful lives must they have lived. Conducting me through the stone nagged lower hall of the building and across a garden where a fountain of pure water bubbled among beds of richly colored flowers, he entered a building in the rear and waved me into a room plainly furnished and of absolute cleanliness. There was a table laden with books in it, several chairs and a stove, and opening from it a smaller room with two beds and surrounded with a row of hooks for clothing. 'Is it true, ' I asked, 'that the Shakers are decreasing? ' ' Yea, ' replied the Elder, ' but only in proportion as other sects are decreasing. Great religious movements occur in cycles or in periods. Just now the forces acting on religion are centrifugal; by and by they will be centripetal. Each great period carries us farther onward and higher up. We are learning all the time. Take liberalism in religion. Universalism is permeating the orthodox churches, for the prophecy that death and hell shall be destroyed is true. The Shakers held that doctrine of old, and prophecies run parallel to law. We are spiritualists, and believe in the active work of spirits after death. Jesus did not establish His church until He had been executed. Nay, we do not take the Bible literally, for much of it is allegorical. The spirit of it is what we look upon as the essential part. The true Bible is all Bible�ours, the Koran, the Talmud, the Bhagvat, the Zend Avesta�the moral guides ot all peoples gathered into one. We look on the Bible as a book of the morals, philosophy, history and science, pretty bad science�of the Jews. Our souls used to be tired within us when the world's people came here and talked and argued about three Gods in one and the atonement and all those old orthodox ideas. Shakerism combines science, religion and inspiration; it is practical religion. We live as families, each member doing his share of work, all mutually helpful; we discountenance war, we do not go to law, we are celibates, monks and nuns without bolts and bars, we own all tilings in common except the clothes we wear ; we do not vote, we use only yea and nay for affirmative and negative, we aim to be just to all men, we do not swear, we are simple in our lives, we eat but little flesh and none of the flesh of swine, and we keep our buildings and persons clean. ' ' You think that celibacy should be generally practiced? In that case the world would be speedily depopulated, would it not?' ' We think all mankind should be divided into two classes: Shakers and Quakers. We believe marriage necessary, but for the continuance of the race only. All men and women cannot be Shakers, nor do we wish them to be. The Quakers have returned to the original state of the church; they aim at honesty and simplicity; they furnish the world with no paupers or ciiminals, and though they practice marriage it is such marriage as can be sanctioned. The Shakers have spiritualized the Quaker doctrines and have re-established the system of communism that was in vogue in the Church of Jerusalem which lasted 300 years. The priests of that church were celibates u1 til the fifteenth Gentile bishop introduced marriage. With marriage came private property ; with private property came wrangling; with wrangling came war. Our communism is merely the communism of the time of Moses. Private property in land is of recent date. It is a pernicious thing. Henry George has been inspired to contest it. It is outrageous that one man�that man, perhaps, a foreign aristocrat�should absorb thousands and even millions of acres to himself, as is the case in the Western territories. If the Brooklyn Eagle were to establish itself on the broad basis of land nationalization or limitation, it would become the mightiest force for truth in this land. '
