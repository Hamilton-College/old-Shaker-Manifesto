In setting hens, it is very important... In setting hens, it is very important to pro vide dry earth, or some good substitute, in the bottom of the box or barrel. Quantities of chickens are counted on that never hatch, every spring, for want of a little common sense in this very thing. A simple nest of hay or shavings on the bare floor will not answer. The hen who steals her nest knows how to do it, and hatch ten out of every dozen eggs. Provide something to hold the heat under the eggs while the hen leaves the nest to feed, and make it easy for the hen to supply her want without absenting herself too long from the nest.
