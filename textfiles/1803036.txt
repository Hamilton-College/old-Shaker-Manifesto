COL. INGERSOLL ON LABOR [Contributed by Rachel Webb.] He says we are but little above Savages. Cannibalism is in existence worse than among the Heathen. In a recent speech on the evils of the times Col. Robert Ingersoll makes the following astounding assertions : In the days of savagery the strong devoured the weak�actually ate their flesh. In spite of all the laws that man has made, in spite of all advance in science, the strong, the cunning, the heartless still live on the weak, the unfortunate and foolish. True, they do not eat their flesh or drink their blood, but they live on their labor, on their self-denial, their weariness and want. The poor man who deforms himself by toil, who labors for wife and child through all- his anxious, barren, wasted life�who goes to the grave without ever having had one luxury� has been the food for others. He has been devoured by his fellow men. The poor woman living in the bare and lonely room, cheerless and fireless, sewing night and day to keep starvation from a child, is slowly being eaten by her fellow men. When I take into consideration the agony of civilized life�the number of failures, the poverty, the anxiety, the tears, the withered hopes, the bitter realities, the hunger, the crime, the humiliation, the shame�I am almost forced to say that cannibalism, after all, is the most merciful form in which man has ever lived upon his fellow man. It is impossible for any man with a good heart to be satisfied with this world as it now is. No one can truly enjoy even what he earns�what he knows to be his own�knowing that millions of his fellow men are in misery and want. When we think of the famished, we feel that it is almost heartless to eat. To meet the ragged and shivering makes one almost ashamed to be well dressed and warm�one feels as though his heart was as cold as their bodies. In a world filled with millions and millions of acres of land waiting to be tilled, where one man can raise the food for hundreds, yet millions are on the edge of famine. Who can comprehend the stupidity at the bottom of this truth? Is there to be no change? Are 'the law of supply and demand, ' invention and science, monopoly and competition, capital and legislation, always to be enemies of those who toil? Will the workers always be ignorant enough and stupid enough to give their earnings for the useless? Will they support millions of soldiers to kill the sons of other working men? Will they always build temples for ghosts and phantoms, and live in huts and dens themselves? Will they forever allow parasites wijth crowns, and vampires with miters, to live upon their blood? Will they remain the slaves of the beggars they support? Will honest men stop taking off their hats to successful fraud? Will industry, in the presence ot crowned idleness, forever fall upon its knees, and will the lips unstained by lies forever kiss the robed impostor's hand? Will they understand that beggars cannot be generous, and that every healthy man must earn the right to live? Will they finally say that the man who has had equal privileges with all others has no right to complain, or will they follow the example that has been set by their oppressors? Will they learn that force, to succeed, must have a thought behind it, and that anything done, in order that it may endure must rest upon the corner stone of justice?
