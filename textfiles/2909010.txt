Shakers, N. Y. July, 1899. As we note the shortening of the days observable in the rising and setting of the sun, we are reminded of the words of that old hymn commencing, 'Our days are gliding swiftly by,' and if we could we would not detain them. The present is constantly becoming history, as it is recorded in the annals of the past, and the prophetic future is becoming the living present. The pleasure of anticipation in looking forward gives the inspiration to every healthy mind to struggle for the best and make the futnre superior to the present. During the month of July we were favored in a manner that seldom falls to our lot. Our Beloved Elder Ira Lawson spent Sunday the 23rd ult. with us, and although the visit was of short duration when counted by hours, yet the blessing that came to us while in spiritual communion with him could not be measured by an earthly standard. We also had a pleasant visit from Sister Sarah Cutler of Mt. Lebanon. In reply to the question of Elder Oliver C. Hampton as to what will destroy the Curculic? we would state that our experience has been that the most effectual means to prevent its ravages is as soon as the fruit is past the blossom, to catch them by spreading a piece of cotton sheeting six or eight feet square, under the limbs and by a sudden jar on the limb they will fall and can be caught; and by burning them and all of the defective fruit that falls. The best time is in the morning while the insects are dormant. We have seen plum and apricot trees where this system was followed three or four times in a week, or better, every morning, to yield bountiful crops of fruit while those that were neglected yielded none of any value.
