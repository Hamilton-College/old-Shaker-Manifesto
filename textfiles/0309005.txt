DRESS REFORM SoROSis has spoken some sensible words on Dress, while partaking of an im-sensible dinner at Delmonico's. Resolved, That the dress and customs of a people are the outward indications of its character, and should engage the thoughtful attention of its most intelligent men and women. Climate, and the well-established laws of health and comfort, should regulate it. That the Dress question has been left too long in the hands of the ignorant, who furnish waists of torture, and skirts of burthen; producing a female figure out of strange stuff, having but slight resemblance to a natural woman, until the taste of the nation is corrupted, and their good sense impaired. Sorosis further ' resolved, that, as mothers of daughters, and sisters of all womankind, we pledge ourselves not to dress, either ourselves or our daughters, in any style of fashion condemned by the wise and prudent, the artistic,' the physiologist, or moralist.
