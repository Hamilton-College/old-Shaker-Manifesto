OUR INVITATION A short time since, we wrote of our willingness to cordially unite, in church and life worship, with any other denomination, whose theological teachings would lead us into more Christian love and self-denial; into a more practical work of the Christ spirit, as manifested in and through the life of Jesus. As yet we have received no invitations ! We therefore invite investigationsby the general churchesâ€”a most thorough analysis of Shaker polity, principles and living results. We invite those who would be better than good Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, etc., to engage in more of the practical self-denials of Jesus; and while thereby showing a genuine love for him, they will realize more of the baptism of his spirit. More self-denial is the desiderata. As Shakers, we ask of all would-be Christians : A virgin celibacy in life, after the pattern of Jesus. A universal love for all who do the will of the Father, by denying self, faring and sharing all they possess equally and together. A peaceful, unwarlike, unworldly spirit, as illustrated by that lowly, beautiful, Christian, Jesus. A separation from the world and its sins, by confession and renunciation of its evils and its good I even as did Jesus. Such life is to us genuine Christian life. Full of crosses, until these are worn into crowns of glory ; but are there more crosses herein than Jesus bore, or more crowns than he wore? We now send an invitation to those only who are able to be thus Christian, for the kingdom of heaven's sake, on the earth.
