THE IMPELLING MOTIVE We would call to mind the object for which The Shaker is published anc continued, at an expense much greater than the income derived. Surely it is for no one's pastime ; nor for competition in excellence of anything, except the exposition of a most excellent faith. Our faith is a singular one—singular, because so few are willing to practice real, unmixed Christianity. Every device that can be offered to excuse individuals from looking the demands of genuine Christianity in the face, are being resorted to by the multitude, and consequently there is but little salvation from sin, active among the people. Heal, Christian life, will save sotds from their sins now. We feel it a duty to make known this truth ; and would preach through The Shaker, plain, unvarnished, pertinently Christian testimony, however unpalatable to ourselves or others. Before us all stands the life of Jesus, the Christ. In that life is Christianity alone represented—therein alone, is the true Christian religion. It matters not to us, nor to others, what this one or that one preached or meant by the preaching, Paul not excepted, but what was the life of Jesus, and his immediate disciples, as Christians? Herein is the security of salvation ; herein alone is all the religion worth having. For this alone The Shaker contends single handed ; while its hundreds of religious contemporaries ai*e preaching a Christianity not found in the life of Christ, but in the very opposite of Christ's life ! Shall we be sustained ia preaching genuine Christianity? Who will send us the needed encouragement to sustain The Shaker, in its unrelenting, determined assaults upon the principalities of evil, the world, the flesh, and every unchristian practice—the devils among the people ! We love our fellowmen, and our object only is, their salvation from the evils and the good which are not of Christ—unpracticed by the beautiful Jesus ! Who will lend to the Lord, by aiding the circulation of The Shaker?
