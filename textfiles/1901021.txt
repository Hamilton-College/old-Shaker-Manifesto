ST. MATT. XIII., EROM TYNDAL'S TESTAMENT The same daye wentt Jesus out of the housse, and satt by the see syde, and moche people resorted unto him, so gretly that he wet and sat in a shyppe, and all the people stode on the shoore. And he spake many thyngs to them in similituds, sayinge : behold the sower went forth to sowe, and as he sowed, some fell by the wayes syde, and the fowlls ca, and devoured it uppe. Some fell on stony grounde where it had nott moche erth, and a non it spronge uppe, because it had no depth of erth • and when the son was uppe, hit cauth heet, and for lak of rotynge wyd dred awaye. Some fell amonge thornes, and the thornes arose, and chooked it. Parte fell in goode grounde, and broght forth good frute : some an hundred fold, some fifty fold, some thyrty folde. Whosoever hath eares to heare, let him heare. And hys disciples cam, and sayde to him : Why speakest thou to them in parables : he answered and saide unto them : Hit is geven onto you to knowe the secretts of the Kyngdome of he ven, but to them it is nott geven, for whosomever hath, to him shall hit be gevne : and he shall have aboundance : But whosoevrr hath not: from him shalbe takyn awaye eve that same that he hath.—Selected
