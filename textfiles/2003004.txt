TRUTH. The Gospel of Christ comprehends every means necessary for the elevation of the human race out of . ignorance and degradation up to a state of angelic purity and happiness, and will, as it develops, draw nearer the final consummation of man and woman's redemption. It commenced at the first creation of man. It grew in Noah and all the Patriarchs ; in Moses and all the Prophets ; in Jesus and all the Apostles and Martyrs who lived and died f o r the truth. Yea, in all nations those who have loved God and worked righteousness were in the list of Saviors who stood for the cause of truth according to the light of their day. C. Dibble.
