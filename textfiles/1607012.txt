Two Different Ways 'The worldly way of greatness leads through self nnd self-seeking. God's way leads through the seeking of others good together with good to one's self,�the good of the world, the good of mankind.�The one makes self the aim and end; the other makes self merely the instrument of another and higher end. Under the influence of a Christian consecration and ambition, one offers up his whole being, with all its forces, as a gift of God, to be used in His service- The one imprisons the soul, and gives it over to all servitude of the passions ; the other ennobles it, by bringing it to the love of nobler themes and things; and it works purity and magnanimity.
