THE CHRIST WELSH POETRY. Beloved Editor�Manifesto :�I enclose a piece of poetry written in a Welsh mining village, by a girl fifteen years of age, whom the villagers pointed out to the traveler as '-daft.' F. W. E. They cry : 'He comes� The signs are sure, all lands are armed for war, The mystic number is fulfilled�He comes !' We answer : O that He would come ! We want The Christ! We want a God to burn the truth Afresh upon the forehead of the world! We want a Man to walk once more among The wrangling Pharisees, to drive the heasts And money mongers from the temple courts ; To bring the Gospel back again, and prove How all unlike the Churches are to Christ! We want that Christ again to tell the 'saints' Their sins : that they were sent to bless the poor, And they have sold themselves unto the rich ; That they were sent to preach the works of � peace, And they have filled the earth with war of words; That they were sent the messengers of love, And they have driven love out of their creeds ; That they were sent to teach men not to lie, Nor tremble when their duty led to death. O for that Christ again! He�He who would dare To tell the Churches how they lie and cant, And talk of serving God�and serve themselves ; And talk of saving souls�to save their 'cause:' And pare and narrow God's divinest truth, Until a man can hardly be a man And member of a Church. ***** Already Christ is coming. Hear ye not The footfalls of the Lord? He tramples down The cruel hedges men have built about The gate that leads to heaven. He rends the creeds, And give- their tatters to the merry winds. He does not come as bigots prophesy, To choose a handful and to d ... the rest, To found a Jewish-Gentile kingdom here, And roll the world into the past again. He comes the Spirit of a riper Age When all that is not good or true shall die� When all that's bad in custom, false in o.reed, And all that makes the boor and mars the man Shall pass away forever. Yes, He cohies To give the world a passion for the truth; To inspire us with a holy human love : To make us sure that, ere a man can be A saint, he first must be a man.
