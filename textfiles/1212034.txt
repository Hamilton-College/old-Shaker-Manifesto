I have lived in this society eight years and have seen Elder Henry once. We have had a privilege to see many of our dear friends, and I shall remember it with great pleasure. 0 that I might treasure in my heart every good word spoken by those who come to visit us. I often think, how thankful I should be for my good home. ,, We hardly thought when we were enjoying our visit with the friends from New Hampshire that the next day we should go all over the world (as it were) in our Geography with our good Superintendent. His lessons in Geology are very interesting, are they not? Have you solved that question he asked us, 'From whence came the soil?' 1 wish we could have asked Elder Henry about it, I guess he would have told us. The little card which I received I prize very highly. Hoping that our Fall term may close as pleasantly as it began, I will now close. Age 13. Your Sister, Lena.
