TWO PILGRIMS. By Frederic M'Kechnie. 'The Way of the Crown is the Way of the Cross' The sad Pilgrim sighed, as he trod a strait Way. For his sore-stricken soul was still heavy with loss, And his gaze on the ground, saw each thorn where it lay. But the glad Pilgrim said, with a light in his eye, 'Nay, Brother, not so: look thou'up and not down-! From thy house upon earth, see thy Home in the Sky, The Way of the Cross is the Way of the Crown.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
