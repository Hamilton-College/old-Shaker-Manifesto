Berlin, Ont., { January 2,1874.) F. W. Evans, Esq., Lebanon, N. Y. Dear Sir: Your kind letter and enclosed pamphlets of December 21, were received in due time, but as the subject is a very important one, and my time at the present much occupied by an extended correspondence, etc., I only wish to acknowledge, with these few lines, the receipt of yours, and to state, that there are several families in Russia acquainted with me, who are in full sympathy with you, and I will not fail to communicate to them about the matter, and to write to you again as soon as possible. Believe me to be very truly, Yours, C. Jansen
