FAITH. Ida Thomas. ''For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear Him.' Psa. ciii., 11. How kind, merciful and charitable is our Heavenly Father ;t if we but do his will and obey his teachings, He will bestow all these blessings upon us, and ofttimes when grief casts its dark vail over us, if we will look trustingly to Him in faith He will send the comforter. What comfort and blessing is this faith, this mighty anchor that stays the soul when the waves of emotion would overpower it, if this blessed power did not break forth in its full strength. I feel that good spiri's are ever near, ready to help and support all faithful souls. I know God has made this beautiful world for the enjoyment of all his people. Why not love one another always and in speaking of each other speak kindly. The heaviness of the cold winter is slowly passing away, the birds again are returning to cheer us with their songs, and in a short time the earth will be robed in its garme it of spring beauty. Then can we say 'Great and wonderful O God are all thy works and mighty is thy power over the whole nation.' I would likewise weave a garment of spotless beauty that my soul could rejoice in wearing ; and I pray to God and good spirits for strength to bear me on and hold me up in my faith. Of myself alone I could do nothing ; but as God has endowed me with faith and understanding, and I feel as far as I have obeyed this light, I have been blest, and am now, in being privileged to enjoy my faith unmolested from the world in the quietness of my gospel home. I shall daily strive to walk uprightly before God and his people and prove my life and faith by my works. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
