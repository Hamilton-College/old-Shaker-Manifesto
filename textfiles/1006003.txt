CONTENTMENT RICHARD PELHAM Come contentment, lovely guest, Reign unrivalled in my breast, Thou alone wilt do. Thou alone canst fill the soul, Every passion canst control, When the stormy billows roll, Thou canst bear me through. Nothing on the earth below — Nought that Heaven can bestow — Fills the soul with peace, If contentment is not there ; All is dreary, dark, and bare ; She alone makes heavenly fare, She alone is bliss. Bat, content will not abide In a soul puffed up with pride ; Neither will she stay With a soul defiled with lust; Nor with him who is unjust ; He that covets she'll not trust, But will flee away. Hypocrites, who sneak around, Hunting flesh on Holy Ground, Peace will never find. He who covers up his sins, Lo ! his torment then begins, He that's lazy never wins ' True content of mind. All the lordlings of the earth — All their boasts, what are they worth ? Nothing but a show ! All the wealth that kings possess, All their vain and gaudy dress, All is splendid wretchedness — Peace, they never knew. In humiliation low, Where the heavenly virtues grow, There contentment's found ; I will tread this lowly vale, And its living breath inhale. Catch the odors from the gale, Richly spread around. Where there is no sin concealed — Where the heart has been revealed — There content is near. Whoso will his sins confess, Live a life of righteousness, God that soul will surely bless, Peace will soon appear. Where no vulture's eye hath seen — Where no lion's whelp has been — Resignation's vale — Where the flesh is crucified — Where the selfish will's denied — There contentment will abide There alone will dwell. Far from lust, and pride, and strife, In a pure and virgin life, Here's true peace of mind. With contentment hand in hand, I'll explore this happy land, Moving with a virgin band Who alone are blessed. North Union, O.
