CARLYLE ON TEACHING An old letter of Mr. Thomas Carlyle'a on teaching, written in 1859 to a young man who asked his counsel, has just been published. In it he says: ' The grand secret (worth all the others together, and without which all the others are worth nothing and less) for inculcating and teaching virtues and graces is, that a man honestly, and with more and more of silent sincerity, have them himself, lodged there in the silent deeps of his being ; they will not fail to shine through and be not only visible but undeniable in whatever he is led to say or to do, and every hour of the day he will, consciously and unconsciously, find good means of teaching them. This is the grand indispensable requisite ; this present, the rest is very certain to follow; the rest is mere matter of detail, depending on speciality of circumstance, which a man's own common sense, if he is in earnest toward his aim, will better and better instruct him in. The business, I am sorrowfully aware, is often enough undertaken without this indispensable prerequisite â€”nay, in general, there is a dim notion abroad that a man can teach such things by merely wishing to do it and without having them himself ; but the fatal result inevitably is, he teaches, cau teach, nothing but hypocrisy and unblessed apery and mendacity. It is a kind of salvation to his poor pupils if they, in a dim way, see through him, and refuse to imbibe the slow poison of such teaching. I fancy you to be an ingenuous young man, aiming manfully to do your best in the vocation which has fallen to you ; and I hang up far ahead, I hope, this ugly but true warning upon a certain path which all mortals of us ought to avoid and abhor much more than we do at present.'
