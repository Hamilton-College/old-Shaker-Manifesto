The Paradox of Jesus Calvin Green, of Mt. Lebanon, once said that ' Jesus was the Sarcastus of his day ! ' Reference in this was had to ' Go tell that fox, etc.' But where can a greater, apparent inconsistency be found, than 'He that saves his life shall lose it; but he that loses his life shall find it ? The pronoun it, apparently refers to the same life; and only as the two lives of humanity are understood—the natural or earthly life, and the spiritual or Christ life—this paradox is not and cannot be comprehended. Would you gain the Christ life, you must lose the carnal, Adamic, generative practice that is opposed to Christ. Would you save this, then be not disappointed if you find that you have not found Christ. Though paradoxical, this is one of the most beautiful sayings of Jesus, and is worthy of a whole life's study. Probably no passage in scripture is generally less understood, and at the same time of greater value when comprehended. As in this saying so much is enclosed, so let our lives ' be hid in Christ.' *
