THE LOVE OF CHRIST. By Lillian Phelps. IT would be impossible to picture to the mind, Jesus, without the attribute of love. Love shone like a bright star, through the truths that he uttered and in the pai ables he gave for instruction in his doctrine. In many instances wherein he sought to touch the hearts of the poor sinful multitude which crowded about him, attracted by the love and forgiveness which he bestowed alike on all, we tind the Pharisee, ready to accuse and condemn. In the story of the woman, known to be a sinner, who came and anointed the feet of Jesus with precious ointment, (Luke vii., 3650.) we read how the Pharisees rose in self-righteousness, and mindful only that she was a sinner, wondered that Jesus could not discern that sbe was unholy. Jesus, however, in his great love and tender mercy, saw beneath all this the sincerity which prompted the lowly service, and sent her away with the happy assurance, 'Thy sins are forgiven.' Can not we, as followers of the divine Pattern, draw a valuable lesson from this little instance? How often in daily life, we can discourage a brother or sibter by refusing to recognize a good effort, rather magnifying the mistakes and failures. Oh the accusing spirit of the Pharisee! how little it knows of the love of Christ! We are chosen to become ministers of good to each other, Saviors to seek out the undeveloped germ of the divine in the worlds around us, and encourage and strengthen by sympathy and love, until it becomes the tree bearing fruit unto God.
