NEVER COMPLAIN. [Contributed by L. Wentworth.] Never complain of your birth, your training, your employment, your hardships ; never fancy that you could be something if you only had a different lot and sphere assigned you. God understands his own plans, and he knows what you want a great deal better than you do. The very things you most deprecate as fatal limitations or obstructions are probably God's opportunities; and it is nothing new that the patient should dislike his medicines, or any certain proof that they are poisons. Nay! a truce to all impatience! Choke that foolish envy which gnaws at your heart because you are not in the same lot with others ; bring down your soul, or, rather, bring it up to receive God's will and do his work in your lot, in your sphere, under your cloud of obscurity, against your temptations, and then you shall find your condition is never opposed to your good, but really consistent with it.
