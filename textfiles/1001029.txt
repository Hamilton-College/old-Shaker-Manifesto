Frederick W. Evans, Mt. Lebanon, New York: Dear Sir... New York, Nov. 6,1879 Frederick W. Evans, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.: Dear Sirâ€”There are one or two points respecting the doctrines and practices of the Shakers on which I should like to have more specific information than I can obtain from any of the books on the subject, at my command. I take the liberty to communicate these as follows, with the hope that you may find leisure and inclination to answer them. My object is to avoid misstatement of fact in an article which I have in preparation : 1. Do the Shakers hold the doctrine of Christ's expiatory sacrifice as the basis of an atonement. And if not, what are their views on the subject? 2. Do they observe Christmas as the birthday of our Lord ? 3. What do they teach the children under their care, as to the person and work of Jesus Christ ? You will accept, I trust, the fact of my connection with the Christian Union, of which I am managing editor, as a guarantee of my good faith in making these inquiries, and believe me yours Very truly, Eliot McCormick
