PRAY WHAT CAN THIS LITTLE BIRD BE? It's strange how little boy's mothers Can find it all out as they do If a fellow does any thing naughty Or says any thing that's not true ! They'll look at you just a moment, Till your heart in your bosom swells, And then they know all about it — For a little bird tells ! Now where the little bird comes from, Or where the little bird goes, If he's covered with beautiful plummage Or black as the king of crows, If his voice is as hoarse as a raven Or clear as the ringing bells, I know not—but this I am sure of— A little bird tells ! The moment you think a thing wicked, The moment you do a thing bad, Are angry or sullen or hateful, Get ugly or stupid or mad, Or tease a dear brother or sister— That instant your sentence he knells, And the whole to mamma in a minute That little bird tells ! You may be in the depths of a closet Where nobody sees but a mouse ! You may be all alone in a cellar, You maybe on the top of the house; You may be in the dark and the silence, Or out in the woods and the dells— No matter ! Wherever it happens, The little bird tells ! And the only contrivance to stop him Is just to be sure what to say— Sure of your facts and your fancies, Sure of your work and your play. Be honest, be brave and be kindly, Be gentle and loving as well, And then you can laugh at the stories 'The little bird tells !
