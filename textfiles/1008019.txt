LET ENGLAND WINCE The seating of Bradlaugh, the English liberal, is a gain for freedom of conscience on the other side of the waters. The fussy Tories, bound up with church al predelictions must feel ashamed, when Bradlaugh refuses to take their unchristian oaths; but holding the Bible aloft in Parliament, he refers them to the injunction: ' Swear not at all! ' Those English bigots who sought to deprive him of his justly earned seat, because he would not swear, must feel terribly, and yet properly mortified by this rebuke from a so-called infidel.
