NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Center Family. April 10, 1891. Beloved Eldeb Henry:�I read your Editorial this morning, in April Manifesto, and it seemed meet for the times, as Manifesto Editorials always seem to me. The average temperature of March for Mount Lebanon and the mean temperature of the same for Canterbury, as given in April, makes a difference of seven degrees, between the two, which makes me think there is a difference between the mean of two extremes and the average for the month, since Canterbury is only about fifty miles further north, according to the maps, and an average of seven degrees colder, than we had, must be severe. The merry singing of birds this morning, the first I have heard this season, seemed homelike, because they tell of genial skies and vernal blooms, and agreeable warmth, arrived to clothe the earth again with her mantle of green, of multiform texture,-� also to renew her friiitfulness with producDSTortli Family. April 15. 'No time to lose, the moments have a voice, Calling to duty as a lasting choice. Swiftly they're fleeing and bear a record clear, Of deeds good or evil in this earthly sphere. Scatter the seeds of virtue day by day; Embody the truth, it will not pass away. And to labor for others is of virtue to thee, Increasing thy treasure in eternity.' Of all the seasons, spring is the most important. If the farmer, or gardener fails in duty now, he will have affliction and trouble all through the summer; at harvest time vexation, and for winter, unpleasant reflections. tions that reward industry, and gladden the hearts of all living creatures. Since April came in, snow has fallen to the depth of twenty inches, so reported, and though it melted fast, and has continued melting, about six inches remains. Our farmers put several acres of grain into the ground before the last snow. It is having a cold bath and perhaps it will make a quick start, after its white shroud departs. Brother Henry and the men are improving the time at trimming apple trees. With the return of mild weather, our people are getting better of their coughs, colds, influenzas and rheumatics, which are being relegated to limbo where they belong. What is home, if it is not where all rational needs are supplied, and all proper wants, physical and moral, intellectual and spiritual, are satisfied. And where, when duties are all performed in their season, we feel peace and rest, in harmony with environment. A wise attention to the little duties, ten thousand times repeated, each in its proper connection with the daily routine, never neglecting the greater ones, fertilizes life's garden and feeds the fountain of content within, while all unnecessary, superficial and transitory wants are denied and banished, by the satisfaction which flows from industry and a justified conscience. Saturday it rained and snow is going fast. ' * The season appears to be opening very satisfactorily. Have just commenced to work the land. On the 3rd we had the greatest snow storm of the season; there fell about eighteen inches. It has now about all disappeared. Elder Frederick, who on the 1st fell upon a very sharp axe, cutting a terrible gash in the calf of the left leg, is doingvery nicely. However it does not at all agree with his active life habits to be so closely confined. The tendency seems to be to develop the nervous system. 'There are no accidents in Christ.' Truth. And our gospel travel is not yet complete. What a glorious sight it will be upon this earth, a body of people living in a section of country where the weeds are all subdued; where there are no destructive animals or insects; where the seasons come in perfect harmony and wh ere all the people not only have complete control of their spirits, but of their bodies too. No accidents, no sickness, no premature deaths and no burdensome old age. The battle against dirt, moth and rust, is now being fought by our valiant Sisterhood, and things look favorably for complete victory. Our Ministry are expected at their mountain home to-day. In kindest love. D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. April 1891. The month of April has arrived and also the time for house cleaning. This is the time when some of us would like to go on a visit, where house cleaning is not known. This wrestling with contrary stove pipes, beating dusty carpets and kalsomining the walls is not very conducive to peace of mind. The only consolation is, that two or three of the good Sisters are generally near, and impart so freely their advice, that one would think they understood the whole business, and of course it will not do to get excited. So we put on an extra amount of pressure on the safety valve of patience and all goes well. We have not done any ploughing as yet. Snow remains on the ground and it freezes every night. We are making fences. Are selling some of our potatoes at three dollars and twenty-five cents a barrel. Our tomato plants look well. We shall have about six thousand plants to set this spring. We have closed the sawing of logs at our mill, this season, and think the business has been profitable for us. J. B. Second Fainily. We have not much to write at this time. The latter part of March was warm, and the wood for the coming season was sawed and stored away. We commenced ploughing, when lo! April stepped in and clothed the earth with a mantle of snow about twelve inches deep. This put a stop to ploughing for the present; but as there is other necessary work to be done we need not be idle. Hancock, Mass. April 10, 1891. Time, which is ever on the wing, again brings the period in which it is expedient to collect 'Home Notes' for the excellent pamphlet that so abounds in wisdom, and gives such universal satisfaction. There is, however, in our section, little of interest to record. Health has been an abiding guest with us through the winter, which is cause for deep thankfulness. In one or two instances La Grippe attempted to put in an appearance, but being rebuffed soon left. The April number of the Manifesto is, from cover to cover, so replete with articles of superior merit, that distinguishing preference seems hardly possible. 'Plome Notes' do indeed have the right ring, are always refreshing, and serve to bring us into closer communion with gospel kindred. The feathered songsters still seem to tarry in their southern homes, not daring to venture to our northern climes, While the chilling winds Blow, And earth remuins enshrouded in snow. One of our aged Sisters, Anna Pool, of the Second Family, on the morning of the 9th ult. had the misfortune to fall on the slippery flag-stones and break a bone of the left arm near the wrist. The doctor who is in attendance thinks it is healing finely and considers it a remarkable case, as she is in her ninety-third year. He claims there is not to be found on record, a case where a broken bone has healed on a person so advanced in years. A large amount of wood is being sawed and split both for market and home use. While we enjoy the delicious maple syrup that we are making in very small quantities, we are reminded of the toiling ones in our sister Societies, (particularly those in New Hampshire,) who are manufacturing such large quantities of both syrup and sugar, and we wonder how so much labor can be accomplished. May God's blessing attend them. J. L. S. April 4. Beloved Elder Henry:�Owing to inquiry from some of the Societies of Believers about our Iron Ore Mine, I thought it best to send you some statements of facts in regard to it, which can be placed in the Manifesto if you think best so to do. Notes about Home seem to be read, and no doubt will be so long as our interests are identical. The pocket of ore found on the land owned by this Society is one of the deposits which belong to the Salisbury vein. This vein is first found near the north line of Berkshire Co., at the head waters of the Housatonic river, and runs in a southwesterly course through the county and along the west line of Connecticut and east line of York State. Its extent is about ninety miles. Ore has been discov ered in sections this whole distance, although some beds are too poor to pay for working, while others are very rich in iron. Four years ago this spring, parties commenced underground mining on our land a little east of the village, near the railroad station. Here they dropped a shaft about one hundred and thirty feet into the earth. This shaft is six by eight and timbered from top to bottom. From this they drift away into the ore. They are now working four levels. The bottom level has been extended between two and three thousand feet, and still forces good ore. The Company have lately sunk another shaft one hundred and fifty feet deep near the lowlands on the line of their underground works. As the top of this last shaft is some forty feet below the top of the old one, they will be able to extend more drifts under these present works. The depth of the ore has not been determined as yet, but the Company are satisfied that they are working on the top of the deposit. They have erected a large building over this last shaft and placed in it their engines, washers, pumps, &amp;c. At the present time they are taking out about eight hundred tons of ore per month. When their new works are completed they intend to work nine or ten levels and mine seventy-five to one hundred tons per day. The Railroad Company have run a track out to their works so as to load their cars where the ore is taken out, without any extra hauling. The ore is taken to Chatham, some eighteen miles, where their furnace converts it into pig iron. The grounds are loaned to the Company for a term of years with an agreement that there shall be a certain amount of ore mined each month and a monthly payment of Royalty made to the Society for every ton taken. We are able to say that thus far the Company have lived up to this agreement. The expense of mining the ore is borne by the parties without any aid whatever from the Society. On the 2nd inst. we observed the Proclamation sent out by Governor Russell for a day of Fasting. Had meeting at ten o'clock A. M. The afternoon was devoted, as is the custom of Believers, to putting things in order. As the snow had nearly all disappeared we thought it a good time to put away our sleds, and did so. The next morning, to our surprise, we found sixteen inches of beautiful white snow had fallen during the night; we had not any use for it except to fertilize our land, therefore we agreed that it could disappear just as soon as it pleased. House cleaning has already commenced and where there is a particle of dust or one fly-speck, the good Sisters think it will not do to let it remain. Therefore, brooms, brushes, and soap-suds are in motion. Good health favors us at this date. In kindest love. Your Brother. Ira R. Lawson.
