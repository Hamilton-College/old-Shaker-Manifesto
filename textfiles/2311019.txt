CARD OF THANKS. Enfield, N. H. Oct. 20, 1893. We wish to thank all who aided in the least degree toward making our Centennial Commemorative Service, both profitable and enjoyable ; it will long be remembered. Elder Daniel Offord, Br. Grorge Clark, Eldress Anna White, Sr. Miriam Offord from Mt. Lebanon, Elder Andrew Barrett from Harvard, Mass., Br. Geo. St. John and Sr. Mary Miller from Canterbury, N. H., also the Ministry of our Bishopric. No sweeter offering was presented than the Memorial Letter from our sister Society, Canterbury, promising to pray with and for us during our time of service; we acknowledge Dn this and many other occasions, the universal, interest of beloved Eldress Dorothy Durgin. Those who worked and prayed for the end desired in our own home, are also worthy of thanks and blessing. We hope to give a full account later. Love and thanks to all. Mary Ella Briggs.
