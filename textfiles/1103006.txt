LINES SACRED TO THE MEMORY Of our Dearly Beloved Sister, Martha Curtis Mary A. Gillespie 1. As we read Life's daily record, And its rugged paths we tread, We are visited by Angels, And by Angel hands are led. Sometimes thro' the vale of sorrow, Upwards to the mount of joy, Where we feed and feast our spirits, And sweet praise is our employ. 2. Now, to-day, as we are reading, One familiar name we miss ; One who long hath walked Life's pathway, Walks the golden streets of bliss. Here her life-work is accomplished ; There the new life is begun ; She has taken those bright laurels, Which thro' faithfulness she won. 3. Blessed, patient, toiling Sister — One whose faith was tried and true ; On the earth and in the Heavens, Blest thou art, and honored too. E'en the little children loved thee, Gospel mother, while thy care For each sister and each brother Will be missed ; but constant prayer Will unite us in the spirit, Soul with soul will often blend, As we drink from crystal fountains, And our prayers to Heaven ascend. Father, Mother, God be with us,4 Grant us love, and may we feel Thy protecting hand still o'er us ; All our sorrows thou canst heal. 5. Thou art Light, amid the darkness]; Peace when angry storms arise ; Joy when ills of life betide us, Star of Hope — our glorious prize ! Thou art rest when life grows restless, Thou art strength when we feel weak ; Lord be with us thro' all dangers, And the trials here we meet. 6. 0 be with us in temptation ; Lead us in the narrow way : Let us ne'er be God forsaken, Unto TJiiMi, 0 Lord, we pray. And when life-scenes close around us, And our sun of life goes down, Like our Heaven-born Angel Sister May we win and wear the Crown. Alfred, Me.
