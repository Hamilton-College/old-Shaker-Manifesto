Ayer, Mass. Feb. 1892. Dear Editor:As we enter upon the last winter month, we find our zeal for labor has not entirely diminished, although we have had but little snow. 125 cords of wood have been hauled to the door-yard, for sawing and 80 tons of ice housed. Our herb and broom business have been ably managed. Good and faithful Sisters have had more than their share this winter, of the burdens of life. Not only the common duties of the family have demanded attention, but there has not been a week without sickness, and this has received their willing attendance. With all this we have not suffered from Winter of the Heart. Our pathway may lead us among trials which for a time would seem to impede our progress, and shut out the very light of heaven; but if we have the love of heaven in our hearts we have a solace that will support and give strength and enable us to meet every trial. We have no need to fear the future while our trust is in God, our heavenly Father and Mother. Winter days will be changed to summer days and our pathway will be made pleasant in the sunshine of God's love. Pleavenly flowers and fruits will abound and make of life an eternal joy. Let us extend this sunshine to every one as there is nothing that will do so much good as the spirit of kindness, administered in a cheerful spirit. 'Kindness is the music of good-will to men and on this harp the smallest fingers may play heaven's sweetest tunes on earth.' Of all blessings there is nothing better or more desirable than a cheerful, happy home, and it should be our duty to promote these blessings in our own home circle. A. D. B.
