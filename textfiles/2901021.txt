Enfield, N. H. Dec. 1898. 'Home sweet home, God's precious gift to me Home sweet home, my life shall honorth.ee.' As we look at our home, not viewing especially the lovely picturesqueness of nature's associations, but at the more precious treasure ,â€”its inmates, we may well waft heart pseans of gratitude to God for the many blessings that are ours. For kindred, as beautiful in character as the flowers we admire, as solid in principle as the rocks of the hills about us and as constantly serving good as the stream that courses down the mountain side. Souls tested by the power of divine truth and affliction, ever self-sacrificing for the good of home's inmates, transmitting influences of pleasantness and bespeaking wisdom's works as genuine as the stars spangling the blue dome of the heaven above. As works advertise our condition and faith, to enrich home, we must blend with the realities of to-day. Dissect, construct and adjust matters in harmony with principles that lead on to victory over sin. The mortal so working has a sacred treasure more beneficial and more worthy of THE MANIFESTO. 15 adoration than any sacred relic incarcerated in cathedral, palace or institution. Our Thanksgiving Service was 'brim full' with soul-inspiring testimonials, which with the hymns, added strength and good cheer. In the evening an hour and a half was given to an entertainment by twenty-eight home folks. A beautiful feature of the event was the numerous pictures of arisen ones of our other Communal homes, decorating wall and piano. The last of the month we had with us, friends, Dr. G. Goding, of Christian Science school and Mr. Galen Fish, of Randolph, Vt. Mr. Fish a student of the Detroit Training School of Elocution and English Literature, gave us an excellent entertainment, rendering many dramatic and humorous recitations. As intermissions, the modern marvel Gramophone afforded pleasure. George H. Baxter
