Sanitary. A VEGETAKUN. [ Contributed by Elder F. AV. Evans. ] l,it~i* Costs liut a $ix])�iicv a Way� Some Mays JJeM. A letter from Dr. T. R. Allinson to the London Times says : 'Allow me to bring under the notice of your readers some experiments I have just concluded to solve the difficulty of feeding our poor in London and elsewhere. The cry is that food is so dear the poor can scarcely live. This cry is true if they want to live on luxuries, but if they will live on wholesome but plain and healthy fare they can do so for very little. A little over a month ago I determined to give up all expensive articles of food and live almost as cheaply as possible. Having left off flesh foods fer nearly two years, and lecturing frequently on the question of food, I knew what to select. Looking over my food accounts, I found milk, butter, eggs and cheese, with tea and coffee, were fairly expensive articles, and none of them necessary, so I gave them up for a time to see results. On Oct. 19th. I began my experiment, my weight was then nine stone eight ounces. I continued this purely vegetarian diet for a month, when my weight was nine stone three pounds twelve ounces or a gain of three and a quarter pounds. My friends said I looked well; I felt well, and did my usual work the same as ever. I walked from ten to fifteen miles daily, seeing patients or taking exercise. Here is an account of my dietary, which cost me little more than a sixpence a day, and I could easily live for less without luxuries : Breakfast consisted of a basin of porridge, made from a mixture of oatmeal and wheatmeal, which I found more palatable than either singly. This I usually ate with bread to insure thorough insalivation. Then came bread fried in refined cottonseed oil or fried vegetable haggis. For drink I had a cup of cocoa or fruit syrup, with warm water and sugar. The cocoa used was an ordinary one with plenty of starch in it, which makes a thick drink, and no milk is than required. Dinner consisted of a thick vegetable soup and bread, potato pie, savory pie, vegetarian pie, vegetable stew, stewed rice and tomatoes, etc. For a second course I had bread, plum pudding, stewed rice and fruit, baked sago, tapioca ajnd apples, stewed prunes, figs, raisins and bread. Tea meal consisted of bread and jam, stewed fruit, or some green stuff, as water-cress, celery tomatoes etc. I had only three meals a day, and frequently, when very busy, I had only two, and a cup of cocoa and a biscuit for supper. I always use the whole meal bread, as it is laxative and contains a great deal of nitrogen, which is thrown away with the bran. The cottonseed oil is a cheap and good cooking oil, and is impossible to detect. This diet I continued for a month, and now I only take the an- imal products when out, not having- them at my table. ' Now compare this diet with one of flesh or a mixed one. The latest analysis shows flesh to contain from 70 to 74 percent of water, the dry residue being A'ery rich in nitrogen, and it contains a little carbonaceous or fatty matter. Hence, to live on meat alone, as much as eight pounds a day is necessary. Then there are to be considered the diseases of animals which are communicable to man if that flesh be not thoroughly cooked all through and as very few of our animals live a perfectly natural life, most of them are more or less diseased, especially the fat ones. The excess of nitrogen taken into the system in eating flesh meat has to be got rid of by the liver, kidneys and lungs; hence these organs, are overtaxed, and much disease is the consequence., in fact, were it not for flesh food we doctors should have very little to do. Man living in towns can not afford to eat much flesh, because he does not get sufficient exereise and oxygen to burn up the excess of nitrogen. If he does eat this flesh, and if lie eat much, then he must suffer from many complaints, such as indigestion, bilious attacks, congested liver, hemorrhoids, gastric catarrh and other gastric troubles. If the habit be continued in gall-stones or urinary calculi may follow, or rheumatism and gout. Then the kidneys become diseased and more nrork is thrown on the heart, which becomes also diseased; the end is death by one of the lingering diseases, which shows a diseased organ somewhere. E^en epilepsy and many nervous diseases are aggravated by flush. Cancer is on the increase, and from some observations I have made, it may be indirectly traced to flesh. Consumption lias only a remote connection with flesh, it being due chiefly to the want of fresh air. Vegetable food is cheap, contains an abundant supply nfriutrj. noent at first cost, and our systems are so formed as to use it with least expenditure of vital force. '
