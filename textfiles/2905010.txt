West Pittsfield, Mass. April, 1899. As to outward appearance at present, it is very muddy. Mother Nature is very late with her work, and we fear will now be obliged to do double duty in consequence. She slept so long and soundly during the winter night, and was so snugly covered with her white mantle, that it was a difficult task to arouse her. The sun commenced gently and gradually to awaken her, but failed. Then a fierce thunder storm tried its power and crashed and boomed, but to no avail. Then the crows came, a congregation of them, and tried coaxing and calling, and as a last resort, singinguntil they were hoarse, but still no sign of life appeared from under the drifts of snow. At last King Sol came to the rescue, and rising higher and higher, sent his beams down with such warmth that she began to move and then to throw off her covering, although she yet clings to patches here and there. She is fully awake now, and very busy, so we hope that by diligence, spring will not keep summer waiting long. The early birds are with us once more. The chickadees have hardly left us, and the Phebes have returned, but are still hunting for that unfortunate sister, for this morning they came under my window and called for her incessantly. The robins have come in a band and landed so suddenly in our midst that we were surprised when they perched around the house and commenced a full chorus of their merry melodies. Dear, friendly, hopeful, trusting robins ! How many lessons we may learn from your lives, how by your simple trust and cheery sonps you reprove our doubts and quiet our murmurings. The Father surely has revealed to you his wisdom, that from you we may learn object lessons of faith. Although most of our trees and plants are tardy in their growth, the wood piles have grown to their full size. The mill has been busily worked converting the pine logs into material sufficient for another winter. The eighty calves before mentioned, wish to submit their report occasional,y. They have flourished and grown during the winter, although the hay mows have suffered. The little, wild colts are fast developing into well educated horses; although they can not obtain a No. 1 diploma, yet can draw a carriage very nicely. The Ministry are with us once more. While receiving all of the good we may, let us also extend our tenderest love, our kind sympathy and loyal obedience. For he who lives only for self, finds only self at last, but he who gives all shall receive all in Christ. Fidelia Estabrook.
