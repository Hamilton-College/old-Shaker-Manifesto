A BOY WHO LAUGHED AT OTHER PEOPLE. By Leon J. Ashton. (14 years old.) Charlie was the son of a poor farmer. One day Charlie's father had to go to the city and he told Charlie to pick apples. Charlie said to himself:'To-day I will have some fun.' So after breakfast he went out with his ladder and had just begun to pick when an old man came along: his hair was white and one of his arms was gone. 'Ha ha,' laughed Charlie, 'I will throw an apple at him.' He saw a nice one a little way from his ladder and he put out his hand to get it but just then a gust of wind blew, and poor Charlie was blown off. He was picked up as dead. The doctor came and found that his right arm was broken; Charlie was in bed for a month, but it was a great lesson to him. He is a man now but he has never laughed at the aged and infirm since. Mt.
