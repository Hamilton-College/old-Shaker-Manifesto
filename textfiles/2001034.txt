MOTHER ANN LEE Mother Ann Lee came from Manchester, England. She was the mother of all the Shaker Societies. She was a very good woman. She said to the children, 'O my little ones you should obey your teachers. On the Sabbath day you should not do any work that is not necessary. You should not play with sharp tools.' Gertna E. Curtis. 8 yrs old.
