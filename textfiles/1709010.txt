PRAYER. ANNA P. CARLL. See Luke, chap, xiii., 11, 12, 13. Jtjdea's hills were clothed with light. A light was on the plain ; And Sabbath peace was over all That to the temple came. 'Twas in that Jewish synagogue, This sunny Sabbath morn, A woman bent with weight of years, Came there among the throng;- - She came to hear the holy word, To join in humble prayer; She could not know her blessed Lord Would meet and heal her there. He saw her needs and from that host, He called her to his side; Then with a touch he healed her pain, And God was glorified. And there she stood in perfect health, Her bonds were rent in twain; She felt the saving power of grace, Restore her strength again. And so I come into Thy House, Bent low with cares and fears ; O may I hear Thy heavenly word Fall on my listening ears. That as I hasten to obey The pleadings of Thy voice, My troubles all will fade away And leave me to rejoice. For now I bend beneath the load Of sin and sore distress ; If thou but touch the burden Lord, It can no more oppress. And like the stricken one of old, 0 grant me full release; So shall I find Thy ways my choice, And in Thy paths my peace. Providence, R. I.
