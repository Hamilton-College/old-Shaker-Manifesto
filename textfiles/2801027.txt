Remarks on the Mistakes of Moses Remarks on the Mistakes of Moses, by H. L. Hastings. This is an enlarged and beauti. fully illustrated work and is well worthy of an extended circulation. To say the least, it does not seem to be very kind to be talking of a persons mistakes for three thousand years, especially when it is so hard to find them. Br. Hastings, however, comes forward as an able advocate for the world renowned prophet, and thousands of readers will be interested in this little work. H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
