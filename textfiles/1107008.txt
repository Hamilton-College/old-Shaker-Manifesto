Whenever you see a wrong deed and have the courage to say... Canon Farrar , in closing his sermon at St. Margaret's, Westminster, on a recent Sunday, said : ' Whenever you see a wrong deed and have the courage to say, ' It is wrong, and I, for one, will have nothing to do with it;' whenever you come in contact with a low and unchristian standard, or a bad, unworthy habit, and are man enough, first, to refuse to succumb to it, and then to do your best to overthrow it, you are a prophet, and by acting thus you can help to improve the moral judgment and raise the moral standard of the world. Your words and deeds will breathe like fresh wind through the perfumed and polluted atmosphere of society. Be brave, be just, be truthful and honest to the heart's core, and so serve your brother man, your Father God, and your Saviour the Lord Christ. If the gospel be the example of Christ, this is the gospel and nothing but the gospel.'
