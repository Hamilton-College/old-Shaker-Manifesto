East Canterbury N. H. Aug. 1895. Already we have a forewarning of the winter to come. All the singing birds have become quiet, except occasionally one solitary robin. Some of these birds, however, remain with us but are evidently making arrangements for the southern trip. Our crop of hay has been very satisfactory, and yet we should have been thankful for more. The small fields of grain that we raise has afforded a good yield. Our garden brings to us the best of food for the table, and the supply is sufficiently varied to meet the demands of our large family. Our corn fields on the farm are larger this year than has been seen for many years in the past and the growth is phenomenal. Indeed, it presents a beautiful sight and will, no doubt, be a great blessing in more ways than one. Mrs. McWhirter of Texas, from the home of the 'Sanctified Sisters,' with her son Eobert of New York City, made us a visit of several days and all were very much interested in learning from her, more about her b,ome in Texas.
