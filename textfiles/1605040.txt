He thought some restrictions... He thought some restrictions should be put upon those who claim to heal by spirit aid. The practice of medicine was a science, and even spirits could only know what to prescribe through a medium by having acquired that knowledge on the earth plane. The laws were framed in order to secure the best talent for the sufferers. It was not a proper, a safe thing to prescribe by a spirit who did not know the value and force of prescriptions. If the mediums would try and acquire some knowledge and then call in spirit aid, and know what the spirit was prescribing, it would be better. If the mediums are prepared by study and then the spirits assist them, they would have every right to practice. The speaker was fully convinced that while there were some genuine clairvoyant mediums, that 99 out of 100 who advertised in the daily papers were frauds and impostors. Judge Bailey in R. P. Journal.
