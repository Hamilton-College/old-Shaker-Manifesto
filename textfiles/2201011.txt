THE NEW YEAR Amelia J. Calver Since earliest childhood the opening of the New Year has seemed a sacred time. It was with almost bated breath that we thought of the departure of the Old Year, and the incoming of.' the New; and with our little notebooks in hand in which to mark our merits and demerits, we stepped with awe over the threshold into a new and enlarged chamber, which many earnest resolutions had converted into an elysium of perfection. And it is even so to-day. These childhood impressions have strengthened with age and we dread to step from the Old Year until we nre prepared to tread with a firm and free step upon the weedless path of the New. But Experience has taught us many lessons during life, the sternest of which is 'Only the present moment has actual being;' and if we impress upon each as it passes a well-learned lesson of self-denial, time is well spent; and we can feel at the close of the year a consciousness of spiritual strength. Together we all now stand waiting for the golden gates of the New Year to open which reveals to us an unmarred future. We all have the same privilege to right all our past wrongs, cancel all debts, and with white robes take up the sacred duties of the New Year, remembering that this grand New Year is made up of 366 new days, each of which should be begun with a clear understanding that there is no victory without a conflict. A sad ending has that year, the balance sheet of which shows more losses than gains; but even then we have a hopeful New Year before us; but sad, sad indeed must that life be whose closing year finds no victory over sin nor self; where remorse steals the peace of mind, and selfishness the friendship of life; for we 'pass this way but once' and there is no returning track over the paths of time ; eternity alone, offers the only hope of salvation.
