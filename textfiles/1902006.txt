REPLY. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Dec. 10, Laura de Force Gordon, Attorney at Law, Lodi, Cal. Respected Friend :�Yours of the 28th. ult. is at hand. We are very much pleased with the tone of your letter ; it touches a chord in our hearts that vibrates in harmony with our own enthusiastic de1888. sires, that the truths revealed in our Society may at no distant day extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast. 'For this Gospel must be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, then shall the end come.' The end of what? Of wars, civil, political and religious, of social strifes and contentions ; of pestilence and famine ; of inequality and monopoly ; of poverty and crime ; of intemperance and sensuality ; of slavery and generation. It has come to us ; and we rejoice with an exceeding great joy, that 'the lines have fallen to us in such pleasant places.' While we recognize a great army of truth-loving souls, like yourself, who are working so persistently for the advancement of the race, advocating peace principles, temperance, equality, women's rights &amp;c, &amp;c, we are not without hope that eventually a new earthly order will arise, wherein use and not abuse of the procreative faculties in man and woman will be observed, and wherein right makes might; even as now exists a heavenly order of peace and righteousness, revealed and established by divine wisdom and love. It needs the one to sustain the other ; and we confidently look to this class as being forerunners of the all important work of redemption in which we are engaged. Are we looking iu vain? Is our purblind vision obscured that hides the cloud fringed with the silver lining? 'Where there is no vision the people perish.' Nay, our sight is clear : The vision shows us wheels revolving in the right direction- �wheels within wheels� all moving toward the One Great Center. A tangible proof of such advance is seen, when in a comparatively new state like California, women are filling offices of trust, becoming lawyers, doctors &amp;c, &amp;c. Woman is beginning to rise in the dignity of her calling to assei t her Godgiven rights. And that right does not call her from her owu sphere that she is destined to fill either, indeed, if she work successfully, she must keep within it. The Maternal Spirit in Deity is 'brooding upon the face of the waters'� r, spiritual Mother. It is this beautiful spirit that calleth aloud from the citadel of truth to the daughters of earth in tones of love and tenderness ; angels catch the sound and reverberate it from hill-top to valley, and from ocean to ocoau. As many sin-sick, sorrowful hearts have been made glad thereby, and filled with her love to-day, so will many more rejoice iu the emancipation and liberty she giveth from the terrible yoke of bondage to man's lust, and his power to oppress ; as well as from her own corrupt nature, that makes her worse than a slave to his baser passions. The leaven is working. But, my dear friend, until it works a little more we cannot warrant the establishment of a Shaker Society in California, or in any other place at present. We very much doubt of finding faith among the people, even in the Golden State, to practically carry out in their every day lives the principles embodied in the everlasting Gospel that we preach�the final test in the judgment to which all souls must be brought either in time or eternity. In the meantime we bless you in your efforts, and appreciate the liberal offer you extend. It is not an impossible thing, if it is an impracticable one : the future must decide. If you could so arrange as to place in the public libraries our books and pamphlets, and thus lay before the people the great truths therein contained, we will agree to furnish a sufficient amount. We herewith enclose a few slips for your own perusal ; and will send as you request, the 'Precepts of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders.' It is a new edition just issued. The letter written by your friend is forwarded to its rightful destination. Elder F. W. Evans whom you address is now in his 81st. year and as you will see is still hard at work in the missionary field. He may write you. As you are striving to be a Redeemer in the generative order, toe , are aiming to be Saviors in the resurrection. Let us clasp hands. Hoping to hear from you again, I remain your friend in the cause of human redemption,, Anna White.
