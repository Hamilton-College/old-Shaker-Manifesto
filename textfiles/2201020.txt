North Family Dec. 1891. 'O 'my kind, loving friends In the gospel so dear; Let us greet one another With a Happy New Year.' Yea, and I wish every body could have a happy new year: but alas! they will not. Why? because of selfishness and sin. Even though crops in some places have failed and the people by the million, as in Russia, are crying for bread, if it were not for greed, and the wrong system of things that prevails in the external order, those people would not cry long; one dispatch across the ocean would be enough to fire the hearts of those who had plenty and start the vessels laden with food to the hungry ones, if nations would all as brothers greet and each seek the good of all; but we have not got there yet; hence all will not have a happy new year. We had a very pleasant gathering at the Church Family on Thanksgiving day. All the young people, and somo older ones of the Church and Center families, recited, read and sang, very much to our entertainment. Sister Amelia Calver was the leader, and deserves great credit for the training of those young people, and the pupils showed a good deal of ability. It was held in the meeting room of the brick house, which was very appropriately decorated; nuts, candy and lemonade were served in profusion which made a feast to both the inner and outer senses. I thought what a profitable season we could have if every Society should turn their attention in that direction, in a centennial celebration. Are now engaged threshing. We find the use of the binder quite an advantage in threshing, the bundles being all of the same size, and no straw knots. The threshing machine can be fed very uniformly. Have had some very nice rains, and hope for more. Beautiful weather just now. Happy greetings to all. In kindest love, D. O.
