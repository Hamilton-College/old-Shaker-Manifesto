Enfield, N. H. We are having unusually mild weather for this season of the year. We continue to have some rain and if the reservoirs are in good repair, there can be no lack of water during the winter. The Brethren have finished the drying of the Dock root and have shipped some forty four thousand pounds to the firm of J. C. Ayer &amp; Co., Lowell, Mass. Of this quantity the Second Family raised 27,856 lbs., the First Family 11,139 lbs. and the North Family 5,031 lbs.
