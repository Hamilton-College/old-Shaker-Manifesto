NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Beloved Eldek Henry :�We have had some very nice weather (excepting Sundays which have been rainy) for some two weeks and more. We are now engaged improving our reservoir which is about one hundred and twenty feet above our buildings and gives us a great deal of power; driving the machinery in the laundry, churn, iron mill for grinding wheat and corn, the wood splitter and sewing machines. It supplies our barn, creamery, cooling room and bath rooms with an abundance of water, and our ice houses with ice and some to sell. Our improvement now, is in arranging it for raising fish, German Carps. A curious improvement for vegetarians to be engaged in, and somewhat inconsistent; but no more so than raising fowls and cattle for food; but we are so intimately connected to the present omniverous generation that it will not do to jump out all at once, lest we break our necks, and the good we would do be turned to evil. But, that most lovely of all jewels will be worn yet by the spiritual people of God, and that in the near future. We contemplate making another pond sonth of our reservoir for the better accommodation of the fishes. Apple trees have about all been trimmed ; and as we think in the very best time, just after the fruit has been gathered. I should like to see a village improvement board started in our societies ; so as to cultivate in a practical way a genuine public spirit. Have a union labor week, to improve and beautify the village; and the roads and road sides. To cast up a highway and gather out the stones, so that family could meet family without traipsing (as the Sisters call it) through the mud; or having our sight hurt by noxious weeds and briers that ought to be dealt with as the tares of old. Who is in favor of the village improvement boards? In kindest love D. Offord. [Those in favor will please make it manifest. Ed.] UNToi-th Family. Nov. 3. We have been busily since last April in the making of shirts, but not like the poor, factory girls, in their pent up rooms, deprived of pure, fresh air and the healthful sunlight, but in our beautiful, well ventilated room, that is lighted by seven or eight large windows. Here we cheerfully work, striving to do all we can for the interest of our home. Since the above date we have made 11,172 shirts, and during the last four weeks we have made 1920. If you could see our machines run, you would not bu surprised at my statement. Center Family. It is a rainy day and the atmosphere feel s like spring. I believe all our crops are harvested, and preparations for winter well advanced. Looking out at one window, I see our garden has been lately plowed. Looking out at others, I see apple trees have recently been cut down and dug up, which have grown in their places from a time antecedent to the memory of the oldest inhabitant, probably since 1780. We have not more than half as many apples, I think, as we had last year� but enough to supply our need comfortably. Pears have been plenty. Potatoes badly rotting. No one on the sick list. Watervliet, N. Y. South Family. We send you an article from the pen of our Beloved Br. Chancy, and it is the last contribution he will write for you. He has passed on to his rest. He has left with us an influence of peace, such as the angels, alone, can bestow. We shall miss his words of comfort and his life example of holiness. It is pleasant to report that we are making some improvements at our own gospel home. Some of the foundation of the building in which the Sisters work, is being relaid. These repairs interest us very much. The porches to our family dwelling have been reconstructed, and the building painted. Even the little girls are made glad, in having a new roof placed upon their house, while the body of the building is being treated to a new coat of paint. The building where we do our Canning is to have a new roof, and next week we expect to move our boiler and engine to an adjoining room, for the better accommodaengaged tion of this work and that at the laundry. I enclose a label which will inform you of our new enterprise, and from which we may hope to reap some benefit. [Copy of the label ] Codfish and Potatoes. Prepared by Shaker Sisters. S. H. Shakers. Ozias T. Bogart, Agent, Albany Co., N. Y. [We are assured that the best of success will attend the good Sisters, as every thing will be so carefully and neatly prepared for the market. Ed.] Hancock, Mass. Nov. 11. Beloved Elder Henry ;�You kindly invited us to write you when we closed our school. At the close of this session we provided no public entertainment, believing the time spent in learning and rehearsing dialogues, recitations and corresponding exercises might be more profitably employed. We think that once a year quite often enough, and at the close of the first term is the pleasantest season in which to entertain our friends. Those of the Brethren and Sisters who visited the school during the last week, seemed pleased with the progress made by the pupils and their remarks of commendation were very acceptable to both teacher and pupils. The S. S. Committee manifested special interest in the efforts which the pupils had made in the studies of Arithmetic Grammar and Drawing, and expressed themselves as well pleased with the exercises. Several of the pupils of the ''Bible Class' are very much interested in searching for answers to the Scripture questions, and we think it an excellent exercise for them. WiJl enclose a few of their thoughts about some of the verses of the Bible. From your Sister, Emoretta Belden. Enfield, Conn. Our ensilage corn is stored in good condition. It was a large crop. Buck-wheat good. Apples a fair crop and of excellent quality. A good quantity of pears. 282 baskets of peaches were marketed and plenty reserved for home use. One plum tree blossomed in Oct. The dwelling house is improved in appearance by some outside painting. The poultry house, with new fence, shows to advantage, and the hens are encouraged to give a good account of themselves. They should not bs crowded, and they should be kept warm and comfortable. Provision should be made for fresh air in proportion to the number of liens. Egg producing food must be given in sufficient quantity and material for shell, such as ground bone, oyster shells, &amp;c. Poultry pays if properly managed. D. Orcutt. Shirley, Mass. Nov. 4. Our crops are well housed, and we are now getting up our wood for the winter. Enfield, N. H. We are having unusually mild weather for this season of the year. We continue to have some rain and if the reservoirs are in good repair, there can be no lack of water during the winter. The Brethren have finished the drying of the Dock root and have shipped some forty four thousand pounds to the firm of J. C. Ayer &amp; Co., Lowell, Mass. Of this quantity the Second Family raised 27,856 lbs., the First Family 11,139 lbs. and the North Family 5,031 lbs.
