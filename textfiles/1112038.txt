To Remove Mildew .â€”Take one ounce of chloride of lime and dissolve in a stone vessel. Turn off the clear water, but none of the sediment. Rinse the article mildewed in clear water, and lay into this solution; stir often until the spots disappear; then rinse thoroughly to remove every trace of the lime, which will rot the goods. Or take one ounce of oxalic acid ; dissolve, and lay the article into the solution for three minutes ; then wring out and lay in the sunshine. If the spots do not readily disappear, repeat,the process, and afterward rinse very thoroughly.
