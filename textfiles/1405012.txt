EVOLUTION AND REVELATION. LOUIS BASTING. The doctrine of Evolution, so widely accepted at the present time, is not entirely of modern origin, for it is distinctly enunciated in the first chapters of Genesis. There the story may be read how Chaos was changed to Order, and how the lower forms of life preceded the higher, culminating in the appearance of man. But science has chosen not to be satisfied with this account of the origin of things; while accepting the idea of the appearance of forms of life in an ascending scale, in successive periods of time, it denies separate acts of creation, asserting that all life, man included, originates from one primordial organism. The late Charles Darwin, in his great work, ' the Descent of Man, ' has accumulated an immense mass of facts, apparently confirm- ing that theory. Learn, then, O man, whence thou art sprung! This is the animal that first was, from which all life originated, according to Darwin. It is an animal inhabiting the sea, permanently attached to a support, incapable of locomotion; a little brown leathery sac ; without eyes, ears, brain, heart or vertebra,�the lowest form of life. But Darwin fails to demonstrate whence the spark of life that animates that humble creature. Is not the principle of life the same in all forms, the highest as well as the lowest? This is the immediate ancestor of man, the famous ' missing link. ' Neither Darwin nor anybody else has ever seen it, but according to science, it ought to exist somewhere. It is covered with hair, both sexes having a beard; ears are pointed and capable of being moved; the foot is prehensile and the body provided with a tail. The males possess great, formidable, canine tet'th. It is arboreal in its habits and has its home in warm, forest-clad land of the Old World! One of the strong points insisted upon, in fact the pivotal point of the theory ; for the author himself designates it but as a theory� is the law of inheritance, the operation of which accounts for all the diversified species of animals and races of men. Under that law, in conjunction with the law of natural selection, individuals distinguished by some physical peculiarity, relating to structure, voice, color, etc., were unconsciously selected and favored by their fellows to propagate and transmit those peculiarities to their posterity. Now, every one knows that the peculiarities of parents are frequently transmitted to their offspring, but it is not generally known that such variations are sufficient to have ever produced a new species of animals or a new race of men. Man may artificially create a new breed of chickens, like the Plymouth Rocks, for instance; but as soon as man ceases to interfere and they are left to natural conditions, they will revert to the original stock. The same materialistic line of reasoning is pursued in the treatment of virtue, morality and spirituality. Temperance, charity, benevolence, honesty, chastity, aye, even the Golden Rule, it is affirmed, is the natural result of the social instincts of man. Darwin from personal experience and other information, proves that most of the savage races are given to extreme licentiousness, and that infanticide, especially of female children is a common practice with them, in order to keep down the population. Therefore, he concludes infanticide to be a beneficial practice! He goes further, and says : 'If men were reared under the same condition as hive-bees, there can hardly De a doubt that our unmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty to kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile daughters ; and no one would think of interfering. ' Of celibacy, Darwin sneeringly speaks as a ' senseless ' practice, stating however, that since it requires great self-command, it has been honored as a virtue from a remote period. It is startling to note the complacency with which the foremost scientist of the century speaks of child-murder as being beneficial and justifiable, and to witness, at the same time his cool contempt for celibacy, which is the only justifiable and moral solution of the population question. Indeed, the apostle of evolution condescends to admit that ' the belief in God is ennobling, ' but he is very far from admitting his personal belief in the existence of God, or to acknowledge Him as the cause of life and its phenomena ; that would be unscientific, I suppose. The present high state of morality among civilized nations, Darwin attributes to experience and reason, by which man has become convinced of the beneficial effects of virtue, has therefore formed virtuous habits and transmitted them, and he thinks that these habits will become permanently fixed by inheritance. Here is a nevr theory of the Millennium : Man will be virtuous by inheritance ! It is submitted for the reader's consideration what the consequences would be if for one single generation all influences that now work for virtue and morality, were withdrawn, and the virtuous impulses of the rising population consisted solely of what it had inherited ! Would not the race sink at once below the level of the dark ages? Under the providence of God, by the aid of revelation, a large portion of the human race, having been irresponsible savages, have become accountable, moral beings. But they need all the aid which can be derived from the accumulated experience of the past, or which present opportunities oft'er, to enable them to maintain the upward march of progress ; and nothing can be of greater advantage to humanity than the blending of rational religion and rational science. It is to he regretted that science in its revolt against theological tyranny has become so largely a godless philosophy, and grave apprehension exists that in its turn it will become as dogmatic and intolerant as theology lias ever been.
