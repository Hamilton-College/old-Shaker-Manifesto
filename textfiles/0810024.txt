The Better Way Not often that we need to repent of having said too little. Tears and bitterness of- ten because we said too much. Never regret our patience under insult and scorn, but sorrow oft because of our haste and resentment. No heart-breaking and pining because we treated our fellow-man with love and respect, but plenty of poverty within because of our rudeness. No mourning because we helped to care for the sick, and eased their dying moments, but abundance of anguish because we did too little. No 'leanness of soul' because we helped our poor brother, and sympathized with him in his troubles, but plenty of 'poverty of heart' because of our selfishness. On all sides, on every hand, regrets and sorrows strike us because we did not as the Master teaches. AVill we turn just where He turned, walk as He walked, be rich in love and good works, or will we go on in the ways of the world and suffer the torments of the damned?
