WHOLESOME ADVICE. Hear and learn to be silent. Be silent and learn to remember. Remember and learn to do accordingly. All that you see, judge not. All that you hear believe not. All that you knew tell not. All that you can do, do not. Goods lost, some lost. Courage lost, much lost. Honor lost, more lost. Soul lost, all lost. By giving alms, you lose not. By being unjust, you enrich not. By lying, you profit not. If you ever speak anything, think first and look narrowly what you speak, where you speak, of whom you speak and to whom you speak, lest you bring yourself into great trouble. Mental Guide.
