Editor Manifesto;�I have just been filled with the life-giving spirit of the gospel, having freely partaken of the bread and waters of life fresh from the spiritual conservatory of heaven. To-day the North family met with the Church in worship and the heavenly avenues were opened and the indwellers of the celestial temple were with us in spirit and in truth. Elder Giles was with us as a minister of the power of the world to come. He repeated some things that he had spoken befoi'e, viz: Hear ye my people! The Lord's work is in its infancy. You will be surprised at the manifestations of his power. There is light emanating from the Spirit world that will prove the fulfillment of the prophecies delivered to the Shakers during the period of time between 1837 and 1846. Ministering spirits are busily engaged in sowing the seeds of a Spiritual Revival among mankind that will raise them from the mire of worldliness and its degradation into a higher life emanating from God the Father and Mother of all the souls of the human family. There will be a sifting and a separation of the chaff and the wheat. The wheat among my people will be pure, and will yield unto the needy and the hungry, the bread of life and living fountains will pour forth for the thirsty, the waters of eternal life. They that truly drink thereof, shall not thirst again for the bitter waters of Sodom. Tribulation lies in the pathway of my people. I see it rise like a dense, dark cloud. When the harvest day shall come, those who shall garner the wheat, will need the whole armor of God. Our meeting was one that will not soon be forgotten by the thoughtful who attended it. Many were deeply imprest, as the emanations of their overflowing spirits clearly indicated. It is a time of general health in our family, also of the Society, and a spirit of unity prevails, feeling� 'Fis selfishness only that hides from another The things that we so greatly enjoy: [other, Then keep not the heaven-born thots from each For selfishness will real pleasure destroy. Calvin G. Reed. South Family. Jan. 1897. 'Old things have past away, behold all things have become new,' even a New Year, the year of our Lord 1897. Righteousness belongs to the Lord thus ; 'Holi- ness unto the Lord,' is a fitting password for the present year. The past season is pleasantly remembered by the visit of Eldress Alvira Conklin and Sister Harriet Jones of the Albany Co. Community. Sister Harriet was formerly a member of the Philadelphia Society. By kind invitation, a party from this place, attended the Christmas Entertainment held at the Second family. The afternoon was devoted to musical recitations and dialogs. The singing of that choice hymn, 'There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,' contained in the Christmas number of the 'Christian Herald and Signs of our Times,' was one of the fine features of the Sociable. The musical dialog, 'What did Jesus say?' was most creditably rendered by six young Sisters. The military march given by the junior members added largely to the interest of the occasion. Br. Henry Hallett's personification of an English Auctioneer, Dry Goods' Merchant and Landlord, produced a spirit of mirth among his audience. Another lively event of the proceedings, was the rendering of a dialog on Physiology by three boys; the article was prepared by Br. Ernest Pick. 'The Coming Woman,' perfectly executed by four little girls. At the close of the program, dainty refreshments were liberally served. We were all blest by the pleasant service, and we live in the pleasant anticipation of another reunion at the next Christmas day. Oenevieve DeGraw. North Family. Jan. 1897. To-day, as on several previous Sabbaths, we attended religious service in the Church family's home chapel. They have a most beautiful room, large and convenient for seating a goodly company in the centre and for exercise in the march when the outer circle is formed. We have been greatly strengthened in spiritual union and Christian fellowship, by frequent mingling and commingling of soulful gifts, uplifting testimony and inspiring song. How pleased we would be, to meet with all the families in turn during the winter months. Our dear Canaan friends spent the Sabbath with us at the close of the year and we were only too glad to have them feel that we loved them as only gospel kindred can love. We would be happy if some generous hand would give them a lift in building up and sustaining their lovely home. May God bless all Zion through his instrumentalities, that prosperity and peace may reign in her courts. The spiritual cause is first in our hearts; but while we are inhabitants of this mundane sphere, we are under physical necessity and have material needs. Job said that 'He never saw the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread.' So if we work along the lines of righteous endeavor in earning our bread, and keep free from the entanglements of the world, we shall be 'blest in our basket and in our store.' We have no sleighing as yet; mountain roads are rough. Brethren are threshing by water power, and sawing wood when the mill pond is low. There are five members in our home that were not here at the beginning of the past year. Our good Brother, Levi Shaw, now nearly eighty years of age, is an honor to the Christian Communism, a shining light among the upright in character, and a blessing in his home where he is much beloved. Beloved Brother Alonzo Hollister, who occasionally attends our Sabbath evening meeting, is always a welcome visitor; his beautiful, chaste spirit wears the mark of angelhood. Love, joy and peace be with the whole household of faith. An especial blessing to those who sustain and continue our monthly Manifesto. May the increase of precious truth, be borne on its leaves for the uplifting and 'healing of the nations.' Martha J. Anderson.
