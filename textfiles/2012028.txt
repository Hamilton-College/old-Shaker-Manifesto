Sabbathday Lake. Nov. 15. While on our recent visit to Canterbury. Elder Henry presented each of us with a package of Dicken's lead pencils that we might be encouraged to write for the Manifesto and if he finds the space for Sabbathday Lake notes vacant he will think that we are negligent of duty. Our dear Ministry, who have been at Alfred for several weeks have lately returned to us laden with good gifts and we feel greatly ble^-t by their additional strength. True souls like them always carry the blessing of God with them. Now that our apples are gathered in we find that we have more than at one time we expected. Our evaporator is undergoing repairs preparatory to condensing the cider, five bbls. into one. This will keep it in good condition for use at any time that we may have orders for 'Shaker Apple Sauce' during the winter season. Nov. 9th we had a slight snow storm which has now entirely left us, and we are enjoying a delightful Indian summer. There are a number in our family approaching eighty years of age, but one over. Sister Lavina Mclntire, who, through a long life has been true to the Cause, faithful and consecrated. Though in feeble health and unable to attend our meetings, she is active in spirit and we enjoy being with her, sharing her motherly love and counsel. We have had beautiful letters from gospel friends in other Societies, tidings of good cheer drawing us nearer and nearer together in spirit. Lovingly farewell until you hear from us again. A. S. C.
