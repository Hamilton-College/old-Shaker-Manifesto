A SIGNIFICANT PRAYER We know that thou art the Infinite love— the healer and not the destroyer ot all thy people—the Father who pitieth his children more than a human father ever yet pitied— yea, the Mother, who comforteth all thy little ones more than a human mother ever yet comforted the children of her travail—and so we know that the hopes with which this mortal life is inspired are but as buds which will bear beneficent fruit for us in the immortal life that is to be. We pray that we may believe in the immortal life—that we may aspire after it, and yearn for it, with an unconquerable yearning—not because we would lead therein a life of slothful ease, but because, in toil and in endeavor, in self-sacrifice and in devoted love, we would become all that which immortal life, and immortal life only, will enable us to realize. But O Father and Mother! even here, while 'the muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close us in, ' may we be supremely content to serve a glad apprenticeship to that toil and endeavor, to that self-sacrifice and that devoted love. So will eternal life begin in us, and uhy kingdom come in us, and thy will be done in us, even as the eternal life has already commenced for, and thy kingdom already come to, and thy will already done by, those supremely beatified spirits who are nearest to Thee because they stoop the lowest to those of thy children, who, even in the immortal life, are yet sad and sorrowful. Amen and amen! —Inspiration of Rev. James K. Applebee in Boston Commonwealth.
