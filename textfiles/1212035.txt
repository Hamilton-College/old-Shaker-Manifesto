During the afternoon the visitors from Canterbury and from Enfield, also several of the Brethren and Sisters from our own family spent about two hours at the school house. After the exercises were finished Elder Henry, brother Frank and the four sisters, gave the pupils some very good advice that we grate. fully received. After this the Enfield visitors bid adieu to our Harvard home and took the train for Shirley. That evening our Canterbury friends remained at the Office, and we went over to see them. The next morning we parted with them not knowing when we should meet again. But I hope that I may so live, and so prize my privilege, that I may sometime, meet them again.
