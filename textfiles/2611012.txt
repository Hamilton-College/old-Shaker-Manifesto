South. Union, Ky. Oct. 1896. Our brick store at the South Union Station was recently burned to the ground entailing a considerable loss upon the Society. A new store has just been finished costing us $2500.00. Our taxes, although lai'ge, have all been paid. Have just purchased ten tons of fertilizer for our wheat fields at a cost of $270.00. Times are hard and our expenses are heavy, but we are out of debt. A. L. Johns.
