DESERVING PRAISE We would call the attention of our THE SHAKER 3O1 readers to the first paper of this number, contributed by our young friend, Henry T. Clough; who though lately arrived in his teens, expresses much good judgment and sound sense. We also take this opportunity of returning our sincere thanks for many kind letters received by us, from many of our elderly and young people, but which are too personally respectful to be expressed by type ; but for which we shall ever hold the donors ir happy remembrances.
