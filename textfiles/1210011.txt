TIRED OF LIFE LILLIE E. BARR It is the idle tire of life : The idle hearts, that duties shirk; The idle brains, that have no thought; The idle hands that have no work. The good man knows that life is good, And strives to make his own complete: The thoughtful know that it is great; The loving know that it is sweet. Yea, even when life halts with pain, Or falls with anguish by the way, Great souls it patiently detain, And hope, and bear, and humbly pray, Because life is so grand a thing; Because beyond its pain and strife They see a fair eternity That must be bought by noble life. Then, thou who are so 'tired of life,' Go work, go love, go try to think, Go find some duty, howe'er small, And then beside it do not shrink. Go take thy place ; it may be low, And in the rear of mortal strife, But fill it well, and then I know Thou wilt not say, 'I'm tired of life.'
