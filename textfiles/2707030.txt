THE BATTLE OF LIFE. [Contributed by Genevieve DeGvaw.] Think not that all warriors fight Where blood dyes with crimson the field, The unknown who dare to do right Are unhampered by warlock or shield. When neither the trumpet nor drum Incites the bold spirit to strife� In ranks where the victor is dumb� Waits the hardest combat of this life! The soldier who falls by his gun Sleeps well beneath laurels and bays, But unwept�how many a one Fights, conquers and dies without praise, The loyal may long to retreat From carnage so stript of renown; But the glory is full and complete When the soul lays its own tempter down Only dare to be honest and brave; Stand guard by what virtues you own; From the cradle straight on to the grave Do the right, tho unseen and alone. It is harder to vanquish, by far, One's self and life's pitiful ills Than even to stand up in war, Where slaughter the flesh only kills. The wounds that are deepest must bleed, Untended by surgeon or friend; Give your arm where you see the most need. As a private be firm to the end. The lip neither falters nor boasts, And true valor knows not of fear; Each day sees unbroken the hosts Who war with us ceaselessly here. Sel.
