Y. Aug. 1, 1887. Age 83 yrs. 8 mos. and 10 days. He united with Believers, Jan. 1849. Has officiated as business agent thirty years. His whole interest was consecrated to the gospel. His integrity was unsullied. He was a zealous convert to the Advent Cause, prior to his acquaintance with Believers, and had, therefore no reason to change his views of the Second Coming of Christ only with regard to the form. His life went out like a candle. He was busy up to the hour of his decease. C. Dibble. Most noble has thy record been.
