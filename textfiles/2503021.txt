Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1895. Oh! for a thaw! Scarcity of water for power purposes, makes us fearful of a ack for domestic use. We have had no 66 THE MANIFESTO. G7 thaws nor any rain for two months and everything is either dried or frozen up. Mascoma Lake is five feet below the top of the dam, which is as low as it can be drawn. We are glad that it happens in winter, as the same conditions in warm weather might be dangerous to health. The zero weather has made bad work with the water pipes, as well as large holes in the woodpile. Last month we sent a small donation of clothing to the sufferers in Nebraska.. We are glad to see The Manifesto is still flourishing and full of good things. We wonder though, sometimes, where some of the old contributors are. We appreciate every new one however. Long live The Manifesto! G. IT. Kirklei/.
