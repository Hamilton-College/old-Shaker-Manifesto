NO HERETIC Whittier Call him not heretic whose works attest His faith in goodness, by no creed confessed. Whatever in love's name is truly done To free the bound and lift the fallen one Is done in Christ. Whoso, indeed and word, Is not against Him, labors for our Lord. When he who, sad and weary, longing sore For love's sweet service, sought the sister's door; One saw the heavenly, one the human guest. But who shall say which loved the Master best?
