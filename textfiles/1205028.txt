THE COLLEGE MOUSE THE COLLEGE MOUSE. There was a little mouse Who lived in a college ; Why did he live there? Was he fond of knowledge-'' Did he wish to master Philosophy and Greek? Did he think the music Better than his squeak? No ; he only wanted To be away from cats, And trap-setting Biddies, And overbearing rats. He roomed with a student Not very fond of study, Who often ate and drank Until his bruins were muddy. Then the little mousey, From his hole would peep, And when he saw his room-mate Safe and sound asleep, Would climb upon the table, And help himself to cheese, And sitting on his haunches, Would nibble at his ease When his meal was ended, He would run about the floor, Searching all the corners He had not searched before. His bed vras 'neath the hearthstone So cosy and warm. Nothing could get at him To do him any harm. He was a happy mousey As ever came along, Therefore have I made him The subject ot my song. S. S.
