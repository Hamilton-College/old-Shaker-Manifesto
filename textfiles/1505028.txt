OUR DEPARTED SHEPHERD. AMELIA J. CALVER. TRIBUTE To the memory of Elder Daniel Crosman, Of 27ew Lebanon, Columbia Co., N. Y. The night damp settles on the fold; The shades of evening fall; A sorrowing flock, now wait in vain, Our trusted Shepherd's call. Far down the vale, we find him not, Nor on the mountain's crest; For the Shepherd of the ' Upper Fold' Has called him home to rest. Gone home to rest? Oh, can it be? When we have lov'd so long! Could not our filial constancy, His labors here prolong? Could not our earnest pleadings hold, Our dearly lov'd and blest? Though the Shepherd of the 'Upper Fold' Oft call'd him home to rest? Ah nay, the cruel toils of time Have worn his life away; 'Twas not within the pow'r of love, To ask his longer stay. Long suffering, with relentless hold, Has giv'n a martyr's test; And the mercy of the ' Upper Fold' Now bids him ' come and rest. ' No hireling Shepherd has he been To flee in danger's hour; No midnight watch, no heated noon, No foe, no alien power Has an unguarded vigil found, Nor a slighted Lord's behest, 'Till a message from the ' Upper Fold ' Has giv'n him time to rest. And who will now, with patient toil Bestow such loving care ; Who'll bless the nine and ninety safe And seek the wanderer? Who will with courage strong and bold, A Savior's name confess. And, like him, in the 'Upper Fold' Find a Savior's hand to bless? Dear Father, we'll not mourn thee now As one forever gone; Thy love still guards thy earthly fiock, And leads us ever on. And, when the river we have cross'd Which bounds that land so blest, We shall meet thee, in the 'Upper Fold' Where the weary are at rest. Mt. Lebanon, N. H.
