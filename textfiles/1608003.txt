STAND LIKE AN ANVIL BY BISHOP DOANE (We call special attention to these golden verses, inspired and inspiring, by an Episcopal Bishop. Such 'word of God' as this is not bound by any limitations of creed or sect.) ' Stand like an anvil, ' when the strokes Of stalwart strength fall thick and fast, Storms but more deeply root the oaks, Where brawny arms embrace the blast. ' Stand like an anvil, ' when the sparks Ply far and wide, a fiery shower; Virtue and truth must still be marks Where malice proves its want of power. 'ï¿½ Stand like an anvil, ' when the bar Lies red and glowing on its breast; Duty shall be life's guiding star, And conscious innocence its rest. ' Stand like an anvil, ' when the sound Of ponderous hammers pains the ear; Thine but the still and stern rebound, Of the great heart that cannot fear. !' Stand like an anvil, ' noise and heat Are born of earth, and die with time ; The soul, like God, its source and seat, Is solemn, still, serene, sublime. Selected.
