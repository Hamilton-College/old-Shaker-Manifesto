The Way to Avoid Calumny 'If any one speaks ill of thee,' said Epictetus, ' consider whether he hath truth on his side; and if so reform thyself, that his censures may not affect thee.' When Anaximander was told that the very boys laughed at his singing, 'Ay,' said he, 'then I must learn to sing better.' Plato being told that he had many enemies who spoke ill of him, said : 'It is no matter: I will live so that none shall believe them.' Hearing, at another time, that an intimate friend of his had spoken detractingly of him, he said : ' I am sure he would not do it if he had not some reason for it.' This is the surest, as well as the noblest way of drawing the sting out of a reproach, and the true method of preparing a man for that great and only relief against the pains of calumny â€”a good conscience.
