THE THREE RULES. Lucy S. Bowers. Iron Bule, Evil for Evil. The iron rule the passions well obey, It is the rule for rendering hate for hate, Regardless reason, yea regardless fate. Strife meets with strife in bitterest array. Sin over evil seeks to rule the day. 'Tis hard and cold revenge insatiate Felt for injuries small, as well as great; Tooth for a tooth, eye for an eye to pay. Selfishness and pain in like coin returned, Mete for measure, flame for fire that burned, [earned. Eecompense of wrong, just and justly 'Tis back to back, no Christian brotherhood, Feeling by animals scarce understood, 'Tis sin of double sin, all void of good/ Silver Bule, Good for Good. The silver rule, the rule of right for right, In better ways all human feeling leads, Which finds expression in good kindly deeds. 'Tis love for love, a measure of delight, And mercy which like mercy may requite. 'Tis sympathy which in its turn succeeds, 'Tis pity ministered, when pity heeds, And joy bequeathed, when other joys incite It is but good for good, no more, no less, No overflow, no added power to bless, 'Tis not, indeed, exceeding righteousness, In this the publicans do even so, But Christ has come to teach, that we may know The sweetness of life's perfectness below. Golden Bule, Good for Evil. The golden rule, the highest rule of thought, In Christ-like action lovingly expressed, Best guide by which the soul is surely blessed. By which the happy ways of peace are taught, [sought. Through which the blessedness of life is The power of Christ by kindly hearts possessed [distressed, Will help the spirit when with wrong And sweet forgiveness is the gift outwrought. The God-like soul to greater gain aspires Than wrong for wrong, or good for good requires, The fulness of the highest law it most desires. Be unto others ever just and true As you would have them be to you; E'en more than this God willeth you to do. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
