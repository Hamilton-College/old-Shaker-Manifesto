From the Little Children. Dear teacher Josephine: I have been looking at... Village, Mer. Co., N. H. Dear Teacher Josephine :ï¿½I have been looking at the evergreen trees in our front door-yard and I have learned that every Spring they form new leaves the leaves do not fall off in Autumn as the leaves of other trees they begin to change at the ends of the boughs. The new leaves are bright green and are very tender when they are fresh. I have noticed that the leaves of the peach tree are notched so fine that I think that no one could if they tried imitate them. I am trying to learn all I can while I am young so that when I am older I can be a help in society. Your Sister E. B. K. GOING TO SCHOOL.
