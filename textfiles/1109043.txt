SUNSHINE From an acorn weighing a few grains, a tree will grow for a hundred years or more, not only throwing off many pounds of leaves each year, but itself weighing several tons. If an orange twig is put in a large box of earth, and that earth is weighed, when the twig becomes a tree, bearing luscious fruit, there will be very nearly the same amount of earth. From careful experiments made by different scientific men, it is an ascertained fact that a very large part of the growth of a tree is derived from the sun, from the air, and from the water, and very little from the earth ; and, notably, all vegetation becomes sickly, unless it is freely exposed to the sunshine. Wood and coal are but condensed sunshine, which contains three important elements, equally essential to both vegetable and animal life—magnesia, lime and iron. It is the iron in the blood which gives the durability necessary to bodily vigor, while the magnesia is important to many of the tissues. True it is, that the more persons are out of doors, the more healthy, the more vigorous they are, and the longer will they live. Every human being ought to have an hour or two of sunshine at noon in winter, and in the early forenoon in summer. — Hall's Medial Adviser.
