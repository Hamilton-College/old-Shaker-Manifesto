IN REMEMBRANCE. Eldress Emily W. Hampton. Anna B. Goepper. 'Death loves a shining mark' was never, perhaps, more fully demonstrated than in the death of our dearly beloved Eldress Emily Hampton, who left the shores of time on the 27th of August, aged seventynine years and seven months. She was a tower of strength to this Society and had held many offices of trust, all of which she filled with dignity and with a Christian spirit. One beautiful trait of her character was particular attention and kindness to any one, young or old, whom sh'e thought likely to be slighted in any way, and her charity, tenderness, and sympathy to all, not only in this Society, but outside of it, was unbounded. During all these years of official duty, her life has been one of integrity and uprightness. She was a dear friend and mother to every individual with whom she became acquainted. 'None knew her but to love her, Or named her but to praise/' She was able to be about till within a very few days of her departure. We deeply deplore our loss and may we all meet her some day in that 'Sweet Bye and Bye.' Her funeral was well attended by all in the Society and also our neighbors, and many good and comforting admonitions were delivered by a number of the Brethren and Sisters. Long will her memory linger in many hearts, in and outside our quiet home, and her presence and sweet, gentle influence will be sadly missed by her people, to whom she was attached by the most endearing ties of Christian love.
