Juvenile. THE STORY OF GRUMBLE-TONE. Ella Wheeler Wilcox. There was a boy named Grumble-Tone, who ran away to sea. 'I'm sick of things on land,' he said 'as sick as I can be! A life upon the bounding wave will suit a lad like me!' The seething ocean billows failed to stimulate his mirth, For he did not like the vessel, or the dizzy, rolling berth. And he thought the sea was almost as unpleasant as the earth. lie wan*dered into foreign lands ; he saw each wondrous sight, But nothing that he heard or saw seemed just evactly right, And so he journeyed on and on, still seeking for delight. He talked with kings and ladies fair; he dined in courts, they say; But always found the people dull, and longed to get away, To search for the mysterious land where he should like to stay. He wandered over all the earth, his hair grew white as snow. He reached the final bourn at last, where all of us must go; But never found the land he sought. The reason would you know? The reason was that North or South, where'er his steps were bent, On land or sea. in court or hall, he found but discontent; For he took his disposition with him everywhere he went.ï¿½St. Nicholas. VICE OF LYING. There is no crime against self and others comparable, for enormity and destructiveness, with insincerity and the several forms of lying. Without this element there would be little sin in the world. It was the first fruit of sin, and it is the seed by which evil is propagated. There are many ways of lying, and the least direct is the worst. Playing on words, or misleading, or taking refuge in a special meaning, is worse than a simple falsehood. It costs the mind more pains to practice deception cunningly than to lie openly. The lie that looks like 'prevarication' is therefore not less, but more heinous than others ; and yet parents make light of these offenses and call them 'romances.' Truth is the regenerator by which human nature is to be restored. Selected.
