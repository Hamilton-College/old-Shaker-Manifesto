INDEBTEDNESS The trouble is, people do not live within their means. One individual thus soon becomes under obligation to another, and is speedily made a bond-slave of the varying fortunes of one whose business is very differ ent from and is not directed by his own volition, but by the will, wishes, and caprice of those who rule over him. Besides he not only involves himself, but he entails his misfortunes, like a cancerous scrofula, upon his innocent family, and many are made to suffer the penalty of the sins of one. He is afflcted more deeply as the years go by, and his circumstances change. His needs change, his calculations change, the facts of life change, and if he had the act to do again he would feel himself a criminal to allow such a thing. But he has already made the obligation, and he must now stand to it, even though he suffer severely, and his posterity after him. The penalty of the criminal must be suffered, though the enormity of the crime be largely mitigated by the ignorance or heedlessness of the act long before performed. Peter the First, king of Portugal, to restrain undue luxury, and prevent the ruin of families, is said to have absolutely forbidden his subjects from buying or selling without immediate payment, and for the second offense made the punishment death. â€”American Wesleyan.
