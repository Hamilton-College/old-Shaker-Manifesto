NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. . JS'ortli If&amp;mily. 'O what beauty there is in thee Ziou, lovely Zion; May thy strength and honor be Of an untold weight from heaven.' Our visiting company are all at home, having enjoyed a very profitable season with gospel kindred in seven different Societies. We could but notice that in every Society and family they had something different from every other. A peculiar manifestation of the beautiful spirit of love; a special spiritual gift and ministration; and when these meet together in the spirit and testimony of Mother's gospel we have the music of the spheres. One feature of our journey was specially interesting to me; and that was the graveyards ; they show real progress of spirit, and a gradual growth of understanding. This may not have come about from our designing, but it has come. The disposing of the mortal remains of our loved ones, has in times past, and is now, calling forth a good deal of exercise of mind. In passing by our burying places, and also many which did not belong to our order, I felt as though we might make the institution called death very interesting and profitable to the living. Instead of costly attire, expensive caskets and monuments of stone ; or wooden marks and tall weeds and briers, neither of which have a savory effect upon the living or upon the departed loved ones, 1 would like to set apart a room in which to place the shadow of the person who has just passed through the vail, with name and age, when they came among Believers, and any points of their history that would be of interest to the rising generations. Take, for instance, the aged saint, Elder Timothy Eandlett, sitting in his chair, patiently waiting the boatman's call; his countenance full of goodness and love; what pleasant thoughts and feelings it would excite to go into a room adorned with such shadows. A grave-yard is to me a place of sadness, and if the graves were opened, it would be a place of horror and disgust. Bury the body decently and in a place where it will do good and no harm, level the ground and keep a record and plan of the same, but do not put up costly marble slabs, or anything else. The angels set us an example in the disposing of the body of Jesus. Let us follow it. The hay and grain harvest about completed which has been very good. We have cut over 300 tons of hay, and some 50 acres of grain. Rye and wheat were excellent; oats generally light. If our machines and tools are all put away in good order, it will save time and vexation when we need to use them again Potatoes very nice; and though there are some things rather scarce, we have enough to fill every reasonable heart with gratitude and thankfulness, and to exercise ourselves in kindly Christian love towards everybody. D. Offord. Soutli ITa/mily. Dear Editor :ï¿½Not long since we told how many potatoes we had planted; now we must tell how wonderfully they have yielded. We do not find any nicer ones in market. We got fifteen very large ones in one hill, and if other crops have failed us, the potatoes have not. I think we have gathered two bushels of blueberries while we usually have three times two bushels. We will be twice glad to resort to the New Hampsnire syrup this year as that was not a failure. Since our last shower we have not been too warm. Those who have trouble with table salt should try putting in one cup of corn starch, in eight cups of salt. The people of Mt. Lebanon have proved it and like the way as the moisture is done away with. We have not been obliged to stay at home one Sabbath day this season on account of the rain. We are quite fortunate, as all meetings are together one day in seven which seems like the proper thing to do, some of the speaking and singing is excellent as it tends to union; 'we must dwell together in unity.'
