The True Ring The Churchman says : ' Men judge of Christianity by the lives of those who profess and call themselves Christians,' which we most assuredly agree with others, is a truth worth heeding in our Church. If we desire to proclaim our doctrines, we must live them. To Those Interested We hold ourselves open to lecture engagements for any further fuller exposition of ' Shaker Faith and Principles,' also upon ' The Jews, Jesus and Christians,' ' Spiritualism among the Shakers,' ' The False and the Truth of Spiritualism' 'The Gospel of Common Sense.' Our only stipulation would be to be paid our expenses in transitu, and a sum equal to twentyfive subscriptions for The Manifesto. A Great Need Will there not be a unanimous desire expressed for the re-issue of the paper Fractional Currency? Silver is heavy, unmailable and inconvenient, excepting as a necessity. Will not the press of the country urge upon our Senators and Representatives in Congress, for a bill that will give us paper money of frac- tional values, even as we now have legal tenders in greenbacks of larger denominations? In the meantime, let our subscribers comfort themselves with the pleasant assurance that a One Dollar Greenback will ensure a copy of The Manifesto to them for 1879, and also a copy to another of similar appreciations.
