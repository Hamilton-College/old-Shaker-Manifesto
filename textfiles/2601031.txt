The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for December begins with an illustrated phrenograph from a personal examination of the famous New York lawyer, Dr. William J. O'Sullivan, which is not only a close analysis of the gentleman's character, but contains also information pertaining to the talents required by the legal profession in general. It will be read with especial interest by all law students as well as practic- ing attorneys. Mr. George C. Bartlett concludes his tour in Switzerland. 'Practical Psychology,' by Dr. H. S. Drayton, is the continuation of a valuable series especially adapted for teachers and philosophical students. 'What Your Palm tells,' by Dora M. Morrell, describes a number of the most important and easily observed signs of character in the form of the hand. Dr. Beall gives an interesting study of the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough with two handsome engravings illustrating the art of reading character from photographs. The novelette, 'A Phrenologist's Prediction,' by Anna Olcott Commelin, is concluded. In the department of Child Culture, Prof. Nelson Sizer describes 'Precious Treasures in Earthen Vessels,' w7ith several illustrations and valuable advice to mothers. 'A Study in Sociology,' 'Another Drink Cure,' 'A Game that Cultivates Courtesy,' are features of the Science of Health Department. In the editorial pages a prospectus of many new things for the coming year is given. A national phrenological convention ir&gt; honor of Dr. Gail's centenary is proposed for 1896.
