Shakers, N. Y. July, 1899. Our attention was especially attracted to the article in the July Manifesto by Brother Joseph A. Wilson, and we were reminded of the saying of Emerson, 'Beware, when the great God lets loose a thinker.' Something of importance must then take place; but whether it will be for the weal or woe of the individual thinker or human society at large will depend upon the source from whence is derived the thoughts that find expression in words and acts. While it is true that there are some that have not the mental energy to expend in extensive thought, the majority of human life in our American Republic thinks enough, but the difficulty at present is to get them to train their thoughts in the direction from which will emanate results beneficial to themselves in the advancing of their ideal life, and as a result its outer manifestation, to a higher plane consequently benefiting humanity. We are temperately optimistic and whatever strengthens our hope in the ultimate destiny of human life brings a pleasure that the external things of life can not take away; and to meet an individual thinker who draws from that fountain of spiritual energy the thoughts that take form and expression as they come from the crucible of their life is of incalculable benefit to one who is reaching out with all the energies of his soul for the best that is attainable. The drought that has prevailed in the eastern part of our country was felt here in diminishing the hay crop and the small fruits. Strawberries especially felt it; some fields in this section on the uplands were not worth picking. To read of the devastation by flood in some sections of the west, we can not help questioning why are these forces so unevenly distributed? We have many things to be thankful for, and out of all this apparent confusion the Almighty arm will evolve harmony. In this hope we will place our trust, working for a higher and more advanced life, Hamilton De.Graw.
