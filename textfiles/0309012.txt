MENAGERIES We wish we could send a word of warning to the towns which Barnum's show is to visit. There travels with it a gang of pickpockets,sneak thieves, and burglars, for which, of course, Barnum is not to blame, nevertheless these scoundrels accompany the exhibition, enter and rob houses while the people are away to witness the parade, and in the crowds upon the streets and around the tents they do a big business in taking purses from countrymen's pockets. We reported a dozen cases last week, and probably didn't hear of half the cases of pocket-picking that occurred. The show draws thousands of dollars from the pockets of the communities where it is exhibited, and it is rather grinding to have the rest snatched by thieves. Two or three visits of Barnum at this rate would be as unprofitable as a destructive fire.â€” Saratogian.
