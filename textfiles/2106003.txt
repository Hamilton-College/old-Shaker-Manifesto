My Dear J--:--Your most important question... West Gloucester, Me. Feb. 1861. My Dear J�:�Your most important question, 'What is love,' I shall try to answer first, and it may be all I shall do, yet I may do more. 'Love is God,' and is found in everything He has created, though it may not be apparent in many substances at first sight, not even in the most perfect of his handiwork, the noble creature man. Is there anything lovely to the touch or taste of the chestnut, the walnut or the butternut, as they hang on their native stem? But take off the husk and crack the shell, and you will find something in them all that you like, if your taste is like mine. The most disgusting external of the human family has something lovely stowTed away in the secret recesses of the soul, that will be apparent when the shell is opened, though it may be but small in some. This love, or particle of God, is like pent-up water, and needs to have the barrier removed, when it will flow to its likeness and its level; to and from you and all others. The obstruction may be in you,.or it may be in the object of your dislike, but when it is taken away, love to love, or God to God will hasten and mingle, as two or more bodies of water become one wThen all hindrances are taken away. Just look into the flower garden when it is first seeded, and what is there to regale the senses? But wait for the beautiful flowers to show themselves, and what delight meets the eye as well as the nasal organs. See the huge masses of granite, of marble, of iron ore, the trees of the forest, and nature both animate and inanimate, and contemplate the beauties which may be brought to view by the artist and those who devote themselves to the training of beasts, birds and all animated nature. When you see a human form, remember there is a germ of loveliness sheltered somewhere in that casket, and do what you can to break the shell; not the outward form, but the veil of ignorance, superstition, skepticism, unbelief, or whatever may compose the barrier; and if then you find it too early and the nut has not ripened give time to have all things accomplished ; but rest assured that God, or love, is there and will one day spread out its flowTers so as to tingle the organs of sensation delightfully. You have many enemies to fight: this is nothing out of the common course ; every one has just the same in proportion to his strength. When the Israelites were in the wilderness, they lived on manna, and those who gathered much, had nothing over, and those who gathered little had no lack, for all gathered what they were able ; and it is the same, with us. We all have strength equal to our day ; this you see carried out in the present day, where the weak and feeble among us are provided for as well as the strong. You say we are ignorant of what passes in the minds of others : true, but the time is coming when our thoughts will take form, and we shall be transparent, and then we can read each other without the intervention of words. You are correct in your conclusions respecting traditions and false systems, your warfare should be against them and all erroneous theories, instead of those who are so unfortunate as to be cumbered with them, for God hates sin, but loves the sinner. It is so difficult for me to read a letter, that it is impossible for me to trace out the items one by one, as I have to get some one to read, and then before I can collect ideas and put them on paper, I lose the subject, unless it is very prominent, so you will have to wait until we meet, for small matters, for I cannot make them out on paper. Prayer. The spirit of prayer is the portion of God within the mind, and in proportion to the degree which we possess, so shall we feel as God feels in regard to his purposes, which feeling produces the prayer of faith, and we believe such and such purposes will be fulfilled and often have intense anxiety that they may be, and this being the feeling of God we co-operate with Him in consummating his and our purposes. God could, and would accomplish his purposes; but if we are one with Him, we cannot help feeling to unite with Him, and as He is the stronger part of himself, we lean upon and trust in Him. The love of God is of the same quality with the love of the Christian, for his love is shed abroad in our hearts, though we know that the great fountain which supplies all the millions of smaller streams, must exceed those streams, or it would soon be exhausted ; and the streams are liable to become fouled by passing through dirty pipes, but the pure love is the same in all. Farewell. John Kaime.
