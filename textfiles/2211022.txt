Watervliet, N. Y. Second. Family. Oct., 1892. The weather the past month has been very favorable to gather crops. Sweet corn is all cut and dried, also tomatoes are nearly all canned. Frost has held off remarkably, and it is well it has. As crops were so backward an early frost would have destroyed half of the crop.
