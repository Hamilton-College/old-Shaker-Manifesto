Reminiscences of an Octogenarian in the Field of Industrial and Social Reform Reminiscences of an Octogenarian in the Field of Industrial and Social Reform by Joshua K. Ingalls. As the first item of interest was an experience sometime in the year 1821 when the author was an infant of only five years, there has been a long series of years through which to study 'The Ways of Man.' The closing of this wonderfully interesting story takes place in July 1897. In the experience of more than seventy years the author has walkt and talkt, most familiarly, with many of the leading men of the country, and also become interested in many of the reformatory movements that were agitating Society, so that his book of Reminiscences or the story of his life becomes intensely interesting, especially to those who can bear in memory many of the pleasing incidents which he so graphically narrates.
