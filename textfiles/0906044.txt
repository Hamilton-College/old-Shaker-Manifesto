A SHORT SERMON Alice Cary One and all who hear my lay, This much I have to say : Each day, and every day, Do what is right— Right things in great and small ; Then, though the sky should fall, Sun, moon, and stars, and all, You shall have light. This further would I say : Be tempted as you may, Each day, and every day, Speak what is true— True things in great and small, Then, though the sky should fall, Sun, moon, and stars, and all, Heaven would show through. Figs, as you see and know, Do not of thistles grow ; And though the blossoms blow While on the tree. Grapes never, never yet On limbs of thorns were set; So, if you good would get, Good you must be. Life's journey through and through Speak what is just and true, Do what is right to do, To one and all. At work, and when you play, Each day and every day, Then peace shall gild your way, Though the sky fall.'
