COME OUT OF THE MUD. DANIEL FRASER. [Compiled from (lie '(jouI of Time' for the Manifesto.] ' Odt from the mud my brothers ! Or is it better still to toil and moil Through miry ways, only to seem to rise By trampling down each other- -such a rise Sinking us but the deeper. 'We are no angels brothers- -well we know We are no angels : let us live by law ! And as our fathers fell from love to rule, Climbing by law, we put ourselves to school And reach a surer heaven than they lost. The Golden City John in Patmos saw In vision, is no vision now to us. In very fact I see it coming down From heaven to earth- -the city of our hope. I see no temple there, for every one Is there a temple. Sacred every place, There every act is worship; every thought a [prayer. I see no priests, for all are priests; no king, For all are kings; no law but love, and that Is written on the hearts of men. No work is menial, and no state is low, And meanest vessel of the common weal Is holy; for all is holy, holy in its ends. O glorious sight! 0 bright abode of consummated joys Where life is one perpetual dance and song And jubilant procession ! [wants ' Very well for angels, but not suited to our We men and women of clay ! No ! No !' ' Give us a human city,' say 3re? Well, 1 grant this city is heaven ; but not, the less 'Tis earth and heaven also. Only those Who make a heaven on earth, as best they can Will find a heaven hereafter : human all Arc angels' joys, for angels are but men Advanced to perfect manhood. What say ye brothers? Is it worth our while To bate a little of our selfish aims, * And budge a step or two for such a prize? Hoping that the enclosed may be profitable I have the happiness to be ever your friend. Mt.
