LEST YE CUT THE ANGELS' FEET 'Because of the angels.'— 1st Corinthians xi, 10. I. ' Take heed,' say the Danish peasant-folks, As they gather around to eat, '¦ That ye lay not your knives with the edge upturn ed, Lest ye cut the angels'1 feet.' II. See how the Father showeth these, His ' babes,' whom we despise, The things that hide in our mists of pride From us the ' prudent ' ' wise.' When shall we, in our common life, Have such sweet tender care For the angel band of friends who stand About us everywhere ? III. Nay, even at our higher boards, When we gather round to eat, How often still with ' upturned ' ' knives ' We ' cut the angels' feet!' The Queen.
