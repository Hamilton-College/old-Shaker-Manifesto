MISSIONARY ITEMS The Seventh-Day Adventists — a body which numbers only about 20,000—propose to raise $100,000 in two years for missionary work in Great Britain. There is said to be a religious sect in Russia called the ' Helpers.' They avoid lying, stealing and getting in debt. An organiza- tion of that kind might accomplish good in this country. Let us graft thereon our re- ligion, if not there already. Let people make what excuses they will, one fact is assured, and can be proven to any by a little observation, that whoso makes objection, excuses, trouble or refusals to the paying of a small tax for the spread of the faith he professes to believe to be most righteous, will invariably be found spending the amount of such tax, multiplied many times, in worldly or beastly habits of selfish indulgencies.
