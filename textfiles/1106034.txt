We all love to hear good things said of us... We all love to hear good things said of us, and we are particularly anxious so to hear of our contributors. The Youths' Mirror, a sprightly and golden monthly, Altoona, Pa., makes us color a little when it so goodly says : The Shaker Manifesto, for April, is more than ever an intelligent and powerful advocate of the truth. '' Mental Fotografy,' by Catharine Allen, sets forth some startling ideas. 'A Letter to Jesus,' by Grace Eddy, is a touching and beautiful piece of poetry. The issue for May is also interesting. ' Better and Better,' by Wm. H. Bussell, points out plainly the truths the author seeks to convey. '' Harmony of God's Universe,' is by our favorite, Antoinette Doolittle, who, we think, belies her name. We are very much in love with the Manifesto, which we now receive regularly.
