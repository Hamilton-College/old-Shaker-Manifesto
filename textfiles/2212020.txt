Watervliet, N. Y. Second ITamily. Nov. 1892. It is now Nov. 10, and the beautiful fall weather that has been so universal throughout the country has been ours to enjoy up to present date. To-day instead of green grass that was just beginning to assume a sombre hue, a mantle of snow is seen and we realize that the first snow of the season in this section has fallen. But as our crops are secured, and we have a goodly store, we are not wholly unprepared for the cold weather should it abide with us. Our gospel kindred from Groveland, are moving to this Society as fast as consistent. A company of six Sisters and two Brethren arrived here on the 31st. ult. and were warmly welcomed by our good Ministry and the Brethren and Sisters. Elder Joseph in our first gathering with them welcomed them to our home, now their home. Eldress Harriet said that Believers should be one, no north, south, east or west, but all should be as one great family of Christ and Mother. Eldress Augusta also made them welcome in her mild and pleasant manner, and with these remarks, the Elders, Brethren and Sisters were united. May they be welcomed in the full sense of the word, for we feel that we have added to our numbers, spiritual strength, and may we grow and increase in all that tends to eradicate selfishness, and bind us together as the 'heart of one.' Health of Society good. Br. Chauncy Miller is still improving in health for which we are thankful, as he has been and still is a bright star in our temporal and spiritual firmament. t
