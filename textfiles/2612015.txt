Enfield, N. H. Nov. 1896. 'God loves the cheerful giver.' In taking a retrospective view of the years which reveal advancement of the various causes that have benefited mankind, we readily see that it has been the generous givers who have endowed humanity, transformed the wilderness of antiquated dogmas and human selfishness, into realms of practical good sense and human rights. And should not the people of God rank first as generous Saviors? thoughtful and kind in their dealing both in the human and animal kingdom. Through the scarcity of apples this season, we have become the recipients of kindred generosity. Our kindred at Mt. Lebanon, and East Canterbury, donated forty-five barrels of extra fine apples. Language with fine embellished sentiment could express our grateful feeling for the gift, but true gratitude is more than mere sentiment, as religion is more than an seolian harpsound that thrills only the heart of man. Not less than twenty barrels of pickles and one ton of beet seed have been sent to market. Another silo of sixty tons capacity has recently been added to our cow barn; and with the large lot of ensilage, one thousand and fifty bushels of turnips have been housed as food for the cows. By request, on the evening of Oct. 25th a company of eight attended service at East Lebanon. A quartette of Sisters rendered several of Zion's inspiring songs. So we would by union of spirit and sentiment, blend with the laws of God, so grandly revealed in the four seasons. In the green of Spring, new life, in the beauty of Summer, the harmony of right living, in the gold of Autumn, the fruits of good industry, and in the white of \V inter, emblems of Christ's purity; features of the soul enrapport with God's commandments. George, H. Baxter.
