'DON'T TELL. ' MARGARETTE DAVIS. Don't speak them, don't hear them, dear children, They're words that will lead you astray From home, from kind friends and from Heaven, Astray in the broad wicked way. When school-mates solicit tills promise, ''Now, don't toll' your friends where you go, Be sure it is guilt seeks the cover, As need of deception doth show. When your heart contains secret planning You cannot with pleasure reveal To father, or mother, or guardian, Then wisely the matter unseal. Don't think for a moment to hide them, For mem'ry a record doth bear, And plain as the stars that shine o'er us The deeds of our life appear there. Then always be truthful, dear children, Though you have done ever so wrong, Repentance will bring joy in heaven; And truth over error make strong. Canterbury, N. H.
