Canterbury, N. H. Feb. 1890. Elder Oliver Hampton of Union Village sends us a sprig of blooming myrtle, taken from the plant in front of their dwelling. We fear the little flower will regret its mid-winter advent. H. C. 13. Ofjr Beloved Elder Henry :�Did you ever tell a straight forward honest story and while it was even fresh with printers' ink need to tell another exactly opposite, both equally true�halves of one great whole? Such is our case. When we reported good health for Canterbury last month, we wrote truthfully. Close upon the same, however, came an attack of the prevailing 'epidemic.' S-i:h a serio-comic experience! We will not say much about it, as we do not believe in transmitting disease even at the point of the pen. We confess to have been taken by surprise. Luckily for us, however, that we are all on the upward grade, without serious or fatal results, is truth for to-day. Sin u!d a similar attack ensue, profiting by our last lesson, we hope to show better tactics in parrying the blow or dealing with the unwelcome visitor. Our sisters at the North Family, meanwhile, pursued the 'even tenor of their way' at shirt-making for a firm in Boston, enjoying uninterrupted health. This gave us who live a little lower down the street, much pleasure and satisfaction in looking up to the North as bearing away the palm. Winter with us singularly open. But little snow, sleet and rain predominating. Ice harvest occurred on the 6th. and 7th. inst. Amount stored, 100 tons solid. Ice cut bymachinery into cakes 22x22 16 in. thick, supplying our S iciety and neighbors at the same time. Elder Alexander and company are sawing wood with the 'Cleveland Engine,' sixhorse power, averaging twenty-five cords daily. The ring of the saw fills the air with pleasant music. More devoted hearts or willing hands are rarely found. Hosiery knittHg by sisters progressing. Machines in successful operation. Our Distiict School closed its winter term the 14th. inst. Examined by S. S. Committee of the town. Good work by both teacher and pupils. Accuracy and thoroughness the leading characteristics.
