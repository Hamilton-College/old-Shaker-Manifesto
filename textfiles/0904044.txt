The farmer who keeps all the stock... The farmer who keeps all the stock his farm will safely carry, and ' feeds them fat,' soon has fat acres, even if they were not originally so, from the manure returned to the soil. And the fatter the cattle are made the better the soil will become. So fat cattle make fat farmers.
