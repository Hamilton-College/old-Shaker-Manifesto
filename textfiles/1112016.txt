WELCOME PROGRESS It is more than one hundred years since the founders of the Shaker Church, arriving in America, preached the good news of a present salvation from sin, and consequently from the punishments of sin through a life of self-denial, similar to 'that lived by Jesus, and which saved Jesus. Pur- THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 275 ity, Peace, Equality and Unworldly ambitions ranked first, a most worthy of attainment. For the possession of these any, and every necessary self-denial was endured. Closely allied to these, but secondary in importance were theological beliefs, which,however unorthodox and heretical at the time, have since become the popular beliefs of the millions. Ann Lee taught that 'Hell' was the torments of conscience; not a literal 'fire and brimstone ;' and though she taught more than a century since, this idea is now generally accepted as most true. Ann Lee rejected with abhorrence the theory of a physical resurrection, which only a few years since was the popular belief; therefore, the Shakers were ready for the advent of spiritualism, and able to interpret its manifold phenomena. The Second Advent having already occurred among the Shakers, they welcomed the progress of the idea, when it sprung upon a startled world. The equality of the sexes before the law and before God has been peculiarly and originally Shaker ever since their rise, and every new ray is hailed with especial delight. To the Shakers, God is Male and Female — Father and Mother. The earliest testimony of the Shakers was accompanied by a protest against slavery, white or black. The Shakers, having been communists since their origin, welcome the dawn of the grand anti-monopoly theory and practice. By their invariable testimony against national wars and family contentions, they were and are ready for the past and future settlements of difficulties by arbitration. There have been no forward movement yet made by Church nor State but were anticipated and longed for by the little, obscure people, called Shakes. We would welcome more progress, particularly in the churches; we would welcome the relinquishment of the unstable hope, dreamed of in the atonement doctrine, and the substitution of the real life of Christ, which will save, and make us at-onement with Christ. We look for this consummation with positive certainty, and welcome its dawning from any circumstance and from every quarter. The Shakers have very much to gain before they assert their proficiency as a Christian people; but they have thus far been in the van of all the dghteous demonstrations that have reformed Church and State for the better; and yet stand ready to welcome more, and an eternal increase of morality, justice and true religion. These forward movements have been made at the expense of proneness to selfish considerations; and extreme self-denial in the foundation of the Shaker life and Church. ¦
