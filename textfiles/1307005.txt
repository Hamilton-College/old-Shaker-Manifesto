A PRAYER. POLLY C. LEWIS 0 righteous Father ! We pray fervently, and in humility for the sake of thy Zion and the good of her inhabitants that she may not fail to honor thy holy way. In thy mercy, Heavenly Father, do visit her people and make them pure in thy sight. Let thy power roll until not one stone is left unturned, nor one twig left leafless. We know, Heavenly Father, thy goodness and mercy is great, therefore we pray that the remnant of Israel may prosper, that the aged ones may be crowned with peace and their few remaining days be to us a life long blessing. We pray, earnestly, that wisdom may lead and direct those that are young ; that they may walk in thy holy way. Lead them by the hand of thy love. Water them with the sweet dews of repentance. O righteous Father, bless them with firmness, and with fortitude in life's battle, and shield them from the snares of sin. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
