MY LITTLE BED LUCY S. BOWERs Written with, and for the little girls. A long time since in the mossy turf, Where the brooklet babbled by ; Grew a lovely tree from a seed as small, As the pupil of your eye. 'Twas not the oak of the mountain top; For those from acorns grow ; But the emerald boughs of the forest-pine, In the valley just below. Yea the lovely pine, where' the little birds. Attuned their rapturous praise, And a covert found in the dewy night, And from noon-tide's scorching rays. 'Twas from this tree so fine and large, That my bedstead small was made ; On which I rest when the stars shine out. In their silvery light arrayed. It was hewed apart from it's native soil, By the woodman's swinging tool; Of branches shorn, and brought to the mill,' And sawed by the sawyer's rule. Then, grooved and planed by the carpenter It's frame was all complete ; And covered well by the painter's oil, It was handsome strong and neat. A tick well filled with husks, or straw, From the farmer's grain, or corn, Makes soft and warm my nightly lodge, From early eve, till morn Two sheets, as white as the driven snow, Or the blue sky's fleecy cloud,â€” Are spread all over my little bed, A sweet and cleanly shroud. They came from the land of golJen fruit Where the grand Mississippi flows ; And the Gulf-Stream washes the shining sands And many a beauty growrs. For there on the broad plantation grounds, Where the Negroes toil and sing, Grows the cotton-shrub with it's tassel bloom, And a harvest rich they bring. The blossoms plucked by the tawny hand, Are placed in a large machine, Where the seeds are cast from the downy turf, And makes them white and clean. Then drawn into threads of wond'rous length, By spindles of glittering steel; While the warp, and woof with rattling loom The power of skill reveal. And this is the way my sheets are made, By many a busy hand: And bought with a sum of golden coin, From the vender's trading-stand. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. (To be continued.)
