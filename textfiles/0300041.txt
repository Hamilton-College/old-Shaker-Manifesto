WHEN WILL THE END COME? BY O. W. HOLMES 'When legislators keep the law, When banks dispense with bolts and locks, When berries, whortle, rasp, and straw, Grow bigger downwards through the box— When he that selleth house or land, Shows leaks in roofs or flaw in right, When harberdashers choose the stand Whose window has the broadest light — When preachers tell us what they think, And party leaders all they mean— When what we pay for, that we drink, From real grape and coffee bean— When lawyers take what they would give, And doctors give what they would take— When city fathers eat to live, Save when they fast for conscience sake— When one that has a horse on sale Shall bring its merit to the proof, Without a lie for every nail That holds the iron on the hoof— When, in the usual place for rips, Our gloves are stitch'd with special care, And guarded well the whalebone tips, Where first umbrellas need repair— When Cuba's weeds have quite forgot The power of suction to resist, And claret bottles harbor not Such dimples as would hold your listWhen publishers no longer steal, And pay for what they stole before — When the first locomotive wheel Rolls through the Hoosac tunnel's bore :— Till then, let Cumming blaze away, And Miller's saints blow up the globe ; But when you see that blessed day, Then order your ascension robe.
