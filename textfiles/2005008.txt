LIVE NOT FOR SELF. Maritta Streever. Live not for self; Ah! God requires Thine all to Him be given : The heart's emotions and desires, Should rise in prayer to heaven. Live not for self, while others need The good that you may do ; They as a slender bending reed, In hope may lean on you. Live not for self; too often lies Deep buried in the heart, Some hidden anguish that defies, The strength of will to part. Live not for self; can we with-hold The talent we possess? Or stand with feeling stern and cold, Without a heart to bless? Live not for self; for love is thine To show in deeds of worth, That will with precious life divine Lift weary souls from earth. Those who with watching, toil and care, Grow weary in the strife, Shall bless the hearts that help them bear The chastening ills of life. Each brother true, and sister dear, Should loving aid receive; Those kindly words which bless and cheer, And burdened hearts relieve. Angelic then be our enploy ; Our spirits sweet and calm, Shall fill life's golden cup with joy, And pour love's healing balm. Then not in thought for self alone, Shall prayer's incense arise, But that our hearts may blend in one, Through noble sacrifice. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
