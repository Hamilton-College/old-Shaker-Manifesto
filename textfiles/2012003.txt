AS YOU GO THROUGH LIFE. Don't look for the flaws as you go through And even when you find them [life ; It is wise and kind to be somewhat blind And look for the virtue behind them. For the cloudiest night has a hint of light Somewhere in its shadows hiding; It is better by far to hunt for a star Than the spots on the sun abiding. The current of life runs either way To the bottom of God's great ocean, Don't set your force 'gainst the river's course. And think to alter its motion. Don't waste a curse on the universe� Kemember, it lived before you. Don't butt at the storm with your puny for m� But bend and let it go o'er you. The world will never adjust itself To suit your whims to the letter, [long, Some things must go wrong your whole life And the gorier you know it the better. It is folly to fight the Infinite, And go under at last in the wrestle. The wisest man shapes into God's plan, As the water shapes into a vessel. [Ella Wheeler Wilcox in Ladies' Home Journal.]
