HOLY CITY. 'And the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.' Rev. xxi: 18. Canterbury, N. H. Ye shall reach the holy city, Ye shall walk its streets of gold; All its elements of beauty To thy vision shall unfold. When the love of truth shall anchor Thy whole life in deeds of light, Pearly gates of peace shall open Into courts forever bright.
