THE SILVER LINING 1. Though dark clouds may often gather That would make our pathway drear, Angel voices sweetly utter Lo, the silver lining's near, 2. Hope and faith shall e'er sustain us, While for heaven we prepare, For beyond the darkest shadow Lies a silver lining there. Chorus. O the glorious silver lining, See the clouds now break away, Inspiration's light is shining, Ush'ring in the heav'nly day.
