Home Topics Unleavened Loaf Bread The Shakers claim to make the best unleavened loaf bread from pure Graham flour. Here is another recipe which makes a very nice composition bread: Mix the best of rye and Indian meal in equal proportions into a soft dough, with cold water in hot weather, but warm water in cold weather. Mix and knead it with the hands until light, and lay it softly, so as not to press out the air confined in it, in deep tin pans. Now smooth over the top with the moistened hand so as to give it a neat appearance. Let it stand over night, then bake it in an oven, hot at first, but gradually cooling. If it could be made late enough in the evening to be allowed to remain in the oven over night, it would make a very nice breakfast bread. â€” Laws of Life.
