84 Russell St., Melbourne W. H. Terry 84 Russell St., Melbourne October, 4, 1881. My Dear Elder Lomas : I read with some concern your brief article in the August Manifesto ' can we afford to suspend ? ' and my reply is a solid no. The gems with which the magazine is so thickly stud ded are infinitely more valuable than the dollars that represent the subscription money, and the world would be poorer for their loss. The only transmittable money I have by me is a two dollar note which I inclose as a small help to pay expenses. I understood from your letter a few months since that my last remittance would pay my subscription to the end of current year. If the Manifesto goes on, as I sincerely hope it will, I will at that time send twenty dollars toward next issue, taking whatever copies it is convenient to send. I know what a thankless office the editorship of a religious paper is, having had twelve years' experience of it, and can therefore sympathize with you as a brother, but hold on just a little longer, my friend, till some one capable of bearing the burden takes it from your shoulders. Yours fraternally,
