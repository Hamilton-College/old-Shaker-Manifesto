Groveland, N. Y. Sonyea, Nov. 6, 1889. Our sweet corn drying was finished September 22nd. From sixteen acres unharmed by flood and frost we have realized a generous yield, the finest and best the Genesee Valley could produce. Imperfect and undeveloped ears were not discovered among the whole sixteen acres. Some unseen agency recompensed us for losses sustained through the destruction of some other crops Potatoes throughout this section are decaying badly. We have harvested nearly six hundred b'ishels; with fair weather we should have grown several hundred more; but success in our potato culture has (we are glad to record) smiled on us as you will see. From a little less than one half acre our gardeners raised one hundred and seventy-five bushels. The variety is known as the 'Stray Beauty.' They are still beautiful and free from blight and decay. Farmers here finished sowing wheat October 12th. All up and growing nicely. Our hay crop is very good though inferior to that of last year. Constant rain injured it to considerable extent. We continue shipping milk to Rochester, morning and evening, probably shall throughout the winter. They all want it for 'tis good and pure. Never has been to a 'Water Cure.' G. D. G.
