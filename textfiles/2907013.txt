Union Village, O. June, 1899. The morning is pleasant, with clouds thinly covering the sky, and some signs of showers are present. We think we have had a sufficiency of rain for the present. Strawberries are coming in fine and large, and our black and raspberry bushes are full of blossoms and promise to be abundant. We raise to-day a stock barn at our Westlot Farm, 100x35 ft. In a few days we shall raise another at the North family 40x30 ft. All crops at present look promising and if we could only persuade people who need salvation, to come in and partake with us of all these great blessings, and of that infinitely greater boonthe everlasting gospel;then we should have nothing left to be desired. If we all would agree to adopt the ideas of Edward Bellamy into practical life and surrender our selfishness, and live on terms of equality, we might then hope gradually to see the beauty of the genuine Christ life. Now is an excellent time for the study and practice of that 'patience of the saints' spoken of by the inspired Seer of Patmos. Nothing is more necessary for Believers, than the exercise and continual practice of patience. Our health is very good and this reminds me that we neglected to send to The Manifesto, an obituary of our brother, Henry Tobin, who deceased July 9, 1897. Age 81 years, 9 mo. and 13 days. He had lived in the Church family about 20 years. Faithful in duty, orderly in conduct and an excellent miller. We try to abound in charity, but we find it at the expense of no little self-abnegation. May we abound still more in this first of all spiritual gifts. We also abound in many beautiful flowers and flowering shrubs, which look splendid at this time of year and seem to indicate that we are determined not to have 'All cross and no glory.' We love to read the Home Notes of all the Shakers, east, west, north and south. O- C. Hampton.
