HUMAN SACRIFICES! Mr. Editor—The ancient Israelites in 1,000 years sacrificed to their war-God fifty millions of human beings! The creed of Christians in 1,600 years sacrificed to tjieir trinity God one billion three hundred millions of human beings! Or, twelve millions more than the present population of the globe For shedding human blood the Christians beat the Jews, the Pagans, the Mahometans, the Mormons, the world ! The Israelites ceased to slaughter when swallowed up by Pagan Rome! The Christians stayed their bloody hands when they lost the power of the State! The orthodox churches in the North are making desperate efforts to amend the United States Constitution so as to include fundamental dogmas of their creeds — an incipient and covert attempt to unite Church and State ! These churches cost the people of the United States two hundred millions of dollars per annum ! These corporations hold real and personal property, exempt from taxation by the State or General Government, three hundred millions of dollars ! Is it right to take money out of the pockets of the millions of heretics and non-professors to support priests, parsons, and powerful ecclesiastical monopolies? They tell us that salvation is free! Free? Tt takes a California gold mine every year to pay expenses! Let us organize an anti-Orthodox Church Grange! R. Peterson
