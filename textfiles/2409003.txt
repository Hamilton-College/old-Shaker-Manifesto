FOR THOUGHT. By Alonzo G. Hollister. IT is clear to me how souls may progress in the spirit world, without reincarnation. I have no sympathy with that doctrine. It seems like a childish speculation of intellectual minds, who must have something to fill the void made by the absence of knowledge. Some people feed on fiction till it seems more real to them than truth itself; then they begin to doubt truth, because it does not fadge with their imbibed fictitious measure. True intelligence will teach them better things. A true knowledge of spiritual states will eventually so commend itself to reason as to cast out the fantastic and unreal. If the true is not immediately grasped by the understanding, the latter will leave as it becomes accustomed to its growth and reality. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
