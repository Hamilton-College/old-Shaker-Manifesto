Wisdom — Wisdom is alchemy, or the art of changing base metal into gold. This is its unfailing characteristic, that it finds good in everything, that it renders all things more precious. When our view is confined to ourselves, nothing is of value, except what ministers in one way or another tc our personal gratification; but in proportion as it widens, our sympathies increase, and when we have learned to look on all things as God's work, then they are all endeared to us. Hence nothing can be further from true wisdom than the mask of it, assumed by a cold indifference about what does not belong to our personal interest. But the strongest symptoms of wisdom are in a person being sensible of his own follies and weak points. — Maria Witham
