THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH IS PAST. By George W. Smart. The bitterness of death is past, When we burst the bonds that bind to sin, And turn from pleasure's tempting sway, To cultivate the good within. The bitterness of death is past, Wnen our heart's free love to God is given, The world's vain treasures seem like dross, And souls in rapture seek for heaven. The bitterness of death is past, When worldly ties are rent in twain, When earth's bright baubles value lose, And loss of wealth and fame, seems gain. The bitterness of death is past, When our sin-sick soul throws off all fear, Celestial glory opes to sight, And Heaven's bright 'pearly gates' appear. The bitterness of death is past, When the ransomed soul its glories sing, O Grave ! thy victory is lost; And Death, O Death ! where is thy sting? Canaan, N. Y.
