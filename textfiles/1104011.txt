Editor Manifesto : Abraham Perkins I am so frequently receiving letters like the following, which so very much demonstrates the spirit which is at work in the hearts of many, I thought it might not be out of place to forward the following extracts which you are at liberty to publish with my earnest desire that still brighter vision may be developed for a clearer understanding of the great work of God; the seeds of which are planted in the earth and so far germinated as to produce fruitage and to give indubitable evidence of a power that purifies the heart and prepares it for an abiding habitation for the Most High. In much love, your brother, Enfield, N. H., March 25, 1881.
