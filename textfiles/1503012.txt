What is that to us? We but slightly... West Gloucester. Me. ' Tis done ! Dread Winter spreads his latest glooms, And reigns tremendous o'er the conquered year. ' What is that to us? We but slightly feel its effects, hived together as we are in our pleasant dwellings, enjoying the hoarded increase of our broad fields, our gardens, orchards and vineyards. We saw the Spring, Summer and Autumn pass away, while joys and sorrows alternate filled our cup. We mingled our tears when affliction's wave rolled over, and exulted together in the blissful hour. Pleasant memories arise of much that we have enjoyed in the year that has passed, particularly those seasons when, our brethren and sisters visited us* from other societies of Believers. You came to see us from your beautiful homes, and with you came a blessing which passeth not away with the ouward flow of time. We remember wheu we united in songs of praise in the sanctuary, and the word went forth for judgment and mercy to all who would listen from for and near. We remember pleasant walks over this consecrated domain, and rides over the hills and dales of the neighboring; towns. Those days are passed but the joy remaineth. A good aged Father from the society of Enfield Conn, visited us in the beautiful month of June, and in a social meeting sung of his great love to our blessed Mother Ann Lee, who held aloft the standard of purity, and revealed principles which are now widely accepted. We were awakened to a realizing sense o-f the vastness of her mission, overthrowing creeds, and establishing theories which cannot be shaken by the increase of light in the world, nor the forward march of science. ' O my Mother, my blessed Mother, Her name to me is dear, I'll praise her name I'll spread her fame, And kings and priests shall hear. There's many thousands praised her name, And shall be many more. Yea millions, millions, tens of millions Shall her name adore. ' Father James Whittaker, when a young man in England saw a vision of the Order that was yet to be established in America, and it was like unto a beautiful tree, every leaf thereof shone with the brightness of the sun. Those leaves are the gems of priceless worth, held in place by the branches, receiving nourishment from the root, drawing life from the atmosphere around, the rain, the dew and the sunshine of the heavens. Those leaves are my Brethren and Sisters inhabiting the Zion of God, clothed with the love and growing in the likeness of our Heavenly Parents. In worship, I have seen them pass and rcpass each other, like the angels, singing,ï¿½ ' 'Tis the kind words, 'tis the sweet words That cheer the downhearted, That lift up the spirit From doubt and despair. O then I will speak them Unto you, my brother, I'll breathe forth a blessing To you, my dear sister. ' Aurelia Mace.
