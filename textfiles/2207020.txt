Shaker Station, Conn. 'Give us this day our daily bre^d.' Why should we ask the Lord to give us what He is constantly providing in some measure, whether we ask Him or not? Because by asking we acknowledge that we are dependent upon Him for our bread by whatever agencies He sends it to us. He feeds the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field. He clothes the lilies with beauty and makes the hills and valleys smile with harvests. Our spiritual and temporal food is truly the Lord's gift, and we should feel our absolute dependence upon Him for all blessings. We should pray without ceasing and with perfect faith, 'Give us this day our daily bread.' If we are living to God, our hearts will overflow with gratitude and thankfulness, for blessings chiefly spiritual, but also temporal. Let us praise God for his unbounded goodness. Our Hubbard squashes that sold at three cents a pound were a paying crop. When stored in a dry and cool cellar they can be kept until May. The poultry business is peculiarly adapted to all classes of society. The hen is a general favorite all over the land, and she is ever ready to do a good deed for humanity. Keeping fowls is a business that one should know something about before investing too largely. Economical feeding involves a knowledge of the needs of the fowls as well as the composition of the foods. Too much whole grain is not so good as a fair supply of bran and milk. When chickens are two weeks old cracked corn may be used to some extentcorn meal and bran. When grown together in large numbers and they have little or no opportunity to forage for themselves, the food should be suited to their age and wants. 4345 spaces of cream were sold in May. D.
