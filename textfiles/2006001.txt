KINDNESS. Mary Whitcher. Who treats the weaker with neglect, Or cruelty doth show, Hath not for God or man respect But stands in scale below. No human eye who sees the thrust To any living thing, Could e'er their life or interest trust To such, or tribute bring. The noble heart defends the least, And deals do needless death, But what is man that he should boast Whose life is but a breath. Canterbury, N. H.
