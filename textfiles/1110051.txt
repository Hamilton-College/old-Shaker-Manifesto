TENDERED TO OUR PRESIDENT AMY BOWERS My head shall not refuse to bow, My knee shall not refuse to bend, My hand shall not be left unraised, Nor shall my heart forget to send One little off'ring up. A prayer, as pure, as white as these Fresh flowers from Nature's bosom culled. Oh Father! give me lips to breathe ; And let all selfish thoughts be lulled, While from the Nation's cup I drink one little drop, that mine With other hearts the thrill may feel Of perfect love and sympathy, Which gives its wealth without appeal, To every human grief. Oh Memory ! keep thy leaves as green As these, unfading in thy trust; Keep all the chastened grace which grows From out to-day's tear-sprinkled dust. Nor let its life be brief. The above lines were written by a young sister who has been confined to her room by sickness. Unable to attend the Family meeting, in honor of our President, she wrote her offering and laid it across a bouquet of white flowers and green leaves. Sympathy is the golden key to unlock the gates of Sorrow, showing us the glory within. Canaan, Sept. 26, 1881.
