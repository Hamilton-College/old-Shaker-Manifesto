TRUE THEOLOGY. NO. 3. Harvey L. Eads. Perhaps I have said enough respecting man's duty to God, and of his reasons for neglecting the same, and of rewards for obedience. I will now say something of his duty to his fellow man ; Christ has put it in few words; 'As ye would that men should do unto you, do ye also to them likewise.' This includes the whole duty of man to man ; but more may be added of man's duty to God through his agency. Now in obedience to Christ I will be free to speak not only to those without the fold but also to those within, who if they will, may take it as a voice from beyond the crystal river, as there shall be as liftle of self in it as though I were on the other side; well knowing that every honest soul who loves truth more than self, will be thankful to have any error corrected ; all such will say: ' Hew to the line let the chips fly which way they may.' I will remark that any person who writes on any subject which contains nothing but assumption and conclusion, should know that he has proved nothing ; as no two postulates can prove anything without a middle premise ; for instance we may say truly, that Jesus was the son of man, and Christ was the son of God, with these two postulates nothing is learned or proven. It rather beclouds the idea of who was and is the Christ, when by a middle premise il is made clear, that the two are the same, and also who was and is the Christ. All lexicographers and all persons agree, that the anointed means the Christ or the Messiah and that the man Jesus was the Anointed, and consequently the Christ, which is proved as follows:� 1st. Sumption. Jesus the son of man was and is the anointed. 2nd. Sumption. The anointed was and is the Christ the son of G-od. Ergo. Jesus the son of man was and is the Christ the son of God. The premise admitted, the conclusion is irresistible ; add to this, which is in itself indisputable, we have the word from God that Jesus is his Beloved Son, and of Jesus that he was the son of man, and was the Christ the sou of God ; also that of his apostles. Peter declares that Jesus was the Christ, the son of the living God, the truth of which I have demonstrated; and he also truly testified that God anointed him with the Holy Ghost and with power. Acts x., 38. 'And this Jesus whom I preach to you is Christ,' Acts xvii., 3, and John testifies that those who deny it are falsifiers. But in order to disparage his Messiahship it is affirmed, without any show of reason, that God sent a second or third class angel to anoint Jesus, and this, right in face of the fact, that God was present, and heard Jesus' confession through John, who stood in God's order for that purpose, and there and then proclaimed to John and to the world: 'this (Jesus) is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.' Thus Jesus who was the son of man, became the son of God, and his Christ or Messiah. There is no possible way for this to be controverted. Then can it seem reasonable, that God being present and well pleased with his Son, should send to the North Star or to some remote part of space, for a second class angel to come and anoint him ? Not at all; the idea is nothing but a chimera or idle fancy, for which proof is impossible. It is further asserted that the time would come when we should ' travel away from all Bibles.' I will here say that the Bible itself and all history has shown, that when any nation or people have thrown the Bible aside with the law and the prophets as unworthy of thought, the curse of God has followed them and when they returned to it, God's blessing came to them ; and when Believers travel away from him who was the light of the world, and from his recorded word which was from God, they will forfeit God's blessing and walk in darkness. It is further stated by a teacher, that, he does not see why we are bound to follow Christ any more than Christ was bound to follow Moses ; this is darkness to be felt. 1 could see this in early years. The reason is plain enough; Christ was uot the re-appearance of Moses, Moses was the type, Christ the antitype. Moses the shadow, Christ the substance; the substance cannot follow the shadow. John the Baptist was the re-appearance of Elias, whose commission was to turn the hearts of the people to the Mosaic law from which they had backslidden. Christ's was to introduce to the world a higher law, which would abrogate the necessity of the Mosaic, and raise mankind above all its demands, and introduce God's spiritual law, and lay the foundation of his New Heavens and New Earth, wherein righteousness should dwell. 'I his is reason enough why Christ and his followers need not look to the Mosaic law for anything; they not being under the law ; and now that we are blest with his second appearing we become his disciples by following him and walking as he walked, we have not gotten something above Christ as Christ had above Moses, but the re-appearance of the same thing, the same life and requirements ; were it something else, we could not be called his followers, and have been preaching a false doctrine for the last hundred years or more ; but we rightfully claim to be his followers, because we live the life that he did. He has come as predicted ; as a thief in the night and in having his life, we have the substance, and having the substance, need not the shadow ; and all is required now that he ever did or can require of mortals, and all is given that could be were he here in person ; heuce the material is unnecessary, and being unnecessary, can never take place on earth. So I would say to Second Adventists and all others, cease to look up to the sky for the shadow which you will never see since the substance is already here. Then let all cease to look without and look within for, 'Know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is iu you except ye be reprobates.' 2 Cor. xiii., 5. And if he is within us, what more can we ask, what more can we desire? All who look beyond him for something nearer to God than he was, look in vain. Let us reach the point to which he attained before trying to reach a higher or better condition. I feel safe in saying: the man never lived on earth and never will who was, or will be more fully in the bosom of the Father than he was, nor more ooe with Him. He is 'the light of the world and all who follow him shall not walk in darkness.' His recorded word, which is the word of God will ever be a light to the world ; but some deny that the Bible contains God's word. If a letter written by a man contains his word, a book can contain the same, or can contain the word of God. If Christ spake the truth, it is futile to deny it. He said the words he spake were not his, but were given him of God ; then they were God's words. The case logically stands thus : 1st. Sumption. Christ spake God's word. 2nd. Sumption. This word is recorded in a Book. Ergo. This Book contains God's word. It is simple in any one to attempt to resist the conclusion, and it would seem for any one to dispute the fact that the Bible contains God's word is simply to get clear of what it enjoins. Christ with his recorded word is the foundation on which his church is built, and any one coming into it must first determine whether it is of God or the work of man. That it is of God became evident to me in early life, and I have observed from that day to this that the simple child-like obedieut soul was always blest and prospered, while the reverse o( this always attended the self-willed and disobedient. It was so in the type and it is, and will be the same in the antitype. When the spirit through the Ministry feel a gift in any direction, intellect from no quarter should interfere to change it. When this takes place it drops from God to man. It is then intellect against intellect, the stronger carrying the day. In God's little army no person should ever select a position or propose a gift for himself or herself, this would be from the. intellect and no gift of God can originate in and come from the intellect; because intellect when it is not directed by the spirit is always selfish and God cannot bless any selfish thing. All that is partial or selfish is ungodly. Every gift of God is spiritual and comes from Him through the spirit. Should a gift from the head appear unreasonable ; in obedience we will be blest. It may be asked; suppose the Ministry should be moved by the intellect? The responsibility rests with them and they may suffer, but the obedient will be blest. This, in my own personal experience, has been thoroughly proven. Now, do not forget that this voice is from beyond the river ; for my soul is as thoroughly absorbed in the well being of all the camps of Israel as though body and spirit were already separated. We should not forget that Christ's kingdom is a pure Theocracv, a government of God, while Democracy is a government of man. The former is spiritual, the latter intellectual. The first belongs exclusively to the upper floor, the other to the lower, and every vote cast in the upper, is so much Democracy where it does not belong, making a hybrid, a mixture, that God cannot bless. There can be no votes cast in a pure Theocracy ; all within the fold are free to make their minds known to the order before them, then let the responsibility rest where it belongs and be content. A great many communities have tried the experiment of mixing and failed, and this will be the case of all who follow that course; all voting takes the power from God and gives it to man ; takes it from the head and gives it to the heels. Now can you pardon me for saying a word of my own earth life experience ? After becoming convinced that this was God's kingdom and work in my youth, I never afterwards questioned any gift felt best for me, nor hesitated to obey ; whether ordered to the rear or front, nor never laid out a gift for myself, aad no odds how dark it seemed to my intellectual understanding, I put my trust in God and gave my spirit, my intellect and faculties in child-like obedience to the call, and was always blest of God, far beyond my expectation, both spiritually and temporally, yea more than I could feel myself worthy of: thus realizing that it is the obedient that shall eat the good of the land, not the diso- bedient. I have never known any one to be either blest or prospered within the fold who refused obedience to God's appointed order, and so continued. As it was in the type so it is in the antitype. A small pebble slew Goliath who was defying the armies of Israel. King David's beloved son who turned against his father, lost his life hanging to the limb of a tree by the hair of his head, and so it was all through the type. Victory to the obedient and defeat, mortification and disgrace was the reward of the disobedient. Thus we see in all ages-of the world, that it is passion supported by intellect which has led astray. It cares for the body and not for the soul. When Christ says take no thought for the body, intellect says take first thought for the body ; when the spirit should absorb, if not the whole, the first attention, then the body will be God-directed and all things necessary will be added. 1 am now asked : which is it, spirit or intellect that enables you to speak and write as you do? Aus : Both, when self has no part in it, the spirit tells me what to say and write ; the intellect tells me how to word it, to make it plain to others. Every syllogism, all logic is intellectual, but good in its place ; thus we see that the offices of both are distinct all the way through life. We are inclined to forget that all prosperity depends on God'� blessing. Sometimeintellect will say, when adversity comes ; 'Take the world easy, don't be troubled, let it alone, if it is God's work He will take care of it, there's no use of worrying about it, and then hit down unconcernedly and wait for God to do their duty for them. Such are the ones that come in for the loaves and fishes, and bodily ease and '.omforts, and unless they become quickened into life by the spirit, will sooner or later fall away. It is not to be expected that God would prepare a place for such to come and waste their time away in luxury, idleness and ease, and feast on his bounties. He calls souls into his vineyard, where, in obedience to his order, they may 'put their hands to work and give their hearts to God ; receive their penny and save their suuls. Notwithstanding my agreement with Philosophy that the attribute of matter is extension, and that of spirit is thought, and that matter of itself cannot think ; it still seems evident that iutellect is a material faculty; were it spiritual it would not antagonize the spirit. One thing is certain, neither Philosophy nor Revelation has yet made known how we think. 1 unite with the philosopher who said: 'I adore the God by whom I think without knowing how I think.' But intellect is a pliant tool and seems to be as necessary to the sinner as the saint, to the robber and murderer as to the detective and hangman. Passion makes a demand for some gratification, the spirit objects, but intellect, reasons, excuses and tells how to obtain it, thus antagonizing and grieving the spirit and leading the soul away from God to unutterable ruin. It would seem that the brain has the faculty to think, as the ear has to hear or the eye to see. Passion desires the eye to see what it should not, the spirit objects, but intellect tells where and how the lust of the eye may be gratified, and so of all other lusts. Thus being uncontrolled by spirit and united with passion it has caused all the blunders of the world. Its reasoning caused the expul- sioa frotn the Garden of Eden; and Aarou to make the golden calf; and the Israelites to reject and cast away the Mosaic law and be scattered as shfiep without a Shepherd ; and King David to do as he did with the llittite ; and Judas to betray the Savior ; and Peter to deny him ; and the Jews to crucify him etc., etc. So let not God's Zion in this day be caught in the same suare, but all be ' Moved by the spirit of the Lord, And quickened by his holy word.' That God may hot only be in every act, but every thought of life, which will insure his perpetual blessing on his people. But many seem so careless and indifferent as not to be able to distinguish intellect from spirit; when we should ask ourselves aud each other in all things : Is this of the intellect or spirit, and correct ourselves accordingly. I will now say in closing that I feel myself somewhat as did the Apostle when he said; 'Though I preach the gospel I have nothing whereof to boast; for necessity is laid upon me. Yea woe unto me if I preach not the gospel;' of Christ, which alone can save the world.' 1 Cor. ix., 16. South Union, Ky.
