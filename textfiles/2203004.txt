Agreeably to the suggestion in the ''Home Notes'' of our Manifesto... Enfield, N. H., Dec. 1891. Agreeably to the suggestion in the 'Home Notes' of our Manifesto, I have taken down some of the testimonies given in our Sabbath Morning Service. Here is one given in our last meeting by Sister Isabella Russell that I deem too valuable to drop just where it was uttered, and am sending it to you with the idea that perhaps some extracts from it may be worthy a place in the Manifesto. Your Sister, Marinda Keniston.
