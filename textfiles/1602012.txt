ACTION. MARION PATRIC. Every way we turn wTe-see the necessity of action in the divine life. If a full granary would be had, we must make preparations to fill it; and if we would have the fullness of the heavenly garners we must labor for it, and we must do the share of work that falls to us to do. The emotions, and pleasures, arising from self-sacrifice give satisfaction to the active worker in the Lord's vineyard. The peaceful haven him' stretch itself out before us inviting in loveliness, but if we sit idly down waiting lor some favorable breeze to waft us thither, we may bj disappointed in our expectation. Our lime on this earthly shore is of short duration, and every action will meet its due reward, therefore to insure the legacy purchased by the humble worker whose every desire is to do the will of God in all things, the utmost concord of feeling and action must exist, for success, and victory will distinguish the active Christian.
