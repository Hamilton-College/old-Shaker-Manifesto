BEST USES OF MONEY This greed for riches sets every man in business against his fellow. It piles up riches with the few at the expense of the many. It assumes a thousand forms of benevolence. It assures much upon the receipt of little, beginning in deceit, and generally ending in fraud and disappointment. * * * Men, for popularity's sake, give their money to old church institutions that have no need of it, and receive curses instead of blessings as a reward. Men are asked to aid the Church, or to increase their annual pittance, and plead poverty, and hard times, and dull business, but enter into some wild scheme to add to their already large accumulations, and within a week, or a month, or a year, the fire, or the thief, or fraud, or business reverses takes away ten times the amount they were asked to contribute to the Church. There is a large truth in the above sentence of the N J. Messenger, and worthy of heed by many readers of The Shaker. A few years hence and time and money will be among the things of the past. The highest and best uses of money and talents will then appear the very reverse of what we fear, even some of the most economical trustees hold them to be now. The main body and heart of the people, called Shakers, are liberal, patriotic, anxious, and confident that truth will prevail. And the heart of the people beats in unison with God. May there be no selfish impediments in the way of spreading true Shaker principles, for they are ' the salt of the earth.' ^
