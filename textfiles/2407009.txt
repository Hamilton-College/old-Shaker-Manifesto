MY COMING. 'Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day, nor the hour, wherein the Son of man cometh.' Matt, xxv., 13. Enfield, N. H. O Zion awake to thy interest so holy As a thief in the night I may come unto you, And blessed are they who are waiting and watching For the will of my Father in heaven I do. In the day of my coming my people shall triumph, The strongholds of Satan I'll surely destroy, A beautiful morning already is dawning,Giving hope to the fainting,to the sorrowing joy.
