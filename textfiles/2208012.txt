In Memory of Sister SAMANTHA BOWIE. It was with feelings of deepest sorrow that we received the message of the decease of our dearly beloved Sister Sainantha; and with a profound sense of the loss to her friends, and to the Society of which she was such a devoted, efficient and useful member, that we extend our heartfelt sympathy, and offer this simple tribute of love to her memory. Sister Samantha was bound to us by the tenderest ties. We had known her from infancy. She was a dear companion of our childhood and youth, and the affection which grew with our growth, and strengthened with our strength, never lessened because we chose a different road to the one our dear sister pursued to the end of her journey. We recall with affection our early associations with the dear little girl, who, at the age of two years was brought by her father, a motherless orphan, to the Believers at Watervliet. Mary was her name, afterward changed to Samantha. Born in Scotland, of Scotch parents, she inherited many sterling traits of character; honesty, sincerity and faithfulness to duty, being conspicuous features. She was generous-hearted, and full of noble impulses. Kind to the aged, valiant for the weak, and 'always, always the children's friend.' Indeed, she was a friend to be trusted 'through thick and thin.' Sister Samantha gave her life to the cause in which she early enlisted, and leaves a treasure of love to all those with whom she was associated. Her loss is great, but her influence will live to bless, and strengthen those yet left to bear the burden. While our hearts are still sad we have this assurance to comfort usIt is well with our dear Sister. After much suffering she has peace, after weariness, rest, after weakness, strength. Realizing the happy change, truly may her freed spirit sing, ' There is no death. What seems so is transition. The life of mortal breath, Is but a suburb to the life elysian, AVhose portal, we call death.' Lucretia &amp; Annie.
