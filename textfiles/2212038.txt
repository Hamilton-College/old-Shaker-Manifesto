KIND WORDS. Beloved Elder Henry:--I send a little article... Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Oct., 1892. Beloved Elder Henry:I send a little article which you may be interested to peruse. The Manifesto comes laden with good cheer and consolation, which truly lifts the soul to higher joys, and helps one to set out afresh on life's journey with more zeal to live closer to the faith of the gospel of Christ. This is the prayer of your friend. Phebe Van Houten. Beloved Elder Henry:--We wish personally to thank you... Sonyea, N. Y. Nov. 1892. Beloved Elder Henry:We wish personally to thank you for the excellent appearance of our 'Manifesto,' and hope you may be sustained in your labors. The last number, when I opened it and read articles from our beloved Elder Abraham Perkins and Elder Oliver Hampton, I felt that I was in the presence of the 'redeemed from among men,' and was thankful to be counted worthy to sit at the feet of such purified souls and receive their ministration. Your Brother, H. DeGraw.
