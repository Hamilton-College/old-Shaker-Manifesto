Sabbathday Lake, Me. Is it possible that the sixth month of the year has passed and the seventh is taking its place? Surely time waiteth for no one and this reminds me that I must hasten to prepare a few notes for the Manifesto before I am too late for the coming number. To-day is Sunday and it seems good to return to quiet life after the busy battles of the week. The Bible questions are very interesting and some of them must require diligent searching to find correct answers. The answer to the last question is this, 'The 21st. verse of the 7th chapter of Ezra conall the letters of the alphabet reckoning i and j as one.' We have been having a feast of strawberries, at this date nearly thirteen bushels have been picked and more are ripe- ning. We found the Poland Spring Houses had secured all they needed from other sources so we could not sell ours there, but we found a ready market for part of them in other places. Have canned all we need for winter use, while our table has been bountifully supplied. Haying has commenced, which we regret to say requires hired help, bids fair for an average yield. Selections from the last Manifesto were read in our meeting and were enjoyed and appreciated by all. Thanks to our kind Editor who so carefully prepares for us this monthly feast. Our good Elder John Vance. is with us to-day so we are having an extra privilege. A. S. C.
