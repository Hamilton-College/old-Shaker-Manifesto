BIBLICAL. NO. 3. BY H. C. BLINN. A careful study of the history of the Bible, whether in reference to the Old or New Testament, becomes more and more interesting, as new light is obtained to aid us in a better understanding of the work. One writer says that the books of the New Testament were gathered from more than 500 MSS. more than a dozen ancient versions and from quotations in the writings of more than a hundred Christian fathers. In the introduction to the revised New Testament by J. H. Hall, L.L.D., we obtain *he following information. It is supposed that Matthew wrote his book of the gospel in Hebrew, as did Paul his epistle to the Hebrews. The other books of the New Testament were written in Greek. These early books were written on papyrus,�ancient paper. It was not very durable and for this reason, the originals of the New Testament books have all perished. The transcripts of the originals have also perished. In the 4th. century, vellum parchment was made from the skins of animals, which was a more durable material. The most ancient MS. known is from the middle of the 4th, centiyy, and those which are before the 10th. century are exceedingly few. Some 60,000 copies of the Npw Testament were in circulation at the close of the 2nd. century and the 1,600 MSS. of the New Testament or parts of it now in existence are copies of those in use at that time. One of the forms of writing at that date was in large capital letters, standing distinct from each other. These form the oldest MSS. of the New Testament, and are thought to be the most correct. The MSS. have no punctuation marks and the liability to error is very common. There are a large number of MSS. in this form dating from the 4th. to the 10th. centuries. These are more or less complete. One closes at the ninth chapter of Hebrews; another contains fragments of all the books of the New Testament, except second Thessalonians and second John. Another contains only the gospels and the book of Acts. The most important one contains all the books of the New Testament and is supposed to have been written in the 4th. century. Another class of these old books was writ' ten more like our ordinary hand writing1 These are supposed to have been written about the 10th century, and some attempt.was made at punctuation. The majority of these books are of but little value. A great many translations of the Bible have been made since the days of the apostles. The one now in use by the Protestants is called the King James Version. It was or. dered by King James the First of England in 1603 and was published in lb'll. It was to be a version of the Bishop's Bible and as little altered as the original would permit. �The. Douay O. T. version was made in 1609 and is used by the Roman Catholic Church. Prom Clark's Commentary, Vol. I. The different nations of the earth which have received the old and new Testaments, have not only had them carefully translated into their respective languages, but have also agreed in the propriety of illustrating them by comments. Ex. xii , 19. ' Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses.' To meet the letter of this precept in the fullest manner possible, the Jews, on the eve of this festival, institute the most rigorous search through every part of their houses not only removing all leavened bread, but sweeping every part clean, that no crumb of bread shall be left that had any leaven in it. So strict were they in the observance of the letter of this law, that if even a mouse was seen to run across the floor with a crurnb of bread in its mouth, they considered the whole house as polluted, and began their puriflca' tion afresh. Leaven was an emblem of sin' because it proceeded from corruption. Ex- xii., 30. ' And there was a great cry in Egypt. ' No people in the universe were more remarkable for their mournings than the Egyptians especially in matters of religion, they whipped, beat, tore themselves, and howled in all the excess of grief. When a relative died, the people left the house, ran into the streets and howled in the most lam. entable and frantic manner. Gen. ii., 10. Paradise. It would astonish an ordinary reader who would be obliged to consult different commentators on the situation of the terrestrial Paradise. Some place it in the third heaven, others in the fourth, some within the orbit of the moon, others in the moon itself, sotre in the middle regions of the air, or beyond the earth's attraction, some on the earth, others under the earth, and others within the earth. Some have fixed it at the north pole, others at the south pole, etc., etc. Joshua, vi., 4. 'Seven trumpets of rams' horns. ' The instruments used on this occasion were evidently of the same kind with those used on the Jubilee and were probably made of horn or silver, and the text should be translated; and seven priests shall bear before the ark the seven Jubilee trumpets. 2 Samuel, xxiiu, 20. 'Two lion-like men of Moab. ' Some think that two real lions are meant; some that they were two savage gigantic men; others that two fortresses are meant. 1 Kings, xii., 2. ' I will chastise you with scorpions.' The scorpion was a military engineer among the Romans for shooting arrows,which being poisoned,.were likened .to the scorpion's sting. Job, iv., 10. ' The roaring oi the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken. ' By the roaring lion, fierce lion, old lion, stout lion and lion's whelps, tyrannous rulers of all kinds are intended. The design of Eliphaz in using these figures is to show that even those who are possessed of the greatest authority and power, the kings, rulers and princes of the earth, when they become wicked and oppressive to their subjects, are cast down, broken to pieces and destroyed by the Lord.
