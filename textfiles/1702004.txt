PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING. R. A. SHEPARD. 'Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.' Psalm, cxiii. Is it not meet, that we give praise to the 'Giver of every good and perfect gift?' To whom, we owe everything, 'in whom we live, and move, and have our being?' Ah yea, it is meet, that we should do this. We were ' made a little lower than the angels ; ' having power to reason ; gifted with superior intelligence, above all created things on earth. Shall we silently pass on our way, receiving all these gracious gifts as though they were our right? 0 nay, shall we not rather give praise, and thanks, for the countless blessings bestowed upon us? Surely, praise and thanksgiving, shall go hand in hand Avith our petitions for still moreible.ssing. Our hearts are continually desiring protection, and care. But, ore we as ready to give thanks for the mercies daily received from the 'Great AllFather?' Will not the truly thankful heart, sometimes, overflow in praise, and give thanks to God? 'Bless the Lord, O, my soul,' for all His benefits ; yea, bless Him. Humbly bowing before the throne of grace ; grateful for the manifold mercies vouchsafed to us. Not only the blessings of every day, but also for the merciful preservation, from the wages of war, and pestilence, the fury of the elements ; the dreadful calamities which have filled the laud with death, sorrow and destruction. O may avc walk softly, humbly, before Thee, our God ; and bless Thy holy name, for all Thy loving-kindness, Canterbury, N. H,
