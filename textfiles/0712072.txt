My dear Children: I have a few good words to say to you... My dear Children : I have a few good words to say to you, in this, the last paper of the year 1877. When next we meet for counsel, it will be under vei-3' improved conditions. I want to suggest to each of you, the good idea of saving a copy of every number of The Shakee, keeping it nice, untorn, unsoiled in all its parts; and at the end of the year, binding, or having them bound for you, making you a very valuable book. I am aware you love the music; that you sometimes have cut the music out to put into other books; nor you alone—some ' children of larger growth'—men and women have done this—but there will be 110 inconvenience of form, hereafter to be contended with. I would have you, dear children, study the beautiful in all around you—the beautiful in language, form, behavior: and to be most agreeable to those you know or believe to be better than you are. Remember to love the good in every one; for by truly loving this good, we will surely grow and become like unto that which we love. Who say they love Jesus, a:;d do not grow more and more like him, are mistaken, in that they think they love him. —Editor.
