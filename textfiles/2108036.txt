PILGRIM FATHERS. Smoking tobacco was forbidden on the highway, or anywhere out of doors within a mile of a dwelling. A fine of ten shillings was imposed for lying, but one man in 1661 was fined twenty shillings. His lie was that he saw a whale when he did'nt, which was a whopper. Christian Standard.
