DUPLICITY ANNA ERVIN ]A distinguished divine inquires: 'Who is the prophet that shall uncover the abysses of our acted lies?' Were this ever true of those who profess to be Christians? When is the rugged, truthspeaking, Christian time coming? are queries of no trifling moment; when all shall be what they seem, and cease to seem what they are not. Have you ever socially trusted another from appearances implicitly, and afterwards been rejected for no good and sufficient reason? How liable are such lessons of experience to make us doubtful of human fidelity. A friend, in whose presence we may not think aloud, should be regarded as an acquaintance, but never trusted as a true friend. Let all earnestly strive to make this life as productive of good as it shall be when duplicity, dissembling and hypocrisy are only known as things thai were, and are not.
