I WON'T The other day a boy burst out a crying in school, and he cried as if his heart would break. Did another boy pinch or hurt him ? No. Was his spelling lesson too hard? No. What were those tears for? His teacher called him to her side, and asked Freddy what the matter was. ' I want to go home. Oh, do let me go,' sobbed Freddy. ' What for my dear child ?' asked the teacher in her own kind way. ' Oh,'! said Freddy, ' I said ' I won't' to my mother before school, and I want to go home and tell her how sorrow I am, and ask her to forgive me.' Then they were penitent tears, the best tears a child can shed. But then you must remember, 'Tis not enough to sari We're sorrow and repent, And still go on from day to day Just as we always went. Repentance is to leave The sins we loved before, And show that we in earnest grieve By doing so no more.
