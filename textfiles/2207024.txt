Sabbathday Lake, Me. June 13, 1892. The months seem to pass very quickly and there is no time to linger or 'put off' in regard to writing 'Home Notes.' Our good editor enjoins punctuality, which is a very necessary attainment. The Mount Lebanon Ministry and Eldress Dorothy Wright arrived at this place on the 20th. ult. They stayed with us four days and during that time administered a mountain of strength. The Oi'der was new excepting our dearly loved Eldress Harriet Bullard. There can be no failure in our Zion as long as it is strong enough to supply such leaders as Elder Joseph Holden. We found in Eldress Augusta Stone a spiritual mother well worthy of our love and confidence, and in Eldress Dorothy a pattern of purity and a spirit abounding in the lovely graces of the gospel. On the 21st. ult snow fell to the depth of five or six inches and remained on the ground most of the next day. Our house plants and seedlings were out and many of the largest were broken by the weight of the snow, but otherwise no harm was done. From the blossoming of our fruit trees we anticipate a bountiful harvest. The strawberry bed set out last spring is now in a perfection of bloom and we are sure of plenty of that delicious fruit later on. We have been somewhat troubled with measles; seven cases within the last two months, and bad colds are afflicting many of those who are measle proof. A. S. C.
