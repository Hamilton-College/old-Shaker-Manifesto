SOME LIVES BY EBEN E. REXFORD Some men there are that never find The beauty all about them. Blind To flower, and leaf, and stream, and sky, They live their narrow lives and die. Some men have ears too dull to hear The music of this lower sphere ; They never catch the harmonies Of wind and bird, of earth and seas. Some lives there are so hedged about With darkness of distrust and doubt, That they can never see their way Beyond the limit of to-day. Oh, happy is he who can see About his pathway constantly, To guide him in his wanderings, The beauty of earth's common things. Each flower he sees each sunset tint Is pregnant with mysterious hint, And all earth's lovely sights suggest The beauty on the hills of rest. Happy the man whose ears can catch The music of the world. The latch Of Heaven is raised for him, and he Hears echoes of its harmony. And happy lives are those which see By faith's clear vision what shall be, And say in dark and dolorous day, 'God knows ; I trust him, come what may.' N. Y. Weekly.
