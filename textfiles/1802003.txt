THE END OF THE WAY. Annie R. Stephens. I'm toiling through sunshine and shadow, And often through sorrow and gloom ; The thorns of my pathway are many, And few are the roses that bloom. But a hope lumeth ever before me, As bright as the sunshine of May, 'Tis the joyous thought of the triumph, When I get to the end of the way. Ofttimes on my pilgrimage journey, Life seems like a mountainous steep; I'm tired and weary with climbing, Cragged rocks are piercing my feet; But I look to the heavens above me, And work while it still is today; For such win the palm and the laurel When they get to the end of the way. I know not what crosses in future My shoulders will yet have to bear; I know if I take them all bravely, '1'is thus the bright crown I shall wear; I'll gird on faith's glittering helmet, For often I've heard a voice say, Our crosses piove sweetest of blessings, When we get to the end of the way. Oh, oft have I seen in my visions, A glimpse of the city of pearl! And Oh ! how I gazed all enraptured On the streets of jasper and beryl; And I saw many beautiful angels, Floating round in snowy array; I thought, shall I join the blest number When I get to the end of the way? I know if I'm true to my duty, And toil with an unfailing trust, Improving each heaven-sent blessing, Leaving not one talent to rust, Though now cloudy skies hang above me, And trials my progress may stay, Yet I know I've cherished some virtue, That will bloom at the end of the way. So I'm toiling through sunshine and shadow, And often through sorrow and gloorn ; But faith is my guardian angel, And hope doth my pathway illume. I feel that God's justice is certain, That He will my efforts repay ; I'll reap the reward of well-doing, When I get to the end of the way. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
