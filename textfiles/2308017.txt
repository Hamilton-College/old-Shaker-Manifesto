Ayer, Mass. July, 1893. Dear Elder Henry:�We are just at present having beautiful weather, and about all we hear is the click and sound of the mower and tedder. Busy hands and hearts are pushing the business, and every thing denotes a bountiful hay harvest. This gives joy to the farmer's heart. All this is telling how well the stock is going to be kept through the rigor of a hard winter. When we see that vegetation is giving promise of a bountiful harvest, then how dependent we are on a kind and merciful Father who gives his blessings to all who ask, or rather to those who work and wait. There is a joy that meets the farmer as he passes out upon his gardens and fields THE MANIFESTO. 193 and can see them flourishing by the hand of industry. Well may he sing, 'Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice.' Joyfulness is a characteristic element of Christian life, and is full of hope, courage? J�y an(i peace. Andrew Barrett.
