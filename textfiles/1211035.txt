AN OBEDIENT CHILD No object is more pleasing than a meek and obedient child. It reflects honor upon its parents for their wise management. It enjoys much ease and pleasure to the utmost limit of what it is fit. It promises excellence and-usefulness, to be, when age has matured the human understanding, a willing subject in all things to the government of God. No object, on the contrary, is more shocking than a child under no management. We pity orphans who have neither father nor mother to care for them. A child indulged is more to be pitied; it has no parents; it has its own master—peevish, forward, headstrong, blind, born to a double portion of trouble and sorrow above what fallen man is- heir to; not only miserable itself, but worthless, and a plague to all who in future will be connected with it. An honest boy.-—In a' country school a large class were standing to spell. In the lesson there was a very hard word. I put the word to the scholar at the head, and he missed it; I passed it to the next, and the next, and so on through the whole class, till it came to the hut scholar—the smallest of the class— and he spelled it right; at least, I understood him so, and he went to the head, above seventeen boys and girls, all older than himself. I then turned round and wrote the word on the blackboard, so that they might all see how it was spelled, and learn it better. But no sooner had I written it than the little boy at the head cried out, 'Oh, I didn't say it so, Miss W------; I said e instead of i' and he went back to the foot, of his own accord, quicker than he had gone to the head. Was not he an honest boy? I should always have thought he spelled it right if he had not told me; but he was too honest to take any credit that did not belong to him.
