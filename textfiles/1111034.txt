A Useful Plumb Rule .â€”Get a good piece of board, a little larger than may be desired, and strike a circle on its face at each end, taking care that they are both struck from the same centre. Plane straight on the edge until the sides of the circle are touched on each side. When this is done the piece of board will be of parallel breadth. Then a line drawn through the centre, with a slit for the cord and an opening for the play of the bob, will complete the plumb.
