PHYSICAL RESURRECTION We are loth to quote the familiar, but unpretty expression, ' the fools are not all dead yet I ' but so it seems; for we have lately received a neatly printed little book on the above ridiculous theme. The intent of the author is to reassure his readers that the same body that is put into the grave or cremation pot will, in God's own time and way, rise up in perfected form, because the Bible says so. The Bible tells of a great many things which happened once; as instanced in the speaking by Balaam's ass; and we have confidently believed that circumstance never would occur again ; but must now, and hence own being mistaken, when any individual attempts to force upon us the distasteful, idiotic subject of Physical Resurrection. ' Who ate Roger Sherman's body ? ' You often hear men of the world say of this or that professing Christian's acts, ' Well, if that is religion, I do not want it.' That is not religion, and no one knows it better than the faulty Christian ; but religion is the same, notwithstanding the imperfections of those who profess it.
