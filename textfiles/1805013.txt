JESUS WEPT. Annie R. Stephens. Jesus wept, oh potent words! that, like A gentle melody float down the corridors Of time, touching the responsive harp-chords Within, and, blending with the tenderest Sympathies of our hearts make divinest Harmonies. What thought consoling, that he, Our great Teacher in the school of Christ, Suffered and sorrowed as we; was touched with The feelings of all our infirmities. Not the command' Stand off I am holier Than thou,' draws men to seek the life divine, But the persuasive, attractive force of Love, which says,ï¿½' If I be lifted up I Will draw all men unto me;' yea love is The mighty lever that is to uplift Humanity to higher conditions ; Love is the penetrative power, that will Reveal the God-life within. The lightnings Flash, the thunders roar are grand exhibitions Of nature's power; but how unlike the sun; Its magnetic rays melt the avalanche And sends it coursing down the hill-side to Refresh the vales below; how it breaks the Icy chains of winter, and bids earth put On her beautiful garments and come forth In the glorious resurrection of spring. So the love of God, exemplified in That full-orbed soul, the lowly Nazarene, That could weep with those that sorrowed, comes to Us in the fullness of its Christ like power. With pitying tenderness it melts the Obdurate heart and bids it ' Go and sin No more;' with refulgent brightness it lights The dim pathway of life, to the dark abyss Of death, with the consolation of hope And immortality; and shines like a Flood of glory over the pearly gates Of Paradise. Jesus wept; oh words most Precious! How like a ray of light they pierce The sophistries of our minds, revealing The power of a great soul: how like a touch From angel fingers they impress us with The height, depth and breadth of infinite love. O Beautiful Spirit! let not earth dwarf Our souls from the exalted knowledge of Thy perfected glory; but come down to Us, descend upon us in the form of A dove; infill our souls with thy holy Unction, that we may be as ministering Angels; open the flood-gates of our hearts Till the measureless tide of sympathy Flows out to all, that we may weep with those That sorrow; let thy impress be the seal Of our discipleship; link us in that Great chain of universal fraternity; And bind us with thy golden clasp to our Infinite Father and Mother, God.
