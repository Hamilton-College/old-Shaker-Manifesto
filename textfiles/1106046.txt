Onions .— From our own experience and the observation of others, we can fully indorse the testimony of the St. Louis Miller of the healthful properties of the above esculent. Lung and liver complaints are certainly benefited, often cured, by a free consumption of onions, either cooked or •raw. Colds yield to them like magic. Don't be afraid of them. Taken at nighty all offense will be wanting by morning, and the good effects will amply, compensate for the trifling annoyance. Taken regularly, they greatly promote the health of the lungs and the digestive organs. An extract made by boiling down the juice of onions to a syrup, and taken as a medicine, answers the purpose very well; but fried, roasted or boiled onions are better. Onions are a very cheap medicine, within everybody's reach; and they are not by any means as ' bad to take ' as the costly nostrums a neglect of their use may necessitate.—Scientific American.
