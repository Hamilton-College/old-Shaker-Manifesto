SNOW-DROPS. [Contributed by Napoleon D. Brown.] Beneath the coverlet of snow, Two little flowers learn to grow,; Their cheeks are pale and white and fair, Their lips are sweet as summer air. At first they shiver in the cold, Then grow more fearless, calm and bold, To push aside the snowy sheet And lift their faces pure and sweet. One to the other gently speaks, As March winds blanch her tender cheeks: 'Dear Sister, it is cold to-day, But yet I think we here may stay: The earth is bleak, and dark and chill, All other flowers are sleeping still, But we'll remain awhile to sing In token of the coining spring.' The sister softly makes reply: 'We'll bloom together, you and I And send our choicest perfume out To gladden mortals round about; I'm sure they must be weary now Of winter's dismal icy brow, And longing for the breath of flowers, So we will stay and offer ours. And so the dainty blossoms braved The snow and sleet, and only craved A tiny place to fill with bloom, And scatter forth their rich perfume; And many hearts that yearned for spring, And all the beauties she would bring, Gave blessing to the little flowers, As heralds of her fragrant hours. ï¿½Selected.
