Fruits of different kinds... Fruits of different kinds have been used from time immemorial as a desert, but might be better used as a principal dish, and this would do away with many of the condiments. It would be slow progress to learn to relish apples or strawberries or peaches when well besprinkled with mustard or cayenne or showered with salt. I am a firm believer in personal idiosyncracies and individuality. Variety as well as diversity seems to be the order of creation, hence 'every one is a law unto himself' and must conform to his environments and climatic efforts as well as personal characteristics to obtain the most advantageous and best results.
