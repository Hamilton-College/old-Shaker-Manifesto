Shakers, N. Y. North. Family. Jan. 1896. The festive season of Christinas and New Years have come and gone and with their advent have been renewed the pledges formerly given on such occasions to be more faithful in life's duties and help advance upward the great struggling soul of humanity. We enjoyed on Christinas day with our gospel kindred of the Society a time of spiritual refreshing, many testimonies being given appropriate to the occasion. Meeting was held at the Church at 10 o'clock a. m. Also on New Year's evening by invitation of the Elders of the North family, Society meeting was held at the North, the first one since we came here. It was some two hours long. Opening hymn, 'Season of Devotion.' It was with great pleasure that we held communion through the Jan. Manifesto with our beloved spiritual Father Elder Abraham Perkins; and it is joy to sit at the feet of such veterans and receive their ministrations. Brother Arthur Bruce of East Canterbury gave us a call for a day or two last month, and if we could have a few more calls from gospel friends at Canterbury and elsewhere how the smiles would illuminate our countenance and with what joy we would labor to minister to their comfort. Anticipation is a beneficial stimulant if the brightest and best in life is looked for; in the coming year we will labor to have this form of it the sun which will illuminate our pathway.
