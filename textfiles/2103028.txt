OBITUARY. At Mount Lebanon, N. I, Jan. 22, 1891, RUFUS CROSMAN, aged 92 years. Rufus Crosmax was one of a family 'to be wondered at.' The father and mother were Vermont farmers, in good circumstances, and having six children; and all became Shakers, in 1825. One sister, Betsy, is still living, aged 86. Though they were not a literary family, they were strictly honest; and, as 'an honest man or woman is the noblest work of God,' the Crosmans, in this sense, were a noble family. They were consecrated, loyal members of the Shaker Order. As one of many who inherit their life-long labors, in land, houses, and conveniences of various kinds, I am their debtor. When the family united, they paid their debts, righted their wrongs, confesed their personal sins, in the light they had received, and became Christians according to the pattern shown on the mount of transfiguration�Mount Lebanon. Their industry was proverbial; their economy�'gathering up the fragments, that nothing be lost'� I have never seen exceeded. In simplicity of manners, and in dress and address, they were examples to the whole Shaker Order. It was such a manner of people that laid the foundation, in temporal things, of all the Shaker Villages : and a similar class of men and women were the granite f oun- dations of Albany, Pittsfield, and many New England towns and cities. Some of them yet remain, and all citizens are blessed by inheriting the fruit of their labors, and being influenced by them as ministering spirits : thus, being dead, they yet speak to the living, by word as well as work. 'Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace.' In his last days, Rufushad no disease or sickness, and was quiet as a child. When he was about to fall asleep, his attendant heard him whisper, 'Now, Lord, lettestthou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.' F. W. Evans.
