In Memory of our Loved Sister, NANCY DOW. By Elizabeth Sears. A loved one has left us and past through the portals That lead to an endless fruition of joy. Perfected through suffering she joins the immortals The purified number in heavenly employ Through scenes of adversity, conflict and trial Our Sister has past with an unshaken trust Through noble endeavors and true self-denial Secured the reward of the upright and just. In life's early morn when temptations surrounded She chose the straight path which our Savior e'er trod, With faith in his teachings her spirit abounded Devoting her all to the service of God. While many turned backward in search of vain pleasure Companions and friends who were dearer than life Our Sister chose rather the heavenly treasure Contentment and freedom from turmoil and strife. Her talents and strength with unswerving devotion Were most freely given, Zion's cause to sustain She made no reserve but with full consecration Gave all she possest for its honor and gain. In acts of benevolence freely she tendered That love which pervadeth her spirit each day. To the stranger and friendless sweet services rendered To aid and encourage them in this pure way. How deep was her interest and strong her endeavor To lighten the burdens of each weary one. With kindness and love for each sister and brother She faithfully toiled till each duty was done. Dear sister and friend, may thy shining example Be ever a light to illumine our way. And while here we journey through sunshine and shadow Permit us to share in thy blessings, we pray.
