THE TOAD. The toad is a very useful little animal. It is called the gardener's friend. We ought never to kill a toad for it catches the bugs and insects which destroy the plants. At night after he has got all he wants to eat, he digs a little hole and gets into it and stays there till morning and then comes out and gets something to eat. We had shingles put beside the hills of squashes so we could kill the the squajh bugs ; they get under the shingles over night. I had to go around every morning and take a stick and kill the bugs. Once I was going to kill the squash bugs I saw a little toad under a shingle, he had dug a little hole and got in it. I let him stay there. Another time when some of the boys and myself were weeding peas we caught a toad, we picked it up and it made three little noises which sounded as if he said, 'let me go,' and we let him go.
