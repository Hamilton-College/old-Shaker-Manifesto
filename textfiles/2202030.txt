Editor Manifesto:--The memory of some friends I have... St. Louis, Mo., Jan. 3, 1892. Editor Manifesto :The memory of some friends I have' among the Shakers is unspeakably precious to me. George Eliot says, 'It is easy to say how we love new friends, and what we think of them, but words can never trace out all the fibres that knit us to the old.' It might be better to reflect while we are with true friends that nothing in the wide world can fill their place when we have gone out from among them. I have treasured up some wonderful blessings laid upon me by saints wTho are now gone, and I bear in mind pure teachings of some who are still on this side. Among Shakers one finds friends for all experiences. Some there be who lift one into the realms of spirituality far above the petty trials of life, with whom one forgets to worry over dish-washing and dinner getting. There are those who supply cheerfulness on washdays, and others who bring one to repentance of irritability and rebuke only by their even, gentle lives. There is quaint wisdom, valuable information, wide experience and pure Christianity to be found in the hearts of those who have faithfully lived out their belief, as Shakers. Nothing this world has ever given me has been so satisfactory as the associations of the Shaker Village. The plain, practical living, the atmosphere of sincerity, the sturdy faith and endurance of those who believed what they lived, has been a tower of strength to me and on which I have leaned many times when buffeted by the world. I revere Shaker doctrines ; I love the Shakers. L. D. W.
