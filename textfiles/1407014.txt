CHOOSE GOODNESS. MARY WHITCHER. To be good is to be happy, ' Is a simple, sacred truth.� And the goodness adds the beauty To the mind and face of youth. Tis the source of purest pleasure, And the depth of brightest joy; 'Tis the filling of uiir measure With the peace naught can destroy. 'Tis the portion of our Father .In the talent to each one, And the nucleus to gather Greater goodness for our own. All the beauty of the spirit Is from goodness of the heart, Who would not the gem inherit? Who with such would ever part? Deep the fathoms of rebellion, Dark the clouds that fill the mind,� Dull the beauty of the heavens When the soul is not refined. Hasten on, ye angel seekers, Who would be their guests on high, All is given by the labors Which for goodness you apply. Canterbury, N. H.
