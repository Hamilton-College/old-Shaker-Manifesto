A Tribute of Love for Sister MARCIA E. ASTINGS By Ednah E. Fitts. The Harvester indeed claims a rich spoil to-day. A golden sheaf, every stalk of which is laden with kernels well filled and ready to be garnered into the treasury of that kingdom forever increasing. Neither blight, nor rust mars the perfectness of the ripened grain, which has brought forth its increase, not of the thirty, nor yet of the sixty fold, but having drawn its sustenance from the true vinev has yielded a hundred fold to the glory of God. The annals of time may not aid us in estimating the true worth of our departed sister, whom we have likened to a sheaf of gold, but the records of heaven bear witness to many needy ones who have been nourished and sustained through the ever ready giving of this richly matured mind. We are sure that her welcome summons to the 'Better Land,' will be: 'Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'ï¿½Matt, xxv., 23. Canterbury, N. H.
