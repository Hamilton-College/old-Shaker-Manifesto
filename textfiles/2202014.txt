Fifty years in the past, one of our Brethren published this statement: 'It will be generally granted that the history of the world does not furnish a single instance of any other religious order which has stood fifty years without a visible declension of its principles in the general purity and integrity of its members.' After the passing of another fifty years, the same statement may be advanced with a corresponding assurance of the truthfulness of the remark. The moral character of the Society is established and its progressive movement toward higher spiritual attainments must be through the blessing and protection of an over-ruling Providence. The general prosperity which has attended the united efforts of the Community, as a whole, has been sufficient to provide all the blessings of an earthly home, and to contribute largely to the comfort of many not of our order. As the temporal and spiritual interests of a Community must receive corresponding attention to insure its success, it devolves upon every member to consecrate his life to the cause that all gifts may be utilized for the peace, prosperity and happiness of the whole household. *
