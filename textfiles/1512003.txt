THE SHAKERS AT HOME. Contributed by Eldress Harriet Goodwin. Eveb since the visit of the Shakers to our city last May we have had a desire to see them in one of their own settlements, and on Saturday last, in acceptance of a standing invitation, we made a flying visit to Shaker Village, Alfred, Me. Elder Vance awaited our arrival at the depot and took us in a carriage to the village�some two miles distant. The ride was a pleasant one, with its varied hill-country aspects�and we noticed that the apple orchards iu this region promised a fair yield. The land owned by this community embraces about twelve hundred acres, and is mostly situated on very elevated ground, called Shaker Hill. Its southern ascent (our way of approach) is very steep, while its northern slope stretches gradually away by the road for about half a mile�at the end of which is a saw mill, owned by the community. Embosomed in a happy valley and folding its loving embrace around the western base of the hill nestles Shaker Pond, a beautiful sheet of water some half a mile Avide by a mile or more in length. Upon seeing it,� whether reposing with unruffled mirror face, or swept now and then by mountain airs which, '�playing a wizard rout,' swoop down to brush its fair surface,�one is led to exclaim ' How beautiful the water is ! To me 'tis wondrous fair. ' Upon the top of the hill is situated the village, consisting of about twentyfour buildings, and composed of two families one of which contains about sixty persons and the other fifteen. The smaller family, with its cluster of houses, lies a little apart from the other. Fine views of the surrounding country are obtained here. Grand old hills loom up in the distance, across the valley into which flows the stream which carries the mill. The houses of the village generally have the appearance of old-fashioned farm houses, and most of them are above eighty years old, but have been repaired and kept in good order. There being a line of houses on the street and another straight row in the rear, extensive green lawns stretch out between, intersected by foot-paths. 'A flue place for croquet,'* we remarked, but did not observe any signs of the game. ' Yea,' said the Elder, u a very innocent game, well adapted to those of sedentary habits ; but our people gener- ally find something more useful to employ their time.' Upon our arrival at the village, we alighted at a good-sized house, having something of the appearance of a neat country inn. Over the door were the words, iu conspicuous letters, 'Trustee's Office.' Here business was transacted and visitors received. We were at once shown the room in which Ave were to make ourselves at home during our stay. It was large, light and airy, and contained two attractive beds. They were high and narrow (compared with the family beds with which we have been acquainted,) designed to be occupied by only one person at a time, but very inviting indeed to the tired wayfarer of the world. That night, for the first time in our life, we slept iu a Shaker bed. ' And, to sleep, you should slumber In just such a bed. ' 'Shaker neatness' is a proverbial expression, and it was well exemplified not only in this apartment but all others which we visited. Our meals consisted of an excellent, wholesome bill of fare, uncxceptionally, and were served with fastidious care and neatness in a little dining-room, where alone and unobserved, we took our own time to satisfy the tangible, outer man�the world's people not being admitted to the table with the Shakers. The largest building in the village is the dwelling-house, a large three-story structure perhaps a hundred feet long, broadside to the street and having two front doors, wide apart. It is surmounted by an open belfry and a large bell which calls the people up in the morning and to their meals. The people all eat and sleep iu this house, with a few unavoidable exceptions. The prayer or conference meetings are also held here, and are not open to strangers. In rear of the dwelli::g-house is quite a large building called the infirmary, where the aged and sick reside, with attendants to take care of them. Another building is used as a laundry, where the washing for the whole family is done with conveniences not to be excelled in any city. The water is supplied, by simply turning a faucet, from a spring higher up on the hill, and instead of employing the slow process of wringing by patent hand-wringers, whole tubs full of clothes are put into a press similar iu shape to some cider presses wehave seen, and the water very quicklyexpelled. The waste water is poured into a receptacle through the floor, from which it runs away. Truly, this 13 the washer-woman's paradise. One building is used for a store-house, one for a paint shop and carpenter's shop, and another as a lounging place for superannuated old men�the fathers of the order. We conversed with one nearly eighty-two years of age. He had lived here �' on the hill, ' he said, sixty-seven years, having joined when fourteen and a half years old. He would not exchange his lot with any rich man he knew�the victory which he had gained over self seeming to be the chief reason for rejoicing. One of the main houses on the street occupied by the pistcrs as a workshop�the younger portion of the Shakeresscshaving a large department by themselves, where they engage in the manufacture of useful and fancy articles, while the eldresses and older women engage in a room by themselves in labors appropriate to their years. Here is also a room where the Elder officiates as a tailor, and cuts the garments for th? men. There are separate barns for cows, oxen and horses. They are all ample, with ground mows, and arranged with a driveway to the second story, so as to allow of pitching the hay down instead of up. AYe entered one, built in 1833, which was probably as good a barn as Avas to be found in New England of its day. It is one hundred and forty-four feet long by forty-five wide. They were all well stocked with hay, it having been so good a year for the crop that some, of inferior quality, was left unharvested. There are other buildings on the premises, including a blacksmith shop. On Sunday forenoon we attended public service. The day was pleasant, and forty carriages brought people to the Shaker meeting, some coming a dozen miles or more. Directly opposite the dwelling-house is the church edifice, an old-fashioned gambrel-roofed building, broadside to the street, with two doors corresponding to and facing those of the dwelling. Flagstones are laid from the sisters' end of the house across the street. 'When the hour for commencing services arrived, the doors of the dwelling opened and the Shakers and Shakeresses passed out simultaneously, two by two, with slow and solemn step, making two parallel lines across the street to the meeting-house. The Shakers were uncovered, and with long hair on the back of the head, but cropped short in front, made a unique appearance. The dresses of the Shakeresses were almost white ; the skirts were not superfluously ample, were neatly plaited at the waist, and stopped short of the around. Some of them had white handkerchiefs, unshaken from the ironing folds, pinned squarely at the waist. All (except the little children) wore white capes, and white gauze caps neatly plaited around the back of the head. They formed in rows, in the church, four and five abreast, the Bible was read by the Elder, when they marched and countermarched, singing songs and waving their hands, palms up, and as they thus k' praised God in the dance, ' singing, �' Let us clasp the hands of the angels. ' we imagined that if they had such 'unseen company ' and we were clairvoyantly endowed, it would be difficult to tell which were the angels and which the Shakeresses. The following is one of their songs :� ' The voice of God is calling us : Come away, away from worldly strife; All ye who name the name of Christ. Come up and live a higher life. O live to God and die to sin, That ye with Christ may enter in, For only the faithful few shall win And wear a robe of righteousness. No prayer was offered. It is very seldom, we were told, even in their private meetings, that a Shaker prays audibly. They do not believe in making long prayers to be heard of men, but follow the direction of Jesus, ''when thou prayest, enter into thy closet. ' After singing a few songs, the Elder. J. B. Vance�preached a very able discourse on the confession of sins, taking for his text the first epistle of John, first chapter, ninth verse:�' If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' The speaker said it was well understood by the Jews as to whom the confession of sins was to be made, and what it consisted of. Instead of goals' awav in secret and talking them over to Him who knew all about them, or getting up in public meeting and confessing that they were sinners in a general way, the demand was that the very act committed should be confessed ('in that thing') to a man of God appointed to hear, with a repentance which led to the forsaking of their sinful deeds and making reparation, as far as possible, to those who had been injured. Other passages, both from the Old and New Testaments, were quoted in support of this view. It might be objected, to observe this rite of confession was too much like the Catholic Church. That the Catholic Church was the immediate successor �f the early, true church could not be doubted; but it had suffered many abuses to creep into it. The mistake of Luther was in abandoning all its rites instead of correcting their abuses. The confession of sins, rightly conducted, was regarded by the speaker as perhaps the most important means of assuring an upright life. At the conclusion of the sermon, the settees were put aside, some of the Shakers gathered in a group in the center and sung, while others marched around them, singing and waving their hands. At the close of the services the audience was requested to remain seated, until the Shakers had passed out, and thus ended the only public service of the day. It was the calm still morning of Monday last that we rode down Shaker Hill to take the early train for Lynn. Inanimate nature wore its best smile, and upon the placid bosom of Shaker Pond floated a loon in conscious safety. Our good impressions of this people were well sustained, in seeing them at their home, and we came away feeling that we had been greatly benefited, spiritually, by this short visit among them.
