The Medical Record, an English Journal... The Medical Record, an English Journal, thus comments on the injurious effects of anger. Anger serves the unhappy mortal who indulges in it, much the same as intoxicants constantly taken do the inebriate. It grows into a sort of disease which has various and terrible results. Sir Richard Quain said, not long ago: 'He is a man very rich indeed in physical power, who can afford to get angry.' This is true. Every time a man becomes 'white' or 'red' with anger he is in danger of his life. The heart and brain are the organs mostly affected when fits of passion are indulged in. Not only does anger cause partial paralysis of the small blood vessels, but the heart's action becomes intermittent, that is, every now and then it drops a beatmuch the same thing as is experienced by excessive smokers.
