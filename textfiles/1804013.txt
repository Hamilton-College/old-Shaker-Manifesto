Correspondence. Beloved Elder Henry:--The Jan. Manifesto came in good season... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Jan. 1888. Beloved Elder Henry :�The Jan. No. of THE MANIFESTO came in good seasou, and with excelleut music. The testimonies of Mother Anu Lee and the Elders are always very interesting. I wish we could have them continued, and more of them. An account of the spiritual, and more private labors and meetings, if such could be had, I think would be very instructive. It has been recorded that some of the religious services of the first Believers could be heard for a distance of three miles. I should very much like the particulars of some of those meetings. We all know that principles never change. 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit, and these are contrary the one to the other.' Will there ever be any process by which flesh can be converted to spirit ? Will the lusts of the flesh and of the mind ever be destroyed in soul and body by any other way, than by self-denial and the cross of Christ and hating and warring them in battles of shaking? So long as the world, the flesh and the devil are in any human soul, shall we not ueed a baptism of the Spirit to overcome them? If the spirit enters the soul, 'where the elements of the world are, will there be auything but war, till one or the other triumphs? 'Think not that 1 came to bring peace' to the earth in your soul; ' I tell you nay, but a sword. ' 'If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother and wife and children, and brethren and sisters, yea, and his'own life also, he cannot be my disciple.' Is not hatred and war admissible in the kingdom of heaven ? Is it not the baptism of the holy Spirit, the fire from heaven, the indignation and wrath of God and the hate of Christ, ths means, and the only means whereby the soul is prepared for the divine element, love ? 'By their fruits ye shall kuow them.' Has not every Society of Believers had more or less experience with souls, that were perfect in their own eyes and filled with love�lust? They would soon want to minister to Believers, a perfection in generation, and teach them to bring forth a holy perfected offspring. Can there be a greater abomination in the house of God than this ? Could a greater man of sin be found to sit-in the temple oi God? I hope that we shall never be ashamed of our glorious name, nor of the power of God and baptism of the holy Spirit that gives to us a just claim to the name. May The Manifesto be heard many miles and among all people, with its clear sounding testimonies, that make a separation between the children of this world and 'the children of the resurrection.' In kindest love, Daniel Offord.
