JORDAN. ' Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give yourest.'Matt., xi., 28. Canterbury, N. H. What saith the Spirit to the poor and oppressed? 'Come unto me and I will give you rest. Are ye heavy laden, have ye fallen by the way? Jordan hath the power of healing. Brave ye the billows now and again, Healing from blindness, from sorrow and pain, O be persuaded the waters to try, God in his mercy is dealing.'
