Correspondence Editor Manifesto.— I received the letter forwarded by you from H. L. E.... Ayer, Mass., Aug. 1, 1880 Editor Manifesto.— I received the letter forwarded by you from H. L. E. I very much regret when I tax the piety of any one over much. I do not, however, think that he and I differ very much after all. Perhaps 1 had better define my idea of ' Infidel more clearly' : I do not care what people believe or doubt, if they conduct themselves well in this world ; obeying all the moral and physical laws of nature, and adhering to the Golden Rule. Such are prepared for the next place of existence ; and will feel at home when they get there, just as much as if they always had been prating about heaven and futurity to the neglect of earth life's duties. 'The salt of the earth,' are such as save humanity from degradation and physical sins, either by precept or example, or by both — whoever exercises the power to save, are saviours — why not ? Is it any robbery of Jesus or his disciples, to declare others to be ' the salt of the earth?' If I give one man ten dollars, and another one dollar, does it necessarily follow that I have robbed the first? Did Jesus secure letters patent on the means of salvation ? To the contrary He rebuked His disciples for their arrogance, when they told Him that they ' forbade them to cast out devils in his name ! ' If, as our mutual [friend, H. L. E. would imply, that the Shakers alone are ' the salt of the earth,' then I must still insist that the earth is none too well salted. In my opinion, the saviors on the moral and physical planes are clearly entitled to the appellation of 'salt.'' In conclusion, I really wish I could know, how some of the stern advocates for Jesus would agree with him as a traveling companion or a room-mate ! I am, Your Brother, E. Myrick
