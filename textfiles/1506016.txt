GOD'S WORK Gathering brands from the burning Plucking them out of the fire, Lifting the sheep that have wandered Out of the dust and the mire ; Bringing home sheaves from the harvest To lay at the Master's feet- - Lord, all thy hosts of angels Must smile on a life so sweet. Speaking with fear of no man, Speaking with love for all, Warning the young and thoughtless From the wild beast, ' Alcohol; ' Showing the snares that the tempter Weaveth on every hand- - Lord, all thy dear, dear angels Must smile on a life so grand. Fighting the bloodless battle With a heart that is true and bold, Fighting it not for glory, Fighting it not for gold. But out of love for his neighbor, And out of love for his Lord; I know that the hands of the angels Will crown him with his reward. Selected
