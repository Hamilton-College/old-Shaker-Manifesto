FOLLOW ME By Elsie B. York. T I THOUGH centuries have passed since our Savior uttered these words in _1_ person to a few men in humble circumstances, who immediately responded to his call, they are heard no less effectually to-day. Although we have not Jesus of Nazareth in our midst, his words and works remain with ns. Many hear the call, not from a personal Savior, present with us, but in the still small voice pleading with us that we may follow in the path that will lead to Christ's kingdom. The question would naturally arise in the mind,follow where, how and for what purpose? If Jesus Christ was the Resurrection and the Life, as he asserted that he was, in following his example we may gain admittance into the kingdom of heaven. Shortly before his death he said to his disciples, 'I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am there ye may be also.' We infer from this, that even In the Spirit world he was called to lead the way for others to follow. Having commenced a new order of life in this world, in a future state there must also be a new place prepared for such as follow his life and example. Jesus tells us that 'The kingdom of God is within you,' yet we believe there is a place reserved for those who 'love him and keep his commandments.' 'Order is heaven's first law.' Admitting this, it seems reasonable to believe that in the heavens, as on the earth, we shall each find our home, in future life as we have prepared it by present faithfulness. East Canterbury, N. H.
