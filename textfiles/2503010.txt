TRUE KNOWLEDGE. By Isabel McLeod. A little knowledge dangerous proves It fills the soul with pride, The mind goes upward soaring And thinks there's naught beside. But with a true desire We long for some brave soul To guide our wayward spirit Unto some purer goal. Unto a fount whose waters Will cleanse from pride and woe That we may find true knowledge And meet no adverse foe. No foe of evil promptings Of jealousy and strife, But ever looking upward Attain the purer life. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
