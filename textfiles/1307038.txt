'RIGHTEOUSNESS.' 'What we need is to write the word 'righteousness' on the play-grounds where the children go to school; write it over every open door through which young men enter upon their lifework; write it on every carriage in which men ride to business, and women to their shopping; write it on the walls of ev,ery bank, counting-room and public building; write it over every entrance of church, that every man may see it when making a public confession of his faith in Christ; write it so plainly that he that would make haste to be rich and great, may learn that there is but one road to real success in this world, and this is the road of strict integrity. God has not given a promise of His favor in this or any other world to any but the righteous man. The man who lives righteously is the only man that need apply for admission to the heavenly kingdom. 'Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.' ' â€” S. W. Presbyterian
