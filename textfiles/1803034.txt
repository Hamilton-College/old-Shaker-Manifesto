EXTRACTS FROM J. TIFFANY'S LECTURES. [Contributed by C. J. Preter.] The difference between the religious formalist and the spiritual humanitarian is seen in this. The humanitarian works out his own and his fellow's salvation, by seeking to develop the elements of love, wisdom, and power in the soul; by practicing every moral, and social virtue; by obeying every truth; by feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, educating the ignorant, assisting the distressed, and redeeming the fallen; by attacking and denouncing every vice, public or private; by decrying war and oppression, fleshly lusts, and intemperance in every form, by bearing a strong testimony against all the idols of man, tobacco and intoxicating stimulants, as well as against all gluttony in eating. He will not expend thousands of dollars in building a church, while the poor within the shadow of its very walls are from want or cold neglect perishing, or are driven to commit the darkest crimes to obtain that which should have been given as a Christian charity, with a Christian's blessing. While the formalist expects to obtain his salvation on credit, and thinks the world is to be redeemed from its selfishness by believing in certain mysterious and absurd -creeds ; by onserving certain external forms and ceremonies ; by idling away portions of time, in keeping feast days and fast days, new moons, and Sabbaths. Take away the formal part of the religion of the modern Pharisee, and there is nothing left. Is it possible that any one can be so blind, as not to perceive the corruption and falling away from the precepts and practical life of Jesus, and the example of the primitive church? Therefore it is plain and evsident, that all sects and denominations in the world, who do not live up to this original Pattern are false and counterfeit. Remarks. All true Shakers do live it and practice it.
