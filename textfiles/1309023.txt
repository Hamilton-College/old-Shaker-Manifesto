Sketches of Shakers and Shakerism, is the title of a very nicely gotten up little pamphlet, that has recently been published by Elder Giles B. Avery. A general circulation of such a work must be the means of doing immense good, as it contains so much of that very form of information, that is essentially needed by those who would become well informed in regard to the Theology, History, General Management, Consecration of Property, etc. The Illustrations of the several societies are an especial feature of interest in the work and are a source of information that will be appreciated. Every Society would do well to secure a few hundred copies and give them a liberal distribution. They cost only $5 per hundred.
