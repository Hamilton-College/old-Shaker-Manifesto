A PLEA FOR PURITY OF LANGUAGE. Man communicates his thoughts and desires to his fellow-men through the medium of language. Conceptions and wishes, in order to be of any practical use to any person, foreign to self, or to be wrested from oblivion, must be clothed in words. These terms, or words, then, simply represent thoughts or ideas, which have been formulated by the activities of the mind. That the expression of the product of thinking be clear, it is highly essential for the thinker to be able to employ terms, which convey his true and full meaning. If lie wants his desires to THE MANIFESTO. 99 be satisfactorily met, they must be thoroughly understood. This, of course necessitates a complete and accurate knowledge of the principles of the language, which he adopts as a means of communication. If the diction of an author is imperfect or ambiguous, his meaning is liable to be misinterpreted and he becomes a victim of severe criticism. All intelligent and cultured persons unhesitatingly condemn erroneous statements and incorrect phrases, when they occur in the field of standard literature, but there seems to be more latitude and liberty granted in the sphere of ordinary conversation and daily intercourse. Why such is the case, it is rather difficult to explain, unless on the unwarranted ground, that a thing which is commonplace, needs not be conformable to the laws of truth or restricted to an honest and faithful representation. Familiarity, however, should not breed contempt. Certainly a blessing or benefit, which is unremittingly conferred, should not lose any virtue or efficacy through its frequency. The sun suffers no contamination from its daily shining, nor does stellar beauty fall into corruption from its frequent glorious nocturnal decoration of the heavens. Neither should language be . allowed to be corrupted, on account of its constant use; but its purity and proper simplicity should be preserved at all times. It is impossible, perhaps, for the uncultured and illiterate to conform to the accepted laws of the language, as laid down in the text-books on grammar and rhetoric, when they wish to communicate their thoughts and desires to their fellow-men. Custom and habit are the only rules observed in making their assertions, and these serve as guides in their choice of words and expressions. The plea for purity and correctness in speech or writing, addresses itself, most particularly, to the learned, and those who are striving to reach the state of culture. The student, pursuing a higher course of learning, is confronted by its urgent claims, and he must, in one way or another, meet the demands, whether it be considerately and intelligently, or remissly and indifferently. He should be very careful in, the selection of terms in which to express properly his individual ideas and views. Here comes in a just demand for the exei'cise of guarding himself well against improper uses of certain phrases and words, which are found in ordinary conversation. Were less regard paid to customary and common expressions, and more originality and self-assertion manifested, there would be fewer erroneous statements. The great abuse and corruption, which the English language suffers at the hands of scholars and intelligent people in general, are due, not so much to ignorance or lack of knowledge as to thoughtlessness and hasty utterances. They are familiar with the principles governing the appropriate use of words and sentences, but fail in the application of them to their own peculiar needs. Unauthorized expressions and obsolete terms, as they fall from the lips of one who presumes to be learned, are very objectionable and repulsive to the sense of refined taste. Nothing perhaps detracts more from the efficacy and persuasive power of a public speaker, than a frequent or persistent abuse of certain rhetorical or grammatical principles. When he fails to clothe his thoughts in pure and fitting terms, his arguments fall far short of their desired acceptance and conviction. The cultivated ear calls for euphony and the harmonious arrangement of words into sentences, and whenever evident and conspicuous perversions of the language occur, it meets with an unpardonable offense. From such inaccuracies and errors, intelligence shrinks back with disgust and stamps the offender as unlettered and unpolished. It must be admitted that a strict conformity to the laws of the language can not invariably be observed. No one ever passes beyond the state where he is liable to make mistakes, even though he exercises the greatest caution and thoughtfulness. It is not, however, the occasional misuse of words and terms that is so ve- 100 THE MANIFESTO. hemently attacked in this article, but their frequent and persistent abuse and corruption. Such as are guilty of this practice have no just apology to offer, but must be considered and branded as ignoring the purity, simplicity and beauty of their native tongue. ï¿½Mercersburg College Monthly.
