GOD. OLIVER C. HAMPTON. The Bible has this remarkable apostrophe which is put into the mouth of one of Job's interlocutors. '' Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou knoAv the Almighty to perfection? It is high as Heaven what canst thou know deeper than Hell what canst thou do?' Still we have some ideas of God, though we must con i'ess that probably no two persons have precisely the same views. We would not dwell very long on this difficult question as our knowledge seems limited. But we will write some ol our impressions concerning the subject. Pope in describing the finite objects and ideas he could see and think of around him and in the Universe generally, makes this remarkable observation, viz : ' All are but parts of one stupendous whole, Whose body Natui e is, and God the Mill.' We seem to detect in every one of the phenomena of Nature, signs of intelligence, benevolence, justice and eternal equilibrium by which the forees of Nature are balanced and antagonisms.. or what would otherwise be such, constantly restrained within such bounds are suggested by the twin principles of Love and Wisdom. These principles are the moving forces of the Universe the primary essence of our Father and Mother God. These are intelligent, spiritual, sympathetic, emotional. These are male and female. In a word these are God. But we do not know whether there is or is not a personal identity of these primary forces, distinct from the Universe of visible manifestations which they seem to control. Indeed in which they seem to live and move and have their being,ï¿½we do not care. However, our most satisfactory view is, that there seems to be an unending category of individualized Intelligences extending endlessly and infinitely higher and lower, and all located along a line of everlasting evolution and progress to higher and higher conditions of perfection toward which they will forever and ever approach, but never reach. We do not know and cannot conceive of any end of this that would be satisfactory to the reaching party and therefore do not believe there is any end. ''God is all of tin's visible and invisible phenomena of Infinite love and wisdom, permeating all the realms of the Infinite Universe and moving it on in all directions, towards eternally higher and higher, holier and holier, happier and happier conditions. We mean the totality of this whole phenomena visible and invisible, finite and Infinite, past, present and to come is directly or indirectly, God. God is omnipresent, all present ; Omnipotent, all potent or powerful, and Omniscient, all Intelligent.' hrough all the world below, God is seen all around, Search hills, valleys through, there he is found. i the growing of the corn, the lily and the thorn, The pleasant and forlorn, there He's seen, there He's All declare God is there, [seen. In the meadow dressed in green, there He's seen. ' Now we can conceive of the personality of such an Infinite, limitless being, in no other way only that all this vast Universe is His embodiment. Is not this Universe the divine manifestation of Infinite Love and Infinite Wisdom and so the image of the Godhead bodily? This is a subject too deep and goes too far into the absolutely unknowable and incomprehensible for you kind reader or us to fathom. Still in the infinite concatenation of intelligences from the lowest scullion in creation to the highest Archangel, and yet there is no highest, Ave shall both be able to find friends and helpers innumerable, for as there is no end to the Heavens, we shall never be in want of myriads of friends and spiritual guides always ready and happy to lead, direct, help and comfort us under all trials, sorrows and temptations and to gradually locate us in realms of peace and rest.
