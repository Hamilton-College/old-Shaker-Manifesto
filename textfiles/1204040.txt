THE SILO MEETING IN PITTSFIELD A Letter concerning it by Elder Evans. Editor of the Sun:—There was a goodly gathering in the town hall, Pittsfield, on the 10th inst., a company of substantial, noble looking men. Instinctively I enquired, Where are the young men? Those present were uniformly past middle age. Have Massachusetts farmers no posterity, or have their sons become clerks, merchants, doctors, lawyers, priests, agents, soldiers, tramps? 'Ill fares the land to thickening wrongs a prey, where idlers nourish and true men decay.' Is there not something radically wrong in the system of national education when it thus results in making labor on the soil uninviting, if not discreditable, to the rising generation of young men? Suppose the clergy of New England revise its theology—form a new plan of salvation—beginning with 'the world that now is,' allowing none to join the churches, unless, as evidence of good character, they prove ownership of at least a part of an acre of land, and also excluding all who own more land than they faithfully and honorably cultivate. 'Woe to those who add acre to acre and house to house, until there be no place left for some of the people,' and 'blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth'—own a piece of land. Soon the school teachers would instill into the minds of boys the idea that landless men are villians, i. e., holders of houses and lands 'by base servile tenure,' and that the speculative land holder is also a villian, i. e., 'a vile, wicked man,' a creator of criminals, poverty in land and riches in land being the primary cause of human crimes. England is in great turmoil with her Irish soil-workers—millions. Eussia is just now legislating to relieve the extreme poverty of 19,000,000 farmers who were emancipated from villiany or serfdom 20 years ago. Educate and legislate the young men, with the best brains, unto the land. F. W. Evans. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
