Enfield, New Hampshire Enfield, N. H. The Brethren have just finished the painting, outside, of four buildings in the Church family, which improves the general appearance of the Village. The North Family have a piece of lovage that is the wonder of passers-by. It has gone to seed and the stalks are full six feet tall. The Mascoma Lake is five miles long and three-fourths wide. The Society is on the west shore. The waters of the Lake pass into the Mascoma River at the north end, and then on to the Conn, river. Elder Elijah Myrick, of Harvard, Mass., calls on the 18th. of July and leaves the 19th. Aug. 8. Several members of the first and second families, and all the school children of the Society have an excursion on Mascoma Lake. They go on board of a small steamboat which is under the management of Capt. C. Packard.
