Don't Grumble It is as bad to be with a grumbler as to be out on a rainy day. The one dampens our clothing, the other our spirits. But a bright, sunny-faced man or woman cheers us like a ray of sunlight coming into a dark room. Fretting is hateful and tiresome. Cheerfulness, lovely and winsome. We all have our trials and troubles, why should we impose them upon others. There is virtue in suffering patiently and cheerfully. When troubles come, shut your month firmly, look up, take in a long breath and go forward.
