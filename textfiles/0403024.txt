CORRESPONDENCE By the request of friends we give publicity to the following correspondence, which took place between two Shaker Sisters of the North Family, Mt. Lebanon, in the early part of October and November, 1873. They both left the shores of time, to seek a home in the elysian fields on the other side of the stream, on the 10th and 23d of December last.
