SCRIPTURE TEXT. Jesus says to Simon Peter in Luke, xxii.,�When thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren. The revised version reads,�When once thou hast turned again, establish thy Brethren. We might suppose that Simon Peter had not been converted as he is informed what to, do when he is converted, or has again turned to the right way. When thou hast turned again, as much as to say,�Well, Peter, you have attempted to be a Christian, to walk in the narrow way, but have stepped aside. Now when thou hast turned again into the right way, then stablish or strengthen thy Brethren. Peter was a growing Christian, but the growth in grace was slow. He was quick to receive some impressions, and when Jesus called him from his home at the sea shore, he left his ship, his nets and all his business relations and followed the Teacher. Matt, xxvi., 51. From this moment Peter was ready, either to pray or to fight for the safety of his accepted friend. He could pray (Acts ix., 40) and baptise (Acts x., 47) and preach, if need be, (Acts viii., 20) and yet was not quite able under all circumstances of life to 230 THE MANIFESTO. hold himself by the side of his spiritual pattern. When Jesus was talking about the rich men, that they could hardly enter the kingdom of heaven, that a camel might go through the eye of a needle as easily, it brought Peter to his feet who evidently was thinking about his daily bread, and said he, Behold we have forsaken all and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore? Peter believed in the adage, ' 'Look before you leap.' We suppose Jesus soon quieted his mind on this subject as he pictured to him the hundred-fold of houses and lands that he would possess in this world, and then of the assurance of eternal life. Peter was so well understood that when he assured Jesus that he was ready to go with him into prison or unto death, Jesus says, 1 tell thee Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.�Luke xxii., 33�34. Peter had many chances to turn again and help stablish the Brethren. In his crudeness and roughness, which was his inheritance through the flesh, he manifested the growth of his gospel life, so fast as he obtained it. While another disciple might be in spiritual retirement, Peter was defending the life of his beloved Teacher from the insults of the crowd. A corresponding instance occurred in the life of our good brother Peter Ayers. Peter was about eighteen years of age when he accepted the testimony of Jesus Christ, as preached by Ann Lee. He was full of the life of the world. Every bone and muscle from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet was perfectly sound. Invitations brought Peter into all the dancing parties near his home, and whether it was a cotillion, a jig or a breakdown, he was always on the floor. Peter was also a soldier in the cause of his country, when the red-coats were at Yorktown and Bunker Hill, and later was a soldier of the Lord, Jesus Christ. He was at the surrender of Burgoyne at Bemis Heights, Oct. 16, 1777, but at a later date he threw aside all his carnal weapons and accepted a place in the ranks of the peacemakers. Peter would sing and dance for the Lord, day or night, and if need be fight for his religious teachers with as good grace as he would pray for them. Soon after he became converted, but before he had done much to establish the Brethren in the peaceable fruits of righteousness, he was subjected to the ridicule and mockery of an idle, reckless class, who laughed at the idea that Peter Ayers should have religion. Peter endured the insults like a martyr and suffered much personal abuse with Christian patience. One night after saying his prayers and retiring to enjoy the slumbers of a peaceful conscience, he was awakened by three young men who were calling him, Shaker ! Shaker ! Then they dared him to come out of the house. Peter was not in the least disturbed by this salutation, but when they began to slander his gospel teacher, Ann Lee, and denounced her as a bad woman, he could bear it no longer. Jumping from his bed, and without dressing he was soon on a wild chase and did not return to the house till he had thoroughly pounded his tormentors, THE MANIFESTO. 231 and left them to mourn their bruises, while he returned to enjoy a night of quiet rest. Peter in his old age, would laugh over this example of zealous, muscu lar Christianity and say it was all the self-denial he had attained unto, up to that date. Simon Peter represents the zealous, muscular, daring, affectionate and great hearted Christian, and he helped to establish his Brethren while passing through all these trials and temptations. Converted Christians are quite often, in their march, like infants trying to walk. The least obstacle in the way and they are certain to fall. The only sure way to success is to try again and every time we try to recover from the fall or have turned again the Lord will help us up, and then we must work more diligently to establish ourselves and the Brethren on a sure foundation.
