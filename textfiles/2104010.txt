SOUL FOOD. Ida A. Thomas. Looking out on this vast world in mental vision I behold millions of souls all sustained bj7 the beneficent grace and care of our great Creator. Not a single soul of this vast universe could exist independent of the care of the all-wise Father. In the earth is found that which is converted into food for the sustenance of the natural life. God in wisdom made the worhl and the greatest and most wonderful of his works, is mankind. How curiously, how wonderfully are we made ! We certainly were born to be happy, but alas! how often do we hear those around us complaining how hard the way of life is. I am convinced by my experience in this life, that life is just what we make it. We are apt to allow our lives to be influenced by the failings and short-comings of others. The noble mind will soar above the petty trials and temptations of every-day life, will seek to look beyond self. As the natural body is supported by the food nature produces, so the spiritual part is fed from the fountains of heaven, ministered to us in the blessed testimonies of our beloved gospel parents both in and out of the body. For the growth of the soul it must constantly be fed or it becomes weak and puny just as the body would without natural food for its support. The natural is a type of the spiritual. It often seems easier to live a natural life ; a life of ease and indulgence, than a spiritual life. The higher life calls us up out of nature into a higher plain; to crucify all those lower propensities which draw the soul down. Away with such weakness. Let us rise in the regeneration, wearing a clean and spotless garment made so by an honest confession of all sin, then and only then can we feel a true joining with the church of Christ.
