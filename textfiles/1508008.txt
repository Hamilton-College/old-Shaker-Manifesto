I HOLD STILL Pains furnace heat within me quivers, God's breath upon the flames doth blow, And all my heart in anguish shivers And trembles at the fiery glow; And yet I whisper, As God will! And in his hottest fire hold still. He comes and lays my heart all heated, On the hard anvil minded so, Into his own fair shape to beat it With liis great hammer, blow on blow, And yet 1 whisper, As God will! And at his heaviest blow hold still. He takes my softened heart and beats it, The sparks fly off at every blow; He turns it o'er and o'er and heats it, And lets it cool and makes it glow; And yet I whisper, As God will! And in his mighty hand hold still. Why should I murmur? for the sorrow Thus only longer lived would be ; Its end may come, and will to-morrow, When God hath done his work in me; So I say trusting, As God will! And trusting to the end, hold still Selected.
