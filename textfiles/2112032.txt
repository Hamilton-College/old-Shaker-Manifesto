Union Village, Ohio. Nov. 1891. Hebe I come with a few items about our happy Western home, and it may interest some one of the Manifesto readers. Office repairs and also those of our newly-modeled horse-barn progress favorably. The Brethren finished digging potatoes on Oct 9th. Had six hundred and forty bu. from 2% acres. About this time Elder O. C. Hampton trims 1200 apple, pear peach and plum trees. Oct. 12th. Elder Napoleon Brown and two other Brethren commence gathering winter apples; finished Oct. 15th. Had three hundred bu. which are put away in the cellar. We have an abundance of squashes and pumpkins which were brought from the field Oct. 16. Also raised 1684 bu. beets for the milch cows this winter. I have been reading and reviewing the life of our blessed Mother Ann. When we reflect and see what she was called upon to go through, the suffering and abuse, it seems to me we are lacking, sadly lacking in gratitude for the homes we have in this day, when she on different occasions like the Son of God had not where to rest her head. All honor to her bright name! I am not ashamed to say I have a spiritual Mother as well as a Father. A. B. G.
