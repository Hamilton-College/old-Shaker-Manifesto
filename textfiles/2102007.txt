Beloved Elder Henry:--A very happy new year to all... Shirley Village, Mass. Jan. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�A very happy new year to all the dear friends at East Canterbury. I send you the assessment for Harvard and Shirley for 1891. The loss we all must feel in the death of our dearly beloved Leader, Elder Giles B. Avery, is inexpressible, if we should not say irreparable. My intimate acquaintance has tended to deepen my love and affection for him. Zion is passing through the fiery furnace, and who shall be able to stand? And the answer comes, the pure and upright. You may have heard of the death of my companion to England and Scotland�Elder Robert Aitken. An experience with him has increased a sincere love and affection for him, as a Believer, and a zealous advocate of all that tends to the true resurrection life. With kindest wishes Very truly, John Whiteley.
