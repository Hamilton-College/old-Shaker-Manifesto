STICK TO OLD FRIENDS S. S. [Contributed by S. S. Woods.] STICK TO OLD FRIENDS. Never give up old friends for new ones. Make new ones, if you like, and when you have found that you can trust them, love them if you will, but remember the old ones still. Do not forget they have been tried and found true ; that they have been merry with you in time of pleasure, and when sorrow came to you they sorrowed also. No matter if they have gone down in the social scale and you up ; no matter if poverty and misfortune have come to them while prosperity and plenty have fallen to youâ€”are they any the less true for that? Are not their hearts as warm and tender if they do beat beneath homespun instead of velvet? Yes, kind friends, they are as true, and tender, and loving, and don't forget old friends. Selected.
