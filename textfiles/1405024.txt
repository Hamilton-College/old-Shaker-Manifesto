CONQUERING FAITH. ANNIE R. STEPHENS. True souls are they who walk life's thorny path With faultless tread; though rugged, mountainous And bare, still on they press, with purpose fixed And soul engirt with courage, as with a coat Of mail, that knows no brooding thought, nor fear Of threat'ning storms that lower. The ebon clouds of stern adversity May hang above, and screen the golden beams Of life's effulgent sun; biit Hope ne'er waning Ever shines within; giving glimpses of that Heaven of eternal blue that, is always Visible to the calm clear eye of faith. Affliction's heavy waters oft may flood Their hearts in Alpine torrents; the cragged Mount of difficulty, rear its snowy peak In stern defiance; but hearts with courage Firm, and purpose fixed, and constant as the Polar star, shrink not; but bravely climb The rocky steep, defy all rising fears For well they know the intervening shadows Soon will pass away like misty clouds Before the rising sun; and dangers seeming' Insurmountable, will vanish 'neath the feet Of those, who know no thought of fail. Who knows but what the heaviest trials, tests And adverse lines that fall across all lives Are sent of God; to teach our human hearts Life's greatest lessons, resignation, trust And calm endurance ; thus unfold the hidd'n Powers of our immortal being, and fit Our souls for that eternal heaven of joy And happiness, we all are seeking here; For what would be the joy of heaven, if not Attained by struggle, toil and self-denial? E'en as the tender seed must struggle 'neath The darksome soil, oft-times impeded By the rudest storm, ere it unfolds its Vernal cup to catch the sunny beam; So will the soul expand its Gad-like powers Beneath the silent work of changeless law That governs all. Then let our hearts be true ; For God is just; and they who work in his Appointed way, shall see triumphant end Of all life's tail and pain; shall reach the goal, And win the prize, and wear the crown of life.
