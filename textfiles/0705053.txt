The Shaker, G. A. Lomas, Editor, Shakers, N. Y.... The Shaker, G. A. Lomas, Editor, Shakers, N. Y., is the official monthly organ of the united societies of that faith, and a very good-looking and intelligent exponent of its material and spiritual interests. Founded by that Christly woman, Ann Lee, originally a Manchester (Eng.) factory-girl, whom they regard as the spiritual peer of Jesus, this wide-spread order of modern socialism presents many features of absorbing interest to students of love and labor reform. The Shaker is sent, post-paid, to any address, for 6o cents per annum. The Word, Princeton, Mass.
