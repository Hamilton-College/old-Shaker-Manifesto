SECRET THOUGHTS. ELLA WHEELER WILCOX. I hold it true that thouglits are things� Endowed with being, breath and wings, And that we send them forth to fill The world with good results or ill. That which we call our ' secret thought, ' Speeds tc the earth's remotest spot And leaves its blessings or its woes Like tracks behind it, as it goes. It is God's law. Remember it In your still chamber as you sit [known, With thoughts you would not dare have And yet make comrades when alone. These thoughts have life, and they will fly And leave their impress, by and by, [breath Like some marsh breeze whose poisonous Breathes into homes its fevered death. And, after you have quite forgot Or all outgrown some vanished thought. Back to your mind to make its home, A dove or raven, it will come. Then let your secret thoughts be fair; They have a vital part and share In shaping worlds and moulding fate� God's system is so intricate. Selected.
