GOD IS LIGHT. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. Did mankind realize the full depravity of that nature which they serve and obey, and the extent of their departure from God in so doing, they would abhor their own flesh�'all tribes of the earth would mourn, ' wall and lament their lost condition and roll in dust and ashes, crying and praying to Gud for deliverance. Joy would cease and pleasure vanish, and if they could see no way of hope of release they would sink in despair. All the judgments announced \ y prophets for the destruction of wickedness, and the correction of evil-doers, would seem a light burden, compared with the heavy woe of sin that rests upon them. All the afflictions of the righteous, and the suffering of the martyrs of all ages would seem less grievous to endure. Yea, even the cross of Christ would lose its barren and forbidding aspect, and be embraced with rejoicing, as the sure precursor of freedom, light, and happiness. They would be ready and willing to part with all that is dear to the carnal mind that they might be delivered from their strong enemy and obtain the better and lasting inheritance of the righteous. The Beast with seven heads and ten horns,�the m.an of sin, sitting in the temple, and opposing and exalting himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped�the abomination that astonisheth the angel messengers of heaven, making the human heart desolate of God and his light, love and saving power, are faint comparisons. It is truly a black abyss, from whence issues continually, fire and smoke that darkens the Sun of Righteousness and obscures and pollutes the air of the Spirit, converting the heart to stone. The root of this depravity in man, is the ' Lust of the flesh ' or of natural generation; from whence proceeds the 'Lust of the eye, ' which desires to see only that which will please the flesh; and the 'Pride of life, ' which would cover all with a fig leaf profession of sanctity, or of false honor, and exclude that light which searches the heart and manifests the true character of its actions. ' God is light�in him is no darkness. ' 'He that dwelleth in God, dwelleth in light.' 'That which makes manifest is | light.' Souls are not conscious of guilt except they receive that light of God which manifests the real nature of their actions. Hence said the Apostle, 'By the Law is a knowledge of sin.' Hence also Jesus testified, 'this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world. ' God having endowed man with a self-conscious power (if volition and reasoning intelligence, termed free agency, without which he could experience no more reward or happiness in doing his duty than does the hand or foo'j for obeying the head, proceeds by enlightening the conscience or understanding with a knowledge of the way of happiness which is life, and of the consequences of departure from the way of protection and blessing. The degree of accountability that rests with any soul, depends upon the amount of this know ledge that is placed within its reach. Hence it is written, 'The Priest's lips should keep knowledge.�They should seek the Law at his mouth; ' for he is the messenger of the Most High; And of Jesus who was to manifest the light of man's eternal Order, it was foretold, ' By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many. ' The same spirit, referring to the restoration that would take place under the New Covenant in Christ, said, 'I will give you pastors according to my heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. ' This knowledge or light in the understanding, concerning the way of true happiness, is called 'Wisdom, who is a tree of life to them that lay hold of Her. ' Every human rational intelligence, (before it prodigal like, sins away its first estate,) is entitled by virtue of its origin, and the designs of Eternal Wisdom in creating it, to receive at some period of its existence (fittest time best known to the Creator.) the fullest manifestation of this Light of Life, that can be made clear to its rational understanding. This superlative manifestation could not be made to man, until the race had sufflciently matured for Christ to appear in human nature, in his perfect Order or ' Glory, ' to establish among men, the spiritual and eternal Order of the supernal heavens, of which the seed was planted in human nature, when God breathed into man the breath of life. The natural life and Order in which man was first created, was an Order of types and figures, designed to instruct his infant mind by symbols until he was sufficiently grown to enter his ultimate and eternal Order, where the mistakes and errors of inexperience could not be so easily overlooked�which accords with the testimony of Jesus 'All manner of sins, and blasphemies shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men. ' Matt, xii., 31- Because the former is a transgression against the light of shadowy and temporary things but the latter is a sin against the eternal and substantial. As the first ' Adam is a figure of him Avho was to come, ' that is, of the second man, the ''Lord from heaven,' or quickening spirit, which existed with God ' before the world was, ' so all natural things in their primitive order and creation, were but types or secondary effects of an invisible substance in the eternal world. Hence ' The invisible things of Him are clearly seen, being under stood by the things which are made. ' Yet 'The things that are seen are temporal, while the things that are not seen are eternal. From these premises, scriptural ard rational it will appear that Christ, who was and is the life of the supernal Order, is the real substance and tree of life, of which the nat. ural tree of life, containing the directive light of the natural Order, was but a reflection or figure. Hence we read ' In him was life, and that life was the light of men. '&gt; The light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehends it not.' Also that the ' spiritual rock ' which followed the children of Israel in the wilderness, and of which they all ate and drank, was Christ. Hence also Christ is the source of light, is symbolized in the language of Revelation, as the Sun of Righteousness, and the light and genius of nature, being derivative and secondary, is typified by the Moon. In the beginning, the directive liglit of the natural Order was abundant, while man's ultimate or spiritual Order was placed before him as an object of hope to which he might attain by faithfulness and obedience. But man lost the greater part of his light, both in the figure and substance by transgression. Therefore it is written 'The entrances of the elder world were wide and sure, and brought immortal fruit. When Adam transgressed my statutes then was decreed what now is done. Then were the entrances of this world made narrow�full of sorrow and travail�few and evil�full of perils and very painful. So I considered the world and behold there was peril because of the devices that were come into it. And I saw and spared it greatly ; and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people. ' The pain and sorrow pronounced upon the woman in child-bearing, while operating as a check or corrective of licentious passions, was the inception or sign of the pain and sorrow that her offspring were destined to pass through in consequence of transgression and according to the laws of origination and transmission, if the mother suffered patiently her offspring would have more fortitude to bear their part. It was also a figure of the increased sufferings of spirit that would be required to bring forth the new or second birth. The flaming swords that turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life, are the fires of tribulation and the cross of selfdenial, necessary to hold that poisonous sensual nature in subjection to the higher life and light of the rational faculties. The thorns and thistles decreed to man, represent the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches, that tend to choke the good seed or light of life, as shown in Christ's parable of the sower. The first effect of transgression upon the primitive pair, was a sense of guilt and shame. The next desire was to conceal their shame from each other, and the third effect was a desire to hide from the liglit, which made manifest and reproved their sin. This is the history not only of the primitive man in Eden, but also of his descendants to this day. Jesus bore witness to this fact, when he said to Mcodemus, ' He that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved, (marg. made manifest.) ral types and figures) for the purpose of introducing the final order of eternal substance, with which the Believer is gradually brought by travel, face to face in open view. 1 Cor. xiii., 12. Jesus was the first to fulfill the whole law of God, so that lie could say, 'I do always those things that please Him. ' ' The Son can do rothing but what he seeth the Father do.' 'It is my meat and drink to do the will of Him that sent me. ' Thus it was his love or life to keep the commandments of God; and 'Love is the fulfilling of the law.' To love God truly is to love to obey his commandments, and 'His commandments are not grievous to those who love, but are life everlasting.' Hence in this spirit he could say 'I am the bread of God�except ye eat my flesh (word) and drink my blood (spirit or life) ye have no life (of God) in you.' Through the power and operation of faith, tie was able to impart or transmit that life to others, so that he could say ' He that believeth in me, though he were dead (in trespasses and sins,) yet shall he live, (by virtue of a superior law to that of the natural life which is temporary and perishable,) and 'he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
