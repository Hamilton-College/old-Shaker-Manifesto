'THE IDEAL MAN.' Rev. George L. Pekin gave the concluding lecture in his very interesting course on 'Ideals' at the Young Men's Christian Union last evening. His subject was 'The Ideal Man,' using as his text Ephesians, iv., 13. He said, in beginning: That we are here, with marvelous powers, with noble ambitions and wonderful surroundings, is a fact of superlative interest. Where we came from and the method of our creation may be interesting, but far more important is the fact that we are here, with the inevitable question, What can we make of ourselves and how develop all that we have? The theories of the theologian and the evolutionist are not unimportant, but more important is the work of the teacher and moral reformer. Our question, therefore, What shall the ideal man include? is very practical. Physiologically considered, man's life is built along an axis which we call the spinal column. Along this axis there seem to be three great centers : First, the reproductive organs, which we may call the passional center. Second, the stomach, which may be called the centre of appetite. Third, the brain, which may be called the center of thought and affection. For our present life, at least, we must believe that all these centers are necessary. But the ideal man will not be ruled from that center which lies at the base of the spinal column. The very life of the species depends upon these organs, while their overstimulation and abuse tend to its degradation and destruction. To-day society is alarmed at the rapid increase of sins against chastity; at the aggressive violation of the marriage contract. We ask for the cause ! Is church, State or home at fault? Perhaps all of them. But the real cause lies in the fact that men allow themselves to be ruled from the lowest center of their lifo, the base of the spinal column. Second�The ideal man will not be ruled from the middle center, or the stomach. Yet, from this center radiate all the appetites which minister to man's physical life; it is the center of all the vast industries of man, foi primarily it is appetite that prompts men to work. But while the normal use of these central organs is so necessary for the healthy life of man, who can estimate the misery that arises from their abuse. By a study of zoology we learn that there are some animals very simple in their organism; some are nearly all stomach. Well, judging by their actions we might well believe that some men were nearly all stomach ; they are literally ruled from that ce ter. Men begin to toil because they are hungry. Shall that be the end of toil? Oh, the pitiable cry of every worldly man, I must make a living! So must a pig. And if getting a living is the end of life what better is the life of man than that of the swine? Third�The ideal man will be ruled from the top of the spinal column. All three of the centers, intellectual, appetite and passional, will indeed be active; but they will be set in harmonious relations and ruled from the top. Here thought and affection will be found always in command. It will not be a blind, but an intelligent rule. Our prisons, almshouses, insane asylums are crowded full. They will never be relieved till men are taught to live above the ears ; till they are no longer dominated by the beast instincts, but ruled by the conviction that they are men. Let men be ruled from the head and the heart and we shall have not only the ideal man, but the ideal society, and we shall feel that that is in some sense the reign of Christ, and Paul's prophecy shall be fulfilled when we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man.
