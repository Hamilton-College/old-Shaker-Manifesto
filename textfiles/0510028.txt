RETALIATION ' Recompense to no man (or woman) evil for evil.' ' If thine enemy hunger, feed him ' (or her). That is good scripture ; it is Christlike. When we are wronged, it is natural to retaliate — to seek revenge — the reverse of the spirit that would lead us to pray for, and forgive those who despitefully use us. It is easier to talk of forgiving an enemy, than to really do it. I ask myself this question : If an incendiary should maliciously, without provocation, put the torch to my dwelling—as was recently done at Mt. Lebanon — would I feel like seeking revenge, and rejoice in the infliction of punishment upon that person ? ' I think I can truthfully answer in the negative. I respect the protective laws of our country, and the judiciary which enforce those laws for the safety of the public; but I would gladly commend the erring to the mercy of God, and of the civil magistrates — if they would repent and sin no more. The prayer of Jesus for his enemies was, ' Father forgive them ; they know not what they do.' Thus we would pray, and forgive. But if they are not brought, through the medium of their own consciences, nor by the moral influence of their friends, to see the great wrong they have done, it were better for the safety of the community, and even for their own happiness in the end, that they be placed by sentence of law where they cannot continue to bring so great suffering and sorrow upon others. 1 am deeply impressed by the recent disastrous fires, with the importance of laying up treasures in that house not made with human hands, beyond the reach of fire or flood.
