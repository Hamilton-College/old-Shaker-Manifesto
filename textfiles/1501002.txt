CONSISTENCY MARY WHITCHER What seers, what Saviors and what Gods, T'is needful we should be ! And yet we are but merest worms To act in such degree. God grant humility of heart, Best armor of defence, That better we may act our part Removed from arrogance. Our motives must decide our case In part, but not the whole ;— Unless we've studied for our race Creation of each soul— We'll say no more, but think anew On this consistent plan, While least and most that we can do, Is, ' do the best we can.
