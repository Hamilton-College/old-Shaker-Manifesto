How many pray thus? *Io\v many ^ray thus'?â€”A work recently published in London, entitled ' English Eccentricities,' contains the following prayer: ' Lord, thou knowest that I possess nine houses in the city of London, and that I have recently bought an estate in the county of Essex. Preserve, therefore, I pray thee, the two counties of Middlesex and Essex from fires and earthquakes. And, as I have an hypothecated estate in Hertfordshire, look also in compassion on that county. As to the mher portions of the country, do as thou wilt. Lord, consolidate the Royal Bank, that it may honor its notes. Let all my debtors be or become honest men. Give a prosperous and speedy passage to the sloop Mermaid, for the insurance of which I am responsible. Preserve me from robberies and brigands. Make all my servants faithful and devoted, that they may watch over my interests and relax not their diligence by day or by night.'
