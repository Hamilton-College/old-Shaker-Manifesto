MEMORY'S PICTURE. Annie R. Stephens. In the picture gallery of my mind are man}7 vivid scenes; one most beautiful that I often admire, represents a charming landscape, surrounded by distant mountains, while the first faint gleams of the spring-tide sun floods hill and vale with a silver radiance, lighting the fresh green foliage with a tender glow, and the early flowers of May are reaching up to the sunbeam to unfold their beautiful lives. But this is not all, only the outward expression, the real scene lies back of these things, as much as the soul is behind the body. Perhaps you think it is the recollection of a painting from some ancient artist, or a production of modern times ; but none of these ; it is the pleasant reminiscence of a kindness received from a friend and penciled on the plastic walls of memory, never to be forgotten. It was a lovely day in the spring when all Nature was crowned with the beauty of the vernal season, even the atmosphere was so balmy that it seemed like drinking in the nectar of the god's, most delightful and inspiring ; but none of these could I enjoy ; a slight accident had confined me to my room, and in my misfortune I was not forgotten. A loving hand, prompted by a loving heart, had gathered from the woods some messes and early blossoms, Nature's first offerings, artistically arranged, and brought them to me to console my weary feelings and speak in their tongueless language of the beauty and sublimity of Nature's works. And they did speak in audible sounds to my inner senses. I heard the music of the rippling stream as it bounded over stone and pebble, moistening the roots of these woodland flowerets ; I saw the sunbeam painting their delicate petals, and the proud oak and lofty elm, that for many years had stood and debarred the keener rays of the sun, and sheltered many such fragile blossoms from the tempest ; and linked with all this beauty was the Divine Mind who forms the atom and holds worlds in immeasurable space. The thoughts that flowed into my mind at that time, pen cannot portray. I felt my soul blended with the good, the beautiful and divine of the past and present, and flooded with a spiritual feeling entirely unknown to me before ; in the ecstasy of the moment I could but exclaimï¿½twOh! the soul is more than the body, the spiritual is superior to the material.' If we unlock the door to the inner sanctuary of God's universe, and cast off the earthliness by which our minds are beclouded, we might pierce through the mysteries that enshroud, and perceive more fully the soul of things. Such were the thoughts and feelings produced by the tender sympathy of a friend. Be not sparing of good deeds, they will yield a harvest for time and eternity. Do not let us omit any opportunity for doing a kindness, no matter how trifling, it may touch some heart-chord that will vibrate forever, giving untold pleasure to the receiver, while the law of recompense returns a three-fold value of blessing to the giver. The recollection of the circumstance that occasioned these thoughts will live in memory as a picture of eternal worth, surviving the fleeting, perishable things of time. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
