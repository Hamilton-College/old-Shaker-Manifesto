My brother: On reading from the... My Brother :�On reading from the June Manifesto, and reflecting upon a mighty question propounded at the close of a worthy historical production from the pen of brother Louis Basting, to wit;�' Who is a Christian according to the high standard of the New Testament, ' I could but think that to Christian sects, Christian professors generally, the interrogatory was embarrassing. Of all the millions bearing the Christian name, who or how many can answer, I know my life to be completely hid in Christ? How many can confidently reply,�that from early dawn to setting sun, my whole service is unselfish, wholly devoted to the support of the principles of truth, with no reserves, no act performed that would not commend me to our Father and Mother in heaven and merit blessing; no word spoken that was idle, unweighed or would condemn me ; no seeking or longing for objects forbidden the genuine follower of Christ or a thought indulged that should on the instant be rejected ; and no motives I would wish to conceal from mortal eye ? Who among this throng is not to be found in the broad way, where but little sacrifice is demanded and self-denial is not the order of its travelers, or by them practised? Who acts the good Samaritan, and who but passes by on the other side to escape duty, the rendering of a service of humility, the making of a sacrifice of pleasure, thus forbidding the indulgence of some animal propensity ; who in their hearts do not truly reject Christ, virtually pierce him and place his life and example too far oft' to be reached, thus consoling and stultifying themselves with the false idea; that Jesus the Savior, the son of man is a portion of Deity, whose life was too exalted for imitation and beyond the reach of the capabilities of man ; that his blood shed on Calvary cleanses every impurity of the heart of those professing his name aud his sacrifices atone for all their errors ? Multitudes profess Christ and are called by his name. Are there not multitudes, far from being pure in heart who flatter themselves they shall see God and reign with Christ, however much they set aside the precepts and example of Jesus and walk in the light of the fires of their owu kindling ; and however positive the declaration that such shall not see God? Little do such regard the spirit of the sermon on the Mount. Virtually they despise the poor iti spirit, the mourner, the meek, him that hungers and thirsts after righteousness, the merciful, the pure in heart and the peacemaker. Such have no just claims to the character of being the light of the world, the salt of the earth. Such dispel the light and become clouds of darkness. Such, if ever salted with the fire of truth, have lost their savor, and through false teaching and ungodly lives by their name and profession of Christianity have become a curse in the earth, unworthy the respect of intelligence or reason, science or religion. Deliver me from all forms, ceremonies and ordinances devoid of the spirit and substance that give to the soul progress and are of a redeeming character. I weary of every shade of sanctity, every name and profession not associated with godliness. Give me the truth that maketh free, or take away the knowledge of a cloak that gives no excuse for sin. Ignorance is preferable to light, unless light is accompanied with that power which looses the bands of wickedness, undoes heavy burdens and lets the oppressed go free. A gospel that breaks not every yoke is not the saving gospel of Christ. Therefore if the means of salvation is not found in obedience to a declaration and testimony, the evidence is clear that souls are not baptized into the spirit and power of the gospel of Christ; and no soul should rest until that revelation is reached. Abraham Perkins. Enfield, N. H. Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord. THE SABBATH. NANCY ft. DANFORTH. When God made an end of his creation, He 'rested for a season ; and not only so, but He hallowed that time, thus making; it holy. After two thousand five Hundred years had passed away, the law was given to the Jews, when the Sabbath was renewed, with many injunctions to keep it holy and sacred, a holy convocation to the Lord, a day of humility or rejoicing wherein they should do no servile work. Whoever violated this law was punished with death. Then was added a week of Sabbaths ; again a whole year was to be kept holy, when all should be released from any bondage wherein they had been made to serve. This was enjoined upon them forever so long as they remained a people. While they were obedient to the commands of God they were abundantly blest and prospered; their enemies were subdued and slain. Indeed, they sometimes had only to 'Stand still and see the salvation of God.' Thus showing the power of God to be sufficient to save all who trust by yielding strict obedience to the requirements, 'Resist not evil,' or, in other words, contend not with those who would seek your harm ; but bow submissively and in the spirit of the Lamb them shalt overcome and surely prevail. It was thus with the Jew-* in the days of their prosperity. But when they were carried away captive by their enemies, it was often said, 'wYe have polluted my Sabbaths. ' The prophets frequently warned the people to repent of their desecration of the Lord's Sabbath. The ancient Jews were called to be the Lord's people, chosen to do a figurative work. All the laws and many prophecies pointed to the final work of redemption ; therefore we see in this law of the Sabbath, a point of peculiar meaning and interest. The Lord ceased from his work of creation and man is called now in the fullness of time to do the same, as it is written, ' He that hath entered into his rest, he also, hath ceased from his own works, as God did from His ; on the Sabbath they were to perform no servile work. In this last great Sabbath we may not pander to servile passions that will bring the soul in bondage to the adversary. The Jews were to keep a great Jubilee ; so may we rejoice in songs of praise, for deliverance from worse than Egyptian bondage. It is the privilege of those who are blest with a knowledge of Christ's second appearing to live free from the baneful influences of sin ; thus to enjoy a perpetual Sabbath of praise and thanksgiving, even in this life. The Jewish Sabbath was a striking figure of this rest from sin. If we would be sons and daughters of God, we must be guided by this law of the Sabbath and cease from ' finding our own pleasure, or speaking our own words,' that is, not find pleasure in anything save the will of God. When we reject this testimony of true obedience to known law, God will also reject us from being His ' peculiar people' even as He did the Jews. Canterbury, N. H.
