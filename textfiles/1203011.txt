GOOD WILL TO ALL O. C. HAMPTON The goodness of God leadeth on to repentance ; Forgiveness, the need of confession sincere; Man's weakness, a plea for entire dependence On God's tender mercies while traveling here. Contrition and sorrow become the Believer, For sin and short coming, and hardness of heart; And who of such gift is the happy receiver Can truly be said to possess the 'good part.' I know that the true consecration of spirit Which we are commanded in deed to possess, Is genuine Love and good will to inherit, And ev'ry good saint and vile sinner to bless. To soften each feeling of coldness and hardness In tender conpassion, to friend and to foe; Of all to be anxious and watchful, regardless Of what they are doing or going to do. The old roots of bitterness, malice and slander, 0 let us dig up, and consume in the fire Of patient forgiveness, and charity tender, If nearer to Heaven and Christ we aspire. Cease, once and forever, from all evil speaking, And learn the new language, to speak well of all; The good and the union of all to be seeking, For this is in earnest the trumpet's loud call. Why should we continue to injure each other O God! shall the sword never cease to devour? O are we not ready, dear Sister and Brother, Of Peaceful at-one-ment, to hail the glad hour? Sweet union, is Heaven on earth to believers It strengthens the wav'ring, and comforts the strong; Ev'n here in this life, from all grief it delivers, And fits us for joys of Eternity long. Union Village, Ohio. O how blessed is the union of God's children just and pure ; Bright and shining are the mansions, which our Father does ensure, Ever blessed, ever holy, shall our work and calling be : Free from evil, clean and lovely, in the spirit we'll agree.
