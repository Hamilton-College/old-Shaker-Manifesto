AN ACROSTIC. By James Carr. The man who does little things for God with fidelity will be given tlie power to do great things. Happy is he that can look up but to be useful we must look down. Every guide-board pointing toward heaven says, 'Start now.' Man is not right in his religion when he makes a wrong use of his money. All admire pluck but more like to be pluckt. N'o man can ask God for much who is not willing to do much. It is not what we give to God but what we keep from Him that makes us poor. Faith in God will move mountains, money can only make a tunnel through some of them. Everybody who tries to make others happy gets paid for it in heaven's coins. Some people can trust God as long as they have plenty of money, but when the bank breaks their religion goes with it. Take from love the power to suffer and it could never speak. One of the most terrible things about sin, is that it makes us dissatisfied with God. South Union, Ky.
