Enfield, Conn, Mar. 1882 Daniel Orcutt Enfield, Conn, Mar. 1882 Dear Children ;—After reading the good letters in the Manifesto, I concluded that I would also write one. Letter writing is an accomplishment, and if you make correspondence a means of improvement, it may be productive of good. Perhaps some of you have window gardens, if so, how carefully you watch the plants and buds. You are disappointed, no doubt, when the buds do not open into beautiful flowers, because some blight has injured them,—perhaps a worm has been eating at its heart. But do you watch yourselves, as lovely plants and buds, tenderly gaurded by true friends, lest the vile worm of sin destroys the beautiful flowers of truth and purity? Nothing but uprightness of spirit and chastity of body, can shield you from such a dreadful fate ! If you wish to have your lives bud and blossom into truth and virtue, shun the reigning blight of sin, lest it bring sorrow and death to your immortal spirits ! Erom your Brother,
