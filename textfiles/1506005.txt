THE DAY OF JUDGMENT. AURELIA MACE. The light at first a glimmer Along the eastern way, Is beaming forth in splendor ; The dawning of the day. White mists like billowy mountains From water courses rise, And, sparkling with the sunbeams, Blend with etherial skies. Throughout the gloom and darkness, We kept the Vestal Light, And heard the voice from Seir, ' Watchman what of the night? ' ' Behold the morning cometh, The Mighty One is here. ' Was sounded from the watch-tower 'The Judgment Day is near. ' O, not as ye expected, Does Gabriel's trumpet sound; The still small voice, in whispers, Is heard by all around. O, not as ye expected, Does Christ through heaven ride, The Living God is in you, You cannot turn aside. And not as ye expected Will Christ atone for you, The light which now ariseth Will search you through and through. Upon the Vestal Altars The Holocaust is slain, And fires thereon are burning, The pride of man to stain. And not as ye expected, Will all the dead arise: The dead in sin are hast'ning To make the sacrifice. The bruised reed is strengthened. The sick and lame are healed And to the feast invited, The Book is now unsealed. Come ye unto the Danquet, The door, no man can close, And war has been proclaimed Against inherent foes. With Michael's mighty army Defy the Man of Sin, 0, not as ye expected, The Judgment Day rolls in. West Gloucester, Me.
