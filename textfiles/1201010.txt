IN MEMORY OF ELDRESS POLLY J. REED Though many voices join in praise, Too much cannot be given For one who spent her youthful days, And all her life for heaven Not for a Heaven of peace and rest In which she would repose With those, the justified and blest, When here the life doth close; But heaven for every one she met While toiling o'er the road, . By kindness they could not forget, Which lightened every load. She gave her all,â€” not small to give, Inheritance was great, In virtues staunch by which to live And conquer fear and fate. A Christian's shield was hers, the Truth Her motto and her dress; Disarmed by nothing of the earth, She moved to love and bless. Not proud of talents, which were rare, But humble as a child To do her best, and equal share, Content and reconciled. Parental love was rent, to give This Isaac of their fold To God, for Christ's pure cause to live; Be their's a peace untold. And may all others near akin Feel blest, and not in vain Their sacrificing unto Him, Their own, for Zion's gain. Farewell, dear sister, in the Lord, Farewell in sweetest peace; On earth, 'Well done,' and thy reward Is joy to never cease. Canterbury, N. H. God and not self.
