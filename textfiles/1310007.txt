THE RESURRECTION JOSEPH WOODS. The prophet Isaiah said of Jesus, His reward is with Him and his work is before Him ; and speaking of himself, Jesus said, 'My reward is with me to give to every one, according as their works shall be.' 'I am the Resurrection and the Life.' and those who believed on Him, though they were dead, in trespasses and sins, yet they should live, and those who were alive and believed on Him,— with a living faith—should never die. That the doers of good works should come forth into the resurrection and life of Christ, consequently all we have to do, is to obey his instruction, to deny ourselves, every moment, of all ungodliness, and every worldly lust, that is presented, and to take up the cross as did Jesus and follow Him in the regeneration. By this we put on the Lord, Jesus Christ, which is the resurrection that Jesus declared Himself to be; and blessed, thrice blessed are those who have part in this first resurrection, for their reward is with them continually, and their duty for each day is before them.
