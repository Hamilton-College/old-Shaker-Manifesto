Dear madam; I received your paper... Osceola, Iowa. Oct. 4, 1881. Dear Madam ;�I received your paper the ' Manifesto'�There are people who are better than their systems of religion�the Shakers, the Quakers, and some others. I respect those people more than their opinions. We live in a free country (at least we flatter ourselves so) and none should be ostracised or persecuted on account of their religious opinions. As a general rule the most numerous and dominant sect in religion try to convert the others, and if unsuccessful, they persecute. I think the Shakers and the Quakers are both free from that intolerant spirit and so I respect them. The late I). M. Bennett and his wife once belonged to the Shakers ; they were both very good people, and great credit is due to those who raised them. I do not concur in Shakerism, nor its apposite Mormonism, nor in monastic celibacy, nor even in the present reckless marriage system and its frequent divorce. but the serious, and almost ominous question comes up, what social relations are best to supersede the present objectionable ones ? That is one of the hardest questions of today, and it calls louder and louder for reply. Suppose all were Shakers. Depopulation would be the result. Suppose all were Mormons. The tangled relations and resultant misery would be greatly increased. Monastic celibacy is but outward show, accompanied by crime and degradation such as few would believe who have not investigated. Our present system most in vogue is full of unhappy marriages, frequent divorce, overpopulation, poverty, crime, lunacy. My own opinions here would not weigh as a leather's weight, and therefore need not even bo glanced at. Be assured of my kind regards, how much soever our opinions may differ. Yours truly, F. J. Emory.
