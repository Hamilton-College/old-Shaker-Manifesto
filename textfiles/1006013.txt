TRUE PROGRESS CATHARINE ALLEN As we progress in a purely simple and religious life, craving nothing of earth but that which is subservient to our highest spiritual development, aspiration will be responded to by revelation; and through this law of influx, our mental faculties will be quickened to read and comprehend the laws of the universe. As wo thus receive the knowledge of God, the superstitions, errors and vanities clinging to, and inseparable from, a false life will be removed ; then, unfettered, we can worship Truth. In its unity our hearts become as one, and our souls flow together in divine love. New Lebanon, N. Y.
