Sylvia Persons Sylvia Persons, at Harvard, Mass., Feb. 25, 1890. Age 87 yrs. 10 mo. and 13 days. Her ?&gt;pirit passed away so calmly that those who were standing by her bedside hardly recognized the peaceful change. She has been one of the veterans of the city, and long and faithfully has she held the fort, not only against spiritual enemies but against physical sufferings. True to her faith she has stood like a conqueror, and now sings the song with the redeemed on Mount Zion. A. D. B. South Union, Ky., Feb. 28, 1890 Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½Another jewel is taken from our casket.
