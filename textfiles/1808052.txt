The Rev. G-- M--, an old negro preacher living upon a plantation... The Rev. G� M�, an old negro preacher living upon a plantation near Rochester, Ky., about twenty-five miles from Evansville, Ind.. is creating considerable excitement among the negroes of that section by his claims to supernatural power and a revelation, He claims to be a licensed apostle of God. He declares that he daily converses with the angel Gabriel, and that he has been delegated to lead all of his people back to their native land in the wilds of Africa, where they in turn are to evangelize all of the savages of the Dark Continent. He says that the hour for departure is near at hand, but the time has not been designated by the angel. The negroes are greatly excited, and though many are dubious as to these divine dispensations, they keep their doubts to themselves, as M� has alwaj s maintained a strong influence over them and his word has been law. What causes many to believe this modern Mahomet is the prophecy, remembered by the older negroes, that he made concerning emancipation. The fulfillment of that prophecy has been the secret .of his long influence over them, and the additional fact that he is said to have prophesied the earthquakes last year, and the premonition of wonderful changes to be made in his race in the near future. Many of the negroes are getting themselves in readiness for the proposed hegira under the leadership of their prophet. M�is a negro of large experience and considerable intelligence. R. P. Journal.
