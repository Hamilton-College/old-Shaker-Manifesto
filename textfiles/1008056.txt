THE THEOLOGY OF THE HEART. 0 vet we trust that somehow good Will be the final goal of ill, To pangs of nature, sins of will, Defects of doubt and taints of blood; That nothing walks with aimless feet; That not one life shall be destroy'd, Or cast as rubbish to the void, When God hath made the pile complete ; That uot a worm is cloven in vain ; That not a moth with vain desire Is shrivl'd in a fruitless fire, Or but subserves another's gain. Behold, we know not any thing ; I can but trust that good shall fall At last—far off—at last to all, And every winter change to spring. So runs my dream ; but what am I? An infant crying in the night: An infant crying for the light; And with no language but a cry. The wish, that of the living whole No life may fall beyond the grave, Derives it not from what we have The likest God within the soul ? Are God and nature then at strife, That nature lends such evil dreams ? So careful of the type she seems, So careless of the single life; That I, considering everywhere Her secret meaning in her deeds, And finding that of fifty seeds She often brings but one to bear, 1 falter where I firmly trod, And falling with my weight of cares Upon the great world's altar vstairs That slope thro' darkness up to God, I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope, And gather dust and chaff, and call To what I feel is Lord of all, And faintly trust the larger hope. —B7rom Tennyson's 'In Memoriarn:
