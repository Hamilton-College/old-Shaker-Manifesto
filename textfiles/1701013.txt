SABBATH of the LORD ''The American Government has no constitutional right to legislate upon theology—to recognize any Sabbath Day in a National Exposition. Under God, our protection as a people depends upon the government being kept in its integrity, unsectarian, a home for all nations, kindreds and tongues. This dispensation of Christ's second appearing, is the kingdom of Heaven, for which Jesus set people praying. It is the Sabbath that remaineth for the people of God, wherein the daily bread of its subjects, was to be as sure as was the manna in the wilderness. All could gather it, and he who will work can eat in this Sabbath of the Lord. The Jewish Sabbath fed the poor cne day in seven ; one month in seven ; one year in seven ; and in the Jubilees gave them the land; but the pentecosta' church gave the poor the land from the beginning, the same as the Shakers do now, in perpetual possession, thus swallowing up all types as short time Sabbaths in a Jubilee of Jubilees, the true Sabbath of the Lord.'—Selected by J. 8.
