Deaths. Lesette Walker Lesette Walker, at North Union, O., Center Family, Sept. 19, 1888. Age 56 yrs. She had lived with Believers thirty eight years.

Died at New Gloucester, Me., Sept. 22nd. 1888, in the United Society of Shakers, Hester Ann Adams, aged 71 years and 6 months. Sister Adams was born in Durham, N. H., and when eight years old she, with her only brother, went to live with the family of Shakers at Canterbury, N. H. She embraced their faith in early life, and in 1843 was appointed to the order of the ministry, which office she filled with great acceptance until 1859, when she was transferred and chosen one of the first ministers over the Societies of Alfred and New Gloucester. She was a woman of great activity and industry, faithfully performing her whole duty, adorning the station to which she had been chosen, and by her Christian walk and conversation, pleasant and genial manners, won the love and esteem of all who knew her.�Z. K. H. in Eastern Argus. Simon Tuttle Atherton At Harvard, Simon Tuttle Atherton died Oct. 1st. of heart failure; aged eighty-five years, four months and twelve days. He has lived in the Society eighty years. In 1833 he was appointed one of the trustees. In 1847 he became Senior trustee, in which office he spent the remainder of his life. Even at his advanced age the Society sustains an irreparable loss. His diligence in business cannot be excelled and has few equals. His integrity bears not the taint of suspicion. Punctuality was prominent among his many virtues. It was no fault of his if all accounts were not cancelled in due time. Some one has said, 'In the open hand of death we have only what we gave, what we keep we lose.' Then his wealth must be great who gave all he had�a whole long and arduous life for the common good. In storms and adversities he was oak and rock never faltering in duty. Duty was the dial on which he measured time. Now that the duties of life have all heen well done, and the sun touches the western horizon, and lengthening shadows slant towards the east, then surrounded by friends the harvester comes with a strain of music. So much departed worth is felt by a large circle of acquaintances whose memory they cherish with respect. Betsey Sneeden Betsey Sneeden, at Hancock, Mass., East Family, Oct. 11, 1888. Age 89 years and 10 mo. She lived in this Society 66 years.
