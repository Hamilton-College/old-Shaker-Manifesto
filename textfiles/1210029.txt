SALT POINT PEACE CONTENTION F. W. EVANS . This Convention was attended by u delegation of Eleven Brethren and Sisters of the North Family, Mt Lebanon, N. Y.. on the 28th and 27th August, 1882. Owing to rain, the meetings were not so largely attended as usual, but there was a goodly gathering and a liberal supply of speakers, of both sexes. The following was presented by the, Shaker Company. PREAMBLE. In as much as the Nine Millions of Soldiers, said to bo now under arms in the various nations of Christendom, are, in ninly nine cases out of one hundred, landless men, having no home, no inheritance in the earth, no vine or fig-tree to sit under, and that all wars end with a ''material guarantee,' the victors taking possession of the land of the conquered nation. Resolved. That our Representatives in the Empire State of N. Y. he requested to cause, if it be possible, the following Land Limitation Law to be passed. Be it Enacted;â€”That from and after the year 1882, no citizen, or person shall inherit, buy, or become permanently possessed of more than one hundred and sixty acres of land. Heirs of land monopolists, may take possession of lands falling to them: but shall, within one year thereafter, sell, or otherwise dispose of the same, down to the legal limits of l(!0 acres. Were there no landless, homeless people, whence would come the material for Armies and Navies ? In the New Earth. 1st. Let Women become Citizens, that we may have a true Republic. 2nd. Let every Citizen have an inalienable Homestead. 3rd. Should Europe send soldiers to fight Americans, give each soldier one hundred and sixty acre lot of land. For, as a carpenter, or blacksmith works for wages, for a living, so is it with the landless soldiers, they fight for a living. Give them the living, without the fighting, and they will cease to be Soldiers. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
