CROWN AND CROSS G. A. Lomas Unison. Moderato. 1. There's a crown and Oh how beautiful Are those above who wear it; 2. Time and change can never separate The bearer from the wearer, 3. Gospel blessings we'll enumerate, And praise the Lord of glory, There's a cross and Oh how beautiful Are those who daily bear it; Heav'nly graces here we cultivate Adorn the rightful sharer, Who in fullness doth remunerate To all who're meek and lowly, Bear the cross wear the crown, Saving cross and Bear the cross wear the crown, Saving cross and Bear the cross wear the crown, Saving cross and Savior's crown. Savior's crown. Savior's crown. 07w. Forte Allegretto. Salvation is our theme, Salvation is our song, Salvation is our theme, Salvation is our song, Salvation is our theme, Salvation is our song, THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. 119 Salvation we will shout, As we triumph over wrong, Salvation we will shout, As we triumph over wrong, Salvation we will shout, As we triumph over wrong, Mezzo Moderato. And while we bear the cross, There's a heav'nly crown in view, The glorious prize is ours, None can ever take a way,— Rememb'ring that the cross, Will in sure a glorious crown,— Salvation we will sing As we bid the world adieu. Salvation we will sing As we rise to endless day. Salvation we will sing As we lay our own lives down.
