North Family Dec. 1896. Our proud old earth has successfully wheeled itself through the zodiacal signs of 1896 and does not seem to be discouraged at beginning another round. Some say that we live on the outside of it, some that we live on the inside, and some that there is no such thing as matter at all. However true or false these may be, the fact that we are here is self-evident. The work of seed-time and harvest has been faithfully performed by willing hands, and the husbandman may well look with satisfaction on the year's rich store and thank God for the golden fruits, the early and the latter rain. Our apple crop has been enormous; 3,000 bushels of choice pickt fruit, besides hundreds of bushels of windfalls. Labor on the farm, in the shop and barn is progressing along the lines of the Brethrens' necessity, and the Sisters are doing their best to keep the house in order according to sisterly devotion. 12 THE MANIFESTO. On the evening of Dec. 4th we had a magnificent Auioral display; at first the sky grew dull and gray, then a pink glow spread over it from which issued an army of emerald flames which heaved and trembled for a moment like frightened ghosts, then marcht majestically across the sky to make room for others. At their approach the very stars turned pale with surprise at so grand a phenomenon. That the Editor, and all the dear ones of the faith in New Hampshire and everywhere that our Communal homes are establisht may have a prosperous and a happy New Year, is the wish of all the members of our household, sent to you on the wires of love and union.
