Dear Sister S:—You always have such a smile on... Mt. Lebanon; Dee. 12, 1882. Dear Sister S:—You always have such a smile on your face I love you xery much, and as we were writing today I asked Sister E. if I might write to you. I do not love winter it is so cold, and I have to stay in the house so much ; and I cannot tell you of anything which seems so really nice as what we enjoyed last summer, when Sister Ann Maria took us into the grove and then to the graveyard. The first I noticed was dear Eldrcss Polly's grave. I gathered some, pretty flowers and put them'on it, and after awhile we went back to the orchard and had some candy and fruit to eat, when our good times were ended out doors. Eldress Polly brought me here to live with believers and I would love to visit her grave every day and put flowers all over it. I hope to be good enough to see her when I die for I did love her so much. I could say many things to you if it was as easy to write as it is to talk, but Good bye. Emeline,—Age, 11.
