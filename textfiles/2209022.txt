Alfred, Me. Aug. 12. 1892. Beloved Elder Henry:No wonder the fear of a hotter climate should have proved a means of grace with so many in past ages. After experiencing the hot nights, and hotter days of July and Aug. one might well dread a more torrid location. The weather has proved favorable for curing hay, and now that the rains have come, corn and potatoes will be glad. Our ensilage corn, of which we have ten acres is already eight feet in the air, and like the youth whose motto was Excelsior, is still climbing. Potatoes planted on sandy soil, the rain came too late to save, but unless the excessive rain and heat shall cause decay we shall have a good crop. Upland hay fell off 35 per cent. If, as some claim, sickness is caused by sin,(Whose sin?) I fear we are not as good as we hoped we were. A kind of epidemic much like whooping-cough visited us some weeks ago and is inclined to remain much longer than it is welcome. We would call it whooping-cough except that those who should be exempt from that disease have to share with the rest. We are expecting some visitors from Harvard, the last of the month. Hope by that time the unwelcome visitor will have left us. We are striving to keep the gospel in its purity and simplicity. F. C.
