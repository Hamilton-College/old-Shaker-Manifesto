HOLD UP YOUR HEAD LIKE A MAN If the stormy winds should rustle While you tread the world's highway Still against them bravely tussle, Hope and labor day by day. Falter not, no matter whether There is sunshine, storm or calm, And in every kind of weather, Hold your head up like a man. If a brother should deceive you, And should act a traitor's part, Never let. his treason grieve you Jog along with lightsome heart ! Fortune seldom follows fawning, Boldness is the only plan, Hoping for a better dawning, Hold your head up like a man. Earth, though e'er so rich and mellow, Fields not for the worthless drone, But the bold and honest fellow, He can shift and stand alone ; Spurn the knave of every nation, Always do the best you can, And no matter what your station, Hold your head up like a man.
