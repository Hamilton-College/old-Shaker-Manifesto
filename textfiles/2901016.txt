South Family Dec. 1898. The last days of the Old Year are fast approaching and soon we must say our hurried good-byes and pass on to welcome the New Year with its blizzards and showers, its sunshine and flowers. Ofttimes with a flood or a drouth, but we'll welcome it here the happy New Year that smiles on the north and the south. The first snow-storm of the season came this way Thanksgiving morning like a silent benediction, frequent showers of snow have fallen since and many merry sleighing parties have improved the snowy op- portunity for making 'music in the air.' The skaters too have gone on their wintry travels around the ponds spending many mirthful hours in the healthful pastime, thus each rising son becomes a Knight of the Skate and the ice. We are busy indoors repairing and preparing for the spring-time, for 'old things must pass away and all things must become new.' We've no time to lose, for we must work while it is day and faithful be to watch and pray. Eepresentatives from the Granite State have added much to the brightness of the fall. Nov. 15th Eldress Emeline Hart of East Canterbury and Eldress Kosetta Cummings of Enfield honored us with their presence for a few hours. Our doors will ever stand ajar for their return when the good time comes. Genevieve DeGraw
