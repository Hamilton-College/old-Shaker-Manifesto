FUNERAL OF ELDER PETER LONG. The Groveland society of Shakers is located three and one-half miles from Mt. Morris, about the head of the Genesee valley. Their lands comprise about eighteen liundred acres, their buildings are substantial and numerous and situated from an abrupt rise from the Cashequa, commanding a fine view of the valley and the eastward slopes of the Grovelan�l and Sparta hills. It was on the last day of the past year that this society met in the commodious brick building, in an inner room, 50xG0, where they 'were wont to gather each Sabbath afternoon for conference meetings, to pay the last tribute of respect and love to their departed friend, Elder Peter Long, who for a quarter of a century had given the best years of his life for their success and prosperity. The occasion was one of deep interest, the funeral obsequies impressive and appropriate'. A large gathering of the neighbors about and others from localities near were also there to attest their respect and admiration for the yenerable dead. The ' Brethren and Sisters ' sat opposite each other near the center of the room. No emblems of mourning appeared. Brother Alexander opened the meeting by a few remarks. Elder Giles, from the Parent Society of New Lebanon, was present and made a very touching and pertinent address, followed by many of the ' brethren and sisters, ' each giving their earnest testimony of the kindness and love that the dear brother had always manifested to them. They feelingly recalled his genial smiles, his warm greetings, his benign countenance and above all his earnest and unflinching attachment to the faith and doctrines of their society, for which nearly his whole life had been devoted. One or two tributes were read. Several hymns were sung (the 'brethren and sisters' rising) very expressive and in harmony with the occasion. After the solemn services, all passed out into another room and viewed the remains of the time-honored dead, then eight of the young brethren bore him to his resting place, the spot selected during his lifetime, just in the rear of the house of worship, between two rows of evergreens, a quiet, secluded nook, suggestive of the ways and manners of the worthy dead. The occasion will not soon be forgotten by the many who were present. Its simplicity was impressive and touching� a pleasing contrast to the pomp and ceremony often exhibited at the burial of the dead. Elder Peter, as he was familiarly called, was widely known in the Genesee valley and highly esteemed for his strict integrity, unpretending and courteous manners and his many virtues : by his death the Shakers lose a true and devoted friend. S. Mt. Morris, January. 1880.
