A CAPITAL PRESCRIPTION. A rather eccentric, yet eminent physician, was called upon to attend a middle aged rich lady who had imaginary ills, t fter many wise inquiries about her symptoms and manner of life, he asked for a piece of paper ^and wrote down the following prescription: ' Do something for somebody.' In the gravest manner he handed it to the patient and left. The doctor heard nothing from the lady for a long time. One Christmas morning he was hastily summoned to the cottage of his Irish washerwoman. ' It's not meself, doctor, it's me wrist that's ailing. Ye sfee, I was after goin' out into the black darkness for a few bits of wood, whenmejfut struck this basket. It stood there like a big mercy, as it was, full of soft flannel from Mrs. Walker. She told me that your medicine cured her, doctor. So, if you plaz to put a little of that same on my wrist, I'll be none the worse for my nice present.' , ' ' It's a powerful remedy,' said the doctor, gravely. And more than once in after years he wrote the prescription: 'Do something for somebody.' [From the Boston Herald.]
