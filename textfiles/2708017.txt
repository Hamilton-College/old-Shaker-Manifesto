'Blood being made from the assimilation of food... 'Blood being made from the assimilation of food, it is, therefore, to food itself we must primarily look for the origin of these earthly deposits. Besides providing the requisite elements of nutrition, food contains calcareous salts, which, upon being deposited in the arteries, veins and capillaries become the approximate cause of ossification and old age.' 'The action of distilled water as a beverage is briefly as follows: First, its absorption into the blood is rapid; second, it keeps soluble those salts already existing in the blood, thereby precluding their undue deposit; third, it facilitates in a markt degree their elimination by means of excretion. After middle life a daily use of distilled water is highly beneficial to those desirous of retarding old age, and it is also a useful adjunct for averting stone in the bladder and kidneys.' Distilled water, diluted phosphoric acid, glycerine and some of the aromatics constitute a most delicious drinkï¿½a very nectar. And this nectar, drank freely, tends to remove calcareous deposits, thus prolonging human life. Temple of Health.
