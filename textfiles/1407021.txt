Letter Box Dear Children;-'Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies... Enfield, Conn. 1884. Dear Children;-'Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies.' Sin brings death the inevitable consequences. Sin is often not half subdued when you think it entirely so. Don't parley with sin. ' Give the adversary an inch, and he will take a mile. ' Yield to one of his wishes, and you may yield to all. ' If you do not wish to travel to the end of the ' broad road, ' shun it entirely. Once on the way, it is hard to stop. ' Be wise in time. Deny the first temptation, and you can more easily resist subsequent ones. 'Nothing torments like sin. ' One sin leads to two, two lead to three, and so on, until they are past counting. One sin, if not erased, will deprive you of real happiness. No sins are small. Sins that seem small, are monsters, that deceive and destroy. Living in sin, blights the soul. Break from sinful habits now. Sin promises joys, but pays sorrows. Remember this truth. Sin grows fast. Subdue it thoroughly, or it will make bad work. It don't pay to sow ' tares.' ' Sin don't make saints. ' It is dangerous to commence a life of sin. ' Gird on the heavenly armor, ' and keep it on. War against sinful proclivities, with ceaseless vigilance. Fighting the rank weeds of vice, is time well spent. 'How low sin plunges its slaves ! ' Give up sin, or give up hope of heaven. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
