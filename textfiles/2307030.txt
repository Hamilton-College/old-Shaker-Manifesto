KIPLING in the PULPIT. There are probably not many ministers, says an exchange, who have quoted Rudyard Kipling's verses in the pulpit. This was done, however, on a recent Sunday morning by Dr. Clifford, of London. Speaking of the responsibility of the individual soul for its own output, and the danger of indulging in spiritual sal volatile when there is urgent work to be done, the Doctor quoted several verses from 'Tomlinson,' including the lines: And they came to the gate within the wall, where Peter holds the keys. Stand up, stand up now, Tomlinson, and answer loud and high The good that ye did for the sake of men ere ever ye came to die� The good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone! And the naked soul of Tomlinson grew white as a rain-washed bone. 'This 1 have read in a book,' he said, 'and that was told to me, And this I have thought that another man thought of a Prince in Muscovy'� And Peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath. 'Ye have read, ye have heard, ye have [run: thought,' he said, 'and the tale is yet to By the worth of the body that once ye had, give answer�what ha' ye done?' �Christian Union.
