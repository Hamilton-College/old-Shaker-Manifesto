THE ILLUSTRATED SCIENTIFIC NEWS One of the handsomest of publications is the Illustrated Scientific News, published by Munn &amp; Co., New York. Every number contains thirty-two pages, full of engravings of novelties in science and the useful arts. Ornamental wood-work, pottery, vases and objects of modern and ancient art are finely shown. The March number contains, among various other subjects illustrated, a full description of the manufacture of paper hangings, with engravings; how the deceptive curve is produced in casting the ball by the baseball pitcher, his attitude, how he holds and handles the ball, all fully illustrated. The number before us also contains engravings of Captain Eads' proposed ship railway across the isthmus, and a novel hydraulic railway locomotive. In addition to all this, it contains many valuable recipes for artisans and housekeepers.
