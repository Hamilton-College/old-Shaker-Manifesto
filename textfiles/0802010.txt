INNOCENCE. E. Innocence! a brighter pearl Than ever Monarchs wore; A treasure for surpassing The earth's most valued ore. I'd not exchange thy beauty For purple robes or gold, To wield a kingly sceptre Or his vast riches hold. When done with transient glories These all must be resignedt The soul will be divested The tenement consigned; But innocence and purity Retained, will sit enthroned Forever, throughout agesâ€” A living virtue crowned. Canterbury, N. H.
