SPEAK LORD TO ME Annie E. Stephens. Speak, Lord to me and show Thy law divine; My inner soul would know Thy will, not mine. The carnal mind may shun The cross, the light, Again to Thee I come, Lead me aright. O, send Thy chastening grace And holy fire, Consume each darkened trace Of sin's desire. Serenely I will stand In armor bright, With sword of truth in hand, Defend the right. Speak, Lord, Thy words repeat, Give life, to-day; Thy whispering voice so sweet I will obey. Though lingering shadows fall Across time's vale, If Christ is all in all Strength will prevail, Oh, when I walk in hope And heavens' light, In doubt I need not grope, In error's night; Perfect Thy grace in me Thy power and life, And make me one in Thee, Through holy strife. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
