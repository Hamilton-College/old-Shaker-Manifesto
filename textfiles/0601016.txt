LIGHT MARIA WITHAM As gentle flowers inhale the dew, So thirsts my soul for light; Each day supplies my wants anew, While e'er I walk aright. And in Christ's gospel there is power To set my spirit free; Its light will lead me, every hour, 'Nearer, my God to thee! ' It fills me with that perfect peace â€” Gives me a lowly mind; By it, I learned that sovereign grace, My soul sought long to find.
