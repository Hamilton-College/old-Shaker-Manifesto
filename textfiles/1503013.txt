SPEAK NO ILL. MARY ANN CASE. We do a great wrong if we allow ourselves or others to fall into the habit of fault finding. Yet how liable we are to fall into this habit. The Gospel, however, is a home work. The tongue is a very unruly member but let us bring it into subjection. It is very pleasant for us to live harmoniously together to speak a kind word to our companions or to meet them with the blessing of God's love. We should look on the bright side and not allow ourselves because a brother or sifter makes a mistake to speak of it and thus magnify into a sin or fault that which was perhaps an oversight or misunderstanding. This would show a great lack of the beautiful Christian virtue of Charity and a need of home work. Let us watch well our own garden, destroy all the noxious weeds that would choke the flowers of peace that would brighten our journey through life. If we strive to live rightly, laboring to correct our own errors we shall see more clearly the good in those with whom we associate, and let us remember the wise adage, ' If we cannot speak well of others it were better not to speak at all. ' If another halt or stumble, Be not thine the lips: to chide; Or with scornful look, or accent. Spread the failing far and wide. llather try to aid, and strengthen. With kind word and helping hand, Till the wavering, halting, footsteps On a sure foundation stand. If thy sister weak and wayward, From the path of duty stray; Seek not thou with pointing finger All her weakness to betray. For while thou art idly telling All her faults and errors o'er, She in deep contrition, bowing, These same errors may deplore. If in sin and deep transgression, Thou shouldst see thy brother fall: Be not thine the censuring outcry, That shall all attention call. But 'neath Charity's broad mantle, Strive the wrong and sin to hide : And with earnestjkind entreaty, Back to right thy brother guide. And if thou art ever tempted, 111 to speak of those who've erred ; May the still, small voice of .conscience, Deep within thylheart be heard,ï¿½ Bidding thee, correct thy failing, Pluck the beam from thine own eye. Then, perchance, another's errors, Thou wilt in charity pass by. Watervliet, N. Y.
