TRUE HONOR. [Contributed by Sophia Wayne.] Since the theory of justification by combat has been exploded, there seems to be no way in which a gentleman can be sure of keeping his sacred honor free from specks except by plain, ordinary, decent behavior, and respect for the rights of other people, says a writer in Scribner'1 s. If he does wrong he can not fight his way right. He simply has to repent and apologize, or take his punishment quietly, according to the rules of the game. If he was injured, and the law can not help him, the best way for him is just to grin and bear it, and let time wreak its own revenges. To be sure, if the injury is desperate, and he resents it in hot blood, the law may excuse him; but society has come to a point of sophistication where it is able to recognize that the man who endures is usually a stronger and a nobler creature than the man who gives reins to his temper. The notion that one's 'honor' can be damaged by the action of another person is pretty generally obsolete. Brag is not so good a dog as he was. Bluff will not go so far. The code that regu lates in these days the manners of the highest and most influential type of American gentlemen is actually to be found in the New Testament.
