Trust in God BY E. T. LEGGETT When clouds obscure the land, Should we in darkness roam; Oh ! Lord extend thy hand, And kindly lead us home. We give our liearts to thee ; We would be wholly thine, Thy grace will make us free, Thy love will make divine. Whate'er is needful here, We know that thou wilt give; And be thou ever near, For only then we live. The only wealth we have, Is treasured up above; The only wealth we crave, Is thy approving love. Earth has on us no claim; We've severed every tie; Home, fortune, friends and fame, We've bid them all good-bye. Thou art, Oh God, our all; WTe ask for nothing more, Let good or ill befall, Thy name we'll still adore. Be thon our Father, Friend, As we thy children arc; AVhen weak, thy blessing send', When wrong, in mercy spare. Though ill then oft betide, And friendship still betray, Well in thy faith abide, And keep thy Living way.
