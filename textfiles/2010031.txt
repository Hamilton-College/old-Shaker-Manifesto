TRUST. Agnes Retzlaff. We should trust God for everything. Trust brings joy and peace and God is with them that trust Him. What a beautiful promise this is and what a comfort to us when we are in trouble, we are safe if we only have trust and faith in God. He cares for us all and loves us more than our earthly parents love us. 'Behold the fowls of the air they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns yet our Heavenly Father feedeth them' we certainly are greater than they. Our kind Father is able and willing to supply our needs if we only ask, then if He thinks best, He will give us what we ask. 'His wisdom can make no mistakes.' But to have God help us, we must try to do our part, we must obey his commandments and we must praise Him and tell others about Him and if we want God to love us we must love Him, if we do this He will not forsake us even if we do wrong, then we should ask his forgiveness and try to do better. King David did wrong but God forgave him when he asked. Temptation is wry strong and we have to keep very close watch of ourselves to keep out of the way of it; even Christ was tempted but he did not yield he had trust in God his Father. It should be our labor to follow his example and then we will have our reward in heaven. Hancock, Mass.
