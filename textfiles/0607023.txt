READING SEALED LETTERS There is so much of humbug connected with modern spiritualism, that we cannot censure any for being wary concerning it. But what can we think of the following ? When Elder Evans and company were in New York, holding a series of meetings, they called, by invitation, upon Dr. J. V. Mansfield, 361 Sixth avenue, New York. The various tests made by them, and as narrated to us by Eldress A. Doolittle, were simply, yet pleasantly astounding. We wrote the doctor that we wanted to make an honorable, but very severe, test. The challenge was invitingly accepted. A noble friend of ours wrote the letter (or we supposed he did) upon paper glazed with blue on the outer side. Especial pains were taken in folding up every line, sealing the same, before writing another line, and fastening the ends with the utmost care and glue. I took the letter, sealed it in a double envelope, making every necessaiy private mark to prevent exposure possible without my knowledge, and sent it. To my own and friend's surprise, the sealed letter was returned undisturbed, with an answer for his wife, who, unknown to me, had addresxed her spirit mother! The answer made references to matters known only to my friend's private family. If Elder H. L. Eades will logically explain how this is done, we will next ask him to satisfy us by elucidating the materializations mentioned in the first fourteen verses of Ezekiel, chapter 37.
