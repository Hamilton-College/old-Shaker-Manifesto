Of the word 'CLOUDS' in Scripture. GILES B. AVERY. 'Behold he cometh with clouds' meaning in a cloud of witnesses. 'Wherefore, seeing we, also, are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience, the race that is set before us, Heb. xii., 1. The Apostle Peter speaking of persons 'who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government 'says, ' These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest, to whom the mist ot darkness is reserved forever ' 2 Peter, ii., 17. The Sodomites were spoken of by Jude as ' Clouds they are, without water, carried about of winds ; trees whose fruit withereth without fruit, twice dead; plucked up by the roots. ' Jude 12th. This word is a Hebraism, and used to denote witnesses, or, media of representation, in this sense, when applied to the coming of Christ, it is in the same sense in which we use the word 'staff' when speaking of the sub-officers of the General of any army. CONQUEST, hew far powerful. Individuals, no more than nations, cannot thrive by mere conquest; that is, power over other souls. There must be progress in the bosom of the Church, also, or, she cannot thrive. Religion, to thoroughly permeate life, must be domestic. Like the patriotic fire which makes a nation invincible, it never burns with inextinguishable devotion until it burns at the home hearth. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
