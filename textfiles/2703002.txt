IN MEMORIUM. By Nancy Clark. They say that Sister Emily is dead, That to the bright galaxy of earth's departed saints, Her stainless soul has fled. And tho the saddening news gives bitter pain, We feel our loss to be her well establisht gain, For none with worthier zeal from day to day Has borne the duties of our self-denying way. With willing hands and meek obedient will In humbleness of heart, she sought Her mission here to fill, Nor paused to murmur by the way But faithfully performed the work appointed for the day. Nor did she stoop to pain's overmastering power But met with fortitude the last, soul-trying hourConscious of having left no work undone She met death's chilling tide With strong unshaken faith In Christ her counselor and guide. Through pastures green and by faith's tranquil stream She walked with him from earthly ways aside. And when the dark, dark vale she came to tread She leaned upon his staff and knew no cringing dread. No more her lithesome form shall greet our eye, No more her cheery voice fall on our ear, But when the evening's soft gray curtain drops about the earth Her hallowed soul will hover near And by its shadowy presence give sustaining power To those whose strength to bear is waning; And by that strength we'll from the ashes rise And bear our burdens uncomplaining.
