RENEWAL. Catherine Allen. I seek communion blest, through silent breathing prayer, With ministers of life who oft draw nigh; And as I turn from scenes of outward sense and care, I feel their inspiration from on high. They quicken unto zeal,ï¿½they come with conquering might, From thrall of error's chains to bring release; Thro' strife of elements betwixt the wrong and right, They bear the prophecy of rich increase. They bring a chastening power, repentance deep and A gif; for Zion's children far and near; [true, To cleanse her courts from sin, and covenants renew, Her sacred laws and statutes to revere. They will revive the flames of holy altar fires, Where souls sincere to God their.offerings bring; And find the blessed power that wakens new desires To live for truth, and to its precepts cling. Then Zion's broken walls rebuilt shall firmly be, By aouls who willingly he: principles maintain; One faith and one baptism, one Lord they all shall see, And heart to heart bo linked in Union's golden chain. To Faith's clairvoyant eye, the future seemeth bright, Though shadows now may Israel's glory dim ; More radiantly shall glow true Revelation's light, Than did Shekinah over Cherubim. And all those sacred gifts shall more than be restored, That once have rested on the Lord's household, When over multitudes his Spirit shall be poured, As prophecy declared in days of old. Then cold philosophies, and husks of earthly lore, No more the hungi-y mind shall seek as food; For ' hid with Christ in God,' is wisdom's boundless store, And those who there abide find every good. Ideals grand in truth, as pictures shall adorn The chambers of the soul from sin made free; No glittering dust of earth with raiment shall be worn, But gems whose light can never tarnished be. Jerusalem shall stand a temple purified, [stream; And 'neath her threshold roll a deep unfailing Whose coursings beautiful, extending far and wide, To vernal heritage shall desert wastes redeem. Pure Inspiration's gift shall light her sacred dome, Her oracles of truth go forth o'er earth, And many souls shall find in Christ a lasting home, And know the holy joys of angel birth. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
