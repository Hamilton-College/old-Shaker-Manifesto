THE CHRISTIAN KINGDOM SOCIETY. [The following was received from a friend who resides in London Eng. Ed.] At a time of so much angry feeling, selfishness and self-seeking, we desire to bring together earnest people of all classes, who wish to set the promotion of God's Kingdom of righteousness, peace, and love, above all selfish considerations of party, sect, or personal convenience. We are not in any sense a sect: we do not enter into theological discussions, or hold religious services, or interfere in any way with the work of the Churches. We are an Ethical Society founded on a Christian basis, and having for its only condition of membership 'an endeavor, in all things, to render faithful obedience to the spirit of Christ.' We are a League of Justice and Love, inspired by a longing for higher spiritual life ; we hope to become a Universal Bkotherhoodï¿½conscious children of one Father, and servants of one Master who was willing to become Servant of all. 680 men and women have joined the Society since its formation in March, 1886, all of whom have come in without argument or discussion, attracted solely by the soundness and simplicity of its cne rule. We believe that 10,000 earnest people, with their hearts firmly fixed upon righteousness, working quietly and patiently in their various circles, and availing themselves of ail opportunities of promoting human righteousness and human happiness, would soon work a moral reformation in the land. Should the Society take root in other countries, it might serve as a connecting link between nations, as well as between Societies and Churches, and thus be the means of fostering healthier and kindlier feelings among people of all kindreds, nations, and tongues. While affording many opportunities to our members for co-operating with each other, we allow to all the fullest freedom, so long as they use not their liberty unworthily, but as servants of Christ. All that is done among us is done spontaneously, and without persuasion. The Society is called 'The Christian Kingdom Society.' The name 'Kingdom' is used because it suggests the idea of 'obedience to law,' rather than that of 'uniformity of opinion,' and because it was the term almost invariably used by Christ, whose mission was to establish God's Kingdom of heaven upon earth. We make no additional demands on the time or energy of those who are alre dy working in the Kingdom of God, but the fact of such workers accepting membership among us will strengthen the hands, rejoice the hearts and revive the spirits of many. Membership of the Society does not in any way increase our responsibility or the claims of Christian brotherhood, but it tends to force them in upon our attention, and it is hoped it will enable us by mutual encouragement, suggestion, and assistance to discharge them better. Our organization is simple, but hitherto it has worked well. We have no public meetings or lecturers : we rely upon the individual efforts of all our members. We hope, therefore, that those who hear of the Society will pass on the message to friends and acquaintance, and do what they can to influence others in daily life. We make no personal appeal for funds, but all contributions will be thankfully received by the Treasurer, Mr. Edmund Waller, Harrow Eoad Branch of London and County Bank, and all receipts are signed by Treasurer and Secretary. Should you feel in sympathy with us, we hope you will not hesitate to communicate with the Secretary, or with some member of the Committee. What the age needs most of all is not more light, or more lecturers, but more resoluteness in our efforts to be loyal to the light and knowledge we possess. Leaflets will be forwarded to any who desire fuller information. ALEX. H. SMITH, M. A., Secretary. 20 St. Bride Street, E. C. London, Eng.
