Mt. Lebanon, August 21,1875 W. C. Clakk — Esteemed Friend : Your important communication of the 16th instant is at hand. The Papers also received. Of course, the first question that arises is, Who is W. C. Clark ? as I am as unknowing of you as you are of me. To sit, at intervals for thirty days is a long time. A young married couple would be objectionable, if living in 'youthful lusts that war against the soul.' We are of the Resurrection Order. Any Spirit, in or out of the body, who sustains not this Order, if presuming or assuming to teach us, we will, without hesitation, reject. We do not believe every spirit. They must be tried. See 1st John, 4-1. I do believe in the Law of Materialization, and that it will be developed among the Shakers. I also believe, that in the world, it will be used as a medium through which many, who marry, will be brought to a practical knowledge of the True Order of Nature— Sexual commerce for offspring only. And to a knowledge of true Celibate Order for those who are called into the Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth — the Shaker System. I see nothing practically objectionable, except the marriage of the mediums, which may be a trap, or snare, to preach marriage to the Shakers, by authority of Spirits. If that be the covert design, we want nothing to do with it. We do not live as we do, because Ann Lee did so live, nor would we change, should she be materialized and come among us to subvert the doctrine of the Holy Celibate Life and Order that she established. You are very welcome to visit us, and when you come, we will do as we feel guided by the Spirit of Truth. F. W. Mans
