Narcoossee, Fla. Nov. 1898. There is nothing more discreditable to the southern agriculture than the slow neglect of cultivating some of the different grasses, and stop the large importation from the north. It is a common thing to hear this argument,'The grasses of the tropics grow wide apart and are coarse, while those of the north are fine and sweet. They are far more nutritious and better for animal food.' But why should this justify the neglect when many of the northern farmers, even of our nation, are trying some of the northern grasses, and thus far give good testimony as to their growth here in the sunny south. Our own experience has taught that Crab Grass can be grown to profit when rightly cared for and cured. That our animals will eat it with willingness as they would eat the fine Timothy grass. Crab Grass is the natural grass of this state. Grass culture has always been the index of progressive agriculture in newly settled countries. The first aim of the farmer, always has been, in our northern states, to make good feeding grounds for the animals. This has been a total neglect on the part of our southern farmers with their great plains and prairies as they have depended on the wild grass that nature has given them. Thus we see the cause of the inferior breed of cattle that has filled the state. But northern people who are now looking to the sunny south for a home in old age, and know the value of a northern acre of grass, are making a gradual change, to prove to our southern friends that certain northern grasses will flourish here as well as in the north. Slavery rendered cotton and orange growing general and almost exclusive, because of the limited capacity of the negro race. Most every improvement had been neglected until the freeze of 189495, which was an experience unknown to this generation, and in fact without a parallel in the history of the state. The farmers seemed dazed and knew not what course to pursue. Destruction and ruin stared them in the face. These people, however, did not give up to despair. Not depending wholly on fruit culture, they entered largely into the raising of vegetables, which is proving of untold wealth to. the country. We now see car loads of vegetables as well as of fruit, pass out of the state. Andrew Barrett.
