East Canterbury, N. H. Sept. 1897. The measure of life seems to be largely filled with hopes and fears. A part of this may be on the religious side and a part quite its equal on the side of the mere animal nature. When we bear in mind that the righteous man shall receive the righteous man's reward we have through hope, an anticipation of a satisfactory reward, and for a season go on our way rejoicing. Trials and crosses which are sure to come, change the whole order of our being, and then we bear in mind that 'nothing that defiles or makes a lie' can enter into: the Holy City; and we wonder what will become of us in that day of reckoning. If we are so lucky as to get 'wholly saved' as some of the Christian friends express it, then we can laugh at all trials and rejoice in the midst of every burden. As the season moves along, the usual changes take place, and already the singing birds have past to warmer climes. Scarcely a bird is to be seen on the premises. A growing anxiety is felt in regard to the apple and potato crops. Both will be very light. Pears are plenty, and many of these may be kept for winter use. The Sisters who went from home to sell 'Fancy Goods' have all returned. As a whole the sales have been very satisfactory, and a markt kindness extended to them in all places. By invitation, the 'Qui Vive' Quartet are on a visit to the ' 'Poland Spring House'' and will also visit the Believers at New Gloucester. Henry C. Blinn.
