LOVE AND ORDER EMELINE BROADWAY Love and order are requisite to promote happiness and to sustain a pure life. Love, unlike passion, produces the fruits of peace, and causes individuals to make large sacrifice of selfish enjoyments, to increase the happiness and comfort of others. The higher spirits in admonishing their charge, gave this precautionâ€”'while cultivating love and good will for each other, beware that you do not foster that which is worse than hate.' If we live and love so as to affect each other for good, then are we Christians in truth. Passion has often been permitted to usurp the name of love, but has ever failed to represent the true character of this godly element. True love is known by its heavenly characteristics, of kindness and constancy, while order unlocks the entrance to the superior harmonies of the Angel life. The necessity of order and regularity to both temporal prosperity and spiritual advancement, is an eternal, unchanging truth. We might as well expect to catch showers from the sky, with vessels bottom upward, as to receive the blessings of divine inspiration from the spirit world, in disorderly and inharmonious conditions. There is no salvation outside the first law of heaven ; the law which sustains and pervades the universe, preserves the individuality of all its parts, and their proper relation to each other. Let us keep our vessels clean, and right side up, that we may receive of the waters of life, and as we receive, freely give. Union Village, O.
