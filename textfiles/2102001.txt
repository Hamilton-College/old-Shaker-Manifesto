THE PRESENT. Catherine Allen. We live in a wonderful age of inventive progress, when the most subtle forces of nature are being utilized in the service of man; and when we contrast our time with even the middle of the present century, in the marvelous labor-saving machinery,�in the means and speed of conveyance by sea and land, and in the communication of thought, silent and verbal, we stand with bated breath and ask� what of the soul? Is not man's religious nature progressive? While the intellect expands, shall the spiritual faculties remain dwarfed ? Shall that inspiration and revelation which was sufficient in olden time, answer the soul's needs to-day ? Not so ; through his interior nature man holds communion with a higher world, and is susceptible of a continual influx of Deific influences, and humanity to-day is vibrating under the pressure of silent, yet powerful spiritual forces ; the sun of divine revelation rises higher and higher, enlarging the circle of the moral and spiritual horizon, illuminating new regions of thought, and answering to the earnest hopes and lofty aspirations of souls who have cast off as an old and outgrown garment, the narrowing creeds and blinding superstitions of the past. New phases, of spiritualism are opening, and media, in different parts of the world, are acted upon by intelligences of the Resurrection Order to spread the truths of the Virgin Church. The vital breath of religion is being infused into the philosophy of spiritualism, without which it is cold and lifeless. A new wave from spirit spheres has rolled upon the shores of earth. Never was the world of mind in such a general state of agitation. All thinking classes are in anxious expectancy of some marked changes which they are sure the near future will bring, and many are inspired to utter prophecies relative thereto. The law of cycles is being taught; educational systems, physical reforms, and other living issues are attracting ranch attention, which, when regulated and established under the rational ideas of the present day, will form a substantial basis for the manifestation of those diviner qualities in human nature, which have hitherto been stifled and checked in a large degree. While the spirit world is thus pressing, is the time for humanity to earnestly co-operate therewith, and by concentrated action push forward the wheels of progress. Invisible intelligences can only do a given part. Mortals must keep unclosed the receptive faculties of the mind. The light that shines must be absorbed in truthloving souls, and then refracted to others through the example of devoted lives guided by its revelations ; and, for the inflowing tides of spiritual power, must be prepared safe and welldirected channels, else they will roll back, leaving on our shores only wreck and desolation, instead of increase and blessing.
