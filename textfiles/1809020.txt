Oliphant's visions do not commend themselves... Oliphant's visions do not commend themselves, at all, to me. I saw too much of too many similar ones in my travels through the States. But Elder Henry, I will frankly confess that you have chronicled in the June Manifesto, a vision which has no difficulty for me, in which I read with great interest, and for which I thank you. It is the vision of Elder J. G. Russell. Such men may tell me their visions and I will accept them and wish that I might be favored as they. Those who have well done their work, as I know the good Elder has done his, such visions are true; such are the products of true religion, the fruits of it. And oh, who could wish for a happier end, to be able to feel as the dear Elder Russell feels, with the great future close before him.ï¿½His end here, his beginning there. J. H. H.
