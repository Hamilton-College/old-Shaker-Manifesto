Sonyea, N. Y. The fertile soil and genial climate of Sonyea has produced fruits rich in quality and generous in quantity; it is the land of fruit and flowers, poetry and song, and thrice blessed are they who can claim as their own, a few acres in this modern 'Garden of Eden.' The heat is intense. During a fierce thunder-storm the large barn at the West Farm was struck by lightning. Fortunately the damage was small, only a post was splintered. The absence of fire prevented the destruction of the building. Thanks to Providence that we escaped the terrible scene. G. D. G.
