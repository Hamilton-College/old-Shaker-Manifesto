'ANSWER TO HIS CRITICS.' Sept. 8, 1890. A Letter from Tolstoi, the Russian Reformer, in reply to a letter commending Tolstoi's Dear Friend and Brother, A. G. Hollister :�I thank you heartily for your letter ; I expected it. I knew that my ideas about marriage would be approved by your Community. Your books and tracts, especially 'What would become of the world if all were Shakers,' corroborated my views and helped me very much to a clear understanding of the question. I am very much astonished how a Christian cannot approve yours and my view of marriage. In Corinthians vii., it is said in so many plain words. I admire very much your explanation of the comparison of the kingdom of heaven to a net, and the conclusion that the fishes taken in the net, cannot depopulate the sea; and that if it does, it will be after the will of God, which in the form of our love for purity and chastity, is written in our hearts. I received one of your books, the Millennial Church, and thank you very much for it. But pardon me, in brotherly love and spirit I must tell you the truth : it was very painful for me to read in your letter the account of the influx of spirits from heaven and so on. It is painful for me because not only your faith (excepting Ann Lee and the manifestation of spirits,) and your practice of life as far as I know it. is a true Christian faith, corroborated by your life, and it should have attracted to you all the people who crave a true Christian life : but your peculiarities� manifestations of spirits�repel them. God's truth has been known always, in the old times, the same as now. True progress, the establishing the kingdom of God on earth consists not in producing new truths, but in sifting the truths that are known to us ; by putting aside the lies and superstitions with which they are intermingled. You have put aside a great many lies and superstitions of the external world, but I am afraid you have accepted new ones. Put them aside. Analyze them. Don't keep to beliefs only because they have been believed a long time, and are old. Put them away, and your Shaker faith, with your chaste and spiritual life, your humility, charity, and principles of moderation and manual work, will conquer the world. Please pardon me if I have offended you. I have written this only because I think and feel it, and because I love God. I try to love Him, and through Him to love you my brethren. All that you say about the time fast approaching in which the Divine light will be spread over all the world, and darkness dispelled, is quite true. I feel it, and therefore write thus to you. Yours in brotherly love, Leon Tolstoi.
