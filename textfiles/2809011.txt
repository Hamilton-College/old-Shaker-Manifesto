Enfield, N. H. August, 1898. Among friends entertained the past month, was Mrs. Chestina Hutchinson Wooster, who is engaged in the W. C. T. IT. work, and who gave us an excellent discourse upon Christian Citizenship. The Christian citizen, she said, will not only support those who preach the kingdom of God, but he will have it his duty to inaugurate that kingdom by his own daily life,by his influence,all placed in the balance against unrighteousness. There is corruption in high places. Men divorce their citizenship from their religion. Their prayer and their act conflict. They choose among evils, of two evils, sometimes the least, when they should discard both. In this holy war of righteousness against unrighteousness, we need not so much be fighters as buildersmen who live and act by a habit within, of definite convictions on the important questions the people's lives, having the courage to advocate civic righteousness and defend its cause. 'Grand, square and upright' are the characters demanded to work for God and home, who cease to be competitors and become comrades in the onward march toward grander developments of manhood and Christian duty. We also had the pleasure of again welcoming to his old home, our reverend father, Elder Abraham Perkins, of East Canterbury. As he went among the inmates of his former home, his physical sprightliness and mental activity convinced us that ninety-one years had dealt well with him, and that he had wisely kept the vigor of life that yields untold soul wealth to the faithful pilgrim. True it is, 'When each fulfills a wise design, In his own orbit he will shine.' George H. Baxter.
