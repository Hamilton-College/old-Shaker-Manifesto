NOTES 'Line upon line' was the form of expression that the good prophet used when he was illustrating the operations of the work of God among men. He had learned that it was to be, forever, a new work, a continual increase in the manifestations of power and glory. The external ceremonies in sacrifices and washings, so long used and so reverently regarded, had lost their vitality in proportion as the principle of obedience became better understood and appreciated. The rudimental lessons in religion were as necessary to be learned and as essential to those to whom they were given as were those of a more advanced order. 'Learn of me, ' said Jesus, ' Take my yoke upon you, and ye shall h'nd rest to your souls. ' A religion that helps man to work out what he preaches, that inspires him with a growing toward God and an interest in the happiness and prosperity of his brethren readily appeals to our common understanding and we soon see the necessity for its general cultivation. In this Jesus the Christ is our lovin o example. He taught that it was necessary to love and even to.pray for those whom we denominated our enemies. To do this was to do quite different from the impulse of a revengeful miud: it was the crucifixion of selfish love and a good test of Christian discipleship. Pilgrim's Talkative could discuss this point to a nicety while at the same time he 'had no special interest in making any sacrifice that would cut him from his relations with the world. 'Why what difference ' said he, ' ^ is there between crying out against and abhorring sin ? ' Talkative is not without his followers., and they are far more ready to discuss passages of scripture,, the meaning of which they never understood, than to. give heed to one of the least commandments. Such persons can make longprayers and quote largely from the prophets and Bible teachers to prove some pet hobby in their religious belief while therecord of their daily lives would prove very objectionable. Talkative had religion but it was largely of words and not of deeds. We busy ourselves, sometimes, over the trifles of life while the weightier matters we pass by carelessly. It is of but little consequence so far as uur present happiness or salvation is concerned whether Abraham was a better soldier than Melchisedec or whether Daniel's lions were men or beasts, but it is of the utmost importance that our life is one of discipline in peace and righteousness. Kindness, carefulness and neatness are in daily demand whether alone or in company. A Christian must be sadly in want of his marks of felloAvship if either of these qualities of the mind have been neglected. Religion that has its foundation in the heart will not carelessly turn from these much to be desired conditions, of the mind. Communities in which brotherly love and gospel affection are carefully cultivated, making the anxiety and burdens of others, in pleasant harmony with those of our own mind, cannot fail to encourage and establish a living interest in every gospel grace and make our home on the earth, the Paradise of God In man's; care for man, we have presented to us, at times, some remarkable instances of self-sacrifice. Down trodden humanity need an order of saviors that can preach to them the gospel of good news, and lead them from their low estates into the paths of peace a;:d righteousness. The example presented by two young men who have solicited the privilege to give their lives for the benefit of some of the lowest classes that are found in the great city, is unprecedented, heroic, and truly wonderful. They say of themselves .ï¿½ 'If we arc to reach these people, we must, first of all, live among them. It will not answer to have a home and interests elsewhere, and then to walk over to the mission chapel, and go about among the tenementhouse population three or four times a week. If we are to get close to their hearts, we must get close to their lives. If we are to do this work, we must strip like the gladiator for the fight. We must be disencumbered of every tie and interest that can hinder or embarrass us. We must be willing to be poor, to live alone, to obey a fixed rule (or regimen) of life, that so we may give ourselves wholly to this work. There was a time when our Master said, ' Carry neither purse nor scrip.' There was a time when his apostle said, ' He that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord that he may please the Lord; and again, ' Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves. ' There was a time, in a word, when, in a special exigency, men voluntarily took on them the soldier life and the soldier rule, turning their backs on home and gain and a self-directed life. It is such a time and such a.n exigency that confront us today. We do not want the help of a brotherhood to retreat from the world, merely to coddle our own selfish souls, and call it sainthood : we want a rule and bond that shall bind us to a hard task under sanctions the most august and urgent. ' Whatever efficacy there may be in religion, it is certain that the acceptance of such a ministration in Glod's name must bring its commensurate reward. Willing to live alone, willing to be poor and abstaining from the selfish pleasures of the world, the more effectually to do good. They have learned one phase of the divine Teacher's mission, so essential to their spiritual success. ' He that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.' Untrammelled by the cares of a worldly life, they have gone out to work for God. In this, they have our sympathy and earnest prayers.
