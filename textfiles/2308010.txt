To be good and to do good seems to be... To be good and to do good seems to be about the whole duty of man. It may well be called his legitimate sphere of action. To be good, whether in our own home or amang strangers, is a very essential feature in one's life. The conscience that is to be exercised for the home relations, should not be laid aside under any circumstances. Personal pleasure should always be a secondary consideration, and honest principle be the governing rule. To profess to be good and then to walk in the worldly ways of crookedness, is ndt quite right. Such a course is confusing to the mind and makes for all a sphere of inharmony. As there are so many degrees of goodness, especially when it is connected with religion, that sometimes the lines are so faint that one can scarcely perceive them, or they may be so shaded by the elements of the world that they would hardly be known. Religious goodness should be an unmistakable force in the reforming of one's life. It should say in words easy to be understood,� 'Go and sin no more.' It should have the same ministration for the erring as did the apostle. 'Let him that stole, steal no more.' And then to make the whole matter as simple as is the gospel of Christ, we have only to listen to the words of the prophet,�'Cease to do evil, and learn to do well.' To involve any thing that belongs to the testimony of Jesus, the Christ, in a mysterious maze, is to detract so much from its spirituality and add to it that which is man-made. Religious goodness, or that which is goodness by profession may sound better than it really is. Cain and Abel each had religious goodness, and they brought offerings to place on the altar before the Lord. These gifts were of value as they had built places of sacrifice and carried to them the best that their store-house afforded, and yet the sequel of their story informs us that there must have THE MANIFESTO. 189 been a deficiency in the essential quality of goodness. To make long prayers that may be heard of men is no evidence of goodness, neither is a protestation of a life to God, unless it comes from a contrite spirit. It is practical righteousness that makes the life of man a power to do good. 'Show me,' said the apostle, 'thy faith without works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.' These works constitute the life. It is the governing element that forbids the doing of wrong. It is the armor that protects the soul against the fiery darts of Satan. This element returns to the Christian mind the new language which belongs to the people of God, and so clothes them with the Holy Spirit that they are enabled to say what they mean and to mean what they say. It aids them in living a new life, and leads the soul onward and upward toward the blissful future. It was Henry Ward Beech er who talked of the thermal line of duty, where it was warm toward God at home and in meeting, and then became cool in proportion as it went from home. Some one on asking him to step aside from the rules of propriety, he remarked,�'If I am going to take any liberties, I am going to take them at home.' That rule would not be out of place with us who are members of a religious Community, and any thing less careful than that is not consistent with our profession.
