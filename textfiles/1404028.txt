Precious Gospel Friends ;- We present the following considerations for most earnest thought... Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Mar. 1884. Precious Gospel Friends ;� We present the following considerations for most earnest thought, and vital action. We are living in a very eventful age, a period of human history wherein the powers of mind and the soul of humanity are reaching out, in every direction, in both the material and spiritual world, to discover causes of phenomena manifest to the senses ; and energetically tracing those discovered causes, to their normal and legitimate consequences. Investigation is peering into science, Philosophy is instituting new inventions and guiding the ringers of art; Literary researches are inquiring after the past history of our 'ace, to find its origin in God's great universal plan, and, if possible, to mark out a path for the luture. Geology is postulating the origin, and date of the advent of the creation of man. But, with all these things, the hungering and restless soul of humanity is not satisfied. Lost, in contemplating the infinity of the universe, and unable to account for the freedom of the human will, millions are wrestling with the question, ' If a man die, shall he live again ? ' Other millions chafingly inquiring ' Is life worth living ? ' There are still left a multitude of soul-quickened intelligences, whose spirit visions reach beyond the tomb, and whose semi-fledged angel wings are beating a more ethereal air than of the earthly heavens ; and whose spirit eyes, visioned by beams of radiance from the sun of God's truth, are beholding celestial abodes for the soul of man, for which their inspired spirits are yearning with a fervency unknown, undreamed of by those whose being is all absorbed with earthly sciences, and filled to sleeplessness with philosophies and sophistries that fulminatingly betray each other. These soul-stirred beings are reaching heavenward, after a pure religion ; having unsatisfactorily tried those systems which dwai*f, stultify and virtually enslave, instead of liberate the soul, or postulate its salvation as a bequest upon a vagrant vicariously bestowed, they are reaching out, inquisitively, seeking a religion that is in harmony with a God character who is a merciful Heavenly Father, and a charitable, forgiving, and Nursing Mother to the penitent soul. A religion bearing in its vessels the waters of repentance from the wells of salvation, to clean up the sin-sooted soul, and a healing balm of righteousness to restore the bruised soul to healthy soundness and beauty ; a religion whose converts to its theology may not only sing of Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens, but, if obedient to its behests and revelations, bask in the sunshine of the bliss of God. To us, dear Gospel Friends, this Precious Gospel Pearl is given; yet, not alone for us, but for all, who, baptized with the truth-seeking spirit, are peering into the archives of revelation, to find food for their hungering souls. To us have been given these blessings to disseminate ! Is not the inquiry momentous, How, with our limited measure of strength we may most efficiently accomplish our work ? Considering the limited able capacity among us to officiate as heralds in the mortal form, to us it feels important that we store our ' Manifesto ' that every number of it shall be a 88tup: living epistle of the gospel of a full and free salvation and redemption, and every number be so dispensed, as to be a missionary of the same, both at home and abroad. Truly the harvest of humanity who need to be gathered into the garners of God is very great, but the laborers are very few, and many of them worn with | toil and very feeble, and their waves of usefulness fast ebbing from the shore of earth's boundaries, to return no more in time ! Every condition of Zion is pulsating with demands for more laborers, active souls, baptized with power to preach the kingdom of God, both by precept and example ; to tell the world that the dual Christ, in his glory, has come, to sit as a refiner's fire, and as fuller's soap ;,�a healer who hath a balm for the wounded, and a provider of both mil!: for babes in Christ, and meat for the hungering, who, when baptized Avitli the Christ spirit, are able to become men and women of God. Let every soul in Zion earnestly pray to God that He may hear the Heavens, and that the Heavens may hear the earth, ; and the earth may hear the corn and the oil and the fruit of the vine. The light of this Gospel Day is sufficient to show to every soul, a path of perfect purity ; and the baptismal inspiration of its testimony is powerful enough to enable every soul, who receives and keeps it, to live without sin. Therefore, let the sinner in Zion be confounded, and repent, and turn to God. Let those who would live in ease, ' crying the lurden of the Lord, ' and unwilling to toil for; lost souls, and the upbuilding of the kingdom of God, arouse from their lethargy and slumbers, and work for God, lest the spirit of the Lord of the Vineyard dismiss them from His service, turn them out of the vineyard, and, to occupy their places, call in those who will labor for the salvation of souls. Let those who would cry, ' It is yet three months, and then comethharvest,' hear the Lord of the Vineyard crying, ' Lo, the fields are white, ready for the harvest; thrust in thy sickle and reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe!' Let the Covenant-breaker renew his pledge, and those whose faith hath waned, and their lamps of gospel light grown dim, arise and trim their lamps, for the heralds of the Lord of Hosts are crying, S' Lo the Bridegroom cometh with his heavenly Bride, Go ye forth to meet them.'
