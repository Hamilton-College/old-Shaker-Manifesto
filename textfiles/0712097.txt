It is one of the striking facts of Christian experience, that sometimes the purest joys, like jewels in the mine, are to be found where all to the outward eye seems dark and forbidding. This is one of the wonders of divine grace. There is a 'good,' independent of outward conditions—a good which 'moth and rust cannot corrupt,' which bereavement and affliction cannot quite rend away. The soul holds it by a grasp that the fear of death cannot dissolve and by a title that no human decision can set aside. And it fills the soul; it satisfies the cravings of its immortal nature; it endures the test when all things else, —the prizes of effort, the triumphs of genius, the successes of enterprise,—mock the soul's cheated anticipations. To the very last, its value is undiminished and its luster is un dimmd. It is a pearl of great price; it is the good part that can never be taken away.
