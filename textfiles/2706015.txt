In Memory of ROBERT CLARK. By Marian Johnson. Weary and worn with life's journey, With its sun sinking low in the west; A pilgrim has lain down his burden, And peacefully past to his rest. Like a sheaf of grain fully ripened, Garnered safe from all mildew and blight, In our Savior's beautiful mansions Thou hast entered those portals, so bright. Our Father gives sleep to his loved ones When life's fitful fever is o'er; And resting secure on his promise, They rise to that immortal shore. 'With the golden bowl broken at the fount And the silver cord loosened for flight,' O rest from thy toil, weary traveler, Leave behind all the shadows of night. The radiant morn breaketh o'er thee, Of that land that is fairer than day, Where no sickness, no sorrow can enter. And old things are all past away. The throng of the loved gone before thee, Awaits thee o'er death's rolling tide, And their blissful songs greet thy coming As thy barque nears the heavenly side. Canterbury, N. H.
