Mistakes Needing Correction Elsewhere, we give proofs of Dr. Mansfield's powers of mediumship. We therein also allude, that he has charitably donated himself so much, for those unable to pay, as to make his gift any thing but a paying one. The Dr. is not able to meet such draughts upon his time and strength without payment. We solicited his advertisement, knowing of his genuineness ; he pays us fully therefor; and we hope none of our friends will trespass upon him by begging or sponging replies to sealed letters. We are made aware that this has been done, since we inserted his advertisement, by five or six persons, and our advice is sought. While we hope none will do so more, we hope, also, soon to hear that those who have made the mistake by doing so, have honorably made amends therefor.
