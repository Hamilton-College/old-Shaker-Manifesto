ST. BARTHOLOMEW. Lucy S. Bowers. O sunny France, within thy book of annals We have read thy history, whose pages tell Of many scenes, and deeds, and ways of life. Of warlike tribes, when Clovis was thy king. Who ruled thy infant monarchy with upraised [sword. And later days, when regal splendor Glittered in thy gorgeous courts, and festal Filled out thy days and years [scenes We read of wars, Of pestilence and famine : devastation, Crime and woe : of learning, intellect, Morality and power; of many people Who have lived and died, and varied instances That seem to mark the centuries of a Nation. But 'mong it all there is rehearsed a dreadful Tale, more terrible perhaps than other wrongs Committed, a fault, a sin, a woeful crime. The only question is, who can forgive? What can atone for it in heaven or earth?� It was the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. Unto the conscience of thy children Had God appeared, to work his will, And each spirit aimed to be a loyal subject In his cause, but man-made creeds and biased J udgment, blinded by unconquered evils Of the heart, gave rise to controversies Which indeed unlocked the gates of hell. * * * Hi He The sky was dark above the wooded hills, And vales, and hamlets rested in the quiet Of serene repose. The starry Virgin Walked with noiseless tread above the ripening Sheaves of harvest-time, and happy stillness Left unborn all thoughts of ill. But hark! Mid'st dreamings all unfinished, thro' the si[lence, Sounded out the peals of bells that echoed� What? The ioys of Celebration? that told The coming of the anniversary whereon Would be high homage done to greatly Honored Saints? Not so. It was the knell Of death, the solemn knell of death. Deceased. Not only one or two dear friends whom some [one Strongly loved, 'mid deep and aching grief, But eighty thousand souls gave up the ghost, Before the dismal sounds died out upon the [air. 'Twas not a dreaded blighting pestilence, Disease, nor accident that caused this havoc Among human lives, but worse, far worse; It was a brother's hand with treachery Uplifted 'gainst a brother : foul plots con[ceived And executed when the light of day Was not, which made more infamous the deed When but a tiny meager badge distinguished The living from those who were ordained to die. The fiery flames of bondfires shot athwart The gloomy sky, from hills that raised their Verdant summits to the free, clear air of [heaven, And signaled but again the terrors Of the impending fates. Oh base and wicked Heart! Oh cruel hands ! that with the sword, The pistol, spear and every deadly Missile, and instrument of death, could thus Deprive so many of the right to live; And all beneath the folds of that fair cloak Religion. Could God once tolerate such crime? Could it be else but fearful frenzy, Stirred and heated by the burning passions Of a truly unconverted mind? Could Jesus Have walked the frightful streets afloat with [human blood And not be weighed with grief at the sad Mistakes of man? Could saints whom many Worshiped have listened to the groans and [crying Of terror-stricken ones, and not with words Of stern rebuke, condemned the falacy Of such a faith, by no means born of Christ, Our Guide and Helper? but was in truth an Enmity, wreaked by one upon another. Whole towns were left as lifeless as the Pallid corpses strewn along the streets. Friends, neighbors, kindred, innocents all [gone Together to a world where mortal fear goes [not. From Sabbath unto Sabbath, seven whole [days Did these feigned Christians stalk the land More merciless than fiends, and woe to every Protestant who dared to do as conscience bid And serve his God according to his light. Brave souls there were, who heard the king's [command Imperative, but shrunk from stains of guiltless Blood, and saved in sympathy whom they [could. The deed of death was done, nor was that all. Strong condemnation rose in living words From countless millions, the sound of which Will echo through the ages yet to come. Kind Sister Nations, England and Switzerland with others Were horrified at that fierce massacre. The tale has been rehearsed from sire to son, And now, Geneva holds her days of prayer And lasting, an anniversary time of sorrow For the dead In sorest grief warm-hearted Scotland bowed her head, and Knox, her peo[ple's Voice, exclaimed in language of prophetic [nerve; ' 'Sentence has gone forth against that mur[derer The King of France, and vengence of high [God Will never be withdrawn from off his house. His name shall be upheld in everlasting Execration.' But Spain and Italy, and Eome ! What destiny for those who in exultations Full, so freely countenanced such infamy As this? 'These tidings are the greatest and Most glorious that could have been received, So wrote the king of Madrid to the soulless Queen of France, the instigator of the crime. 'Twas in the i?orry days of 1793, One cried,�when led up to the guillotine To sacrifice a mortal life, whose only Aim had been for human weal�'O Liberty! What crimes have been committed in thy [name!' And in Religion's has the same been done. And now we ask again, who can forgive? What can atone tor it in heaven or earth ?� There is above, a living God who in His wisdom can give retribution meted By the law of justice : according to the Day and knowledge is received the balance Of returns. The king, upon whose infant Hands rested the fearful weight of this grave Tragedy, gave up his life an offering of Conviction upon the altar of remorse. O, let us learn by things long past and pres[ent, To honor Christ thro' love and not thro' hate. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
