TO THE TEMPERANCE BAND We unto you in kindly greeting, Waft our blessing and our love ; Praying that each temperance meeting, Will to souls a blessing prove. Ask for aid, it will be given ; Guardian friends are hovering near ; Look to God for strength and comfort, He the cause will guide and cheer. Seraphims of love and mercy, Go before and chant the song, Beaming light, truth and conviction; This will make your army strong. Hear ye not the voice of Angels, Hovering o'er each valiant band, Speaking love and inspiration, Giving strength to heart and hand ? Persevere, perform your mission, God resery'd this work for you, Many souls in deep contrition, Will your path with blessings strew. Pear ye not; fulfill your duty, Angels chant the song of life! Female messengers of mercy, Will subdue the stormy strife. Nancy P. Riley, W. Pittsfield, Mass.
