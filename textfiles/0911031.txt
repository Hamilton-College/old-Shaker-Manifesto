Poisons in farmers' hands Poisons in Farmers' Hands. The great increase during the past thirty years in the variety and number of insects which destroy the farmers' crops has made it necessary, for purposes of defense, to purchase and have upon the premises some very active poisonous agents, mineral and vegetable. Among these may be named Paris green, for destroying the potato beetle; hellebore powder, for the currant worms, rose bugs, etc.; and strychnine, for crows, blackbirds, etc., in corn-fields. These comprise some of the most potent and deadly poisons known to science. By far the most dangerous is Paris green, because it has come into such general use it is found in almost every farm house in the country. Now, it is a well-known principle in human conduct that familiarity with danger engenders indifference, carelessness and negligence, and consequently, however timid and cautious one may be in the first handling of dangerous implements or agents, in the course of time extraordinary safeguards are not thought of, and great recklessness succeeds to extreme caution. We were impressed with this fact by fortunately happening to observe a farmer, in the hurry of hay time in J uly, seize a wooden stirrer which had been used to mix Paris green with flour, and thrust it into a stone pitcher containing oat meal and water designed for the men in the field. Of course the peril was instantly pointed out, the beverage was thrown away, and perhaps life was saved. It was an incident well calculated to create a feeling of apprehension in regard to the employment of this poison by farmers. It was kept in a tool house, where also was the package of oat rneal, and here the mixing of the poison and the beverage took place. The stirrer, covered with the green powder, was the implement nearest at hand, and it was thoughtlessly seized in the hurry of the moment. All these conditions and circumstances show great carelessness, but is it greater than that shown by others in different ways ? We fear not! In the first place, no poisonous substances should be stored on farm premises, unless it be in an unused cellar or outbuilding. It is better to make a tight box, large enough to hold all the poisons needed to be kept on hand, together with dredging boxes, stirrers, etc., and place this in a secure place, away from tools, foods, etc., also from animals. Again, in using Paris green in gardens, care must be observed that no peas, beans nor other vegetables are in close proximity to the potatoes, as the powder might fall or be blown upon them, and thus reach the dining table and cause mischief. These poisons are of immense benefit to farmers, but, like gunpowder and other useful but dangerous agents, they should be used with intelligent and constant care. Boston Journal of Chemistry
