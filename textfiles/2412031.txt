O my mortal friends and brothers... O my mortal friends and brothers, We are each and all another's, And the heart that gives most freely From its treaures, hath the more. Would you loose your life, you find it, And in giving love, you bind it, Like an amulet of safety To your hearts forevermore. ï¿½Selected.
