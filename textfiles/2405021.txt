Watervliet, Ohio. April, 1894. We have been having very nice weather through the month of March, and had some potatoes, peas and onions planted; also set out some fruit trees, one thousand raspberry bushes, five hundred blackberries and other fruits. Had a very hard freeze the latter part of March which was disastrous to fruit and oats. Have put in about forty-five acres of the latter. We have built about one hundred rods of picket fence and will put out probably one hundred rods of hedge fence. Our young fruit trees are all doing well. We were blest with the company of Elder Joseph Slingerland on the 29th ult. Health of Society good. Henry W. Fredrick.
