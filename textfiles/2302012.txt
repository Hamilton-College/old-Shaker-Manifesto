From South Union., Ky., the early home of DANIEL BOLER. It would seem proper that the Society from which Daniel Boler started as a youth, should contribute toward enlarging and perpetuating the record of his high character, and of his virtuous life. As a boy, this was his early home. And here his father and mother resided for five years. The great Revivals which prevailed in this western country from 1805 to 1808, bore abundant fruit in the awakening and conversion of many souls. The Divine power was manifested by the sacrifices which many made to follow Christ, and William Boler was one who was brought under the influence of that gracious outpouring of the Divine spirit. He connected himself with the United Society of Believers at South Union, in 1808, with his family and remained here until 1814. In that year he took his son Daniel to Pleasant Hill, and from thence to Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., to avoid the spirit of persecution which prevailed at that time, against the Believers. This section of country was at that date almost a wilderness ; yet on foot, with the boy Daniel, who frequently rode on his father's back, or walked with him, they traversed the woods; and animated by an unfaltering trust and faith in God and the truth of his promises, made their way for many weary miles to Mt. Lebanon. See what faith the father displayed ! His son Daniel evidenced in his life and character the same traits which characterized his father. Brought up to faithful manual labor, and to patience and fortitude, early taught the principles of morality and of religion, he pursued a consistent and upright path through life. He leaves the record of an example of good deeds, and of triumph over the sins of the world. He lived a long life of usefulnesss, and we are much gratified in surveying the beauty of his life-work to think that he commenced his Christian journey at South Union. Anon.
