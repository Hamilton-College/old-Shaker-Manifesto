LIGHT ENOUGH E. T. LEGGETT What thousands, blinking like the birds of night, Dazed by the brilliance of o'erpowering light, With slumbering eyelids, grope the green earth o'er, And in full floods of light still sigh for more : Not light they need ; could all the suns that glow, In jne concentered, brighten all below, They'd still complain ; for all is dark within ; No ray illumes their citadel of sin. Not light is wanting; light is everywhere; Each tree's a sermon and each flower a prayer: Earth, seas, and skies, the seasons as they roll, Teach man's whole duty to each reasoning soul. The light, that at its dawn, ere man was free, Led saints of old from death to victory. From heaven to earth, from God to man to-day, Still dazzling shines upon the better way. No light has dimmed, no fountain ceased to flow; No truth 's involved that man has need to know; No law has changed, rewarding good or ill; All ill is Hell,— all good is Heaven still: No chord is missing from earth's glad refrain; No link is broken in earth's golden chain; Still, as the sunbeams, angels come and go, With smiles to cheer and balm for every woe. That soul, of all is happiest and best. Who, blessing others, is in others blest: In every sphere where men or angels are, True happiness is true religion there: He who conforms in body, mind and soul To all God's laws imposed for his control, Or prince, or peasant, be his station given, W'herever he may be, to him is heaven. 'Tis folly to resist, where man is wrong; Man is too weak for treason — God too strong; Omnipotence is His with all the spheres; To Him eternity's unending years; Let's then be wise before it's all too late, Acknowledge God and keep the laws of Fate; With heart and hand join with the hosts above, Who less know God is great, than God is love.
