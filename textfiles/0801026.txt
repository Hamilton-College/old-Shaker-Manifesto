MOODY AND SANKEY Elder Evans means no disrespect, we are sure, by the remark upon their kind of Christianity. Any party who aims to resurrect humanity, and does make them better shall have a 'God bless' from every Shaker heart; just as Paul does in his attempts, and those who follow Paul. Hut Paul, Moody, and Sankey are apologists for the flesh : and the genuine life of Christ is not found in the gospel they preach. Paul found the people un- equal to a full cross against the flesh, and for a virgin life ; so he ''fixed up' a gospel that has better pleased the worldly mind ever since. Just so with too many evangelists today. They preach part of Christ, and adulterate the true gospel. Let Moody live the life Jesus lived, and Sankey sing the self-denials and hates of tlie beloved Apostle, and in these, preach from the spirit of Christ, and the world at large, so stirred by their appeals now, would soon get over the curiosity and look upon them as they now look upon the Shakersâ€”very good doctrine, but very unpalatable !
