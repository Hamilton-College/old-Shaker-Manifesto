BANDS OF MERCY The Pledge. 'I will try to be kind and merciful to all living creatures, and will try to persuade others to be the same.'�//. Educator. Ingratitude.�It is an old saying that if you do a man nineteen favors, and for any reason decline to do the twentieth, he will forget the nineteen requests that you have granted, and only remember the one that you have refused�and for that refusal he will hate you for ever after. This is true of some men; it is true of mean and narrow nature; it is not true of all. It is as natural for a noble soul to cherish a lively recollection of kindnesses received, as it is to breathe. And while we are often shocked to see acts of friendship toward others, which have cost us a good deal of time and of labor, entirely overlooked and forgotten, we not unfrequently, on the other hand, are surprised by the grateful reciprocation of some favor long since rendered, and the very performance of which had passed from our own recollections, until reminded of it by the recipient. We have always regarded gratitude as a. feeling which is hardly susceptible of being taught to any one. A lecture on gratitude, to whomsoever addressed, instead of awakening that emotion, is very apt to engender a feeling of indignation and hatred. People never like to be told to be grateful. And it is of no use to tel]�4;hem. If it is not natural to the soul to appreciate the good nature of others it can never be taught such appre ciation. Selected.
