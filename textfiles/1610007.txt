Esteemed friend: I thank you for... Hopedale, Mass., May 5, 1863. Esteemed Friend :ï¿½I thank you for your kind favor of the loth ult. I have read it with care and candor. You present very strong reasons why families of the procreative plane cannot without great difficulty, if at all, establish communities of goods ; and why a people on the plane of the Shaker families cau do so successfully. I will endeavor to present in response the real difficulties which need to be removed from my mind in order to my concurrence with you. First. I have believed that it was the destiny of man as a race to be gradually inducted into a holy, harmonic, and happy order of society here on earth. Second. I have believed that it was according to Divine order, natural and right for mankind as a race, while here on earth, to procreate their species. Third. That whatever is strictly natural for the time being cannot be a sin per se, .and should not be forbidden, but only regulated into true order. With these fundamental ideas, I have sought to discover and commence an order of human society, which would not only be holy, harmonic and happy in select communities, but become ultimately universal for the entire race. I can see that celibacy was best for Jesus, Paul, and many saints in the ages of the past to enable them to fulfill their respective missions for the regeneration of the race. Also, that the like exceptionally will continue for ages to come. I can see that with such characters, under such circumstances, celibacy is not only a privilege, but an imperative duty. I can also see that this may be true in respect to select communities of celibates. And I can farther clearly see that in such cases, such celibates can establish communities with far less difficulty than can married families of the same essential moral goodness. I do not need to be convinced of these truths. Now will you tell me whether your order and system of society is designed or expected to become universal for the race here on earth ; or if it is only select and exceptional in its nature? If select and exceptional to the course and destiny of the race, I assent at once to the fitness of its platform and means to its end. But if designed and expected to become universal then your present societies are first fruits, specimens and models for the entire race, and if so, then your success must result in the extinction of the race here in flesh and blood on the earth. And farther, if so, it must be a sin per se for even the best of human beings to procreate offspring. In that view, how can you vindicate God for having created mankind.here on earth with all the capabilities, instincts, and inherent longings which result in offspring? Or how can you demonstrate that loves and faculties strictly natural cannot be exercised without sin per se? These are the precise points on which if in error, I need to be enlightened and corrected. I state them as explicitly and directly as I can, that you may instruct me. I am sure I desire very strongly to embrace ' the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.' Bear with me esteemed friend, and write again soon. Your friend and brother, Adin Ballou.
