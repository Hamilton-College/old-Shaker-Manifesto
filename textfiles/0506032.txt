GOSPEL INCREASE Bright angels are passing through the earth, to and fro, Proclaiming God's Word that all nations must know; Yea, bearing the Law that will bring lasting peace, And establish his kingdom which never will cease — Never will cease to flourish and grow,— Until the whole earth is an Eden below; Never will cease in its growth of love, Till mortals are like unto angels above. 'Tis but by the cross, self-denial and truth, The soul is renewed, and brought back to its youth; And by the deep love which the Saviour possassed, The earth is to bloom, and its fruitage be blessed. Put on your whole strength, O ye earnest and bold 1 The seed must be sown, that its life may unfold; The chosen of God, have his work to perform, Yet, He will protect them from ev'ry wild storm. For thus 'tis decreed, the true laborer shall rise, Though scorned and derided—and covered with lies; No mortals have power to harm or destroy Those who for the truth all their forces employ. Those who come forth to march in the van, By angels are guided in God's holy plan. Courage, brave-hearted, be fearless and true ! The Lord is your strength, and will bring you safe through; Eternally yours, his kingdom of peace, Of which there's to be an abiding increase. Eternally yours — his kingdom of love— * As starry and broad as the blue arch above; Rapturous joy, none but victors can tell, What the anthem contains, which their glad voices swell! None but the heroes who've ended the strife, Are crowned with the laurels of immortal life! Julia Johnson, Hancock, Mass.
