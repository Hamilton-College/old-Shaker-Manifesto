CHRISTIAN LOVE Elvah F. Collins Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Leave some good behind you, 2. Leave some good behind you, 3. Leave some good behind you, 4. Leave some good behind you, As you journey on, Tho' the seed be small, God will bless your aim, Little it doth cost. Gentle act of mercy And along the wayside And in love reward you, To bestow the sunshine Unto mortal It unseen may With a righteous On a heart that's done, fall, name, lost, Christian deeds of kindness, It will rise with vigor, Many souls will hail you, Tenderness of feeling, Ne'er are wrought in vain, And abundantly As a guiding star, Love to brother given, Only in our blindness, We from these refrain. Bear the fruit of glad ness, In some future day. Fadeless in its brightness, Shedding light afar. Is the balm of healing, Making home a heaven.\
