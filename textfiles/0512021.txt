Progression [part 5 of 6] A. DOOLITTLE, EDITRESS Melissa â€” Heard ye the song of the Angels ? Heard ye its echo sweet. That softly swells around our home, When the earth and the heavens meet? Yea, we have heard that glorious song... Yea, we have heard that glorious song, 'Tis a burst of music grand, 'Tis vict'ry's inspiration From the resurrection land. I have caught its echo in my soul, Its melody has come to me, Oh, let its cadence roll and roll, 'Till earth is glad and free, Oh, let its cadence roll and roll, Till earth is glad and free.
