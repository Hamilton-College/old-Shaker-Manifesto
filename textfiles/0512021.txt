Yea, we have heard that glorious song... Yea, we have heard that glorious song, 'Tis a burst of music grand, 'Tis vict'ry's inspiration From the resurrection land. I have caught its echo in my soul, Its melody has come to me, Oh, let its cadence roll and roll, 'Till earth is glad and free, Oh, let its cadence roll and roll, Till earth is glad and free.
