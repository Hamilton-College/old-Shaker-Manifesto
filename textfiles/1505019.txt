Dear Children; Work out your own... Enfield, Conn. Apr. 1885. Dear Children ;- -''Work out your own salvation. ' Begin now. While you wait for that which may never come, precious opportunities are passing away forever. You have no right to waste a moaient. Wastefulness oftime is a sin. ' Time enough is little enough. ' Press on for the crown awaiting the faithful. The present well improved is the best preparation for the future. Time is short. Improve your portion small. It is the little moments wisely used, the little duties well performed, that make up the sum of a virtuous life. Little by little your work is done; step by step, the crown won. Purity insures a crown worth wearing. What though temptations assail? How shall you know your strength but for them? ' It is the Lord who girdeth with strength unto the battle. ' Be strong in Him. Your days are golden now. Be wetchful. Constant watchfulness is the price of salvation. ' Make your calling and election sure.'' Not only to be called, but to be Christians. It is what you are that will make you valuable. It is not how long, but how well you live. ' Since earthly joy abideth never, work for the joy that lasts forever. ' Work ! Thanking God who gives you the strength and the opportunity. '; Work, for I am with you saith the Lord of hosts. ' Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
