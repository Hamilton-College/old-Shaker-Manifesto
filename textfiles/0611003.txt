CHANGE THE SABBATH DAY F. W. EVANS I PROPOSE that the American government change the Sabbath to any day of the week, except the Jewish or the Mahometan Sabbath day. The pagan Sun-day is of all others the most improper. As Shakers, I and my people observe it as a day of rest with as much fidelity as any people. As an American citizen, proclaiming liberty of conscience to all mankind, I protest against the sectarian, superstitious closing of the world's exhibition on Sun-day. It is not the true scriptural Sabbath. The government did right in blowing up Hell Gate on the Sabbath. Let the Christian clergy blow up the gates of hell — religious controversy; let the world's exposition be open, free of expense, to the world's poor on the remaining Sabbath days, and henceforth keep hands off the only government constitutionally free from sectarian theology. Then they may keep any day, and as many Sabbath days as they please, unmolested. And we — Jews, Quakers, Catholics, materialists, atheists, Protestants — will all unite and keep any day the American government may appoint as a day of rest to man, beast and cook.
