Harvard, Mass. June 4, 1891. Dear Elder Henry:�On the ,16th., we had an unexpected visit from Elder John B. Vance of Alfred, Me. Being in Boston on business and finding he could not get through to his place in time, he concluded to come and stay with us over Sunday, and we found it a very profitable and beneficial visit. In our service he spoke words of wisdom and strength, and dwelt largely in his testimony upon the spirit of Charity. His expressions, many of them were new and therefore interesting. Since having time for reflection, thoughts have passed through my mind, and none with more weight and force than upon this redeeming spirit,�charity. We are here as Brothers and Sisters claiming relationship by obedience to a faith made sacred to us by the fruits we have thus far realized. But all possessing a nature a little stronger for our own ways and wills than for the general good and benefit of the institution. Should we not in judging and giving our opinions, use a little of this spirit, knowing we are not capable of judging another's motives. Many of the faults that come into society germinate in an overtaxed brain and go no farther than the head, while the heart is as true and genuine as the purest gold. The spirit of charity and cheerfulness go hand in hand. A wise author once made the remark, 'I never knew a cheerful man to be a bad man.' What a glorious element a sunshiny person throws over society. While this melancholy spirit may be sure evidence to some of extraordinary piety, the cheerfulness which I mean to represent is not a momentary mood, but a lasting temper. It has not the noise of mirth, nor the emptiness of levity. It is a serious and abiding joy, resembling the flame of a wax candle, so steady, bright and pure. Forebodings of evil, rob the mind of cheerfulness. Ills that never have happened have mostly made people wretched. Casting a glance ahead we see lions in the way, difficulties which we are sure we can never overcome. Not satisfied with our present troubles we borrow misery from the future. 'Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.' This is what the cheerful man and woman sings through the day, and this gives them the golden promise, 'As thy day, so shall thy strength be.' Disease may have a tendency to cast a gloom over the spirit. As the body sympathizes with the mind, their union is so intimate and delicate that what affects one affects the other. Therefore, it becomes our duty as Christians, if we have health to study the laws of our being and compel ourselves to labor and to rest; avoid all unnecessary exposure, abstain from all that is injurious, by living prudently and temperately, and by every means try to preserve what is so essential to our spiritual comfort. Count up our mercies instead of our miseries. Try the medicine of cheerfulness. It may not insure you a full recovery, but it will certainly produce a pleasant alleviation. 'A merry heart doeth good like medicine, but a broken spirit drieth the bones.' A. D. B.
