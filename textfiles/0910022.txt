A Needed Suggestion We are in constant reception of communications from 'the household of our faith,' in which, speaking of ourselves—Shakers — the term ' Believers' is used. Once we claimed the equal of a copyright upon this term ; but there are several minor sects who are now wearing this cognomen ; and besides the term bears upon it no distinct explanation nor information. Should we add to it ' in Christ's Second Appearing' we would be better understood. But people pretty well understand what the Shakers believe, who they are and how they live, and why not cling to the honorable name of ' Shakers ' which no man has ever counterfeited yet for a denomination, neither desires to do so, while it may all remain ours for another hundred years without the least molestation ? We are aware that some, very high in authority among us, do not'like this appellation. That they avoid its use and evade its address. With all due respect for such, we have no apology to make to them for this timely suggestion. For the term ' Shaker ' means so much — those who shake errors from themselves first, and then go all over the world with their shaking testimony, to the great disturbance and eradication of worldly errors and fleshly wrongs. The term is a righteous one and applies grandly to our profession and testimony. We could not, if we should all try, get rid of it for one hundred years, and we, for many, protest against the evasion OR ATTEMPTED DISUSE.
