INVITATION. REBECCA SHEPARD. 'Come then with us, and we will do thee good.' These words were spoken by one in the 'olden time' who evidently felt as we do in this day. We feel sure that we have found '' a more excellent way,' and fain would tell of its blessedness, to our fellow beings who have not found it for themselves ; and extend to them an invitation to do so now, assuring them of the happiness to be found in the higher life ; where all is sacrificed for ' Christ's sake' and the gospel. ' For the love of Christ constraineth us. ' The same universal love for pur race that Jesus had ; the love that would gladly raise them out of sin, and its consequent suffering to a life of purity and innocence, a life of true happiness. ' Come then with us, and we will do thee good. ' 'For the Lord hatk spoken good concerning Israel.' 'Come taste of the hidden manna' hidden from the natural man, but given liberally to those who seek it in spirit and iu in truth. ' Come and taste the living bread,' and hunger no more for the vanities of this world. 'Come to the waters, drink and live.' Come and be grafted into the living vine, and bring forth fruits of righteousness and peace. Canterbury, N. H.
