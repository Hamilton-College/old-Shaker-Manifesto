PURITY. By Ella F. Williams. 'Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.'Matt, v., 8. Purity is the entwining virtue of modesty and inspires the heart with a love for good company, pure language and refinement. We often hear the passage of scripture quoted which reads, 'Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.' As our future life depends greatly upon the habits formed in youth great care should be taken to implant within the heart, germs of truth and purity, which shall bloom to be flowers of beauty and virtue, exemplifying a Christian life and seeking good in those around us our language will be true and savored with a spirit that is pure for 'even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure and whether it be right. By obeying the voice of conscience and living a noble and virtuous life we are making the kingdom of heaven upon the earth. Enfield, N. H.
