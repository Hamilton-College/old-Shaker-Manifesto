The Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company celebiated on November 27th, the first anniversary of the completion of their 'Standard Dictionary,' by putting to press the SOth thousand of thii grea't work. This is a very large number of dictionaries to print in a single year. The publishers' mathematician has figured out that, if these 90,000 sets were piled flat one upon another, they would reach nearly seven miles in height; and. the printed pages, if laid end to end, would extend over 40,000 miles, one and three fifths times around the globe ! But the most significant of the triumphs of the first year of this remarkable dictionary andthe most gratifying to Americans, is the wonderful reception given the work by the most exacting of the linguistic critics in England. Especially is this so when we remember how reluctant, naturally enough, the English are to look to a foreign country for a dictionary of their own tongue. It is something extraordinary for an American work of this kind to elicit words of such enthusiastic praise as those uttered by such scholars of the Oxford University as Professor Sayceand Max Muller, and well-known scholars of other English universities and such journalistic critics as those of the London Standard, Saturday Review, Notes and Queries, Nature, London Times, Westminster Review Atlitnaum, Mark-Lane Express, Scotsman, Liverpool Post, St. Jame's Budget. The latter closes his critical review with the following superlative indorsement: 'To say that it is perfect in form and scope is not extravagance of praise, and to say that it is the most valuable dictionary of the Eng lish language is but to repeat the obvious. The Standard Dictionary should be the pride of literary America, as it is the admiration of literary England.' May the triumphs of the second year of this Dictionary equal those of the first; they could not well exceed them! Another feature of this first anniversary of the publication of the Standard Dictionary was the forwarding, from the Pennsylvania depot for Michigan, of a big freight car loaded wholly with Standard Dictionaries. Large letters on muslin across the sides of the car told the public of the contents. Editorial rooms of the Standard Dictionary. To the Editor:—A very grave 'wrong is being perpetrated against the American public by a reprinter of one of the English competitors of the Funk &amp; 'Wagnalls Standard Dictionary—a wrong that cannot be excused by the exigencies of commercial rivalry. As is well known, in all unabridged dictionaries it is necessary to give the definitions of certain indelicate words. Eighteen of these words (selected out of a vocabulary of over 300,000 terms in the Standard) have been collated and printed with their definitions by the reprinter of this English dictionary, and circulars containing them are being distributed among teacheiT, school trustees, and parents all through this country, stirring up a iilthy agitation that will end, unless irowmd down by the public prtss and other leaders of public opinion, in setting people of prurient minds and childien everywhere to ransacking dictionarits ior this class of words. One of these publications contains such outrageously unjust comments as the following: 'About two years ago the publishing house of Funk &amp; Wagnalls brought into the world a monstrosity entitled the Standarn Dictionary of the English Language.' 'So far as relates to its collection of obscene, filthy, blasphemous, slang, and profane words, it has no cc untupart in dictionaries of the English Language.' It is but iair to the press and scholars of England to say that the English critics have in no way seconded this unfair as- sault, but are unanimous in the most unqualified indorsement of the American work, the Standard Dictionary, expressing in many ways the same opinion as that of the St. James's Budget [weekly edition of the St. James's Gazette,] London, which said: 'To say that it is perfect in form and scope is not extiavaganee of praise, and to say that it is the most valuable Dictionary of the English language is hut to repeat the obvious. The Standaid Dictionaiy should be the pride of literary America as it is the admiration of literary England.' The utter insincerity of this attack on the Standard is seen in the fact that nearly every one of these 18 words is in the English work which is published by this reprinter, and it contains other words so grossly indelicate and withal so rarely used as to have heen txeludtd from the Standard and from nearly all the other dictionaries. Fiitten out of the eighteen words (and others of the same class) are, and properly so, in the Century Dictionary, and they are to be found, with scarcely an exception, in every other reputable unabridged dictionary, and this class of words is invariably recorded in the lead- ing dictionaries of all languages. Since this gross attack has been made wehave submitted to Charles A. Dana and to a number of well-known educators the question whether we committed an error in admitting into the Standard this class of words. The answer has been without an exception, 'You did not.' The fact is, extraordinary care was used by the editors of the Standard 'to protect the language.' Of the more than 500,000 words collected by the hundreds of readers employed to search all books of merit from Chaucer's time to the present, over 200,000 were excluded wholly from the vocabulary; hence there was no need and no effort to pad the vocabulary. The rules of exclusion and inclusion were most carefully made and rigidly enforced. A most perplexing problem from beginning to end was how to reduce the vocabulary, not how to enlarge it. Compression was carried by many devices to the extremest degree. The editors who passed upon the admission of words numbered over one hundred of the best known writers and scholars in America and England. To accuse such men of 'fllthiness' is to do a wrong of the gravest degree. It is the business of a dictionary to record words, not to create, nor fco destroy them; to a.iswer inquirers concerning the spelling, pronunciation, and meaning of all words that are used to any considerable exttsnt, not to obliterate those it does not fancy. Whether a word has a right fco exist or not, the final arbiter is the people, not fie dictionary. The dictionary, as says Trench, should be the inventory of the language, and, as says the Encyclopedia Britannica under the term DICTIONARY, it 'should include all of the words of the language .... A complete and Standard Dictionary should make no choice. Words obsolete and newly coined barbarous, vulgar, and aifected, temporary, provincial, and local, belonging to peculiar classes, professions, pursuits, and trades, should all find their place,—the only question being as to the evidence of their existence,—not indeed, all received with equal honor and regard, but with their characteristics and defects duly not- ed and painted out.' Improper or indelicata words, when it was found necessary to admit them into the Standard, were blacklisted as low, vulgar, slang, and printed in small type. It did not saem to the editors that an unabridged dictionary could go further without justly incurring blame. To collect from such a work words of the class referred to and publish them is as great an outrage as to collect from the Bible tha many indelicate words and passa^es to be found there, or those from Shakespeare (some of these 18 words are found both in the Bible and in Shakespeare,) and then to print and scatter abroad the collection, saying: 'See what a foul book is the Bible; see what an obscene and blasphemous work is Shakes- peare.' The publication and distribution of th.353 circulars is a gross assault upon public decency. An agent who attempts to exhibit such a printed circular surely should not be listened to for a moment; he is a public enemy, and should be turned from every decent door. The old story will be remembered of a woman accosting Samuel Johnson, shortly after his dictionary had been p wished, with, 'Doctor Johnson, I am so uorry that you put in your dictionary tl\e naughty words.' 'Madam', retorted the Doctor, 'I am sorry that you have been looking for them.' Respectfully, I. K. Funk.
