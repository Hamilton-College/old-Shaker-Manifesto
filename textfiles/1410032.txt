Individual effort alone gives growth... Individual effort alone gives growth,�substantial growth of character; what we possess, not what we profess, is a safeguard against error. Oft repeated ceremonies of confession are not the power that resurrects and brings the soul into newness of life; good homes do not form noble men or wornen, without thought beyond self and material conditions. �E. M. H.
