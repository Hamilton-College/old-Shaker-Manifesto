CONSECRATION WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO. ' CONSECRATION. No longer mine, the gifts I bring and Jay At feet of God, with lowly heart to-day; That they are gifts of mine I would not say. Not mine the will to stny, to come, or go, The will divine is all I seek to know, And God it is, who willing, wills it so. If He should place me keeper of His gate, Outside His kingdom to abide and wait, I would obey, nor doubt, nor hesitate. And if, on lowly errand I were sent, Or bade to work at home, I'd be content, And know at once what the sweet counsel meant. Oh! thus it is, my soul can understand The nature of each message, each command, Whidi cometh with such wisdom from His hand. And thus my hands are filled with labor sweet, So staid from weary wand'rings are my feet, I do not heed the shades which round them meet. Nor mind the clouds that frequent o'er me break; Fear not the storms, feel not the winds which shake; But all these chastenings I as mercies take. Because I live in faith, His will, while mine Is in the keeping of Love's holy shrine, Where Truth will purify it, Grace refine. And so I trust, with sweet confiding love God's will; and safe within His care above, My heart comes home like a returning dovo.
