ASPIRATION. CALVIN G. REED. ' How lovely are thy dwellings fair 0 Lord of host , how dear Tlic pleasant tabernacles are When thou dost dwell so near! ' �Milton. Ye messengers celestial Dwelling ia omniscient light Of God's effulgent glory, Peerless, incandescent, bright; While on your heavenly mission, Of a pure, unfathomed love, To point the denizens of earth To noonday spheres above ;� O, shed upon our vision, Beauties of the world unseen, Where living powers, real, Beautiful, august, serene, Pervade the amplitude Of the etherean, boundless space, With glorious, rich profusion, Of true happiness and grace. For these my soul lured upward, Welling, gushing with desire, Would revel in the grand, Substantial fullness, of these higher, Pure, sublimated, hallowed, Love directed spheres of bliss, Eliminated from the Errors and weaknesses of this ; Its crudeness, darkness, dangers, Misconceptions of the truth, And cumulative foibles Of the era of our youth; With every machination Which would twine around the soul, To dim its keen perceptions And its higher powers control; And turn its aspirations From heavenly truths sublime, To seek its inspirations In venal sense and time. Ye gracious powers eternal, Of the glorious life divine, That with such God-like spirit, Heav'nward ye so nobly bear Each honest, anxious, toiling Pilgrim, toward your realm so fair, Dip your elysian pen in Your imperial, cloudless light, And on the tablets of our Deathless understandings write,� Or photograph, with brilliant tints Of your empyrean sky, And all the blended glories Of your matchless home on high, Upon the spotless canvass� The pure, eternal, sacred roll, The clear unblemished picture Of the bright perfected soul, Just heir of fadeless glory Within God's central zone, Where nought but white robed angels Can circle round His throne. I long to feel the pulsing Of this ceaseless flow of love, Course onward in my veinlets Perpetually to move; Uniting me more surely AVith the life that's good and pure, And the rich celestial graces Which true happiness ensure. I seek a pure relation With the noble and the true, Treed from the wild commotion That so often meets the view Disturbing and corroding The peace and sweet communion Which should be so abiding A nucleus of our union. I seek elimination From opinionated clamor, And all the vileful frenzy Of wild theologic glamour. I seek a pure religion Worthy of the realms above, Where brethren dwell together In pure harmony and love. Where each with each is striving For the truth, eternal, pure ; In kindliness of feeling, And the love that will endure. I long to see the era, Which the prophet's wise foretold, When man shall work by Reason,� Not by tyrant fear controlled. When swords and spears are beaten Into implements of peace ; And war and tumult banished By the perfect rnign of Peace. When man hails not his brother, Saying, come and learn of me ! For then shall the Instructor, Be the God of Liberty. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
