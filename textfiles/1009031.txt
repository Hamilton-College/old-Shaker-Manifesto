REAPING Here's a beauty of a poem, which each of the dear children would profit by committing to memory, and never forget while growing up, nor when grown to be men and women : . Every one is sowing, both by word and deed ; All mankind are growing, either wheat or weed ? Thoughtless ones are throwing any sort of seed. Serious ones are seeking seed already sown ; Many eyes are weeping now the crop is grown ; Think upon the reaping — each one reaps his own. Surely as the sowing shall the harvest be — See what you are throwing over hill and lea ; Words and deeds are growing for eternity. There is one all knowing, looking on alway ; Fruit to him is flowing, feeling for the day — Will your hearts be glowing in the grand array ? Yea, that would be bringing sheaves of golden grain, Mind what you are flinging both from hand and brain, Then 'mid glad songs singing, you shall glean great gain.
