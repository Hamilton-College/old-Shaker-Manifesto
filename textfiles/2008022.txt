NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North. Family. July 10; 1890. The July Manifesto came smiling along, bright and early, iind renewing our interest at home and abruad. Mother's counsel was very wise, to do everything in its season; to heed this we have no time to lose. The seasons roll round so close one after another that it requires constant diligence to keep up with them. We no sooner get through with seedtime, than we have to commence harvesting. To have every set of tools all in readiness for the season, is arming ourselves beforehand; and saves a great deal of fret and worry. The best way, we find, is, at the close of each season to put the machines and tools all in working order before they are stored away. We shall attend to this, or try to, in the future better than we have sometimes in the past. Old Time is everlastingly working away, taking the polish off, and using the influence of the elements to bring all man-made things down to one general level. A few years ago we painted and fixed up till we thought we were pretty nice; but now when we come to look round we find we are getting quite dingy. So with the help of angel Sisters we have started to polish up again. Are now engaged painting our buildings ; righting up chimneys, fences and things in general. This necessitates the hiring of extra help; which always brings additional burden. We are trying the plan of hiring by the day, and have them board themselves. It may cost a little more one way, but I think we gain it in another. It pays well to look after the interest of our sisterhood. They can then the better look after the interest of the brotherhood. Are now in hay harvest; which is excellent where the land is rich. Potato bugs, and weeds call, and have to be attended to. Br. Charles Greave's fertilizer machine is a grand affair for putting plaster with paris green, on potatoes. I wish we were situated as are our good friends at Alfred, down in Maine; that is be able to do our own work. And I also wish that every man had land of his own to work upon. Our forefathers in the gospel were very zealous in their day, and wanted to do all in their power to redeem the earth; thinking that all the land Believers owned was being redeemed by consecration, they tried to buy all that joined them, as far as possible, and consecrate it to the Lord. But alas, in many cases it has become a burden grievous to be borne. We have recently had the privilege of seeing the beloved Ministry from Maine and some of our gospel friends from Groveland. I wish we could see more of them from near and afar. Who can tell the great amount of good that is imparted and received by the visiting of gospel relation one with another? I can tell of much good I have received, and I know many who have been blest in this way. If we have really forsaken the natural, according to the example of Jesus and the founders of our order, we have a right to cultivate the spiritual; and is it not our duty so to do? It was said of Jesus 'for the joy set before him he endured the cross.' For the joy with his heavenly Father, and sweet communion with angels did he forsake his earthly kindreds and relationships; so with us ; if we have no joy set before us of our Heavenly Mother, and communion with the household of faith, will there not be some danger of our turning earthward. 'We'll waft a waft of love thro' Zion, To our kindred everywhere. We'll shout a shout of gospel blessing, That angels on their wings will bear. Over mountain over valley, Over plain and flowing rill, Wf'll extend the gift of union, Till our kindred it doth fill.' In kindest love, Daniel Offord. Center Family. Beloved Elder Henry :�Our cherry crop which is nearly all gathered proved better than we expected and prices were exceptionally good selling at fifteen cents per quart, as there are very few in the market beside what Shaker Village produced. Brethren expect to finish haying (weather being good) to-morrow, the crop is very heavy and of good quality. Our Society Meeting commenced the second Sabbath in June and was opened to the public for the first time this season last Sunday. We had a select audience who were very respectful and attentive an.l why should they not be? Health of family and Society quite good, the weather is warm and dry. Potatoes are suffering for want of rain and will be a light crop unless we get some pretty soon. Fraternally yours, T. Kayson. Soixtli ITa-mily. Dear Editor :�Time is money just now, but we must boil down a few lines for you, or the blessed Manifesto. Since writing before, our people have painted two hundred windows so will not have that bill to pay but have not finished yet. Last week good brother Henry Mantle and two of our Sisters returned from Watervliet with a great deal of love and were very much refreshed ; well tried Elder Alexander Work, and two Sisters from Groveland were there at the time which made it very pleasant all around. The Manifesto reminds me of a good dinner it takes longer to prepare it than to devour it but we get hungry and want more. We at Mt. Lebanon do not know how to be thankful enough for the large supply of water we have had, since hearing Elder Alexander tell of the scarcity at Groveland. They came here to take the Census last week, and they wanted more than we could give. We are picking cherries, but have a small crop. S. A. C. Hancock, Mass. July, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�The rain is falling, thunder rolling, and lightning flashing! I have often heard of its 'raining pitchforks'' and think it comes as near being true this afternoon as it ever will; at all events I am glad to be sheltered from the fury of the storm that is raging without. I sent to your address in June a letter and some Bible Class papers; also answers to Bible question No. 8, but they must have gone astray or been mislaid, as our Society was not mentioned in the answers. But I do not mean to be discouraged, you perceive, but 'try, try again.'' Bible question No. 9, requires much .thought and research, but several have p-epared answers which I enclose. We thank you for providing this nice plan, inciting to the study of the Scriptures. The young people all feel an interest in it, and look fur the column devoted to the Bible Class as soon as the Manifesto is received The Ministry from Alfred, Me., arrived here early in the afternoon of June 25th. and remained with us till near the close of the next day, when they crossed the mountain to beautiful Mt. Lebanon. Their stay, though so short, was greatly enjoyed by us. The next day we were pleased to welcome Sisters Ella Winship and Elizabeth Sidle with whom we spent two very pleasant days. I wish I could tell you something more interesting, but one day is much like another, as mine are spent in the school-room, which is�oh, so warm these summer days. Sometimes of an afternoon, when we can endure it no longer, we ta'ke our books and sit for an hour in the grove near by. The children learn quite as good lessons and enjoy it very much. Our first term of school will close in two weeks. Br. Ira is having an addition built on the East end of the Office barn, thirty-six ft. long and twenty- four ft. wide and three stories high. It is now nearly completed. It is the intention, I think, to lay a bridge over the brook opposite the barn which will prevent the necessity of passing before the office with loads of hay, etc. I will send three Bible Class papers in another envelope Please accept an abundance of love from all Hancock friends for yourself and as far as you wish to extend.
