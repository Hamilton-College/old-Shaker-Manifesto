Hancock, Mass. July, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�The rain is falling, thunder rolling, and lightning flashing! I have often heard of its 'raining pitchforks'' and think it comes as near being true this afternoon as it ever will; at all events I am glad to be sheltered from the fury of the storm that is raging without. I sent to your address in June a letter and some Bible Class papers; also answers to Bible question No. 8, but they must have gone astray or been mislaid, as our Society was not mentioned in the answers. But I do not mean to be discouraged, you perceive, but 'try, try again.'' Bible question No. 9, requires much .thought and research, but several have p-epared answers which I enclose. We thank you for providing this nice plan, inciting to the study of the Scriptures. The young people all feel an interest in it, and look fur the column devoted to the Bible Class as soon as the Manifesto is received The Ministry from Alfred, Me., arrived here early in the afternoon of June 25th. and remained with us till near the close of the next day, when they crossed the mountain to beautiful Mt. Lebanon. Their stay, though so short, was greatly enjoyed by us. The next day we were pleased to welcome Sisters Ella Winship and Elizabeth Sidle with whom we spent two very pleasant days. I wish I could tell you something more interesting, but one day is much like another, as mine are spent in the school-room, which is�oh, so warm these summer days. Sometimes of an afternoon, when we can endure it no longer, we ta'ke our books and sit for an hour in the grove near by. The children learn quite as good lessons and enjoy it very much. Our first term of school will close in two weeks. Br. Ira is having an addition built on the East end of the Office barn, thirty-six ft. long and twenty- four ft. wide and three stories high. It is now nearly completed. It is the intention, I think, to lay a bridge over the brook opposite the barn which will prevent the necessity of passing before the office with loads of hay, etc. I will send three Bible Class papers in another envelope Please accept an abundance of love from all Hancock friends for yourself and as far as you wish to extend.
