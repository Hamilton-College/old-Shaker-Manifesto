Kind Words. We are under many obligations... We are under many obligations to our old friend Charles Clapp, of Union Village, Ohio, for late copies of the Western Star and Ga~ zette, both staunch Republican journals, published at Lebanon, Ohio. Also copies of the Shaker Manifesto, a bright little monthly quarto, setting forth in an able manner the faith and doctrine of what the world is pleased to call a 'peculiar people. ' The Shakers on account of thnse same peculiarities are entitled to the respect and admiration.of the world. No class of people have been oftene misrepresented by the press of the country and the public in general than the pious Shakers, and no class of people are less understood. As communionists they have stood the test for many years, and have flourished in spite of the scoffs and jeers of the world. If you desire something chaste and pure read the Manifesto.
