PROCRASTINATION DANIEL ORCUTT Procrastination is a besetting sin. Putting off, putting off! How many things are lost or periled by putting off. It is never safe to defer until tomorrow, that which should be done today. Of all the losses in consequence of delay, the greatest is the loss of the soul ! The Holy Spirit, and the still small voice of conscience, warn us of the danger of delay : and we see there is danger. We are on the stormy sea of life; we see the darkness gathering round, and the waves rolling high. We look for refuge, and hear the cry, 'Come un- to me !' 'Now is the accepted time ;' 'now is the day of salvation.' Do we heed the call of Christ, the good pilot ? or, are we waiting for 'a more convenient season ?' It will never come. We will not be saved unless we are anxiously willing to be saved. Put off, and we will go down, we will be lost! Hesitate not. Today, if we will hear his voice, 'harden not our hearts.' He nowhere promises to receive us tomorrow; tomorrow may be too late. He insures a safe passage in the 'Gospel Ark,' which is provided with 'bread of life and waters of salvation' in abundance ; but lie accepts only 'working hands.' 'Work out our own salvation.' The voyage is from time to eternity, and the Ark never 'puts back.' There are billows of Pride, rocks of Infidelity, quick-sands of Destruc-. tion and whirl-pools of Mammon to encounter, hxit the great Pilot knows them all, and He will safely guide us to the port of restâ€”all who put their trust in Hun.
