Whoever lives looking for pleasure only... Whoever lives looking for pleasure only, his senses uncontrolled immoderate in his enjoyments, idle and weak, the tempter will certainly overcome him, as the wind blows down a weak tree. Whoever lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well controlled, his enjoyments moderate, who is faithful and strong, the tempter will certainly not overcome him, any more than the wind overthrows a rocky mountain. â€”In the Alpha. -----Buddha.
