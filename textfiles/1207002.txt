A GODLY LIFE LOUISA SHERMAN 'A godly life has a voice, it speaks when the tongue is silent, and is either a constant attraction or a perfect reproof.' An attraction to those who love purity and goodness, and a reproof to those who love the ways of evil. Uprightness of life is of inestimable worth. 'The good alone are great;' whatever may be the qualifications of a human being, however much worldly wisdom they may possess, if they lack true moral virtue, 'if the truth is not written in their inward parts,' their whole life work will be a failure. Because we possess two natures, there is necessarily a conflict between good and evil in every heart. Blessed is the soul that has the strength and courage to resist evil ; who can say with the authority of his own free will, I can, and will deny myself of this wrong practice, of that unholy desire, of this injurious habit and that unsanctified manner. All our actions should be under the direction of conscience. God's voice in the human soul. Greater are they who govern their own spirits than kings or queens who ru;e empires. Let us learn to govern our thoughts ; they are the springs of action 'From purity of thought all pleasure springs, and from an humble spirit all our peace.' If the intents of the heart are right, there will be corresponding good effects flow therefrom. It is very necessary that in early life, we assiduously cultivate those principles, that shall lay the foundation of a godly life. Every day is a golden opportunity, which the all wise Father, SHAKER MANIFESTO. 147 and loving mother have placed in our hands for the purpose of self-improvement. Full time is awarded us for the cultivation and improvement of the noblest faculties of our being. Let us not idly squander it; but, in this precious seed-time, let us sow unto righteousness, purity and peace, that we may enjoy their immortal fruits, in that glorious inheritance which awaits the faithful in the blessed land of souls.
