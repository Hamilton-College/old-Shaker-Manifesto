Lumps in Starch or Gravy .—How true it is that, if wo observe and remember, we can learn something of every one we meet. A few days ago I learned from the poorest housekeeper I know something new tome— that salt added to the flour before the water, on stirring paste for starch or gravy, would prevent the flour from forming into lumps. Of course I used to salt both gravy and starch, but I never observed the good results of adding the salt first.
