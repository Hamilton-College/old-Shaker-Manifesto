DEATH-PENALTY. Fred'k. Gerhard. After the State of Michigan in 1846, and Ehode Island in 1852, had abolished the death-penalty, the State of Wisconsin in 1853 followed this laudable example of justice and humanity, and so it has been in these states for about forty years. During the last sessions of the Legislatures of Wisconsin and Michigan attempts were made to revive death-penalty, but rejected by a large majority, proving beyond doubt the public sentiment against the innovation proposed. In the last session of the Legislature of the State of New York, there was appointed a commission for the purpose of finding out a djeath-penalty 'more in accordance with humanity' than hanging. This commission, which has for said purpose been traveling in Europe, has reported recommending electricity.�-But is not the death-penalty in itself an inhumanity, a cruelty and a barbarism, belonging to former dark ages? Is not each and every mode of carrying out the deathpenalty, be it by hanging, decapitation, shooting, garrotting, electricity, poison or any other way a wilful killing, a murder? Should not our century, which has abolished the inhumanity and barbarism of slavery, following the example of Rhode Island, Michigan and Wisconsin, abolish also the inhumanity and useless barbarism of the death-penalty in all the other States of the Union, showing to the world by this newstep forward, that the United States in every respect are at the head of civilization? Let us consider this question in an unprejudiced way. The writer sincerely hopes, that his arguments for abolition set forth in the following lines are so strong and indisputable, that even those, who until now thought death-penalty indispensable, will come to another conclusion. The Bible says 'He who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed ' But, on the other hand, the Bible also says : 'Thou shalt not kill,' and we find here two passages 3iametrically opposed to each other, so that the advocates as well as the opponents of the death-penalty can base their arguments on the Bible. Let us, therefore, treat the question whether the death-penalty be just and fair from a purely human standpoint. The penal code has several theories for the death-penalty�namely, determent, retaliation (revenge) satisfaction for the state, and security for the state. The three latter have been pretty well abandoned, and the justification of the death-penalty is now mainly based on the theory of deterring by intimidation, insisting or supposing that an execution must be a warning to other-* not to commit a similar crime. But the penal code recognizes still another theory as the warrant for punishment in general, and that is the reformatory theory�the only one which is morally justified, but which cannot be considered in the case of a death-penalty; because, if a person be executed, there can be no intention of reforming him, and if we hang a man we deprive him, through violence, of all possibility of reformation; we rest satisfied with simply taking his life, murdering him. According1 to the passage : 'He who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,' in the death-penalty merely a remnant of 'vendetta' is exercised. In the cours'e of time, a milder practice has taken place even with regard to capital-punishment, horrible as it may be in itself, inasmuch as the law has ceased to torture the condemned, contenting itself with simply slaying them; the number of the crimes for which this punishment is prescribed has also been diminished, and has been reduced in all countries to that of murder�a great progress in comparison with the last century, when, in England, about a hundred different crimes were punishable by death. Among these was theft to the value of forty shillings�truly, a contemptible price for a human life! How morally debased were th opinions entertained at that time concerning punishment and the value of human life, is most strikingly illustrated by the fact that even a man of the high position of Lord Chancellor Eldon should have exclaimed, horror-stricken�on the occasion of a motion in Parliament for the abolition of this forty shilling law�'Why, by this innovation all I possess would be left entirely unprotected ! ' All this has been changed. Murder alone receives the death-penalty. Is it warranted even in this case? The celebrated authority of criminal law. Temme, speaks in one of his works as follows concerning punishment by death : 'Why do we still have the death-penalty, which is no punishment, but a cruelty, a barbarity? They say, to murder a human being, to annihilate a human life, is some thing so horrible, inhuman, unnatural, that it can be expiated only by the severest punishment? And in what do they find this severest punishment? They murder the murderer. They annihilate in cold blood his life, a second one in addition to the first! And the second murder they call right, justice, and for the murderer, who is to be murdered, special tortures have first to be created. The death-sentence is announced to the murderer weeks beforehand, and it is said to him : 'Thou shalt die a violent death. We will lead thee to the gallows, and there the servants of the executioner will seize thee, strap thee, and then the executioner will come to thee, and hang thee.' Thus the murderer will be murdered, after having had before his eyes for weeks and months the picture of his approaching cruel death. 'But, after all' they say to him, 'it is possible that you may be pardoned,' in order to make still more terrible, by the seconds of hope, the weeks and months of deadly anguish! And this they call justice, even Christian justice! ' The first step of the abolition of deathpenalty was made in 1764, by the celebrated Italian criminal lawyer Beccaria, the champion against capital punishment, by proving that this penalty had nevcr deterred criminals from inflicting harm upon society. But a long time elapsed before his endeavors bore the first fruits. In Tuscany the deathpenalty was abolished in 1786, and in Austria 1797. It was, however, re-enacted in Tuscany in 1852, but this roused such a storm of indignation, that the Government found itself forced to annul it once more. In Austria it was also re-enacted. In Germany the National Assembly of 1848 passed a resolution of abolition, which was put into effect in Oldenburg, Bremen, Nassau, Anhalt, and the kingdom of Saxony, but not permanently; for, at the establishment of the German Empire, when the reaction regained full power that resolution of the National Assembly of 1848 was annulled; and, since that time, intelligent Germany can again be proud of the fact, that in its domain murder will again be committed de jure. In Switzerland the death-penalty has been abolished in several Cantons, but has been re-enacted in some of them. In Holland it Mas abolished in 1870; and the same has been done in Portugal, Belgium and Roumania. Among the states of the American Union it was abolished in 1846 in Michigan, ' in 1852 by Rhode Island, and in 1853 by Wisconsin. The remaining states and the remaining foreign countries have not yet been able to attain the moral elevation requisite for this act of humanity, though in the States of Maine, Minnesota, Indiana and Vermont the law prescribing the death-penalty must be considered a dead letter, as no executions have taken place there for years. In 1887 the Central American States Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Guatemala entered into negotiations for forming a Union, similar to the United States, with the express condition, that the death-penalty in those states should be abolished. That the death-penalty as a means of deterring from crime is a complete mistake; that, on the contrary, the abolition of the death-penalty lessens the number of the worst crimes, whilst executions increase them, is proved by the experience of various countries. In Holland no parricide or matricide was committed in the ten years following the abolition, whilst these crimes oc- curred frequently in the fifty years preceding the abolition. In Tuscany it was shown that the abolition of the death-penalty led to no increase in the number of the crimes considered worthy of death; and the same result has followed the abolition in States of the Union. In Wurtemberg no death-sentence was executed under Karl Wilhelm : in (Jotha, none in fifty years, and in Eussia, under the Empress Elizabeth, none in twenty years, without this being followed very soon by further crimes punishable by death. An English prison-chaplain, who during his official career prepared 167 criminals for execution, has testified that of these 1G7 persons, 161 had been proved to have witnessed executions. There is evidence that people who had just seen an execution, only a few hours afterward, themselves committed murder. Can one, in the face of such testimony claim any validity for the theory of deterring by intimidation? Considering the frightful brutality in the intentional killing of a human being, considering the profoundly demoralizing effect which executions entail, and, from their very nature, must entail, one can indeed rot wonder that their result is not a decrease, but an increase of heinous crimes.
