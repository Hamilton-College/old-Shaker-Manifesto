A HELPING HAND The poor give more than the rich. This proposition holds good as a general principle. Money is by no means the only thing to give in this world ; neither do large gifts necessarily contribute more to the happiness of the receiver than small gifts. Go into any country and converse with the people. Ask who ministers most to their happiness. You will very likely be told of some venerated clergyman, whose salary has never been more than enough to barely support him; or some poor widow, who goes from house to house, like a ministering angel, wherever sorrow and suffering demand consolation and relief. It is astonishing how much one without money can give. A kind word, a helping hand, the warm sympathy that rejoices with those who do rejoice, and weeps with those who weep. No man is so poor, no woman is so poor, as not to be able to contribute largely to the happiness of those around them.
