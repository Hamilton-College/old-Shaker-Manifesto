Groveland, N. Y. Dec. 10, 1890. The morning dawns, the noonday wanes And night comes on apace; The seasons come, 'and seasons go A never ceasing chase. The weeks fly on with lightning speed And whirl the months away; The years they come and years they go Time's march makes no delay. The earth revolves and man evolves Dissolves this earthly frame, Yet sun and moon and stars above Forever shine the same. The mind Immortal e'er resolves To live expand and grow, Grow in the image of the Lord, And constant progress know. A few short days ago we were taking the last notes of the departing year 1889. This P. M. finds us again engaged in the same occupation, signing the final notes for the year 1890. Only a few more frosty mornings and the dear old year will be counted among the past.

George Estel Proprietor, and A. J. Crans Agent for the Victor Hay Press. Last week Brother William Bussell whose age numbers nine times nine, performed a bold and daring feat on his hands and feet. A long freight train became detached on a down grade, blockading the road he wished to cross, and not caring to be delayed by the untimely intrusion he found access to the opposite side by going underneath the Avaiting car, just as he finished his perilous journey the engine neared the detached portion and started the train, but William the brave was safe, and has agreed never to repeat such bravery. His fearless accomplishment commends him to the ranks of the heroic. Ice weather has dawned again in all its coldness, clearness, glory and beauty. Snow storms numberless call out tlie juvenile class whose jubilent spirits find jubilee in the fun of ascension and descension. D. G. D.
