New England Magazine Joseph Kirkland writes in the New England Magazine by far the best account of the great Chicago Fire that has found its way into print. He gives a straight, connected story of the progress of the fire, like a good newspaper man who knows how to group his facts into a telling, vivid and consecutive story. The article is fully illustrated from photographs furnished by Major Kirkland's Western publishers, who possess the best collection of the kind in the country.
