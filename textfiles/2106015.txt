NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. Apr. 30, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�Enclosed, please find the list of books, pamphlets, tracts, etc. with price, to be secured at the several families at Mt. Lebanon. Thank you for the advanced copy of the Manifesto. It is like the month (May) bright and betokens good things for the future. You truthfully remark that mankind are going up and not down. They are moving toward God the Father of light and the dispenser of all good gifts. A few more steps in this direction will lead them to acknowledge a heavenly Mother, and when she is found the wheels of progress, as Sister Emily Ofl'ord says in her excellent article, will roll more rapidly. The fire that was kindled in the first appearing of Christ, has been and is beingrekindled by her testimony. Believers should fan the flames and increase the fire by throwing into it those things which the spirit of God does not approve. The accumulated brush from orchards put on the asparagus bed was burned four days earlier than last year. By the help of a quart or two of kerosine it burned with rapidity. Is it not so with individuals? When prepared and willing to be helped, they are readily touched by the gospel fire and find enough to consume, as we by searching find the moth and the miller, the rubbish and dirt where we least expect it, upon cleaning our houses. 'Our God is a consuming fire.' She will not only clean out every vestige as small as a breast pin or a finger ring, that savors of a worldly life, but the very spirit that would keep that life alive. Not only sins committed, but the nature of sin that we all possess is embraced in the testimony of Mother, and whoever accepts this must part with their dearest idols. The idol may be a father, mother, son or daughter, husband or wife, selfish prop- erty�or some bad habit like smoking or chewing tobacco, it must eventually be consumed by the fire of truth. And happy and glorified is that soul 'who spares no idol, great or small.' Our good father, Elder Frederic, is still a prisoner. The wound is healing nicely. In mind lie is as active as ever, always reading or writing when not conversing or sleeping. We have finished house cleaning and have on hand two hundred dozen shirts to make. It would seem that every man and boy should own as much as one, but alas! alas!! Booth's 'Darkest England' tells the story and New York city might repeat it. Brethren are preparing gardens, and Sisters have raked the door-yards. Cows were turned out to pasture the 21st of present month, earlier than ever before known. If the readers of the Manifesto are interested in weather reports, there is a lively little paper called 'Words and Works,' that is printed at St. Louis, Mo., foretelling the state of the weather; and by it, we learn that frost and snow will give us one more call in May ere winter takes its final departure. In the meanwhile the grass will grow and flowers bloom, and seed-time and harvest will not fail, no more than can the love of the Gospel fail. O, there's a love that can never die, 'Tis pure as the heavens, warm as the sun in the noonday sky. It giveth life, health and endless joy, And liftcth souls from earth. O come ye needy, share this love, It is of heavenly birth. A. W. Enfield, Conn. May 8, 1891. With abundant reason for thankfulness for the blessings which surround us on every hand we are progressing heavenward. The scenery is delightful at the present time, trees in full bloom on every side, and although two severe frosts have visited our section of the Connecticut valley the past week, we do not despair of having some cherries and pears, but peaches will probably be a failuie. The work of potato planting has been very much assisted by the new Planter, which works well, and is a success. Oats are in and stocked down some ten days ago. Grass is looking well, and with a little rain now will be of great value to vegetation. The apple trees are coming forward, and hopes are entertained of a good yield. Our new Lawn Mower is highly prized in keeping the grass in good order around the dwellings. To beautify home within and without, is the duty of all Christians, therefore we would improve each and every opportunity to cleanse the sanctuary, that we may make those around us cheerful and happy, and also have a greeting ready for any who may come to seek for truth. M. Witham. Harvard, Mass. April 26, 1891. Deab Editok :�On the 15th of April we were again summoned to the bedside of one of our dear mothers, to see her spirit take its flight for the heavenly spheres. It was a joyful parting; there was not a tear of sorrow shed, for she died as she had lived a sunbeam of cheer and strength to all around her. All through her sickness she manifested the spirit of gratitude and love to those who were attending to her little wants. A gleam of cheer and sunshine was always on her countenance, and after receiving the little kindnesses which so many bestowed, she would always look up with a smile of thankfulness. Thus did our dear mother pass on to the higher stage of existence. She left the primary for the higher grade where all the faculties can be brought into use and develop what they cannot here, a full, perfect womanhood. The funeral of our Sister was attended on Sunday the 19th. Quite a company of her friends were present to give in their tribute of respect. A wise Quaker wrote, says George J. Holyoke, 'I expect to pass through this world but once. If therefore, there be any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it for I shall not pass this way again (in the body.) Let this be my epitaph. What I spent I had. What I saved I left behind. What I gave away I took with me.' Never have our doctrinal positions needed more helpers. Never before opportunities so ample and gi*and, with hopes so inspiring and glorious, ever and steadily pointing to an early revelation of the spirit of Christ in the true principles. Never, Heaven helping us, shall its dearly purchased banner of virgin purity and consecration be lowered by our consent. Around its standard, m;ule sacred by the heroic devotion of tLc living advocates of truth, let us battle on, hand in hand, heart to heart. Young Brethren and Sisters, we will stand by the noble principles of redemption to mankind, and by its living inspirations, and our Zion shall become as a beautiful tree. If there is inspiration in anything under the sun, should it not be in living in holiness, and redeeming our time? Like the spring that is opening upon us, why not look upward and draw down a new inspiration of spiritual life and strength. Two weeks since our dear editor sent a request to me to help him do a little missionary work by sending out some of our religious publications, and so spread a further knowledge of our faith. This invitation I can readily accept. Brethren and Sisters, can we not do a little in this line to help those who are doing so much? Let our dear editor see by the next month's issue that he is not alone in his noble work. Farming has commenced, though the spring seems quite backward. A few potatoes, peas, onions and beets have been planted. A. D. B. Canterbury, N. H. May 16, 1891. Time, like everything which belongs to time is marching rapidly along. Already the first quarter of the new year has passed into history, and has carried us from the severities of a winter climate to the inspiring influences of spring. New life has awakened the trees and plants and meadows, and they are budding and blossoming with a beauty that gives inspiration to every heart. God's beautiful gifts can never grow old. With spring comes the seed-time and through the careful management of this, the anticipation of a plentiful harvest. The gardeners are closely noticing every indication of the germinating of choice plants, as their summer hope of happiness depends to a certain extent on the growth of the indispensable asparagus, and then of the nice, early potatoes, as well as the corn, beans and peas. How hard and yet how interestedly we work to obtain a little food to assist in sustaining life. Our cherry and plum trees are now in full bloom. A good share of the cherries will be claimed by the red-breasted Kobin family, as compensation for their early, morning songs, while the plums will probably be appropriated to the uses of the curculio. Some persons advocate the planting of so many trees as to exhaust the labors of the insects and then have a supply of perfect fruit for table use. Many of our plum and cherry trees have been ruined by the black knot, and we fail to find a remedy to prevent this wholesale destruction. The introduction of an earthquake since our last, enters into the list of variations. It succeeded quite well in giving us a shock, and frightening us with an in or tm-earthly sound. Some through fright ran out of the houses, but finding themselves unharmed they soon returned to their dwellings and to their duties. On the 30th of last month Eldress Rosetta Cumings and Sr. Katie West from Enfield, N. H., made us a visit of one day, and on the *7th inst. Br. Wm. Wilson from the same Society, also called to see us for a few hours. All as gospel friends were made welcome to the blessings of our consecrated home. * Weather Record, for April, 1891.
