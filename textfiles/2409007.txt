CHILDHOOD. By Martha J. Anderson. Blest childhood ! happy, innocent and free, Rose-lipped and blushing as the dawning day With eyes as brilliant, and heart as gay As the gazelle who loveth liberty. Though glad the life and full of mirthful glee. Yet all the questioning through toil and play Show how unfolding thought and reason sway And mould the face that speaks sincerity. Oh, joyful hours of early spring-tide dreams! 204 THE MANIFESTO. Which lead by rippling stream and flowery glade, When all the imagery of lii'e but seems Like some fair picture on a canvas laid, ' Whose beauteous shades are like the sunset gleams, That from the expanding vision quickly fade.
