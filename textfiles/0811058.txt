Farm and Garden Our Opinions of Vegetables &amp; Fruits We have heretofore been favorably impressed with the Trophy and Canada Victor tomatoes. Acknowledging these to be good' I still, we have proved this season that the ! Acme is superior to any other variety known 284 THE SHAKER 'The Types of Christ,' which appeared a our August No, has been put in pamphlet to us. If there is a better, we would be glad to know it. We have tested the New Melon, The Surpriseâ€”and were disappointed at finding it inferior to the Sills' Hybrid. This latter, while not so juicy as the Green-Fleshed * Nutmeg, is every way its superior; and as a universal Musk-melon, we should deem it unequaled.
