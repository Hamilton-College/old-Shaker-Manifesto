PROGRESS. Elsie York. History, both sacred and profane, furnishes many valuable lessons to the thoughtful student of human nature. Especially interesting are the lives of some of the noted men of Israel, leaders among God's chosen people. What a contrast between the first king of the Israelites and the prophet who anointed him to his high office. In Samuel's career, we have an example of a thoroughly gcod life; always obedient to the voice of God, he was, consequently, tr le and upright in his dealings with the people under his immediate care. In Saul's case how different. While in obscure circumstances a good and unassuming man, l.e became, when raised to the high office of king, haughty and rebellious. *We can plainly see that in starting wrong by disobeying God, he cast a blight over his future lift'. Hud lie repented and honestly ;:ck.iowlerlgcd his error, he would have found a merciful, as well as a just God ; but to the sin of disobedience he added that of deception, gaining nothing thereby, but losing the greatest blessing, the favor of God. It would profit us little to know the errors of Saul's life if we did not realize the lessons to be learned from them. Much is said and written about the progress that has been made since those days, but it is evident that human nature remains very much the t-ame with all our present enlightenment. Even a child could comprehend the mistakes of Saul. Disobedience, deceitfalness and jealousy are only a few of the evils that mar the lives of many in this day ; but with the light of the gospel of Christ, which grows brighter as the years roll on, and the knowledge that 'the wages of sin is death,' let us find true progress in the subjection of all evil, cultivating rather, the virtues and graces of the Christian life.
