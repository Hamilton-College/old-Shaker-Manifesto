ELDER EADS' SHAKER THEOLOGY Bowling Green, Ky., Dec. 4, 1880. JRev. H. L. Bads, South Union, Ky. Dear Sir : You have my sincere thanks for your book of theology. For some of its thoughts you ought to. have the thanks of the whole Christian world; but as an old, tough Calvanist, I think we ought to congratulate ourselves that there are so few to present your peculiar theology as you do, for I am sure some of the elect would be drawn too far from the catechism. I shall take the book down to Elkton, as I go there to open court Monday, and I know that Rev. Gill of the Calvinistic church and Petree, will be glad to see it. As ever your friend, William L. Dulaney
