Pleasant Hill, Ky. Elder Henry :ï¿½We have tried to answer the Questions in the Nov. Manifesto, that had reference to the Bible. Our Sabbath School has sixty-two pupils, ten teachers, an organist, a superintendent and a secretary. M. C. S. Bldress Elizabeth Downing of the Order of Ministry and Sister Emily Hampton of Union Village, have just made us a visit of about one week. Elder Napoleon Brown has gone to South Union for a visit, and from his letters to the friends at home, we infer that he is having a very pleasant season with his gospel kindred. The questions in the 'Bible Class' column have called forth some replies, and we trust they may be beneficial. M. J.
