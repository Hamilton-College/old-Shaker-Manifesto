West Pittsfield. Jan. 10, 1893. Heke we are in the midst of a Berkshire winter, still striving to 'fear God and work righteousness.' Have thus far had but little snow, though it is now sifting down quite briskly, and the wind is whirling it in all directions. Cold weather has been plentiful. The water in our reservoir is frozen to the depth of seventeen or eighteen inches; and of the beautifully crystallized ice, a sufficient quantity has been secured for domestic purposes in the coming warm season. The sad accident which occurred here on the morning of the 14th ult. by which one of our workmen, a strong, healthy young man lost his life, was indeed shocking. An animal was being slaughtered, and while turning the windlass to raise the beef for the purpose of dressing, he slipped and fell forward thus losing his hold on the crank. This caused it to revolve rapidly, striking the man on the back of the head crushing in the skull. Medical aid was promptly obtained, but in two hours after the occurrence he ceased to breathe. How true it is, that 'in the midst of life we are in death,' and how necessary that we be prepared at all times to meet the grim messenger. The night preceding this dreadful event one of our tenants dreamed that an animal had just been slaughtered, and immediately thereafter saw a funeral procession. Our boy trapper has caught in the past summer and autumn thirty-eight woodchucks, four rabbits, two pole-cats and three foxes. The foxes were taken from their dormitory in the ground, and sold to outside parties who wished to domesticate them. Julia L. Sweet.
