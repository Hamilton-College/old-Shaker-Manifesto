SHAPING THE FUTURE BY J. G. WHITTIER We shape ourselves the joy or fear Of which the coming life is made, And fill our future atmosphere With sunshine or with shade. The tissues of the life to be We weave with colors all our own, And in the field of destiny We reap as we have sown. Still shall the soul around it call The shadows which it gathered here, And, painted on the eternal wall, The past shall reappear. Think ye the notes of holy song On Milton's tuneful ear have died? Think ye that Eaphael's angel throng Has vanished from his side? Oh, no ! we live our life again ; Or warmly touched, or coldly dim, The pictures of the past remainï¿½ Man's works shall follow him.
