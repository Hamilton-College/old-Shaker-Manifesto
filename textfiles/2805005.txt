FROM THE 'SOCIAL GOSPEL.' Christian Commonwealth that has been organized in the state of Georgia, is another effort made in the right direction, and whether it is of short or long duration, it has an educational influence in the line of Communism. We should wish the dear friends the best of success iu this new enterprise and shall hope that they may be able to meet in full, the spirit of their Constitution, which has this note;'The recognized unalterable organic law of the Christian Commonwealth shall be;'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and thy neighbor as thyself.' ' If this rule can be made a part of the life work of the little society then we might say of them in the words of Jesus;'Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God,' The Commonwealth has 931 acres of land. One orchard of 35 acres has peaches, plums, pears, apples, cherries and other fruits. Other acres are used for farming and gardening. Preachers, professors and poets have worked side by side. They have sermons on Sunday and talks and Bible studies and prayer meetings. The dear friends are learning even so soon, that a Society of men and women, must have a system of discipline, or there will be but little practical righteonsness. They say,'We have also learned that some need Christian correction and moral restraint, the individual conscience needing to be stirred up and educated by the more enlightened and by expressions of the general conscience.' This first step in advance, towaixl the Brotherhood of man is a lesson that may prove profitable, not only to the class directly interested in the movement, but also to others who have a silent inthrestin a corresponding 'Social Gospel,' fur the much needed advancement of the human family.
