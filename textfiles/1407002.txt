Truth, vs- Speculation, vs. Transition. GILES B. AVERY. The forms of material things pass away ; in like manner many speculations of theorists often prove transient; and, some teachings, that, in one age of human life pass for philosophy in an advanced age are proved to be but sophistry ; but, Truth remains! The sources of truth's manifestations or discoveries are two fold�revelation, through inspired media, and the researches of human reason. In all a^es of human history, there have been, through these sources, discoveries of measures of truth, both in relation to philosophies applicable to science and art, also to God, and the affinitive relations of man to his Creator, and his fellow beings, spiritually, affectionally, and sympathetically. And, though, in every age there has been, and still is, a vast amount of idealism which is simply speculative, therefore, destined to pass away, yet there have been measures of solid truth revealed and discovered which is as unchangeable as the orbits of the heavenly bodies ; or as the institutions of day and night. Passing away is impressed on all mutable, material ^.things ; and, as human progress discovers errors in speculative and ideal philosophies, properly termed sophistries, the excitable temperament of the human mind is such, that, with some constitutions, there is a tendency, under the influence of discovered errors, to doubt the existence of truth in any supposed and generally accepted revelation, or discovery of philosophic truth ; and, under a very ardent stimulus for change, some people are ready to condemn all degrees of conservatism, seeming to conceive the notion that mankind have no substantial basis of truth on which to rely, either in religion or philosophy ; while the fact remains, that all truth stands firmly amid the ravages of time, the demoralizations of dissipation, and the wreck of worlds, or the new discoveries of science. The fundamental principles of the Law of God revealed to, through, and by Moses, and recognized by Jesus.� i'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might; and thy neighbor as thyself.''�A law of Love to right doing, is a basis of life character necessary to human happiness that is securely and sacredly stored in the archives of the tabernacle of God; unchangeable as the Eternal Throne! And the myriad collateral ramifications of the principle of love to humanity and to God that have been evolved from this fountain, and disbursed to humanity in theological requisitions, many of which are interwoven into the fabrics of human creeds of theology, are measures of truth that are unchangeable, though, as a whole, these creeds may be quite untenable. Inspired media,�ascetics and recluses, have existed in all ages ; as Noah, Abraham, Moses, John the Baptist, Jesus, and a nameless host; these, prompted by the inspirations and illuminations of truth to them vouchsafed, as a fruit of their separation from the herd of humanity, and honest devotional seeking to God; for truth and wisdom, have been, in varied degrees, shining lights and conservators of truth and wisdom, and dispensers of the same to the human family ; and the truths they enunciated have been blessings to our race, and they are as eternal as God is true. No new discoveries ot truth theologically or scientifically obtained, can obliterate the manifestations and principles of truth previously revealed. A class of philosophers and scientists have been raised up from time to time, as Archimedes,. Copernicus, Newton, and others, too numerous to mention, of both more ancient and modern date, who have discovered principles of philosophic and scientific truth, that no progress of humanity can ever justly gainsay, or eradicate. Spirits of superior dignity, and minds of the largest ability and capacity to search for, perceive, and acquire truth and wisdom, have been, and ever will be, oracles to the masses, unto whom, as teachers of truth, the multitudes of the human family ever will, and must, necessarily seek, as teachers, and attach themselves as scholars and dependents, Noah, Abraham, Moses, John the Baptist, Jesus, and successors, many have been teachers of righteousness whose enunciations of truth, in measures adapted to the day and times in which they lived, and links in the vast chain of truth's revelations that shall embelt the world ; and their revelations of truth can never be ignored, justly, because they are steps in the march of human progress. The Noachian dispensation of righteousness was a school for the masses of that dispensation ; in like manner were the dispensations of Abraham, Moses and Jesus. The Christian dispensation is a school, and of its scholars some are constitutionally organized with capacities as teachers ; others as scholars ai-id learners of them, while, in turn, they are also learners of teachers in advance of them ; thus, on in gradations, up to the Eternal Throne.' The Christ Spirit and baptism is the Master in the Christian School! This Jesus beautifully taught as a government of God, through ft vicegerency,�A Theocracy. Thus, ' I came not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me.' John, vi., 38. 'I can of mine own self do nothing ; as I hear I judge, and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which sent me.' John, v., 30. 'And the Father, himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. ' John, v., 37. 'One is your master, even Christ, and all ye are brethren.' Matt, xxiii., 8, 10. This same government of God through mediation of the Christ Spirit was also beautifully taught as a theocracy by the Ministers of the testimony of Christ's Second Appearing, Ann and William Lee, as manifest on the following occasion. One Col. Smith came to see the Elders at David Meacham's, in Enfield, Ct. He asked, 'Is there not a woman here that is the head of the Church?' Mother Ann replied, 'Nay, Christ is the head of the Church.' Elder William Lee also said. ' We do not allow man nor woman to be the head of the Church.' 'But' (said Smith,) 'there is a woman here that teaches, is there not?' Elder William replied, 'We must not suffer man nor woman to teach, except they have the spirit of Christ in them, and then either man or woman may teach. ' But, while Christ's Church is in the state and capacity of the Church militant, that is, of the Kingdom of Heaven Order ' like a net cast into the sea, that gathers of every kind, which, when it is drawn ashore, men gather the good into vessels, but cast the bad away,'' there will be in it some who do not have the Spirit of Christ in them ; and, of course, could not, with propriety, be authorized to teach, nor exercise government in a democratic sense. And, when all the members of the Church of Christ are fully redeemed from all that is not of the Christ spirit, the baptism of the Father and Mother,� God, they will then be in the Father and the Father in them ; and not be ' many masters' but their united ministrations will be a full and complete government of God, as the Church triumphant over all the powers and passions that work divisions among men. This will be a perfect Theocracy,�A Church not ruled of man nor woman, but by the Christ Spirit�The Vicegerency of God ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
