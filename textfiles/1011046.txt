Poultry Vermin are the greatest pest to fowls. They are worse in the winter than at other times, because the fowls are confined more closely, and have not opportunities to free themselves. Lice may be destroyed by whitewashing the house and roofs with lime-wash mixed- with carbolic acid. Fleas may be destroyed by thoroughly greasing the roosts. Clean straw should be supplied to the nests, and glass nest-eggs provided for early layers. A glass-covered coop will be useful for an early sitting hen and a young brood of chickens.
