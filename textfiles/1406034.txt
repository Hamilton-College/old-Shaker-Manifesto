A NUT TO CRACK. There was an old man who lived in a hut About the size of a hickory nut; The walls were thick, and the ceiling low, And seldom out doors did the old man go. He took no paper, and in no book Of any sort was he seen to look. Yet he imagined he knew much more Than man or woman had known before. They talked in his hearing of wondrous things. Of the dazzling splendor of Eastern kings, Of mountains covered with ice and snow When all the valley lay green below. They spoke of adventures by sea and land, Of oceans and seas by a cable spanned, Of buried treasures ;ï¿½biit though he heard, He said he didn't believe one word ! And still he lives in his little hut About the size of a hickory nut, At peace with himself, and quite content With the way in which his days are spent. Little it troubles him, I suppose, Because so very little he knows, For keeping his doors and his windoMrs shut, He has shriveled up in his hickory nut. And you, my dears, will no larger grow If you rest contented with what you know, But a pitiful object you will dwell, Shut up inside of your hickory shell. Josephine Pollard.
