TWILIGHT REFLECTION 1. When the soft shades of twilight drop over our way, Like curtains let down from on high, When life's busy scenes that have crowded the day, 2. O, this is the season when calm, holy thought Like tidewaves our spirits o'er-flow, While truest of pictures our life-deeds have wrought, 3. Then oft let us pause mid the con-flict and strife, The counsel of wisdom to heed, To ask for a fore-taste of heavenly life, Have pass'd with the light from the sky; Tis then that the spirit should rise and take flight, From tumult of earth and its care, Reflection shall over us throw, Till clearly portrayed on the vision within, Each motive and action will be, To satisfy immortal need; And when the deep shadows of time close around, When life's fairest day-beams are past, And seek sweet repose on the shadow less height, Communion with angels to share. The glory of goodness, the darkness of sin, In joy or in sorrow we see. May light from beyond us our path way surround, For ever and ever to last.
