Editor Manifesto: Allow me to thank... Millville, N. J. Sept. 1886. Editor Manifesto :ï¿½Allow me to thank you for your Magazine, The MANIFESTO, which is a constant visitor to our Library. I would say, it is eagerly sought for by the people who visit the Library, and I believe it is a promoter of good. It is read by several who can hardly wait for it to come. It is as good a Magazine as comes to the Library. I often read it and get much good from it. Respectfully, Samuel Fox. Librarian.
