The sick squaw of a dusky chief in Washington Territory... The sick squaw of a dusky chief in Washington Territory lately told her noble husband that she didn't think that she should ever feel any better unless he killed her doctor. This is a novel and startling view of medical matters, and interesting to the profession. The doctor was duly killed ; and upon being tried for his murder, the chief was acquitted on the ground that he acted in defense of his wife's life! The doctors in those regions must feel a little doubtful about continuing in the business under such circumstances.
