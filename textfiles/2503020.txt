East Canterbury N. H. Feb. 1895. Since our last we have secured the ice harvest which is thought by some persons to be one of the important things of the season. Not less than 103 tons was securely packed in the ice-house, and this of excellent quality and not less than sixteen inches in thickness. At the present time there is a great scarcity of water in this part of New Hampshire and some farmers are obliged to drive their stock not less than half a mile to procure the much needed supply. Our reservoirs have failed us and we are really suffering from a water famine. All that is used for domestic purposes must be pumped from the wells and carried in pails to all places where it may be wanted. As all our Laundry work and our machinery for knitting and for printing are dependent upon steam power, we are forced to shut down and wait patiently till the arrival of a few warmer days, as the melting of snow and ice does not progress very rapidly when the mercury is 16 deg. below zero. The water for some one hundred head of cattle is hauled from a pond at a distance of about one half a mile and after being turned into the trough is warmed by a very curious stove that is placed in the trough, mostly under water. All the water that the cows drink through the winter is warmed in this manner, and the herdsmen consider this arrangement a very valuable acquisition. The 100 tons of ensilage is not quite all gone, as it has been used very sparingly the past month, and only fed to special animals. Fiftynine gallons of milk from a herd of twenty-three cows is carried to the dairy each day. We have had nearly a week in which to study the freaks of the blizzard. The wind whirling around the buildings, trees and fences, piled the snow into huge drifts and for several days made all traveling a matter of much anxiety. II. C. Blinn.
