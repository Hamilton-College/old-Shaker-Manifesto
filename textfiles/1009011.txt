SAY WELL AND DO WELL E. MYRICK In closing a sermon on ' Good Works and Good Words,' Dean Stanley of Westminster quoted the following lines which some suppose were written by one of the earliest Deans of Westminster . Say well is good, but do well is better; Do well seems the spirit, say well is the letter; Say well is goodly, and helps to please ; But do well is godly, and gives the world ease ; Sa}r well to silence sometimes is bound ; But do well is free on every ground. Say well has friends, some here, some there, But do well is welcome everywhere, By say well many to God's word cleave; But for lack of do well it often leave, If say well and do well were bound in one frame Then all were done, all were one, and gotten were gain. Esteemed Brother Albert: I send you the inclosed : ' Sap well and Do well.' And as good comes to us by littles, it may do a little good. The ancient prophet said : 'As the days of a tree are the days of my people;' — seasons of growth and also seasons of seeming death— latent life. Our modern prophetess predicted 'days and nights,' seed time, harvest and winter. Have we not witnessed the spring time of hope, ' signs and wonders,' of seed sowing in receptive soil ? The summer growth, the autumn harvest ? And shall we be dismayed at the silent winter? A season in which all life seems extinct.
