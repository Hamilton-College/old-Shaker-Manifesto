'THY KINGDOM COME.' By Lizzie D. Horton. THE kingdom of Christ, which we pray may be establshed upon the earth, does not come with display, for it is the enthronement of Christ in each individual life. Its perfect consummation, will be the obedience rendered to the will of God. The law of this heavenly kingdom is love; as its principles of righteousness and peace are made the guiding and controling elements in the hearts of men, the knowledge of the truth, is extended to all people. It was the mission of Jesus to lay the foundation of this spiritnal kingdom and having taught many truths as the laws for its government, he left with his disciples, instructions for its growth and development, commanding them ; 'Go ye therefore and teach all nations,' baptizing them through faith and love, as members of the kingdom of God or Christ Church, of which Jesus is the 'corner-stone' its life and the source of its power. The majority of those who followed Jesus, failed to understand the distinction between the Kingdom with its spiritual rulership, and the earthly kingdom which they Iiad expected he should establish in Jerusalem, and many discussions arose from time to time, as to which of them should be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Jesus taught them that these distinctions did not exist in his kingdom, but the highest place should be given to him who was most willing to be the least, or servant of all. 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' In this kingdom, there are neither rich nor poor, high nor low, as shown in the words of the Divine Teacher,'I have not called you servants, but I have called you friends,' also, 'I am among you as he that serveth.' As we accept the life of Christ, just so far are we able to proclaim his mission of peace and good-will. When Christ reigns as King the powers of darkness will be dispelled by the light of that spirit which fashions the life according to the perfect Pattern. East Canterbury, N. H.
