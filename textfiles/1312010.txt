PETITION. SUSAN C. HALL. Search Thou and try me, Lord, and see If all my powers are turned to Thee; If all my motives, aims and strife, Tend only to a noble life. Search Thou and try me, Lord, and find If in all cases, I'm resigned To be, to do, to act or share The burdens which are mine to bear. Search deeper still my heart, I pray, Until the record of each day Meets thy acceptance fully, Lord, In thought and purpose, deed and word. Canterbury, N. H.
