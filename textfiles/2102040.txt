WATCHMEN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT? Hamilton De Graw. 'I see a light on the distant horizon; Its rays illumine the path of the just And betaken the coming morning.' Glorious announcement. We thank thee watchman on the ramparts, for telling us that the night is past. Like a flood of inspirational life and power it comes to the weary and worn toiler in the valley. Courage and strength is renewed. Ministering angels are ascending and descending the shining way, telling the indwellers of ea-th that a new day is dawning. The false systems that have become fossilized and mummified, offer no inducements to the awakening thought of the age. Give us light that we may clearly see the way and the duty we owe to the cause and to our fellow men; and courage to follow that light is the Macedonian cry given in tones that indicate earnestness of purpose. The spirit of the iconoclast is abroad. In the words of the poet Whittierï¿½ 'All grim with toil and brown with tan, I saw a strong one in his wrath; Smiting the (iodless shrines of man Along his path.' Bgfore this grand superstructure, revealed by the light of the coming day, can be dedicated to the cause of the spiritual unfoldment of man, the rubbish of ages must be removed. The demolishers cannot at all times be the builders ; but their mission is a necessary one for human unfoldment. We cannot accept the Agnosticism of the Ingersoll school of thinkers. It is as twilight as compared to the noonday sun. But the terrific onslaughts they are making on the citadel of antichristian creeds and dogmas is beginning to be felt in their weakening power and hold upon mankind. The pendulum's swing is at present in the direction of a materialistic train of thought. Charity and forbearance should be extended to those honest souls, who, reared in the school of dogmatic theology, are at present on the sea of doubt, by those who have been spiritually illuminated. From an editorial in 'Christian Science Thought' for June 1890 we quote the following prophetic words. i;On every hand are the signs of the new dispensation which is shortly to assert its sway on earth. Celestial societies whose song is peace on earth and good will to men, are now organizing their earthly choirs, and we shall soon hear that divine song sung by pure unselfish bands of faithful followers of the good in every clime.' The beginning of a new reformation is at hand in the religious, social, political and industrial world. As much as the nineteenth century is in advance of the sixteenth in the material comforts for the masses, so will the new reformation eclipse the old in its deeper spiritual enlightenment and the possibilities that are unfolding to the soul of man of a higher and more exalted destiny than at present has been revealed to him. The immutable law of growth or decay is stamped upon all human institutions. 'Upward the star of empire takes its way.' In the ever unfolding cycle of advance thought, all dead and decaying matter must be cast away. Wrong will die of its own inherent weakness. 'Truth crushed to earth will rise again, The eternal years of God are hers; While error wounded, writhes with pain And dies among her worshipers.' Groveland, N. Y.
