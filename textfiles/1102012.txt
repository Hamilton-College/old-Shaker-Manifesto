'LET HIM TELL A DREAM'-Jer. O. PRENTISS Fifty-nine years ago, I had a dream. Journeying from east to west, like the cars of progress, I found many hills to climb and descend. After each hill a swamp — here, I had to hop from bog to bog, occasionally slipping between—a long and toilsome journey. Having ascended and descended all the little hills, and passed all the swamps, I was on terra firma, gradually ascending a mighty big hill. The way was rough, rocky and thorny—growing steeper all the way. After a long, laborious climb, an apparently insurmountable precipice, not much unlike the wall, on the Canada side, at the foot of Niagara Falls, Table Rock and all, seemed to effectually block my further progress. Did I give it up ? By efforts Herculean I climbed, getting both arms on the Table Rock, and resting from my labors a moment, one more effort carried me clear from the penitentiary. On the border of a gently ascending plane, a land of calm sunshine and gentle breezes, perpetual verdure and perpetual bloom, what do I now care for the trying scenes of the past ? I bless my saints for those heart-searching ordeals, enabling me to decide the question —am I a vertebrate—viz., only a reptile ? For a brief period, after reaching the plane, the rugged path I had trodden was in full view. Passing cozily on, the gently ascending, ever-increasing in beauty plane, the 38 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. rugged ordeals vanished from sight—from recollection. I told the dream to Elder Calvin Wells. He said, ' It is a gift to you—an epitome of your life's journey.' I'm not disposed now to question his interpretation. In this, or in some of the worlds without end, amen, all souls must have penitentiary graduation, either voluntary or by compulsion. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
