Enfield, N. H. Mar. 15, 1891. Dear Editor:ï¿½JS[oiv we know, having read the very interesting and much-prized 'Memorial' of our revered and saintly Elder Giles, why the Manifesto was just a bit tardy in reaching us; it must have been quite an addition in the printers' department, but the genuine satisfaction enjoyed by many kindred souls in its perusal, and the conviction it should carry to earth's seeking, sorrowing children, we hope may bless and fully compensate your worthy efforts. May it not only serve to keep green his memory, but also perpetuate in others, yet with us in body, his Christ-like spirit and example. Do not think us 'fault-finders,' because we mention the late arrival of our little messenger, not at all, it is like this: some of us have kindled our zeal anew, in the line of Bible questions which it furnishes, so if we have only one Sabbath to 'Search the Scriptures,' concordance etc., we might be a little late too, had we not some ancient worthy to help untie the Gordian knot; at present writing, our zeal is very commendable, and if it does not prove as our good Br. Chase Allard often said of our zeal in worship, 'like a shaving fire,' it will be of real benefit. There is not very much we can say this time, and it is little matter, the months recede so rapidly; evidently we have not struck the exact key to produce a real 'Home Note,' but yet, if these few words cause any of our dear friends in any part of the universe, to send us a kindly thought we shall be convinced that they had the right ring all the same.
