-Alfred., Me. Sept. 1899. We regret to hear that the publication of The Manifesto must be discontinued. We wish to thank the Editor and publishers for their efforts to continue it as long as they have under the pressure of so many financial difficulties. On Aug. 26, through the kindness of the Portland and Rochester R. R. our young people enjoyed an excursion into the city of Portland, and after a sail to Peak's Is. where lunch was served, we returned to the city and took a ride of about five miles on the electrics, arriving home at 1 p. m. tired and glad to be in our quiet home again. We hope to be blessed with an abundance of rain before long, for the springs and wells are failing us and all the water for kitchen and laundry purposes has to be pumped. The spring that supplies the tank at the foot of our hill where the trains fill their boilers, which has never been known to fail since the railroad was built, some thirty years ago, in now so low that the Railroad Company have had to put in a steam pump to pump the water from the lake into the tank. The sweet corn is being harvested and taken to the corn factory. We find the amount from 15 acres to be 28,Yo9 lbs. after being cut off ready for the cans. Eva M. Libbey.
