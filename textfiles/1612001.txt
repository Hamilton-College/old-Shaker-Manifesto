CHARITY. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. ' Charity! Love! rejoicetli not in iniquity, hut rejoiceth in the truth. ' 1. Cor- xiii., 6. There is no class of persons in the world so dangerous and so numerous as those who rejoice in iniquity, and still do not know what manner of spirit they are of; being full of iniquity or inequality, so that if they rejoice at all they rejoice in that element which predominates over them. 'Vengeance is mine I will repay, saith the Lord. ' It is ours to love and bless. Vengeance alone belongs to God. It is ours to love and bless in living a life of righteousness. In all the calamities in th c. world we see the angel of mercy goes hand in hand with the angel of judgment and in the most serious disasters as soon as circumstances will admit, in all cases we see the hand of mercy is stretched out for the relief of the poor sufferers. In this we see God is a God of mercy as well as of justice and truth. Hell and destruction is not the law of our God without mercy. This was manifest in past ages, and is manifest in this day. Admitting that the spirit of antichrist has commenced his second reign upon earth and history is repeating itself; what better condition of things could we expect under an infidel power ''until the indignation is past' which is manifest in these calamities which are the natural elements combinedï¿½Air, Earth, Fire, and Water which are God's agencies which he has employed in all ages of the world, for the punishment of crime, and workers of iniquity. The day is come for all to beware at what fountain they drink and with what spirit they unite, for many false spirits have gone out into the world, and will, if possible deceive the very elect. And as the testimony of Noah condemned the old world, so does the testimony of Christ's second appearing condemn the present generation. North Union, Ohio.
