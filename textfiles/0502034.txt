A MERRY CHRISTMAS December 25,1874. Elder Frederick — Beloved Father in Christ —Permit me, on this, my first Christmas with you, to acknowledge, while I gratefully remember your many acts and words of kindness to me, during my residence with you. The labors of your pen have been to me like water to the traveler on the barren desert — like refreshing showers from heaven to the parched earth. And now, on this recurring festival, let me congratulate you on the peace and happiness enjoyed by your flock. May you long be spared to minister to an ever-increasing family — to witness many returns of this joyous and happy season. Such is the prayer of Yours truly in the Gospel, David Gill, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
