MOTHER ANN LEE. By Sadie Webber. THIS day, March 1, 1897, we commemorate the one hundred and sixty_L first anniversary of the birth of Mother Ann Lee. To a humble home, in England, she came, and tho her parentage, was the most common and lowly we know her life work has been no common mission. Many incidents may be compared with the life of Jesus. Her lowly birth,�was he not cradled in a manger? Her religious fervor and conviction, both for her own soul, and for humanity,�and greatest of all the freedom which she brought to woman. Whether it is recognized as a truth or not, by the world at the present day, the foundation stone of the great 'Woman's Rights Movement,' which agitates the minds of so many, was laid in the gospel work of Mother Ann Lee. It began in America, more than one hundred years ago. At the age of thirty-four, Mother Ann was recognized as standing at the head of our Church. Her Ministry was wrought out through the deepest tribulation ; and through mental and physical suffering she obtained the just title of 'Mother.' Indeed the mother spirit was ever manifest with her. Atone time she said, 'I only chasten you that I may bring your souls nearer to my soul.' No reasoning mind can doubt that her ministrations were from God. Never has a woman been ordained for so divine a mission. Many have come like wolves in sheep's clothing, declaring themselves to.be the Christ, but inevitably their purpose has been traced to some selfish design. Not so, our Mother; as the years have rolled by, her name has grown brighter and more exalted. Let us speak and live in honor to her name, as she taught that 'Those who voluntarily take up their crosses in this world, and faithfully endure to the end, will be bright and more glorious than will other souls, they will be kings and priests unto God.' With this beautiful life before us, we can but exclaim;� 'O my Mother, my blessed Mother, Her name to me is dear, I'll praise her name, I'll spread her fame And kings and priests shall hear.
