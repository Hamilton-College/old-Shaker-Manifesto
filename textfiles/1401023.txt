[Juvenile] Letter Box Enfield, Conn., 1883 Dear Children ;â€”It is time to turn over a new leaf in the volume of your lives. Let the page be free from blots. You cannot recall your past mistakes, but they may serve as warnings for the future. Profit by dear bought experience. Form good vows and keep them. You must deny self, to gain immortal riches. Selfishness should be despised, fought and conquered. Perform the duty of the moment, whatever it may be ; prepare for the future, by improving the present; prepare for death, by living aright now. Truth and purity are sure to win. Strive for a life that shall realize these virtues. No good effort is lost; what you desire, you endeavor to obtain. By desiring what is virtuous, you may become a power against evil. Abound in goodness, grow in holiness. Let the daily service of your lives be an offering of 'a sweet savor unto the Lord.' Let each moment tell for good. Life is none too long for repentance. 'As every grain of gold is valuable, so is each moment of time.' How much time is lost! Wasted hours count up fast. Gather the fragments of precious time, and make of them something of moment that will benefit you. Gather the crumbs of happiness, to give brightness to your lives, and make the way more cheerful. Garner the fragments of spiritual food into your souls, to nourish, and strengthen, and beautify; let none be lost. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt
