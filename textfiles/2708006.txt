THE ANGELS JUST OVER THE WAY. A kind, gentle whisper came wafted along, An impress it made on my feelings so strong, I listened, assured, the sweet accents belong To Angels just over the way. The longer I listened, the more I felt sure The melodious breathings, so holy and pure, Were only the pulsings of those who secure A birthright with Angels to stay. As I pensively mused, in a querying mood, Whence came this effusion, so cheering and good, Spreading o'er and around me like aerial flood, All pure and entrancing to me? The whisper replied, as tho from the sphere, Where nothing but goodness could ever appear, 'Tis the bond of true friendship, untarnisht, sincere, Of Angels just over the way. Can it be? I again askt the ministering Guest, Tha,t earth ever garnered a treasure so blest, So lofty, so noble, so fully possest Of sacred felicity, boundless and pure? Once more the sweet spirit replied: It is true. This good is the solace that Time brings to view And this tow'ring upward, will ever be new, Eternally, heavenly, socially sure. The joys and the pleasures which true hearts possess, The sweet consolation which naught can repress, Will brighten in lustre as Godward they press, With Angels just over the way. And there the strong bond of true friendship will be Unfailing and cheering thro Eternity, And unsullied union and felicity Will make all such Angels forever to stay. Thus our Sister has woven her garments divine, By virtuous actions with beauty they shine, Her life work of goodness has made her sublime, An Angel of eternal day. Her robe and her crown are spotless and white, Her spirit refined with Christianity's light Has made her credentials a compromised right, With Angels of glory to stay. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
