From the Little Children. Dear teacher Josephine: I have been looking at... Village, Mer. Co., N. H. Dear Teacher Josephine :ï¿½I have been looking at the evergreen trees in our front door-yard and I have learned that every Spring they form new leaves the leaves do not fall off in Autumn as the leaves of other trees they begin to change at the ends of the boughs. The new leaves are bright green and are very tender when they are fresh. I have noticed that the leaves of the peach tree are notched so fine that I think that no one could if they tried imitate them. I am trying to learn all I can while I am young so that when I am older I can be a help in society. Your Sister E. B. K. GOING TO SCHOOL. As I walk to school I will describe what I see, when I get started on the side walk, first there are some Willows, Poplars, and Maple are all the way down to school on the left side are some Lilac bushes, Ilackmetack, Crab apple tree, Ash, Apple trees, Horse Chestnut, Pine and fir trees, when I get past two white houses on the left hand side, there is a field with a large quantity of grass and clover, next to that is a smaller place with a fencing around it and. has Pine, Fir and Spruce, and Maple trees some violets grow there, next are rose bushes and the school house itself. J. L. W. TREES. As I sit thinking of a subject I am in a position where I can see a great many trees the names of which are the Maple, Apple, Plum, Peach, Cherry, and Evergreen. All these bear fruit excepting the Maple. I noticed as I had a long walk Tuesday evening with Sister Jeannette the Plum and Apple trees were the prettiest because they had the most blossoms. The Benoni tree was the prettiest one every place and space was filled this way I like to see trees look and I think every body does too. M. M.
