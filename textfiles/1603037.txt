TREES. As I sit thinking of a subject I am in a position where I can see a great many trees the names of which are the Maple, Apple, Plum, Peach, Cherry, and Evergreen. All these bear fruit excepting the Maple. I noticed as I had a long walk Tuesday evening with Sister Jeannette the Plum and Apple trees were the prettiest because they had the most blossoms. The Benoni tree was the prettiest one every place and space was filled this way I like to see trees look and I think every body does too. M. M.
