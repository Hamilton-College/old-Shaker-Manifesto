An Aged Reformer F. W. EVANS In conversation, this morning, with an octogenarian brother, he related to me his experience. Pointing to a tobacco-box in a pigeon-hole over his lead, he said ' For scvcitty-one years [ chewed tobacco. For the last jive vears I have not taken a particle.' Opening a drawer, he handed out a arge can, half filled with what he called the best quality of tobacco, saying: 'I left using the narcotic voluntarily. It did not injure my health. But it was a great act of self-denial. In the spiritworld, I shall not be afflicted by a desire for tobacco. It is far easier to break a bad habit here than there.'
