Our Picnic Hymn Hail to the Gospel, in union cementing, Hearts that are loving, together in one; Hail to the voice from the pure heart ascending, Heavenly Father, thy pleasure be done. Here with the skies shining brightly above us, Here from the green grove and wild flowers around, Here to the father and mother who love us, Let our glad voices to Heaven resound. Light as the zephyr that's whispering lowly— Fleeting as Summer clouds flying above— Earth, are thy grandner and fame to the holy; Time, are thy pleasures compared to our love. We are united as sister and brother; Golden the chords that encircle our heart; Living and loving, for God and each other, Heaven uniting what man cannot part. Groves where the frost, and the wintry winds never, Blight on their vesture of beauty bestow; Flowers, whose fragrance is living forever, Bloom but to welcome us whither we go. Light be our hearts as the merry birds singing, Anthems of praise as they hasten away; Glad be hereafter, our memory clinging Fondly to thoughts of our union to-day. E. T. Leggett
