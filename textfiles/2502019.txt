South. Union, Ky. Dec. 1894. Fakewell, Dear Old Year, thou art dying, dying: thou art fading, while around me the evening shadows softly fall. I sit alone watching the tall stately pines bend and bow to each gentle breeze, the sun reflecting its soft mellow light over our landscape and it presents a picture too lovely for description. I wonder how many at this sacred hour are turning over the pages of their past history, calling to memory the good and noble deeds they have done. Beautiful old year. While we list to thy last faint whisper, no tear-stains are upon our cheeks, no bitter regrets. Let us not mourn thy departure but let us be glad with new and firm resolutions for the New Year. Let us so live that in after years we will sweetly cherish thy remembrance. Help us to be wise, patient, kind, gentle and charitable. True charity attempts not to close our eyes to the distinction between good and bad; toward our enemies it inspires forgiveness and a solicitude for their welfare; it forms gentleness of temper, a comforter of the afflicted a protector of the oppressed. Farewell Old Year! with glad tidings for the happy new. May health, peace and prosperity be tended to all. Accept much love and good wishes with respect and gratitude. Birdie Henderson.
