STRENGTH FOR TO-DAY. [Contributed by Nancy Dowe.] Strength for to-day is all that we need, As there never will be a to-morrow; For to-morrow will prove but another today With its measure of joy and sorrow. Then why forecast the trials of life With much sad and grave persistence, And wait and watch for a crowd of ills That as yet have no existence? Strength for to-day; what a precious boon For earnest souls who labor, For the willing hands that minister To the needy fm-nd or neighbor. Strength for to-day, that the weary hearts In the battle for right may quail not, And the eyes bedimmed by bitter tears In their search for light may fail not. Strength for to-day on the down-hill track For the travelers nearing the valley, That up, far up on the other side, Ere long they may r;illy. Strength for to-day, that our precious youth May happily shun temptation, [sun And build from the rise to the set of the On a strong and sure foundation. Strength for to-day in house and home To practice forbearance sweetly; To scatter kind words and loving deeds, Still trusting in God completely. Strength for to-day is all that we need, As there never will be a to-morrow; For to-morrow will prove but another to-day, With its measure of joy and sorrow. ï¿½Selected.
