CORRESPONDENCE Beloved Eldress Antoinette : In perusing a late number of the Shaker and Shakeress, I was deeply interested and edified with the article headed ' Courage Toilers.' As I view the present condition of society, the aspect presents cause for great courage and patient toiling, on the part of those who possess wisdom, and have the ability to work for the elevation and redemption of the human race. There is need that every effort be directed to aid the Gospel work; that Truth may triumph, and the voice of Reason and Conscience may be heard. We should not be encouraged, if we feel that the work progresses slowly ; rather let us enter into the sublime patience of the Lord, and trust Him to weave our little threads (one at a time) into the great web, though the whole pattern is not shown us. God's people must be willing to labor and wait for the fruit; remembering that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and that the grand harvest of the ages shall come to its reaping in good time, and the day shall broaden into a thousand years, and the thousand shall show one perfect and finished day. I realize that I am but as a grain of sand, possessing neither large talent, nor power. But my sympathy and prayers are enlisted in the glorious cause of advancing truth ; and I will strive to ' let Patience have her perfect work,' and bring forth her celestial fruits. Angels bless the patient in spirit, and let us all be co-laborers with them; and while we toil to sow the good seed, and look around us for duties to perform, let us look up to a higher source for strength to discharge those duties, and for our reward. Our Captain and Pattern said, ' Lo, I am with you always!' With such a promise to cheer us onward, why should we not willingly toil and pray — trusting in humble confidence — giving our hearts to God in grateful adoration ? Maria Witham, Enfield, Ct.
