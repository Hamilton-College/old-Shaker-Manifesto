LIFE'S TRUE SIGNIFICANCE. Deeper than all sense of seeing Lies the secret source of being, And the soul with truth agreeing Learns to live in thoughts and deeds : For the life is more than raiment, And the earth is pledged ior payment Unto man for all his needs. Nature is our common mother, Every living man our brother. Therefore let us serve each other; Not to meet the law's behests, But because through cheerful giving We shall learn the art of living; And to live and serve is best. Life is more than what man fancies ; Not a game of idle chances; But it steadily advances Up the rugged height of time, Till each complex web of trouble, Every sad hope's broken bubble, Hath a meaning most sublime. More religion, less profession ; More of firmness, less concession ; More of freedom, less oppression, In the church, and in the state; More of life and less of fashion, More of love and less of passion: That will make us good and great. When true hearts divinely gifted, From the chaff of error sifted, On their crosses are uplifted, Shall the world most clearly see That earth's greatest time of trial Calls for holy self-denial, Calls for men to do and be. But forever and forever Let it be the soul's endeavor Love from hatred to dissever. And in whatsoe'er we do, 'Won by love's eternal beauty. To our highest sense of duty Evermore be firm and true.
