The general average of mankind... The general average of mankind are not only moderate in intellect but also moderate in inclinations ; they have no tastes nor wishes strong enough to incline them to do any thing unusual, and they consequently do not understand those who have, and class all such with the wild and intemperate whom they persecuted, and then worshipped. Food or drink should never be taken into the mouth either hot or cold, but near the temperature of the blood.
