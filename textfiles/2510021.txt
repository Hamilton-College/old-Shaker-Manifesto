Sabbathday Lake, Me. Sept. 1895. We have recently enjoyed a very pleasant visit with Elder William Anderson of Mt. Lebanon who called on business, thus 238 THE MANIFESTO. blessing us with his presence for several days; during which time he was kindly imparting interesting reminiscences of his life and gospel experience which afforded us all much pleasure. At this time we have with us live lovely Sisters from Enfield N. H. ia., Sr. Julia Russell, a precious and well loved friend whom we met to love long ago, also Srs. Emma Spooner, Almira Elkins, Katie West and Eva Mellen, all souls of sterling worth to the Society unto which they belong and we are made happier by their t;irry among us. We have felt the need of rain in our vicinity and many things have grown brown and seal before their time. At this writing we are having a large well dug on top of the hill west of the buildings which we are in hopes will supply our Village with a good means of irrigation by another summer. Fruit is very scarce. Apples are the fewest that have been known for years. Vegetables of all kinds are extra in quality and quantity. Corn very fine. During the busy summer we have striven to maintain the Cause of Truth and now as it is already waning we wish to keep our spirits alive and not let the testimony of God wane within our own souls.
