CARE OF THE EYES 1. Rest the eyes for a few minutes when the sight becomes in the least painful, blurred or indistinct. 2. Have sufficient light; never sit facing it; let it come from behind or from one side. The writer considers too much light almost as bad as too little. He strongly recommends a moderate light, so that surrounding objects may not be too much illuminated and the wearing of a black shade, so large that front and side light may not enter the eyes. With this protection the light may be safely in front—if reading, it is better that it be to one side. 3. Never read in horse or steam cars. 4. Never read when lying down. 5. Do not read much during convalescence from illness. G. The general health should be maintained by a good diet, air, exercise, amusement and a proper restriction of the hours of hard work. 7. Take plenty of sleep. Retire early and avoid the painful evening lights.— Ten hours sleep for delicate eyes is better than eight. If any thing more is needed, use The Shaker Eye and Ear Balsam.
