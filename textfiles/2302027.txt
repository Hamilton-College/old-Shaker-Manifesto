Ayer, Jan. 8, 1893. Elder Henry:ï¿½I am pleased to inform y ou that Elder Calvin Reed, of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., attended divine service with us to-day. How inspiring it is to meet with those who give up all for the gospel, and live in confoi'mity to the principles of the gospel, that they may benefit humanity. What a blessing it would be if all could see the beauty of a life of consecration. The remarks made by Elder Calvin, touched the hearts of many who heard him. It will awaken new thought toward an increase for good. We need living bread, and fresh fountains of truth and light; something to reach the soul and quicken it into action. We need a new inspiration, something to reach the soul. An influence that will bring into action the combined powers of body and soul. I often think of the pleasant time I spent in your place, and visit in mind with those I met there. We are having cold weather, with but little snow. We have harvested the ice. It was of good quality, twelve inches in thickness. Louisa L Greene.
