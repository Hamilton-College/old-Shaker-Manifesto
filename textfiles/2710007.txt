COMMUNITY HOME. By Isabella Russell. A CCEPTING the fact that we are apt to attach more or less importance to -ZTjl_ our earliest impressions of a religious life, and realizing that these are usually the most lasting, and as my experience has been confined largely, within the limits of the Shaker Church, I feel it my privilege and my pleasure, to speak of its benefits and manifold blessings. Indeed, I am under the most sacred obligations to fulfill the pledges honestly given to sustain its vital principles. Notwithstanding the fact that in our Shaker Homes, as they exist to-day, there is abundant opportunity for those who have no more honor, or self-iespect than to live a life of selfishness and idleness, let us remember that this is in direct opposition to the teaching aud practice of the founders of our Church, whom we profess to love so well, and whose motto, 'hands at work and hearts to God,' is just as binding upon us, as it was upon them, and is just as faithfully carried out by every loyal member. If any individual violates this principle of hand and heart service, so essential to the maintenance, growth and prosperity of the communal home, while sharing its common blessings, then is he dishonest and disloyal, and no amount of charity or mercy on the part of others, can make such crooked paths straight; neither can it be a passport to the union and friendship of the consecrated. If any individual in our ranks, is untrue to these vital principles of our Institution, and has not the moral courage to change his or her life, then, as beloved Elder Giles has said;ï¿½'War should be proclaimed to the subduing and casting out of such elements and influences of evil.' We want no peace which involves the sins of ourselves or others. The peace and happiness which the gospel gives, is not to be bought at such a price. It is not to be obtained by coming down from our standard of virgin purity, or compromising with any spirit or influence that is below the standard of a Christian man or woman anywhere. By this testimony of eternal truth we shall be judged, and not by the number of years spent in a community where our presence is an outward profession of faith. This has nothing to do with our merits or demerits, our justification or condemnation, only in the sense that 'where much is given, much will be required,' and if we have neglected our opportunities for moral and spiritual growth and development, then, instead of being a help and strength to others, we are simply as stumbling-blocks in the way and as such shall have our reward.
