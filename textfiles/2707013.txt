East Canterbury, N. H. June, 1897. It has been the beautiful snow, now it is the beautiful rain, and the beautiful grass. By and by it will be tiie stoivhouse full of hay and the other nice things that the farm produces. Two or three of the houses have been visited with a coat of paint, and under this special privilege they form a conspicuous contrast with those less fortunate. Several rods of new fence have added to the va}ue and beauty of our earthly home, while a visit from the painter to other fences that so sadly needed a new coat, now gives joy to every one who pass s on the street. Some several years ago every new building must have a flat roof and this must be covered with gravel or tin. Sometimes old things pass away, and sometimes things not so old. Most of these flat roofs have not proved satisfactory. At the present time one of these roofs is being removed and a gable roof covered with shingles takes its place. Farewell to the honey bees. The last colony has gone. Some have been lost through improper care during the winter, wink, the bee thieves have also secured a' share. We may not have so much honey and we may not have so many bee stings. This however, is the first time since 18(30 that we have been without a c ilony of honey bees. The bird that interests us the most at present is the Whip-poor-will. In the early morning and just after the closing of the day, he comes quite near to the buildings and gives a private recital of his peculiar and interesting song. While he may be so distinctly heard but few persons are ever able to see him. As the Whip-poor-will belongs in the same family with the Night Hawk, some have thought it to be the same bird. Henry C. Blinn.
