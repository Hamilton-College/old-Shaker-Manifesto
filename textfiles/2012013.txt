INTEMPERANCE. Lucy S. Bowers. 'O God! that men should put an enemy into their mouths to steal away their brains.' It seems impossible that in the long line of human evils there can be one more terrible than intemperance known in the use of alcoholic drinks. Behold the mighty sea ! and many streams and myriad crystal drops, which ever now and then rise up to heaven, and made more clear and beautiful return to earth again in showers of rain and snow which sparkle in the ices of the frosty North, and glisten in the sunlight of the summer South. Behold the golden harvests of shining grain and waving corn ! Then why the maddening cup? why turn to such abuse God's gracious gifts ? He might with justice withhold his generous hand, thus to prohibit man's base and wicked deeds. The question arises in the mind of the native teetotaler as to the pleasing or acceptable taste of strong drink ; how such hard, burning, biting fluids can be suffered to pass the mouth and throat with any endurance, and is answered by the fact of the great stimulus it proves to be to the mental and nervous conditions. This habit usually commences, not in excesses, but in slight sips, and its effects lead to further and greater temptations ; too often induced through medical prescriptions, at banquet tables, at pleasurable sociables and in many instances when but little is taken, but the habit and taste become permanent. The history of ardent spirits runs through the ages from the time of Noah ; a history which records no virtue nor blessing, but eA^ery kind of woe that has fallen upon the human race. The heart's dearest affections, love, happiness, home, reputation, soul, everything has and must succumb to this terrible monster, and death! death! more agonizing, yet sure as the guillotine and untimely graves, are the terrible results and calamities of its victims ; it is really incredible that with all the suffering that has been produced by, and existed through the power of this thing, that it should not in some way have been controlled. If any inexperienced persons wish to imagine the penalties of this irresistible temptation when once overcome by it, let them read the Autobiography of J. B. Gough, he, having once sunk to the lower depths, and endured its despair and the tortures of frightful delirium�and afterward reclaimed� knew and nobly confessed and proclaimed to the world its direful effects, he could find no language too strong in its denunciation ; and we may also well imagine the pangs of a woman's aching heart together with the utter detestation which she had due cause to feel, when we remember the forcible poem known as the 'Drunkard's Daughter,' and which contains the sentiments of many of her sisters. It is to be regretted that there is no law controlling this drain upon the life and resources of the people. Prohibition is a large and prominent plank in the platform of the reforms of today, and yet think of the waste of property in land and labor still going on ; the statistics concerning drink in the country, presented to us frequently, are appalling; over two hundred millions invested in breweries, malthouses and distilleries ; enough drinking places to reach in an unbroken line from New York to Chicago. 'Intemperance costs this nation a thousand million dollars in hard cash every year, and it could better afford to buy out the vested interests of the liquor traffic five times over than to allow the business to go on under legal sanction.' Look for instance�and it is only a sample�at the metropolis of our Puritan Massachusetts, styled 'The Literary Center of the World,' 'The Hub of the Universe,' with hundreds of liquor saloons, and thousands of inebriates and famishing children and mothers who circle their fireless hearths spending between fifty and sixty millions of dollars yearly for this deathproducing luxury. We might have anticipated Boston's redemption by this tune if we remember the report of the Grand Temperance Jubilee and procession that marched her streets in the year 1848. Its total abstinence army known by various epithets was numbered by the thousand. It could hardly be thought that any one living in the state did not belong to the Clear Water Throng. This evil indulgence, even in moderation, impairs, excites and inilames every portion of the body and mind, and if the sins of our forefathers are visited upon succeeding generations, then we are able to account in some measure for the fearful nervous conditions so prevalent, and for the mental depression and inclination to commit crimes even among those who are innocent of the evil in all its forms, and if continued, what of the future ! more generations of paupers, criminals, idiots, tramps and insane ; how can the nation afford this waste ? but, the evil lives in high places and is the source of political corruption ; the battle must be turned to the gate ; public opinion must receive a greater awakening ; all good people must unite as citizens, patriots and Christians to fight the common enemy. 'Where there's a will there's a way,' and greater than conquering heroes of battle are they, who are and will be able to vanquish this wanton foe. There is one perfectly sure remedy for intemperance and that is total abstinence ; then will Bacchus fall and God be praised forevermore. Let us drink from the crystal goblet, and bathe in clear waters that our bodies may be fit temples for the indwelling of our immortal souls ; let us fire them not with the indulgence of any carnal passion, for the reward of our doings is inevitable.
