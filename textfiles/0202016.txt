Editor op 'The Shaker: â€” Presuming that ' The Shakkr,' being liberal as well as radical, will permit defense as well as attack, oblige me by inserting this : 1. Among the nations, the Israelites were the most advanced in spiritual growth and receptivity. 2. Jesus, of preternatural birth, was the acme or culmination of that growth. 3. A highly-organized person has all the phrenological organs well balanced; the basic, or sensuous, being under perfeet control of the superior or spiritual organs. 4. Jesus, being the acme of the spiritual growth of a peculiarly chosen people, the nation of nations, was the Man of men and, therefore, of necessity, must have been most highly organized and constituted, and so was well balanced from his childhood. 5. A child having all its organs well balanced, being highly organized and constituted, and, being under the best moral and spiritual training, especially the training by angels and holy spirits, will not sin. 6. Jesus, I think, was preeminently such a child. 7. Therefore, in my opinion, Jesus did not SIX, neither was guile found in his mouth or heart. Thine, for justice, J. Robe
