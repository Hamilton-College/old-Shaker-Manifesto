Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Mt. Lebanon.—The South Family have been improving the appearance of the village by clapboarding their laundry building — previously plastered externally ; several new slate roofs are noticeable also. Second Family have razed the old landmark south of the dwelling-house—quite an improvement. They have slated the roof of the office-barn, surmounting the same with cupola and a glittering vane, which seems inviting the wind to blow from the right direction. Second Order have repainted their dwelling, rising quite high to do it. They have also re-roofed several buildings. Cart shed has had new founda- tion. Cow barn has been considerably repaired. The Church Family have put on 150 squares of slate this season. We do not like the black paint on their beautiful; new fence. North: This family ig re roofing brick shop, and making many other improvements. Canaan Families are looking beautifully; pnint, with hard labor, have made a wonderful transformation! May God bless lower family—Canaan ! The Society have made a donation of SI,200 to Groveland.
