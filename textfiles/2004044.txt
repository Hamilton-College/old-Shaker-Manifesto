KIND WORDS. East Canterbury, N. H., Mar. 1890. I have been very much interested in a letter which I have just read in the March Manifesto. Every word of encouragement that serves to make our union stronger and to establish our gospel relation on the foundation of truth and righteousness, becomes the precious treasure which we wish to retain. I refer to the letter of Br. John Bradford. I think it is the first time we have heard from him through the Manifesto, and after reading this good, substantial word of Christian comfort and hopeful assurance I regret we have not heard from Br. John oftener. Any one might feel himself the happy possessor of a real treasure who coulel be made the recipient of so worthy a message, as it states in a few words, easy to be understood, the practical life of a Christian Believer, and worthy the careful reading of every young person. I would like to extend my thanks to Br. John, for this letter, and hope we may hear from him again. William Briggs.
