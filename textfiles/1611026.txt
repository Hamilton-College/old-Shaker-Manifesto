WHAT IS CHRISTIANITY? R. A. SHEPARD. Is it not following closely, the teachings of the Christ Spirit? We believe this to be the true definition of the term. Daily living out the Christ principles ; closely interweaving them into our own lives ; then, the fruits of the Spirit will become ours, will they not? But, dear friends, this is not the work of a moment, it is a gradual growth, from day to day; we may really be begotten, of the Christ Spirit, long ere we can attain to the new-birth! Do we not all realize this truth who have struggled, with our inbred foes? The natural propensities are ever at war with the things of the Spirit, until the victory is gained through' the second birth, when we shall have 'Put on the new man, which is after the likeness of God, created in righteousness and true holiness.' 'Love is the fulfilling of the laAV. ' ' Him that overcometh, will 1 make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out; and I will write upon him the name of ray God, and' the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem, which eometh down out of heaven, from my God; and I will write upon him my new name. ' We as a people, believe that 'Christ has appeared a second time Avithout sin, unto salvation. ' And hath made plain the beautiful 'highway' 'The way of holiness ;' and all who will may walk therein. ' The unclean ^liall not pass over it, it shall be for those who are willing to take up their cross against all evil, and follow in the footsteps of our great Exemplar; in other words, daily living the Christprinciples, incorporating them, into our very being ; and thus becoming regenerated ; really baptised with the Chris* Spirit, ' born again.' Having gradually, grown into a one-ness with God ; and making the Golden Rule the rule of our life ; really becoming u Sons and Daughters of the Most High. ' Canterbury, N. H.
