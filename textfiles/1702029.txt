RABBITS The rabbit is a beautiful little creature with long ears and soft fur. They are very timid and are startled at the first sound. They look like the woodchuck in some ways but are smaller. They make their hole underground and it is so deep that you cannot get them out. There are different kinds of rabbits. There are the wild rabbits and tame ones. I like the wild ones best because they look so pretty running about so wild and free. I always thought that animals were much happier when they were free as God made them than they would be if they were caught and tamed. Babbits are of various colors, black, white, red and gray. I think the white rabbits are the prettiest. The white rabbits have pink eyes and the rest have gray ones. Wild rabbits are good to eat. I have had some two or three times and I thought them very nice. The rabbit is like the hare but is much smaller and has shorter legs and ears. Lizzie Shepard.
