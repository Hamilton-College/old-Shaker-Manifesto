Shaker Station, Conn. Nov. 1894. 'Lift the standard higher up, Let Truth in regal glory reign.' A great injury is done by lowering the standard of truth. Let us cherish a high ideal of a Christian life and strive to live up to it. Let us pledge ourselves to nothing less than this. The highest standard is none too high. Anything less than the highest is too low. How beautiful is truth! To say of any one, 'his word is reliable,' is an honor, a meed of praise more desirable than all emoluments of office and the flatteries of multitudes. Truth is sure to win. Let us strive for a life that shall portray this virtue, for no good effort is lost. It requires constant watchfulness to follow the path of truth. Let us help others to be pure and true and we are doing the work that is ours to do. It is the constant care exercised over every part of the household, and the constant endeavor to improve and apply our best powers to our work that alone gives peace, happiness and prosperity. 'The largest railroad station in the world is in St. Louis. The station proper with the train sheds occupy an area of more than 11 acres. The cost of the site, the building and the entire system of tracks amounts to $6,500,000.' ******* The morning feed of soft mash, bran, ground oats and chopped onions and turnips for hens should not be given up. A small amount of wheat fed daily will be beneficial, but as an exclusive diet it means few eggs and fat poultry. Eggs hatch better with more grain and less soft food. Success in growing poultry is due to systematic feeding. A few spoonfuls of sulphur mixed with soft food will increase egg production; a tablespoonful to four gallons of food is plenty for seventy-five liens. Daniel Orcutt.
