THE KING'S DAUGHTERS' PRESIDENT. There are now nearly 200,000 'King's Daughters' in the land, and Mrs. Margaret Bottome, an energetic New York woman, is their President, as she is also the founder of the Order. With October 1st, Mrs. Bottome takes up the editorial pen, and becomes one of the editors of The Ladies' Nome Journal, in which periodical she will hereafter write and edit a department entirely devoted to the best interests of 'The King's Daughters.' Through this channel it is Mrs. Bottome's intention that her 'Daughters' and herself shall come closer together in feeling and sympathy.
