WASH FOR WOOD WORK Betsy Johnson Kind Editor ; As it is now about the time for the cleanly sisterhood to begin their annual ' scrubbing ' and putting on better appearances, I thought to send for publication a recipe for making a solution to wash woodwork. We have used it and find it a good and ' helpful friend ' in times of need : To one pint of soft soap add two tablespoonfuls of spirits turpentine; stir these together thoroughly and put sufficient of it into two quarts of warm water and one pint of skimmed milk to make a weak suds; wash the wood-work with it without any rinsing. It leaves a glossy appearance, and a wholesome flavor which every one will appreciate. West Pittsfield, Mass.
