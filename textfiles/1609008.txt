Dear children; Truth alone will... Enfield Conn., 1886. Dear Children;ï¿½'Truth alone will stand. ' Truth and purity go hand in hand. If you would not have your lives blasted, be true. Untruthfulness is the entrance door by which other sins enter the heart. Acknowledge a fault at once. 'A fault confessed is half redressed.' ' A fault once denied is twice committed. ' When you leave truth and virtue you leave happiness. When you are tempted to be untrue, remember, 'God sees me.' That will help you greatly. ' A danger foreseen is half avoided.' Every temptation resisted is a stepping-stone in the higher life, though you may not realize it. The way of truth is the road to salvation. Truth and virtue insure abiding joy, the sweetest and the best. Ah! how you need to watch, that you speak nothing untrue. Never exaggerate. The plain truth will go further and be better received. To make your words pure and true, your minds and hearts must be pure and true. a Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. ' If you think good thoughts words expressive of those thoughts will naturally flow from your lips. To be able to speak true and noble words, you must think the thoughts and live the lives of which truth and purity form the basis. Your brother. Daniel Orcutt.
