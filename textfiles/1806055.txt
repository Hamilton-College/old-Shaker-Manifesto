North's Philadelphia Musical Journal The music in the May issue of North's Philad'a Musical Journal will be found especially interesting inasmuch as theie is something to suit all tastes. The beautiful song and chorus, ' Sweet Rosalie,' by J. Ford, author of the well known ' Will you Love. Me when I'm Old,' will ,-urely please all who are fond of a sweet and flowing melody set to words brim full of pure sentiment. The ' Marietta Waltz' by Harry B. Manby and the ' Dance of the Elves' by Thomas O'Niell, will find favor among all who enjoy comparatively easy and yet interesting instrumental music. The ' Barcarolle,' by J. Low, and the ' Andante in G minor' by Mendelssohn are each classic gems which will be appreciated by all who are striving to cultivate a taste for the highest grade of music. Altogether the music issued in this number is worth more than is asked for an entire jear's subscription, and is but a fair specimen of the musical contents of the twelve numbers. The letter press portion contains a portrait and sketch of Mr. Fred T. Baker, the eminent composer, and the usual amount of articles of value and interest to music teachers and pupils. Every person subscribing to the Journal previous to July 1st, 1888, will recieve $2.00 worth of sheet music as a premium. Subscription, $1.00 a year; specimen copy 10 cents.
