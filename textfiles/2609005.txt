Correspondence. Dear Fred Aitkin and Brother... Glasgow, Scotland. June, 1896. Dear Fred Aitken and Brother :What a shame of me, but writing is a very weary job; 'better late than never.' When yours came we were at tea on a Saturday afternoon and I was saying how glad I would be if you could walk in. I keep missing you and wondering how you are getting on, so you guess yours was gladly received. We all three wanted it at once, still it was short and just like you. A few days after I received your face on paper, it was good of you to remember me with one. Glad you had a good time crossing. Am much wondering how you are getting on now and often try to send a wave of kindness out to you. I do miss you, there are so few I am in close touch with. Well now do you find it easier to serve one Master where you are, than 144 THE MANIFESTO: you did to try to, here? To serve in the struggle for djiily bread and at the same time live according to oiir light toward all ami toward our own uplifting, in the heat of discord felt and unseen. I find, at times, a severe serving of two Masters, which He said could not be done. Mammon we need, God I can not do without. What then is to be done? Something within me says, 'Be patient child, 'man does not live by bread alone.' 'Life is more than meat.' Will you be so kind as to let me know how you feel inwardly and outwardly with the Shakers. Try and spare me time for a long account of yourself and what you think of me having thoughts of setting sail for Mount Lebanon. Have you felt homesick? Have you made friends? Do you feel at rest and peace and gaining ihOre knowledge? I would so like a report of the land. I hope you can send grapes like those of Eschol. Your sincere friend and sister, Isabel Mackie.
