Most of our periodicals have matter enough... Most of our periodicals have matter enough on hand to supply them for the next two years, if all the contributors should strike work in the meanwhile. A gentleman, who contributed last year to one of our youngest magazines an'article of three pages, which was promptly accepted, had it inserted as a special favor at the end of seven months; if it had waited for its regular turn, it would have appeared at about the end of the year. We have known of an instance where an article has waited over fifteen months for its turn. The necessary delay suggests the question — how long a magazine article can keep ? In the case of some other 'articles' — fish and vegetables, for instance —the time may be calculated to an hour. Seriously speaking, it is possible that valuable information may sometimes be lost to the public, from the impossibility of finding immediate room for it, even in that immense general receptacle, the daily press. A natural inference would seem to be, the necessity for the utmost condensation on the part of all writers. H. H., Mt. Lebanon
