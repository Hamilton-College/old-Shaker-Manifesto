ORDER OF GOD. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. ' Touch not mine Anointed and do my Prophets no harm- ' Psalm cv., 15. Under the Mosaic law and Apostolic dispensations God had an order through which he communicated his mind and will to the people ; and through that line of order established in that day, he could lead, warn, admonish, and administer his love and blessing to his own chosen people. And while they rendered obedience to that order, he always recognized them as obeying him ; and blessed them in so doing. Yea, he blessed them abundantly, in their basket and in their store, in their out-goings and in their incomings. No good thing did he withhold from them who walked uprightly, and were subject and obedient to the order of God in that day. On the other hand those who were disobedient and rebelled against that order, never failed to meet with the displeasure of God; if not with his immediate judgment, and a curse. Witness for instance, the case of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. See Numbers xvi: 1, 8. Let every one read this chapter. By what has transpired in past dispensations, in relation to disobedience and rebellion against the order of God, we may learn if we will, what God requires of us under the dispensation in which we live, which is emphatically, a spiritual dispensation and not so great in outward display, as formerly, because it is an inward spiritual work ; therefore souls ought to be the more careful how they treat it. God is unchangeable the same yesterday, today and forever. Although the order varied in each succeeding dispensation in some respects, adapted to the day and age in which it was given, thus the Jewish -ceremonial law, was superseded only by obeying the higher and superior law of Christ, and continues so to this day ; but the order of the priesthood was changed, and St. Paul tells us how, and in what manner. 'And God hath set some in the church, first, apostles, secondly, prophets, thirdly, teachers, after that, miracles, gifts of healing, helps, governments.' 1 Cor. xii., 28. ' And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and evangelists, and some pastors, and teachers,' and for these reasons. '' For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, the 'Anointed.' Eph. iv., 11,12. Elders were ordainec in every church. ' Actsxiv. Deacons, were also appointed after the following manner. Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said, ' It is not reasonably that we should leave the word of God to serve tables. Wherefore, brethren look ye out among you, seveu men of honest report, full oi the Holy Spirit, and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.' Acts vi: 23. Take notice, whom we may appoint. It was not done by majority vote,ï¿½it was done by the gift of God, to the apostles and their successors, on whom the appointing power was established, as St. Paul expressed it. 'Now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.' 2 Cor. v,, 20. i. e. through his order. This was the order of God in Christ's first appearing, and was rejected and overthrown by the spirit of antichrist, which already began to work in the Apostles' days ; not so much at first, by open rebellion, as it was by a false lying spirit, to work out of sight, under a mask, under a smooth outside Christian name, by denying Christ in any form of visible lead, not confessing that Christ had come in the flesh, or in human shape. Such, St. John denounced as the spirit of antichrist. 'Ye shall know them by their fruits.' North Union, Ohio. (To be continued/)
