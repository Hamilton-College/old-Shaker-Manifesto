Sabbathday Lake, Me. Sept. 1894. We hear it said 'There is a time for everything' but time for writing has of late failed and consequently correspondents have to wait. We still have many people from far and near walking through our village and over our grounds, but we furnish them no meals, as the labor attached to that is beyond our strength; so few, and so much to do to carry on our trades. Last week two of our young Brothers, Stephen Gowen and Franklin Libby of Alfred, made us a short visit; too short; but the time was very pleasantly occupied and we are thankful to realize that we have young Brethren and Sisters in our Zion homes who will yet be able to bear the burdens which will surely fall upon them. To-day we are enjoying the great blessing of having with us the Ministry and some of the Elders from the western Societies. They bring with them much spiritual strength and encouragement which can not fail of being received by the faithful and true. 'Zion thou still art strong though thy enemies thy failure await.' But the end is not yet and never will be. 'Beautiful Zion decked with those who believe,'These were the words of Father James Whittaker, one hundred years ago, and Zion is not less beautiful to-day. Our garden and field crops promise an abundant harvest which will soon be gathered in. Autumn is here and we seem to be amply rewarded for the labors of the spring and summer. Ada S. Cumminr/a.
