THE CAMEL AND THE MILLER This, it seems, is an Arab fable. Read it, and see if you can tell what it means. Once upon a time a miller, shortly after he had lain down for an afternoon's nap, was startled by a camel's nose being thrust in at the door of his house'It is very cold outside,' said the camel, 'I only wish to get my nose in.' The mil THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. 113 ler was an easy kind of man, so the nose was let in. 'The wind is very sharp,' sighed the camel, 'pray allow me to get my neck inside,' This request was also allowed, and the neck was thrust in. 'How fast the rain begins to fall. I shall get wet throngh. Will you let me place my shoulders under cover ? ' This, too, was granted; and so the camel asked for a little, and a little more, until he had pushed his whole body inside the house. The miller soon began to be put to much trouble by the rude companion he had got in his room, which was not large enough for both, and, as the rain was over, civilly asked him to depart. 'If you do not like it, you may leave,' saucily replied the beast. 'As for myself, I know when I am well off, and shall stay where I am.' This may show the meanness of unthankfulness, and the folly of giving up too much to bad folks. And the camel may also represent habit. A bad habit almost always begins with a little pleasant indulgence, then more and more, until at last the habit is master. Keep the camel's nose out. Stop your bad habits in the very beginning. Then you can fill the place God has given you in the world.
