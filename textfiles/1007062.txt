JOSH BILLINGS' PHILOSOPHY. Thare iz a good deal in a name: vinegar sounds sour to me, so duz honey sound sweet. Philosophy iz a self-sakraficing virtue; most of it iz spent on our nabors, but little on ourselfs. Yung man, satisfy yurself, and the world in dne time are sure to giv yu all the praze yu deserve. Thare may be people who never make enny blunders or mistakes (or think they don't), the best we kan say for them iz pain-fully korrect. Too mutch larning and too little wisdum iz making the whole world mad; the mis-take iz az old as the farce enackted in the garden ov Eden. There iz a great deal more virtew and happiness in the world than we are aware ov; menny ov us hav it in our possesshun without knowing it. Opinyuns rule mankind, and yet two-thirds of all the opinyuns afloat are like foot balls; the man who kan kik them the highest iz the best fello Musik iz not only a plezant power, but it iz one ov the cheapest ones too; enny per-son who haz genius enuff to turn a grind-stone kan understand a fiddle. The man who laffs and nods hiz hed, and sez, ' Yes,jess so,' to every thing yu say, iz one of the hardest men in the world to git onto the bak ov sixty day paper. It seems rather tuff, and quite ridikilus, that a man who haz honestly earned fame kan't git it until after he iz ded, and then haz to take it in second-rate poetry on hiz tume stun. There seems to be two kinds of wisdom; one a llIan gits from studdying only the bad side ov human natur, the other from stud-dying both the good and bad side, and then striking a helthy average.
