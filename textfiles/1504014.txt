FOR THE RIGHT [.Joaquin Miller read the following poem at the meeting of tke New York State Press Association at New York on Tuesday.] The builders of cities, of worlds are we, The unnamed scribes and of unknown worth; For we are the kinsmen of Progress, and he The one Prince we honor, the whole wide earth. Nor gold, nor glory, nor name we claim-- We ask but the right unfettered to fight; To name the wrong by its shameless name, To slay the wrong for the love of the Right. The sentries of cities, of worlds are we, Each standing alone on his high watch-tower; We are looking away to the land, to (he sea; We have only a lamp in the midnight hour. Then leave us the right to fight or to fall, As God may will, in the front of the fight, Unchallenged, unquestioned for the good of all, For the truth that lives, for the love of the Right. The givers of glory to nations are we, The builders of shafts and of monuments To soldiers and daring great men of the sea; But we are the homeless, strange dwellers in tents With never a tablet or high-built stone, Yet what care we who go down in the fight, Though we live unnamed, though we die unknown, If only we live and we die for the Right.tup: There arc brighter things in this world than gold, There are nobler things in this world than name-- To silently do with your deeds untold, To silently die unnoised to fame. Then go iorth to the fight unnamed and alone Let us lead the world to its destined height; Enough to know, if but this be known, We live and die alone for the Right. Selected.
