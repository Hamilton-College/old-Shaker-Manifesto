GOD AND HIS FLOWERS [Contributed by Eldress J. J. K.] The flowers of many climates That bloom all seasons through Met in a stately garden Bright with the morning dew. For praise and loving worship The Lord they came to meet; Her box of precious ointment The Eose broke at His feet. The Morning Glories fragile, Like infants soon to go, Had dainty toy like trumpets, And praised the Master so. '* His word is like to honey, ' The clover testified, 'And all who trust Thy promise Shall in Thy love abide. ' The Lilies said, ' O trust Him, We neither toil nor spin, And yet His house of beauty, See how we enter in!' The Kingcup and her kindred Said : ' Let us all be glad ; Of His redundant sunshine, Behold how we are clad. ' ' And let us follow Jesus, ' The Star of Bethlehem said And all the band of flowers Bent down with rev'rent head. The glad Sunflower answered, And little Daisies bright, And all the cousin Asters, ']We follow toward the light! ' ' We praise Him for the mountains, ' The Alpine Roses cried ; ' We bless Him for the valleys, ' The Violets replied. ' We praise Him' said the Airplant, ' For breath we never lack ; ' 'And for the rocks we praise Him' The Lichens answered back. ' We praise God for the waters, ' The gray Seamosses sighed; And all His baptized Lilies 'Amen! Amen!' replied. ' And now for the green, cool woodlands We praise and thanks return, ' Said Kalmias and Azaleas, And graceful Feathery Fern. ' And for the wealth of gardens And all the gardener thinks, ' Said Eoses and Camellias, And all the sweet breath'd Pinks. ' Hosannah in the highest, ' The Baby Bluets sang, And little trembling Harebells With softest music rang. ' The winter hath been bitter, The sunshine follows storm, Thanks for His loving kindness, The earth's great heart is warm. ' So said the pilgrim May Flower That cometh after snow, The humblest and the sweetest Of all the flowers that blow. '' Thank God for every weather, The sunshine and the wet, ' Spoke out the cheerful Pansies, And darling Miginonette. And then the sun descended, The heavens were all aglow ; The little Morning Glories Had faded long ago. And now the bright Day Lilies Their love watch ceased to keep� ' He giveth, ' said the Poppies� ' To His beloved sleep. ' The gray of evening deepened, The soft wind stirred the corn, When sudden in the garden Another flower was born. It was the Evening Primrose, Her sisters followed fast; With perfumed lips they whispered, 'Thank God for night at last. ' New York Evening Post.
