THE NECESSITY OF BEING VIRTUOUS IS YOUTH. James W. Shelton. It is a preposterous resolution of some people to defer being virtuous till they grow old and have spent their lives in the endless round of outward observance. If their lives have been unloving and unworthy, they will hear these awful words, 'Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; depart from me, I never knew you.' The chief end of a virtuous life is to give us as near a resemblance as is possible to the divine nature ; to make us pure as He is pure. It is to raise us to the utmost degree of purity of which we are capable. To defer this work till old age, is to resolve to be as unlike God as possible. It is indeed,'a weak assurance that old age will help our deformity, and give us a good resemblance of Him, and in an instant confer upon us purity of spirit after we have wilfully passed over our whole life in wrong doing. How strange to think that when the purest part of life has been prostituted to vice, that the dregs can be a fit offering for our Maker, and that He will accept of such a sacrifice. It is, then, our best wisdom to walk the paths of virtue in the morning of our days, that the evening may terminate with a smiling serenity, and wing its way to the regions of unmolested security.
