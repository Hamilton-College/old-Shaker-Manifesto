Sabbathday Lake, Me. Sept. 1896. Months have come and gone since the readers of The Manifesto have heard from us; but do not think we have forgotten the magazine by any means. We welcome its arrival every month and it is more interesting each time. Our flowers have been a source of pleasure and profit this summer. Such lovely sweet peas and asters as have bloomed continually, and even now the vines are full of the beautiful blossoms; and what is better the Poland Spring House is full of guests who admire and purchase our flowers as often as we have time to carry them to the Hotel. This has been a great blessing to us and as a people we are greatly favored. Our fancy work has also found a ready sale. Two very pleasant Sisters from Shirley, Mass., Eldress Lucy Mitchell and Sr. Mary Ann Whiteley are with us on a short visit. We enjoy their company and find the sterling worth that marks the genuine Shaker everywhere. These, Father James THE MANIFES1 0. said, 'would shine brighter than the stars in the firmament when called into eternity.' We are having an abundance of apples and the evenings at present are occupied by the Brethren and Sisters in cutting the apples and drying them. Plenty of fruit and vegetables but a scarcity of hay, therefore the stock will have to be lessoned before cold weather. Ada S. Cummings.
