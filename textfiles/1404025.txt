To the Young ;-In whatever situation you may be... Enfield, Conn. 1883. To the Young ;-In whatever situation you may be, strive to render yourself useful. Study yourself. Make yourself acquainted with your own imperfections, and your inclinations to stray from the path of rectitude. Guard closely the avenues of the heart where temptation and sin may enter, and place a double watch at the weakest point of this celestial fortress. Now look about you and make yourself wise by observation, and experience. Where you discover goodness strive to imitate it. Fear God and keep his commandments. Waste not time in idle; useless pursuits, or conversation. Ever heed the admonitions of your superiors, and well improve the precious moments allotted you to store the mind with useful knowledge, for time once gone can never be recalled. Would you enjoy happiness? Seek it in the fulfillment of your various duties, and in the cultivation of intellect, in cherishing that which is good. Seek and find whatever of real happiness is allotted here below, in the consciousness of having endeavored to live as becomes an intelligent being destined to immortality. Prom your true friend, Anna Ervin.
