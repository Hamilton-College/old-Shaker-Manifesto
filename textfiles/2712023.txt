The Deseret News A copy of 'The Deseret News' of June 15, 1850 from a lady now traveling in Utah. It was No. 1 of Vol. II and publitht by W. Richards, of Salt Lake City. In a sketch of debate, in the U. S. Senate Mr. Hale presented a petition 'for the immediate and peaceful dissolution of the American Union.' It also contains a wonderful story; which is said to be a dream by John C. Calhoun of S. C. inspired by the ghost of the 'Father of his Country.'
