Elzevir library THE EJLJEJEVIH, Among the recent issues of this unique, and in respect to cheapness and beauty of form and typography, really remarkable publication, are the following : 'Aristotle,' by Sir Alexander Grant; 'Plato,' by C. W. Collins; 'Horace,' by Theodore Martin. These are in the famous and excellent 'Ancient Classics for English Headers' series, heretofore obtainable only at the price of $1.00 each, but now published in this handsome form for 15 cents each. 'The Indian Song of Songs,' by Edwin Arnold, author of 'The Light of Asia,' is published at 6 cents, the cheapest edition heretofore issued being $1.00. We also have the 'Life of Alex. H. Stephens,' by F. II. Norton, author of 'Life of Gen. Hancock,' and other works. It contains an excellent portrait, and a fine illustration of 'Liberty Hall,' Mr. Stephens' famous home. Though a copyright work, paying the usual royalty to the author, it is published at the astonishing price of 10 cents. The last issue is Schiller's celebrated 'Song of The Bell,' and 'Hero and Leander,' all for 2 cents. These publications are not sold by dealers generally, but only direct, by the publisher, John B. Alden, 18 Vesey St., N. Y.,
