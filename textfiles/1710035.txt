Salvation army has opened a lively... The 'Salvation Army' has opened a lively fire against our wicked capital. The infidels marched out against them with their h..l..h blasphemy, and the clergy stood afar off and drew their sacerdotal robes around them, looking on with holy horror. The police prohibited them marching the streets, as this is a city of order; but not mindful of opposition, they continued their attack, talking to about five hundred persons every night, which is as much as their present hall can accommodate. I talked with the captain, and he said that in a short time they should commence at a different point, in a hall about the same size. He is hopeful of gaining a glorious victory for the Lord. Though I do not agree with them as to their terms of pardon, yet I devoutly wish and hope that they may do a great deal of good by arousing those who feel secure in the citadel of sin. Copenhagen, July 14. O. C. Mikkelson.
