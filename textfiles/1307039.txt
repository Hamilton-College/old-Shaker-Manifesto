WE DO NOT THINK [Written for Pomeroy's Democrat.] WE DO NOT THINK. We do not think when slightingly We speak of one another, That just a passing breeze may fan The spark we ought to smother; For spoken thoughts, are apt to grow— Like buds when fairly started— We seldom dream what form they'll take When from our lips they've parted. We do not think when envy rules, And tongues begin to wander O'er cruel things— which were they heard, Might make our neighbors ponder. They may be wrong—we may be right, But should we try to measure Their lives and actions by our own, Their feelings, at our pleasure? We do not think, that hearts are crushed And brows are madly burning, By just an idle word, which gains A hundred while returning. The pleasure's brief, let conscience reign, How proudly then, we'll own it— That when a slanderous thought steals up, We'll think—-and just postpone it.
