BECAUSE BY MRS. M. A. KIDDER. Because I've failed to do a task As well as I would have it done, Shall I desist and idly shrink As life's bright sands drop one by one? No ! let me try, yet once again, Take greater pains, use greater care, The cunning hand we all may train To do our bidding everywhere ! Because my feet slip on the way, The upward way that leads to life, Shall I turn back without delay, And mingle with the sin and strife? No ! good right foot take firmer hold, And soon the left will follow thee ; Naught should discourage pilgrims bold, Not e'en the wild tempestuous sea. Because I spoke a bitter word That hurt a friend or wronged a foe, Shall I still keep my anger stirred And drink the gall as on I go ? No ! though the bitter word can ne'er Be taken back as long years roll; The wounds I may bind up while here, Before we meet at yonder goal! Because today I quite despair Of sunshine when the clouds hang low, Shall I remain cast down with care, Nor watch for the returning glow? No ! let me still with hope look up, While hands and feet their tasks obey; For well I know that all life's ills In heaven's good time will pass away. N. Y. Weekly.
