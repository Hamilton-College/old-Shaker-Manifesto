THE TESTS WHICH GOD PUTS. [Contributed by Wm. L. Lincoln.] The cross which God puts upon his children is always their human nature. The tests which God puts to his children are always whether they will yield to their human nature, or forsake it and lay hold of the Divine. This does not mean self-inflicted punishments or crosses but God-appointed trials. There is no merit before God in self-inflicted trials, discipline, or punishment. God only knows how your human nature is to be changed, and He only knows what trial or test or cross will be most effective to do it with. When the offering is laid on the altar of sacrifice it remains there perfectly passive ; the fire must be put to it by another's hand and it must be crucified from without. Every child of God will be tested, and the eye of God will watch to see if it yields, simple and willing to have its human nature burned away, or whether it will yield to its human nature and thus sacrifice the Spirit of God.
