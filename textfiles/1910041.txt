COUNSEL. Canterbury, N. H. lead thee to righteousness, glory and peace; Make the people thine Make the Lord thy God, who shall bring thee to judgment And who are patiently seeking The kingdom of Christ, in its truths to increase. For no earthly pow'r hath wisdom to guide thee, And kin dred will fail when afflictions abound. From out of the depths cry 'O Lord, we will serve Thee, We'll flee to the refuge where mercy is found.'
