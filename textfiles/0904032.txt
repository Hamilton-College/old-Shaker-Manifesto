Look after the Cellars Many farmers use the cellars under their dwellings as a place to stow their root-crops, especially potatoes, beets, turnips, celery, and even cabbage, which is not a root. It is convenient to do so where there is no barn-cellar or where these vegetables' are not buried upon the premises. But it is a practice not to be recommended, except the best care is taken to keep the cellar clean and well-ventilated. Every day at about noon, when the weather will admit of it, the outer door should be opened for an hour or so, and even when the weather is extremely cold the door should for that length of time be partly opened. The refuse of vegetables also should be daily removed and not left to evolve a deleterious gas as soon as the temperature shall rise sufficiently to act upon it. The most danger is in the spring, when the mildness of the weather outside finds its way into the cellar, and operates, if the cellar is not ventilated freely, in producing decomposition in some degree. There is nothing that tends more directly to produce the most deadly fevers than filthy cellars. The poisonous gases permeate the whole house. And yet how frequently do we see cellars left untouched, with all their heaps of vegetable refuse, until April and even May ? We hope this word of warning will not fall on unwilling ears.
