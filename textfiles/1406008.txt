INFLUENCE. HARRIET I. SHEPARD. The liome sphere is one in which a good and Christian influence should abound with beautiful graces. This is a truth which we have reason to fear is not fully estimated by many persons, but we should find here the best opportunity of doing good. Some seem to feel that they have not much influence at home. Such have yet to learn that home is the sphere, not only of duty, but of the best influences. It is natural to aspire after something great. Perhaps we need to work more in oiir own vineyard, to know ourselves, before our influence can be very elevating. This knowledge is gained by entering frequently into the closet of our hearts and honestly, humbly pray for the graces of the spirit to abide with us. We can exert an influence for good, and become bright and shining lights, and will be able by divine influence to eradicate much evil and establish order, peace, joy and harmony in society. There are some pleasures and influences which result from storing the mind with useful knowledge, but enjoyments, and benefits greater, by tar, result from the cultivation of the mind, and from the exercise and reciprocation of friendly feelings. The world is full of the praises of some of the most elevated men and women, but without the parental influence, which guided their youth, what would they have been? Their first lessons were received at home. There they commenced their education of mindfand heart which rendered them eminently useful in after life. Are we not indebted to the parents of those meritorious people for the good influence which they exerted over them and through them, over a nation? John Quincy Adams has been acknowledged to be one of the brightest ornaments of Massachusetts. His Father was questioned with regard to the means by which his son was so early brought forward and became so prominent and useful. The Father gave a description of the various means employed in his instruction and adds, lie had a Mother. When Governor Briggs returned to his seat in Congress, he told Mr. Adams that he had been reading the letters of his mother, and had just found out the secret that made him what he was, 'The old man eloquent.' He replied, with the liveliest emotions, that what ever there had been in his life which was good and useful was to be ascribed to his mother. Let us take a critical view of his long life of usefulness such as accompanying his father to Europe on a foreign mission, while in his boyhood unparalleled activity, of spotless purity, of highest honor, brilliancy and usefulness; then trace all this back to the honored mother, and consider the importance of her influence. Tins is only one instance out of many. There are numerous accounts on record of pious females exerting a heavenly and benign influence, not only on their own families, but on all around them. Who can measure the responsibility resting upon parents and guardians of children. The ornaments of society, are in no small degree, the result of that maternal influence which has been tacitly and without being perceived, exerted in the domestic circle. But influence is by no means confined to the parental sphere. A brother, sister, or friend, may sometimes become as influential as parents.ï¿½Upon such, will great blessings be pronounced. ' Blessed are the Peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God. ' How careful and prayerful we should be, that we do not exert a wrong influence upon society. Let slander, calumny, or anything that would hurt or wound the tender feelings of another be banished henceforth and forever; no matter what grade or station we may occupy, such traits of character are not justifiable. No community can be prosperous, harmonious, peaceful, and happy, where such ruinous vices exist. Let us carefully, and continually pray that we may so possess the spirit of Christ, that we can love and bless one another with a pure heart fervently. Our influence then will always be cast on the right side, and become what it should be, holy and acceptable to God. North Union, Ohio.
