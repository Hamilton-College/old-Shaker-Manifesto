Shakers, N. Y. June, 1897. If the poetical aphorism is true that 'A colcl and wet May, Fills) the barn with grain and hay,' we may expect a bountiful supply of these products the present season. In this section of the state the spring rains have more than equalled that of the two preceding seasons. As we reviewed the list recorded in the June Manifesto of,those who had past over the mystic river a feeling of sadness came over our spirit as we realized that our friends are passing one by one from our mortal sight. But why should we be sad? Steadily the procession moves on and we lose sight of the head of the column,ï¿½ but only for a little while and then the joy of our heavenly reunion. Since our last communication we have witnessed the translation of one of the veteran souls who gave all they had to the cause. On the 17th of May our gospel Mother Lydia Dole was received into that mansion not made with hands. Over sixty years had been spent in the Community and many of them, years of heavy burden and care for the people. Such are numbered with those that the Revelator saw 'who had come up out of great tribulation and made their garments clean and white.' Heavenly Father and Mother we thank thee for the inspiration and blessing that comes from such as these, for in their presence there is no darkness nor death but all is light and life.
