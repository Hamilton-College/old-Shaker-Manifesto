Enfield, N. H. Dec. 1897. 'We are living, we are dwelling In a grand, eventful time, In an age on ages telling, To be living is sublime.' The truth of this poetical declaration, is realized as we think of the great inventions man has made in the halls of art, music and mechanism. Life is only sublime, as we live in thoughts and acts that are stampt with the sublimity of the Christ spirit. A spirit that keeps itself unspotted from every de- filing element and is devoted to God, of whom, every product of nature, not created by finite powers, and the stars radiant in their golden silence, constantly remind us. 'There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is death.' Narrow or sin-diseased must be the mind that can not distinguish right from wrong. No one need to master all isms, sciences and philosophy to work out a sublime immortality, it is only to 'cease to do evil and learn to do well.' The doctrine of Christ does not appall or enchant, but instructs to right living, and the life of the Christian, is not a, sol- emn drama, of masquerading of seem-tobe Christianness, but a life as open and as pure as the heavens; full of good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.' We had a very profitable Thanksgiving service and entertainment, both of which added comfort to the aged and cheer to the young people. We lately had the pleasure of entertaining Misses Gould and Davis of Lebanon, N. H. who gave us a recital of their visit to the convention of Christian Endeavor, held at California, also, of listening t.) an excellent discourse on missionary work among the fallen and poor of New York, by Mr. Fred Partington of Mt. Kisco, N. Y. For all our blessings, we render thanks to God and associates and hope at the end of the corning year we may be able to report greater advancement in spiritual and material growth.
