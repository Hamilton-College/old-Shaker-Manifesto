A Gardener's Secret Peter Henderson, the veteran gardener, made a very significant statement before the convention of nurserymen and florists. This statement embodies the' remarkable fact that if garden seeds, when planted in the spring, are firmly pressed, when under the earth, by the ball of the foot at the time the gardeners are putting them into the ground, they will invariably grow, drought or not drought; and what is still more important, they will spring up earlier and grow faster and mature better than any of their kind which have not been subjected to this discipline. The same rule of pressure, he says, holds true in regard to transplanting trees, shrubs and plants. This is an item of great practical value to many of our people, and especially to those who live in the suburbs. Cleveland Herald.
