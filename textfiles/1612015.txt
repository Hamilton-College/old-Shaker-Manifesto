How silently we go our way... How silently we go our way When we have found a goodly pearl, The earth may frown, and nothing may Upon us smile, but still we smile, We know the treasure we have get, And what the value yet will be. The King may boast, but he has not This one choice pearl that's given trie, No envy clustering round the heart, No jealousy to friend or foe, When we have found the better part, The only lasting good we know. Canterbury, N. H. M. W
