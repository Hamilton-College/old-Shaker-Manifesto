TRUE THEOLOGY. NO. 2. Harvey L. Eads. Text :�/ am the light of the world, and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness. John, viii., 12. I will extend the text and say : he that folioweth me not, shall walk in darkness. In my former discourse on Theology I endeavored to show man's true relation to God. To-day, I purpose to show his duty to Him, but there is nothing in which mankind differ so much as in what God requires of them ; this seems to necessitate that something should be said on this part of theology. For the external world, man's duties to God are summarized in the Decalogue ; but the great Ecclesiast puts them all in a nutshell, saying: 'Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil.' Eccl. xii., 13, 14. No better counsel nor warning can be given to the world outside of God's Kingdom, either civilized or barbarian than this; which means obey the high- est dictates of conscience, being your own judge. This is confirmed by the apostle. ' In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted with him.' Acts x., 35. But acceptance is not redemption, this is obtained only in one way, and that is to find the Order which God has established in his kingdom on earth and to accept and live in accordance with the same ; but the very best that any can do outside of this, and on the lower plane of life, either professor or profane, is to walk in darkness and be liable to stumble at every step they take ; yet they are justified and accepted while obeying their highest light, because in this they are doing their duty to God, and while this is continued they will be in the ascendant, rising and drawing nearer to God, by whose inspiration they will continue to be enlightened. But if they do not, they will recede from Him and lose his blessing. All history from the creation to the present day bears witness to this truth�beginning with Adam and Eve who lost Eden by their disobedience to the light that God had given them. So it has been ever since with every human being and with all nations and people and will be so to and through Eternity. 'This is the condemnation, that light has come into the world.' Johniii., 19, showing past errors and present duties and will continue until we find Him who said as in the text�'I am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,' and hence will stumble no more. He it is of whom the voice of God said: '' This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.' Matt, iii., 17. This person then was and is the God-Anointed head of his established Order for the redemption of man, and was the first that ever walked the earth, who was moved in all he said an^ did by the God-di ected spirit, depending nothing on the intellect, and never made a blunder. But see how it is with the outside world where intellect rules, the brain in triumph, the heart in mourning, their spirits asleep and buried in their graves as they were at the time of Christ's resurrection, after which (we are not told how long after,) being awakened by the resurrection, the sleeping saints arose, not a lot of bodies of flesh and blood that was not there, coming up through holes in the ground as �,he blind guides teach, but the Saints who had been sleeping as to Christ's spiritual work were awakened by his resurrection. Some sleeping Saints now ha\ e need of such an awakening coming over them or they may be swallowed up in the sleep of death. How often do we hear it said : 'O that God would send into his Ziou sonr- cultured intellects who are competent to lead and build up Zion, I am weary of the hedge and ditch comers. ' Is this prayer of the Spirit or intellect? Do not the hedge and ditchers need redemption as much as the cultured? Intellect cannot lead to God ; if all withic his kingdom on earth were spiritual minded, led and governed by the Spirit, all would be life and peace, his Zion would blossom as the rose and flourish as a well-watered garden. But without the spiritual mind and the child spirit, the cultivated intellect would be the worse accession of the two. So our duty is to labor for the spiritual mind and all other things necessary will be added, and God will prosper Zion and all will be satisfied with his goodness. If Zion is to depend on intellect, then she had better appeal to the world for wisdom and guidance, where the most cultivated intellects are and ever will be found, greater even than Christ himself possessed. To become like him who was tba light of the world and not walk in darkness our first duty is to cultivate the spiritual. But I am told that I have quoted the philosopher John Locke on p. 69 of Shaker Theology, who affirms that all inspiration should be subject to reason, the intellect being the reasoner. This 1 consider to be true with all who live on the lower plane of intellectual life where philosophers are mostly found ; ignoring the Spirit, they have no means of judging, but philosophy and logic aud all walk in darkness. But in coming into God's spiritual kingdom with Christ who is the light of the world at the head, the conditions are reversed. Here is the sea of glass where the philosopher is on a level with the child ; here his duty is to receive the child spirit, &gt;k become as a little child,' ignoring his philosophy, and listen to the voice of the Spirit comiug from God through his Order, no more to walk in darkness. Right here it may be asked: Is not the intellect a God-giveu faculty to the human race? Surely it is. The same question may be asked of other faculties ; procreation, for instance, is a Godgiveu faculty, and with the unenlightened generative world who are ou the animal plane of life when properly used is uot wrong ; but on the upper floor or Christ plane where the Angel life is to be lived our duty is to crucify it with all its partial affections and lusts, but intellect with speech, hearing, seeing, feeling, are to be kept in subordination to the Spirit; but if this is not done, all the faculties become a curse instead of a blessing as the millions of murders, broken hearts and suicides testify, yea the millions who wish they had never been born. But I am further asked : Would not Christ have been better off' himself if he had paid more attention to intellectual culture and secured house, home and property for himself and his little community? Not at all, even though he, the good, the better and the best of earth, plaintively said, ''The foxes have holes aud the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.' The time had not come for the establishment of communal homes. This could not be made permanent until the Bride had 'made herself ready' to care for it. But it has come as predicted, 'as a thief in the night,' and although it has existed more than one hundred years but few seem to know it. The keen prophetic eye of the Prophet Isaiah saw it in the long distance and said: 'They shall build houses and inhabit them, they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. ' Isa. Ixv., etc. This is now literally fulfilled. Why is it not seen ? Because that wily, tortuous, conscienceless intellectual Serpent has stolen into the garden and climbed the tree of knowledge and is now talking down to man instead of woman and offering him the fruit of intellectual greatness, saying to him, God knows you shall not surely die, but become as Gods, great in the earth to be envied by Angels. By listening to this serpent, the world is more cursed to-day than were Adam aud Eve in the garden of Eden. O yea, Moses was a little late in coming down from the mountain, and what did intellect do ? It made a golden calf to worship instead of God and the whole world with little exception have been worshiping the golden calf from that day to this. This is the effect of neglecting our duty to God and placing the affections on the vanities of the world depriving ourselves of real happiness here and hope of heaven here-after. But when Christ's fold is entered by the honest seeker after salvation, whether he comes from the hedges or the mountain top, who desires relief to his sin-burdened soul, he does not choose a position for himself, but, with all his brain power bowed down before the Spirit, he will say, after confessing all his sins before God's Order ; here O Lord is my all, my gold and my silver is now to me but as dung and dross, the redemption of my soul and union with God's people is all I crave. If I can but be saved and have my sins blotted out to be remembered no more, all else may go. I now thankfully accept the child spirit demanded by Christ. Mould me as you will, I am as clay in the hand.; of the potter. I am without will or judgment of my own they are taken from me as Christ's were, myself, my all I here lay down on thy sacrificial Altar, never more to grieve the Spirit by permitting my intellect to occupy the judgment seat. O nay, never. All such will be overcomers as Christ was and shall sit with him on his throne as he overcame and sits with his Father on his throne. South Union, Ky.
