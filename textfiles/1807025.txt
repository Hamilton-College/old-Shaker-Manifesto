WHITE CROSS CELIBACY. F. W. Evans. Adam and Eve were notable persons whilst they remained celibates. But when�as the Book of Mormon hath it �'Man sinned, that man might be,' how have they since been regarded by their unfilial posterity but as the ''chief of sinners?' Because of his sexual purity�celibacy�Jesus has been and still is, worshiped by millions of Adam and Eve's non-celibate posterity, so deeply are they impressed with the enormity of the sin of their primitive parents. He is not so worshiped by the celibate� Shakers. Peter and his successors, the popes, down to Leo XIII., with all cardinals, Jesuits, and orders of monks and nuns, have been the rulers of Christendom for ages, and were, professedly, all celibates. Is there another man who wields an equal amount of power over the nations of Christendom, that Leo, the celibate, wields? Were not Luther and Calvin sworn religious celibates, like the rebellious Dr. McGlynn ? And his friend, Henry George, has only to marry, to lose his power over the masses who worship the celibate Jesus. Cannot the Protestants find food for thought in the above cited mighty historical facts ? Many far-seeing people expect the Catholic hierarchy to steadily continue to gain the ascendency of power in these United States as things are now going. Query�doe- not the secret of that power consist in the principle of celibacy, so much cherished by the Catholic church, and which the Protestants so fully endorse by their idolatrous worship of Jesus, the celibate? Although Mary bore a son, by some thing or some one begotten, the Catholic is bound by the church to believe her to be still a '�'�virgin Mary.' What are Shakers but an order of religious, scientific and intellectual celibates, who would unite all classes together in the formation and support of a celibate secular government? As the Jews cherished and loved the Essenes, so should all parties and all sects love and cherish the Shaker order, as the friend of God and humanity. Build up, therefore, the shaker order, in its place, as the kingdom of heaven upon earth. It is 'not of this world' of generation ; it is what you have all been praying for and desiring. It has come. Bless it; and unite with it, to create a 'White Cross' class of intellectual celibates, male and female, from which class, all civil officers and legislators shall be chosen, to rule and govern the whole nation ; leaving the married people at home, to do business of all kinds, farming, mechanical, mercantile ; and to take gool care of their families �'their own households.' These� like the Jews and Quakers�should learn to observe, and be ruled by, the same laws and principles, iu propagating human beings, that they learn to observe in raising domestic animals ; then their progeny would be fit for something better than 'food for powder,' or butchers of human beiugs. Reduce things to order�now it is Babel. What is Law, Theology, or even 'Science,' falsely so called, but confusion? We are in perpetual danger of war, from one cause or another, by reason of the absence of woman as a peace-maker. And blessed are the peace-makers ; they are children of God. Warriors are the children of the evil one ; war is hell; devils only wage it. Napoleon, Wellington, Washington, Grant, have all denounced war ; and they all knew that the more reckless and dare-devilish the men became, the better soldiers they were. Then they would do what they were ordered, uninfluenced and unrestrained by individual conscience or morality. What else but 'White Cross' soldiers, would be intellectual celibates? When divided into senates and houses of representatives� between them, they would fight sexual sensuality, in and out of the marriage relation. Thus would the axe of reform be put to the root of the national and society evils, which are preying upon the very vitals of these United States, and of all other nations in what is called Christendom. And 'the work of righteousness would be peace, and the effect of peace would be quietness and assurance forever.' 'There is no peace for the wicked, saith my God.' 'The wicked are as the troubled sea, whose waters cannot rest.' Could a better symbol of the adulterous church and state governments of earth be found than the fathomless, restless ocean? It is liable at a moment's notice to be violently agitated to an unknown depth by storms that would roll its waters up mountain high. 'Peace is as really taken from the earth' as rest from the salt sea ! There may be a calm ; but what next? 'Wars and rumors of wars' are constant�never ending. White Cross celibate men and women will, like the celibate Jesus and Ann, bring from the Christ-heavens the white-winged dove of peace. ' Let us have peace.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
