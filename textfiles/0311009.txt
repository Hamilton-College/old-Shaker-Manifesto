THREE STAGES First.— Fear and love. Children obey through love and fear of ultimate physical punishment. Second.— Youth obey through love, self-respect, and the ultimate fear of grieving and offending. Third.— The adult obeys from love, self-respect, from a desire to excel and do right, and, finally, from the ultimate fear of selfcondemnation. The same stages of progress may be traced and observed in the religious travel of souls. The Law, written upon stone: ' Thou shalt' do thus and so, or die physically. The First Gospel. — A call to such as were prepared to believe and obey, or be ' damned ' — condemned — spiritually. The Second Gospel. —An invitation: ' The Spirit and the Bride say Come, and all who hear say Come and be free! ! Perfect love of truth, of good, of Gfod, hath cast out all fear of physical death, and all of spiritual condemnation, and all fear but the one fear of Grod — the fear to offend Love.
