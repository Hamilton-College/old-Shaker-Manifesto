'HONOR WHERE HONOR IS DUE.' We are in very common, and constantly happy receipt, of eulogistic and complimentary letters thanking us for our unselfish labors in behalf of The Manifesto. We want all our own people to know that there is a most energetic and talented sister in our household, whose unselfish and most kind attentions to the details of The Manifesto are deserving of unmeasured praise, and much more. Were it not for her untiring zeal, for her unequaled love for and interest in The Manifesto, neither editor nor publisher would receive the credit we now get from every quarter. It is no easy task to keep the mailing lists all in correct order; nor to direct so perfectly the thousands of copies proceeding from this office. Then there is much copying to be done, and many details too numerous and small to be mentioned, and these are all and faithfully attended to, gratuitously, and during hours that might be used for recreation, by one who chooses to be nameless here ; and yet without such devotion, The Manifesto would not be even what it is in excellence. That our dear friends may know hereafter who to praise and send gifts both earthly and heavenly we will whisper â€” Sarah Ann Neal, Shakers, N. Y.
