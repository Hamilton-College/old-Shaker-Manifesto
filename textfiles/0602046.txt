Earth worms __Earth worms. These insignificant and unattractive creatures are of the greatest benefit to the fields which they inhabit, though many have supposed to the contrary. They are very humble but efficient servants of the agriculturist; and far from injuring his meadow and his garden, they devote themselves with praiseworthy assiduity to turning over the soil to a greater depth and more thoroughly than can be done with the best appliances known to science. These animals (for so they are classified by the naturalists) are scarcely more than animated tubes. They seem to live by taking earth and earthly substances in at one end and passing them out at the other. This simple process of digestion is aided, however, by a mucous secretion; and the worm has a habit, when he has filled himself with earth, of ascending to the surface, turning around and working himself back again into the ground. This operation unloads him; and the process repeated by millions of his fellows cannot but have a highly beneficial effect upon the quality of land. It is said by Mr. Darwin that these worms have been known to cover a field to the depth of thirteen inches in the course of eighty years. A slow process, to be sure, but so are all the processes of Nature. This, however, is not all that they do. They carry their shafts and galleries to a depth of several feet, and cross and intersect in all directions, loosening the soil, opening it to the air and water, and, in short, doing all that they can to help vegetation, without preying upon it or injuring its roots in the slightest degree.
