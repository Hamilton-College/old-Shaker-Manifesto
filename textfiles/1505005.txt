GOSPEL. ARABELLA SHEPARD. 'The gospel is pure, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. ' This short sentence of scripture language, speaks volumes. Who would not be in possession of such a gospel? It is worth more than silver or gold, or all that this earth can bestow. Whoever hath this gospel, and doth strictly live it, hath the durable riches ; riches that never will fail to comfort or console under the most complicated and severe tribulation that we could be called to pass through. It is the pearl of great price, and will recommend itself to the mind under all circumstances. To become possessor of this gospel, a thorough work of self-examination is necessary in order to expel from the heart every evil propensity, and when impurities are re' moved, we shall be in the way of cultivating and cherishing the heavenly and the Christian virtues which alone will recommend us to a beau! if ul home beyond the scenes of time.
