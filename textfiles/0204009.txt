Providence 'With dark, foreboding thoughts oppressed I wandered forth one summer's day : Hoping abroad to ease my breast, And grief allay. Deep in a lone and green retreat I laid me down, with many a sigh; When lo! a daisy at my feet Allured my eye. Methought, with sympathetic smile, It seemed to pity, and reprove; And thus my bitter cares beguile With words of love : ' Sad mortal, cease thy anxious sighs! Why sit you down in sorrow here ? Does not each leaf that meets thine eye Reprove thy fear? ' Although a mean, unheeded flower, My daily wants are all supplied; And he who brought me to this hour, Will still provide. ' The light and dew, the sun and rain, Are daily seen to foster me; And fearest thou God will not deign To think of thee ?' Ashamed, I rose : rebuked my care, And blest the teacher of the sod; Resolved, to chase away despair And trust in God.
