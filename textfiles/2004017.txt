THE CONQUEST OF SELF. Ida A. Thomas. He that ruleth his own spirit, is greater than he who takes a city. There is no conflict so severe as the labor of subduing one's self; there is so much opposition in human nature so much that is opposed to the natural inclinations of the will and disposition of the individual, that oft times holds us as it were in bonds of iron. And oh ! the conflict, the thousand, yea the unnumbered army of foes we meet, all to be subdued with do other weapon but the gospel sword. It is powerful enough when wielded within. With eyes open to all the foes within struggling lo overcome the powers of good, I would burst the fetters and scatter the foes that dwell in my own heart. For there is no greater enemy than one's self. The conflLt is not won in a day, a week, a month or a year, but is a life struggle. It requires a bright burning light within, a daily refilling and trimming of the lamp of the soul, and a burning indignation against all that would retard the travel of the soul. To gain a rich increase, labor is required and this labor is to cultivate true Christian virtues, by uprooting all that is evil. One may possess a very bad habit which, growing for years may have taken deep root, it is just like the obnoxious weed in the garden it requires the united strength of each other to uproot it, the attempt is made, the visible part is cropped off but ere long growth is observed, coarse green leaves appear and we know the root remains. In the spiritual growth, is a deep work, it searches, it goes down to the foundation, undermining, te iriug and pulling apart all those elements of the natural disposition which cause rebellion and destruction, making room for the rise and progress of the spiritual life.
