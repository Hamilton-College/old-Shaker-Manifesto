ANGEL EYES We often think of angel eyes That watch us here below, Of spirit friends â€” the good and wise, Who light the path we go. They lift for us the mystic veil, That in vision we may see, The beauteous scenes that will not fail In blest eternity. They sing for us seraphic strains Of yonder peaceful shore; And show to us the golden gains Of heaven's garner'd store. And, with rejoicing, make us feel The strength of angel love, That lifts the soul, through faith and zeal, To brighter spheres above. Where love, unmix'd with earth's alloy, Pure as the Mother's own, Crowns dear departed ones with joy, In their celestial home. We love those blessed angel eyes, That search us through and through, And read the heart's intents, as well As actions that we do. They would, in love, our souls baptize, And be our guardian friends ; They listen to our earnest cries, Which oft to heaven ascend. Julia Johnson, Hancock, Mass.
