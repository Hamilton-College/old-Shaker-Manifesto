Enfield, N. H. Nov. 1894. On the evening of the 16th ult. the Centennial League entertained t!:e Society with original compositions, dialogues and music. It was especially appreciated because it was all prepared without the aid of teachers. Our anniversary supper, in commemoration of the founding of our Society in Enfield, one hundred and one years ago, was given on the 18th ult. The dininghall was beautifully dressed in autumn leaves and evergreen, and the occasion was one of pleasure and thanksgiving to all. One of our Sisters at the Infirmary picked some ripe raspberries on the 20th of Oct. which would indicate that the Weather Bureau has got the seasons a trifle mixed. In September Elder William had an auction sale of the property and live stock of our South family, and again on the 7th inst., a sale of farm produce. The aggregated sales amounted about $2,000. Our large Grist-mill at North Enfield has recently been sold, with all the privileges belonging to it, for $13,000. Sisters are busy drawing the window sash in several of our houses. Pipes are being put in order, and buildings banked to keep out the frosts of winter. The first snow-storm of the season came on the 6th. So far we have had about 6 inches of snow. O. 11. Kirldey.
