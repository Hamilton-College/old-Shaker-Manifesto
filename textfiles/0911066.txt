CROSSES A story is told of an old man who lived long ago. Forcible was the way in which he spoke of the struggle he had to carry on, A friend asked him the cause of his complaints, since in the evening he so often complained of great weariness and pain. ' Alas, I have every day so much to do. I have two falcons to tame, two hares to keep from running away, two hawks to manage, a serpent to confine, a lion to chain, and a sick man to tend and wait upon.' ' Why, this is only folly,' said the friend; ' no man has all these things to do at once.' 'Yes, indeed,' he answered, 'it is with me as I have said. The two falcons are my two eyes, which I must diligently guard, lest something should please them which may be hurtful to my salvation; the two hares are my feet, which I must hold back, lest they should run after evil objects and walk in the ways of sin ; the two hawks are my two hands which I must train and keep to work, in order that I may be able to provide for my brethren who are in need ; the serpent is my tongue, which I must always keep in with a bridle, lest it should speak any thing unseemly ; the lion is my heart, with which I have to maintain a continual fight, in order that vanity and pride may not fill it, but that the grace of God may dwell and work there ; the sick man is my own body, which is ever needing my watchfulness and care. All this daily wears out my strength.' The friend listened in wonder, and then said : ' Dear brother, if all men labored and struggled after this manner, the times would be better, and more according to the will of God.' Selected
