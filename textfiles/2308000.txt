TESTIMONY OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, SEN. No. 2 When I arrived at Watervliet, where they lived, I was received with great kindness. The leader of this people was Ann Lee, whom they called Mother ; and truly she seemed like a mother. Her countenance, and the countenances of those who stood as witnesses with her, shone with brightness and glory, as evidently as the shining of the sun upon clear water. This confirmed me that the glory of God was upon them. The first words I recollect hearing from Mother Ann were, 'James, take this man and let him open his mind.' This was just what I desired; and by this I perceived that she knew the state of my mind. I opened my mind and confessed my sins, freely and honestly, before Elder James, as a witness of God. I had frequently confessed my sins to God in secret, as many others do ; and in conformity to the practice of public preachers in antichrist's kingdom, I had frequently, in public, confessed myself and the congregation to be great sinners. But in all this I brought nothing to light, nor did I find any abiding releasement of soul. The burden of my sins returned upon me, and condemnation still continued. I was therefore convinced that I did not confess to God's acceptance: for I read, 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' 1 John i., 10. This promise I had never before found verified. But now, by bringing my deeds to the light, I found the promise of God fulfilled: for I felt entirely released from the burden of sin. All condemnation and despair were entirely taken away, and my soul was filled with heavenly peace and comfort, accompanied with a godly sorrow and repentance for sin. 1 tarried about a week, and witnessed many beautiful displays of divine power and goodness, and heard many precious instructions and exhortations. Here my soul received the precious 'unction of the Holy One,' which is the baptism of the Spirit, and by which I knew the spiritual things of God, which can not be understood nor discerned by the natural man. This produced in me many heavenly gifts, and many operations of Divine Power. Here I obtained the full anAUGUST, 178 THE MANIFESTO. swer of my former prayers; for I had now lived to see the second coming of Christ, and the commencement of his kingdom on earth. In this I was confirmed beyond a doubt. I left them with great reluctance; and nothing but my duty to my family, enjoined by Mother Ann's counsel, could have reconciled my feelings to retire from a place and a people so evidently filled with the Spirit of Christ, and so blessed with the Divine presence. I returned to my family, and felt myself blessed in my obedience to Mother Ann's testimony, and daily enjoyed the presence of God, and felt the powerful influences of his Spirit. And I have reason to bless God that my wife and children all embraced the same testimony of the gospel, and, with the exception of one daughter, who died firm in the faith, they are all now living in the Society, and continue in faithful obedience to the gospel. In September following, after Mother and the Elders, and a number of the leading Brethren were imprisoned in Albany, I was attending a meeting on the Sabbath, at Dr. Isaac Harlow's, with my family and a consider able number of the Brethren and Sisters ; and while we were on our knees, in prayer to God, a mob rushed into the house, headed by the very one who had stirred up the persecution against Mother and the Elders, and caused their imprisonment. They seized and dragged me out of the house, and carried me off to the house of their champion. The next morning they made a pretence of trying me before one Adgate, who had been a justice of the peace under the royal government. Here I was accused of speaking against the war; and it was also alleged that Mother and the Elders were British emissaries in disguise, who were exciting their hearers against the war. After this mock trial, (for I can call it nothing else,) I was hurried off to Albany, to be tried before the commissioners who composed the Board of War. Here I was again charged with maintaining the principles of Ann Lee against the lawfulness of war. Such principles, they contended, were detrimental to the cause of the country, which was then engaged in the arduous struggle for liberty, against a powerful enemy, and forbid my preaching such doctrine. I replied, 'I shall speak what God gives me to speak; for I feel it my duty to obey God rather than man. I did not receive the testimony against war from Ann Lee ; but was taught by the revelation of God, before I ever saw Ana Lee, that the followers of Christ could have nothing to do with wars and fightings.' This declaration was so offensive to the commissioners, that they gave orders for my imprisonment, declaring at the same time, that the Elect Lady was going to be banished to the British army in New York. I replied 'The Elect Lady she is, indeed and in truth ; but whether she sinks or swims, I know the work is of God.' They would not suffer me to be imprisoned with Mother and the Elders; I was therefore confined in the jail of the old City Hall. After ten days imprisonment, I was set at liberty through the intercession THE MANIFESTO. 179 of my brother, who produced many certificates from respectable characters, of my former zeal in the cause of my country. From all the proceedings of these inveterate persecutors, it appeared evident that the clamorous charges of British emissaries and traitors to the country, which were raised against the leaders of the Society, were merely a pretext, under which they intended to effect the destruction of the Society, by securing the leaders and suppressing their testimony. But in this they were disappointed; for many who received intelligence of these things, flocked to hear the testimony of a people who were persecuted and imprisoned for the cause of righteousness and peace. So that in the event, the very means they had taken to prevent the spreading of the gospel, produced a far more extensive increase. Thus the overruling providence of God 'caused the wratn of man to praise him.' Being now in the eighty-fourth year of my age, and on the verge of eternity, I feel it my duty to leave behind me a testimony of my experience, for the benefit of all who are seeking, as I once was, to find religion in the dark pages of ecclesiastical theology, written in the dark kingdom of antichrist, by the blind guides of a bigoted priesthood. And as I feel a sense of my solemn responsibility to a just and holy God, I can have no possible wish nor motive to deceive my fellow-creatures, in any manner whatever. I can therefore assure every candid inquirer after truth, that I could never find the work of salvation, nor the life and power of religion, which is the essence of the gospel, by all my labors and researches, until I found the present testimony of the gospel, which was brought to light by Mother Ann Lee. And concerning her testimony, I can truly say, it is 'the power of God unto salvation :' for such it has proved itself by its effects. It has purified my soul from sin, and saved me from the corrupt propensities of an evil nature. It has afforded me justification and peace for nearly forty-seven years. Through this gospel I have received many precious gifts, and many divine manifestations. When I first embraced this testimony, I was baptized with the spirit of humiliation, which brought me under many mortifying and humiliating signs and operations, tending to mortify and crucify the pride of my nature, and show me the folly and vanity of relying on my literary and scientific acquirements to teach the way of salvation, or preach the gospel of Christ. These humiliating operations of the Spirit completely humbled the pride of my education, and prostrated in the dust my exalted station among men. I then felt, by actual experience, the force and power of the prophet's words: 'The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low ; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.' Isa. ii., 17. And this every exalted soul must yet feel and experience, before he can be prepared to enter the kingdom of heaven. By these humiliating scenes, the loftiness of my spirit was abased, and 1 was effectually brought down into a humble frame of mind ; so that I could truly feel the meek and 180 THE MANIFESTO. lowly Spirit of Christ, and profit by the simplicity of the gospel, which, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, is received by babes, rather than by the learned Rabbins and great ones of the earth. After this, my soul was blessed with many joyful and heavenly gifts of God ; such as gifts of revelation and prophecy, which have actually come to pass ; discerning of spirits ; so that I could many times discern the secret state of souls : also divers kinds of tongues and signs; and many glorious and heavenly visions, by which the spiritual world was brought, as it were, into open view to my spiritual sight. Concerning the existence of such gifts, in this day, I well know that a spirit of scepticism prevails almost universally, both among professors and profane, and especially among the learned priesthood. They are taught to believe that there can be no such gifts in this day, nor any divine or supernatural inspiration; because they all ceased with the primitive Church. It is true that when the primitive Church lost the life and spirit of Christ, and fell back into the spirit of the world, these gifts actually died away. But a restoration was promised, which was to take place when the true Church should rise in the spirit and life of Christ: for these gifts are the life of the soul, and a seal to the testimony of the true gospel. I was formerly taught, agreeable to the prevailing opinion, that those gifts had ceased, and were no more to be expected. Accordingly I strove to believe it, until I was convinced to the contrary by actual experience. I have myself experienced many such gifts; I have been an eye and ear witness of many such in Mother and the Elders ; and many such have I known to take place in the Church, from time to time, down to this day. Can I then disbelieve the sight of my own eyes, the hearing of my own ears, the feelings of my own senses, or the inspirations of Divine light in my own soul? I can not. The evidenco of these things is as clear to me as that of my own existence. It is an immutable truth, established by the eternal principles of heaven, that without the inspiration and gifts of the Holy Spirit, no soul can ever find salvation. These gifts, being the very essence of divine life, are as important to the spiritual life of the soul, as the inspiration of the natural air is to the natural life of the body. Why then will mankind still cleave to an erroneous and blind tradition, which can not be maintained by scripture nor reason? 0, ye professors of the divine religion of Jesus Christ! when will ye cease to believe in the soul-darkening doctrines of men, and the blinding creeds of human invention? Is not God 'the same yesterday, to-day and forever?' Is his 'hand shortened that it can not save,' or his Spirit straitened that it can not work ? Is it not iniquity 'that has separated between you and your God ? ' Have not your sins shut you from the light of his countenance, and hid from your eyes the divine operations of his Spirit? I know, by living experience, that this was once my case, and why not yours now? I feel it my duty, before I leave this THE MANIFESTO. 181 earthly tabernacle, to bear a testimony concerning the characters, moral and religious, of Mother Ann and the Elders who administered the gospel with her ; knowing, as I do, the many false and infamous reports circulated in the world against them, and more especially against Mother Ann, who was the principal object of the dragon's rage. For it is clearly evident that he is now gone forth in his wrath, uto make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, aid maintain the testimony of Jesus.' I have been with her in many places, and had much opportunity to hear her testimony and observe her conduct, both in public and private ; and I can bear witness to the purity of her life and the sincerity of her religion. She was truly a pattern of godliness to all Christians, and especially to those of her own sex: for she was indeed the most exemplary person, both in word and deed, that my eyes ever beheld. Her words were generally few; but they were directed in the most perfect wisdom; and none were able to gainsay or resist the power of her spirit. Yet she was free and familiar in conversation, when occasion required it; nor did she feel herself above conversing freely with the least and the lowest, whether aged or young. She showed a remarkably kind and tender feeling towards children, and would often give them some good advice ; and the attachment of such little ones to her was wonderful. There were many small children who, by a few words from her, received impressions of godliness which governed them through life. And there are numbers now living, whose first impressions of faith and love to the way of God, were inspired into their souls, by the notice of Mother Ann to them, in their infancy. She was truly a Mother in Christ. Her whole soul seemed entirely devoted to the will of God; and her discerning spirit was able to see and feel the state of souls in every situation, and to administer to their necessities under all circumstances. Indeed, the discerning light of God in her was such, that it seemed as if no secret thought of the heart could be hid from her. Often did she expose the secret sins of hypocrites and deceivers, to their shame and confusion : and in all she said, I never knew her to be in the least mistaken. She always manifested a feeling of kindness and compassion to the poor, the widow and the fatherless, and often deprived herself of temporal comforts, in order to administer to their wants. She taught us to be faithful and just in all things, both spiritual and temporal�to be industrious, prudent and saving, and to manage our temporal affairs with economy, that the blessing of God might attend our labors. In so doing, she said we should be blessed with a plentiful store of the comforts of this life, and be able to supply the wants of the poor and needy. And by walking in uprightness and keeping the way of God in purity, she assured us that we should always be blessed with the gospel and the gifts of the Holy Spirit, not only for ourselves, but to administer to other needy souls, who should desire to forsake the course of this world, and 182 THE MANIFESTO. find a part with us in the way of God. In the early part of my life, I often contemplated upon the character of a child of God, as exhibited in the New Testament, and earnestly sought for it; but could never find it, until I found it in Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker ; there indeed I found it perfectly exemplified to my full satisfaction. Come then, ye who desire to learn the way of peace and righteousness, and be partakers of that life and salvation which, I can testify, is treasured up in this Church, which was founded by the ministration of Mother Ann Lee. I know by the revelation of God, and by my own experience, that the second coming of Christ has commenced ; that the latter day of glory has dawned upon earth, and the kingdom of Christ is begun, which will never have an end. And i feel confident that all souls will yet bow ' before it, and acknowledge it, either in judgment or mercy. Beware then, ye children of men, that ye speak not evil of those things which ye understand not, 'lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets ; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish; for I work a work in your day, a work which ye will in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.' Acts xiii., 40, 41. Expecting this to be my last public duty, I solemnly bear witness, in the fear of God, to the truth of these things; and I pray God that, in his mercy, it may be the means of awakening and rightly directing some poor lost souls, who are, as I once was, seeking in the wilderness, where there is no water, and in the desert, wh re there is none to save, and where there is no way of salv:.tioa to be found. So testifies your aged friend. New Lebanon, N. Y. 1827.
