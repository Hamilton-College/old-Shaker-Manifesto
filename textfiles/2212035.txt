In Memory of our departed Sister, AMELIA LYMAN Margaret Hopkins. One more beautiful example of a true Christian lias gone to meet her reward, and to find prepared a beautiful mansion. She has been a faithful laborer in the vineyard of the Lord. At the age of ten years she came into this Society, and was a remarkably active, kind, and sympathetic youth, and as she matured in years, she also matured in all the Christian graces which so endeared her to us, that although the summons has come for us to part, we find our hearts deeply pained to say adieu, and to realize that we shall hear her cheerful voice in love and encouragement no more. Having been intimately acquainted for the past fifty years with our departed Sister, I can say she was a patient sufferer for many years, but was ever cheerful, Avilling to do good whenever able to be in duty. Her life of self-sacrifice was becoming the profession she held so dear. We shall long hold our beloved Sister in sweetest memory.
