BE A MAN. Foolish spending is the father of poverty. Do not be ashamed of hard work. Work for the best salaries or wages you can get, but work for half price rather than be idle. Be your own master, and do not let society or fashion swallow up your individuality-- hat, coat and boots. Do not eat up or wear out all that you earn. Compel your selfish body to spare something lor profits saved. Be stingy to your own appetite, but merciful to others' necessities. Help others, and ask no help for yourself. See that you are proud. Let your pride be of the right kind. Be too proud to be lazy; too proud to give up without conquering every difficulty; too proud to wear a coat you cannot afford to buy ; too proud to be in company that you cannot keep up with in expenses; too proud to lie, or steal, or cheat; too proud to be stingy.
