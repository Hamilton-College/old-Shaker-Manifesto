INDEPENDENCE IN SOME THINGS E. A. SEDGWICK In this centennial year, let the people declare Freedom and Independence from Sin. Let us have a peace jubilee, and permit the spirit of truth to govern the United States, and may it continue as long as time shall last. Resolved, That we look to Jesus Christ, as our law giver; that we obey his laws, and follow his example ; that land, air and water, shall be free to use. It is selfish for individuals to hold land. Selfishness leads to envy, and envy leads to lust. We know that lust is the cause of sin, and sin is the cause of sorrow. ' The wages of sin is death.' We can live free from sin and sorrow, if we take up crosses against animal passions. Selfishness makes us think evil, and do evil, ' Charity thinketh no evil, but endureth all things.' If you suffer wrong, resent it not, but endure it; use kind words. ' Kind words can never die.' They are treasures of the living truth, found only in Heaven; and if we do the will of Christ, we have Heaven on earth, and the Lord's Prayer fulfilled, as it was in Christ â€” he practiced all he preached. It is written '' the Kingdom of Heaven is within you,' it cometh not by observation, but by works; theory is not salvation, but example is. Hancock, Mass.
