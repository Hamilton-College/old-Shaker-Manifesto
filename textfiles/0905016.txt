As ye would NOTES. â€”President Hayes is worthy the thanks of all heavens for the just and merciful position he acts from, when dealing with the Chinese. While so many intriguers with policy are seeking selfish ends at the government's capital, it is an assurance that America is not God-forsaken, nor likely to be, while R. B. Hayes stands at its official head. And what a shame it is, that the names of so many brilliant political lights of both parties (and particularly shameful for the Republicans), were recorded in favor that 'the heathen Chinee must go ! ' May the President and his counselors give us as practical illustra tions of the golden rule while dealing with the Indian question.
