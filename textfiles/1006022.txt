How nice! The eulogistic criticisms rendered by our friend T. C. Callicot, editor of the Albany Evening Times, which paper, by the way, is the best edited sheet in this country, outside of the city of New York â€” we only wish we could feel were as well deserved as they are conscientiously given. The beautious results therein pictured are truly the fruits of the shaker system when acting* under its full development. It only remains for us Shakers to act more in accord with the system to have his critical statements true. But how nice!
