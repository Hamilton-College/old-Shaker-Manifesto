Winged Guardians. Winged Guardians. The swallow, swift and nighthawk are the guardians of the atmosphere. They check the increase of insects, that otherwise would overload it. Woodpeckers and creepers are the guardians of the trunks of trees. Warblers and flycatchers protect the foliage. Blackbirds, thrushes, crows and larks protect the soil under the surface. Each tribe has its respective duties to perform in the economy of nature ; and it is an undoubted fact that, if the birds were all swept away from off the earth, man could not live upon it, vegetation would wither and die, and insects would become so numerous that no living thing could withstand their attacks.â€” London Farmer.
