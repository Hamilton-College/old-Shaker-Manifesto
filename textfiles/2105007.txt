Dearest mother, thou hast left us... Written April 8th. 1891. for LAVINA McINTIRE. who this day passed over the River. Nellie O. Whitney. Dearest mother, thou hast left us, For a home in a fairer clime, Angels sing a welcome to tliee, Eest, loved one from things of time. We shall miss thee, dearest mother, Miss thee when the way seems dark, But we pray thee, linger near us, And thy blessing still impart. Many years thou hast toiled in Zion, For the cause of truth and right; Fought the battle, gained the victory, Now thy robe is snowy white. Trials and afflictions many, Were thy portion here to share; God will now repay thy labors Hold thee in his loving care. We would follow thy example, We would live as thou hast lived Without flinching in the warfare, All to God we'd freely give. For thou'It wear a crown of glory Which the loyal hearted wear; Thou wilt have a mansion holy, For the pure in heart prepared. Thou wilt meet with friends and kindred, Loved ones who have gone before. O the meeting! O the greeting! When thou'lt meet on that bright shore. Fai^ewell Mother, we shall miss thee, Miss thy kindness and thy love, And we hope to be so faithful That we'll meet in heaven above. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
