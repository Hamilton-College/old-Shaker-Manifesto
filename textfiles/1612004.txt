SOWING. Are we sowing seeds of kindness? They shall blossom bright ere long; Are we sowing seeds of discord? They shall ripen into wrong; Are we sowing seeds of honor? They shall bring forth golden grains. Are we sowing seeds of falsehood? We shall yet reap bitter pain Whatsoe'er our sowing be, Heaping, we its fruits must see. We can never be too careful What the seed our hands shall sow; Love from love is sure to ripen� Hate from hate is sure to grow; Seeds of good or ill we scatter, Heedlessly along our way� But a glad or grievous fruitage Waits us at the harvest day, What soe'er our sowing be Heaping, we its fruits must see.
