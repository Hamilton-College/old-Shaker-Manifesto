LIFE IN THE WOODS, NO. 5. GRANVILLE T. SPROAT. It was in the month of September, 1837, that, having closed up my school in camp I started on a second vaccinating tour across the great plains that lay across the sources of the Mississippi. It was, I said, the month of September, the month in which the Indians say, 'The Fire Spirits are awake,' that, with Ma-gwah-gah-bo for a guide, I started on my journey. The weather had been very fine for many days ; there had been no rain for nearly a month, and we had noticed, at a distance, as we lay down at night, the distant horizon glowing, as if it caught its hue from burning prairies. Still we did not feel any particular cause for alarm, as the fire, if there was any, must be at an immense cistance, and therefore not likely to visit us, without giving us sufficient opportunity to escape. It was about two o'clock, in the morning, that I was aroused by the voice of Ma-gwahgah-bo, sounding at the door of my wigwam. 'Ish-Jco-da! ish-Teo-dal wain-je-tah! ivaweep!' (Fire! fire! get up! haste! the Fire Spirits are upon us.) I sprang up, and rushed to the door of my wigwam, to witness a sight such as I had never seen before. The whole western horizon, far and near, was one vast sheet of liquid, rolling flame. It streamed up far past our meridian, blazing, and dazzling over-head above even the place where we stood. ' Wa-weep! wa-weep!'' (quick! quick! for life .') cried Ma-gwah-gahbo ; and away he rushed through the tall grass, myself following close at his heels. Away he sprang over the prairie, I with difficulty keeping up. Such speed he made, although he had to break his way through the tall prairie grass before us. At last he reached a rising swell of land, and as we gained the summit, and began to descend on the opposite slope. I perceived before us a broad marsh filled with reeds standing in the midst of water. But the fire, was by this time, upon us ; we could feel the heat as we descended towards the marsh; the air became close like an oven. I was covered with perspiration, and felt my strength rapidly going. As we reached the shores of the marsh I threw myself down, perfectly exhausted. 'Get up! get up!' cries Ma-gwah-gah-bo. 'Haste you will burn to death here!' 'Life, or death,' I exclaimed, 'I cannot go one step farther.' 'Get on to my back, then,' cries the old man, 'get on to my back.' I did get on to his back, and he carried me on, running with me a great distance toward the centre of the marsh. He then threw me over his head into the water, laying himself close beside me, and saying, 'Keep under! keep under! and watch for the burning clouds!' By 'burning clouds,' he meant heavy masses of burning prairie grass brought here by the wind, and lighting all around us, which, if they fell on us, would burn, or smother us. Here we lay amid the rushes and water, looking out on the terrible scene before us. Yonder, over the swell that we had just passed, came the flames, rolling and rolling onwards, a vast deluge of fire. Down the descent they came, we could hear them hiss as they reached the waters of the marsh, and see them careering, like race horses, along its shores, which seemed to say to them, 'Thus far shall ye come, and no farther.' Presently I looked, and saw crouching among the reeds just beside me, something blackâ€”I knew not what. I said to Ma-gwahgah-bo, 'What is that?' 'Ma-gwah !' he exclaimed, (A bear !) 'Do you see that thing, which looks like a bush, yonder among the reeds? That is a moose, a moose's horns. Oh, we are not here alone. Company enough! company enough 1' It was so indeed. All the animals in the vicinity had fled to this marsh for protection from the fire. 'Will you kill them?' I asked, referring to the moose and the bear, for I had never before made a bear my bed-fellow. 'Kill them! No ! The same Great Spirit that sent us here sent them here! I will not hurt a hair of their heads.' After a few hours the fire passed off, leaving behind it, a vast plain, covered with smouldering grass, whose damp roots the fire had not consumed. The Indians make war not only against the lives of their enemies, but, also, against their language and inventions. They will not suffer their enemies names to be mentioned in their wigwams, and will have no spoils of 190 THE MANIFESTO. theirs, excepting their scalps. Perhaps I cannot better illustrate this fact, than by relating an incident which took place in the autumn of 1837. I had been instructed to go across the Mississippi and vaccinate old Hole in the Day's band. Hole in the Day was a Sioux, and a mortal enemy to the O-jib-ways, with whom I made my home. I said to Ma-gwah-gah-bo. 'Tomorrow I cross the Mississippi, to visit the Sioux camp, on the other shore, avid will depend on you to go with me, to paddle my canoe safely over,' for the stream was rapid. The old man's countenance fell. 'There never was an O-jib-wah' said he, 'who ever went into the Sioux country and come back again alive.'. 'You go, I replied, 'under my own protection, and are as safe as I myself.' 'Well,' he replied, 'I put my life into your hands. I will go with you.' (To BE CONTINUED.)
