Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Average of Weather at Mount Lebanon. September. Thermometer. Bain. 1890. 1891. 61. 65.60 11.31 in. 2.18 in. Geo. M. W. Oct. 11, 1891. Beloved Editok;�The bountiful harvest which this year has been ours to enjoy, from the earliest to the latest fruits, teaches us anew the all-important lesson, 'We reap what we sow.' In this case we also gather where has been planted. From spacious orchards we now gather the delicious fruit of trees, most of them planted by those whose tireless labors, have won for them the invitation: 'Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' The planting of trees by those on the shady side of life, seems to me to be the embodiment of an unselfish interest in those who are their successors. In this, our loved ones gone before have set a noble example. Will those now in life's prime, 'go and do likewise.' If every one numbered in our ranks should take for their text the golden words uttered by Elder Giles as reported in Notes from Enfield, N. H., 'We should be producers as well as consumers,' both spiritually and temporally, where would ever come a de. cline. O let not one who shares the blessings of our Home, draft upon its treasures without doing all in their power to return the same to the Lord's storehouse with no stinted measure. The picking of our winter apples was finished on the 10th. inst. and one thousand one hundred and twenty-five bushels have been taken from the trees, and now nearly as many still remain to be gathered for drying and for cider. And such beautiful apples. It has been like viewing a delightful panorama, to watch their growth since the early spring gave us the clustered blossoms in such abundance. Center Family. Oct. 14, 1891. Beloved Eldek Heney;�We have abundant cause to be thankful for both spiritual and temporal blessings; for abundant crops of hay, corn and potatoes, also fruit of all kinds commonly cultivated here. Fruit is generally fairer, and pears sweeter than in most years. Apples are less perforated with the fly maggot than in other years of late. This pest was little known here twenty years ago, but of late, has destroyed the value of a great deal of otherwise fair and excellent fruit. We are well along in our apple picking, and the fruit is fairer and more of it, than we saw reason to expect in the forepart of summer. Our tomatoes also have yielded bountifully, when once they could be persuaded to ripen. But the frost keeping its distance from our hills until the 10th. of October has given us ample time to reap the benefits of the care bestowed on our spacious tomato patch. We hope abler pens with more time than ours, will report the pleasure which we as a village enjoyed from the first to the fifth of October by the 'Harvest-Home Gathering' at the North Family. All were invited and during the days it was open, nearly all of our village attended to see the collection of fruits, flowers, vegetables and industries of that devoted family ; to be met with smiling faces, gentle voices, and to listen to recitations, speeches, songs, etc., suitable to the occasion. 'Coming events cast their shadows before' sometimes. Is this a forerunner of a Society 'Harvest-Home' for our Centennial, 1892, to show what progress our Community, starting from almost nothing, has made in one hundred years. When my thoughts turn to our possibilities as a Community, volumes seem to open before me, and- - - - -but I must write no more at this time, lest even the forbearance of our patient editor, become so exhausted that my humble offering arriving too late, be consigned to the waste basket. A. J. C. Our Society meetings, according to custom must be near their close for the year, but they have been seasons of deep spiritual interest, and movings of the waters of life, promoting union, harmony, and supplying food to those who hunger and thirst for salvation and the bread of eternal life. Yet it does not seem to be the time when we can consistently proclaim 'Ho! Every one that thirsteth come!' Come all ye needy and hungering souls� We've enough and to spare. Because only a selected number can be admitted to our feast at present. It is public only to certain prepared ones. This is not mentioned for complaint, but for reminder. There are times and seasons in the spiritual work of God, as in the natural creation, and there is a suitable time and season for every righteous proceeding under the sun, moon, or stars. But never, nay never a time for unrighteousness. Souls endowed with spiritual talents, are enriched in giving. The liberal soul shall have liberal store. 'O our mortal friends and brothers! Each and all must toil for others, And the soul that gives most freely From its treasures hath the more : For in losing life we find it, And in giving love we bind it, Like an amulet of safety To our hearts forevermoie.' We had a very enjoyable season Oct. 1st, at an industrial exposition and social entertainment given at the North Family, which had the right kind of talent to make it a complete success�Thanks and honor to whom honor is due. Long live and prosper the Manifesto, and its Editor and contributors, and abundance of light, peace and health to its readers. * North. Kamily. Oct. 10, 1891. The summer has past, and the harvest most brought to a close. We are now engaged gathering in our apples of which we have a great abundance, and very nice. The weather the past few weeks has been beautiful; no frost till this A. M. Everything has ripened up, and we had some very large yields. Our patch of tomatoes a little more than half an acre, has yielded at the rate of one thousand bushels to the acre; never saw tomatoes so thick and so nice. Sweet corn was a very heavy crop. Winter squash (white chestnut) on a little over half an acre we had six tons and a half. Beans were likewise very good. Indeed we are most bountifully blest with every good thing pertaining to this life, and if we don't have a grand thanksgiving, it will be because we are too selfish and have not done our duty, loving our neighbors as we do ourselves. In working our gardens the past season, I never before realized the benefit there was, in frequently stirring the soil; the weeds in this respect prove a great blessing to the diligent cultivator; if it were not for the weeds, our gardens in many cases would seldom be cultivated or hoed. The appearance of the weeds constantly remind us, and of necessity we stir the soil. Straight rows, and uniform distance apart are a great advantage, in field, or garden. Irregular crooked rows, mean careless cultivation; careless cultivation gives indifferent crops; poor crops are no incentive to gratitude; unthankfulness leads to impatience and poverty; thus crooked rows have a depressing, downward tendency. While straight rows, and clean culture ever tend upward towards perfection. Our gospel friends at Hancock are an example to all who pass their street; and there is no doubt, that many a one passing tlieir straight-rowed, clean kept gardens, and witnessing their enormous crops, has caught an inspiration inciting him to go and do likewise. External surroundings have a marked influence on the internal growth of young people. A company of boys put to work in a field or garden where the rows are crooked and overrun with weeds, where the fences are covered with briers and bushes and the walks in a slipshod, slovenly condition, and it will be very easy for them to be rude and disorderly. I love straight rows, clean of weeds and neatly kept borders; they make it easier to be good. Well, it looks as though our Society Meetings would soon be closed; for upon the arrival of cold weather we have no means of heating our meeting house that is satisfactory, and no thoroughly scientific way of ventilating it. I think the house where we meet for worship, should be made the most comfortable; where the best knowledge of art and science should be embodied, to warm the house equally all over, and where the ventilation is so perfect, that at the close of the meeting the air is in as pure a condition as when first entered; and it should be out of the reach of anybody to stop the breathing process going on. Every house where humans, or other animals live or meet, should be constructed so that it as really breathes, as does the animal body. Shall not this knowledge be brought into one or more of our meeting houses as a preparatory step for our centennial 1892. In kindest love, D. O.
