THE GOSPEL AS THE GOAL OF EVOLUTION. W. Watson Andrews. From the source of life and power, From our globe's formative hour, From the primal step in progress Of the human race on earth; I would trace the evolution Of that race, to the fruition Of its hopes and expectations, In a so-called second birth. Back beyond remotest ages, Seen by prophets, seen by sages; Man is traced by modern science, As he never was before; Traced from lower, bestial nature, Primal works of the Creator, Through evolving, fruitful eons, To a state for man in store; Through the savage, the civilian; Through the Christian, cultured million, Through the dark and bloody ages, That essayed the symbol cross; To our Savior's high ideal, To the day this is made real, In a final, full salvation; In redeeming man from loss. Man is what lie is by nature, Through no mistake of the Creator, Scientific research teaches As it never did before; In accord with revelation, In accord with the foundation Of the mountains and the valleys, As they formed in days of yore. Yet the will of the Creator In the universe of nature And her laws, is apprehended By experience alone; And, forsooth, each generation, Of each epoch, of each nation, And each individual person, Must needs have one of his own; For we find, although another, An officious, kindly brother, May afford us hope and courage; Yet experience alone, Is sufficiently assuring To establish all enduring Faith in Ciirist and in his gospel, That shall make Ms life our own. That shall furnish the conviction, That alone the crucifixion, Which our Savior meekly suffered, Symbolized upon the cross,� Is the final step in progress, Is the only way of egress From our rudi mental nature, Which theology names loss. Mark! this partial, selfish feature In our riiclimental nature, Is the source of earthly fulness And of travel to its goal, Of the human race through ages, To the time foretold by sages, When the Christ should come in glory, To redeem the human soul. This last change in evolution, Is no cruel retribution; ~No infliction, but an epoch In the travel of the race; To a state�a situation, E'en the most exalted station, Occupied by men or angels In the heavenly Father's grace. To attain this royal favor In the union of the Father, There is needed total change In the direction of the will And the motives and desires, Of whoever fain aspires To this perfect state of freedom, 'Tis man's privilege to fill. For while working down in nature,� A subordinate creator,� It is needful man be governed By the laws of primal life; Must be partial to his father, And his sister and his mother; And must keep and love his children, Lands and chattels and his wife; With their unions, and their schisms, And their world antagonisms; And these, needs must bound his being, And must fill his heart and life. For the family relation, Could be formed but by attraction,� An affection, superseding For the time, all other care Of whatever name or nature; Even that of the Creator, Has small place in these affections, Quite a secondary share. And hence not until this labor In the reproductive order,� Or in act or in desire,� Is outgrown and left behind, Can the man attain fruition To his hopes of full salvation; And be born again, a freeman, And a Savior of his kind. Free from social limitations, From mere sensual relations, Forced and painful separations, And resultant suffering. From unsatisfied desires, From the quick or sraoldering fires Of the appetites and passions, With their noisome clamoring. Free from envy and suspicion, Avarice, and vain ambition; Pride, and jealousies and hatred With attendant train of strife. This it is to be a freeman, Raised above the merely human Into that exalted region, Even the angelic life. This it is to be a savior, Zealous to assist another, By the power of love and kindness, Into this angelic sphere; Far above the world's ambitions, In its fairest, best conditions; To a realm of peace and safety, Free, alike, from doubt and fear.
