West Pittsfield, Mass. June, 1897. June,�the month whose praises poets have sung, whose bright days are so joyfully anticipated through the cold season preceding them, is with us. But how different is the reality from the picture. Since her entrance not a cloudless day have we seen, but steadily night and day, with only slight pauses, in which to gain renewed force, the rain has descended. Some few days ago a slight tremor of the earth was telt by several members of our family, but as it ocurred at night and was of short duration it was attributed to a strong imagination. But upon reading of the earthquake shocks felt in different parts of the country, our belief was confirmed, that we also had received a slight touch of the shock. A company of Sisters attended a meeting held in the Baptist Church of Pittsfield for the purpose of listening to a sermon delivered by the Eev. John McNeill, the Scotch evangelist who has conducted revivals in many countries, and received a hearty welcome in our own. His address was plain, pointed, pleasant, practical and interesting to all. We would encourage all such workers, for like the forerunner, who so many years ago taught the necessity of repentance, they are preparing the hearts of men for the reception of divine truth,� opening the field of the world to receive the seeds of spiritual life. We, who claim a wider knowledge, who by divine mercy, have been given a clearer light, should welcome all such evidences of the world's advancement. Grateful for our light realizing the responsibility of extending it to others, applying our faith to daily life, thus proving its practical value. Not echoing the Pharisaical prayer 'God, I thank thee, I am not as other men are,' but 'I am thankful I am not tempted as they.' We received a very pleasant call from Elder William Wilson and Frank Theobald of Enfield, N. H. and we hope the visit will be renewed at some future time. Fidelia Estabrook.
