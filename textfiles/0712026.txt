SUPERIOR REFLECTIONS Interior says that 'bigotry' means holding view... The Interior says that 'bigotry' means lolding the views of those who are a shade nore conservative than ourselves. Nonsense. ?here are hundreds and thousands in all denominations, from the loosest to the strictest, vho are not bigots in any sense. Bigotry is ;he lack of Christian charity toward those who differ from us in matters of religious beief. THE TIME IS SHORT The time is short; the more the reason,then, For filling it as full as it can hold With thrills of beauty, yearnings for the truth, And joys of love and labor manifold. Then should it chance, as we would fain believe, Life's glory waits us in some other sphere, Its first great joy shall be we did not miss God's meaning in the glory that is here. Honey from the Scriptures Do not think it enough if you learn to spell and read, and to say the words of the Scriptures, but seek to learn the truth of the Scriptures. Do is the bees do. A bee, when it sees a flower, does not fly round and round it, and then fly off' again, like foolish, idle butterflies. It settles on a flower and sucks the honey out of t. You should do as the bees do ; you should settle your thoughts on what you read, and :ry to suck the honey out of it. Almost every verse in the New Testament has its honey. Almost every verse contains a spiritual truth, fit to nourish some soul or other. That may be right which is not pleasant... That may be right which is not pleasant, and pleasant which is not right; but Christ's religion is both. Matthew Henry
