HIGHER. 'Here am I, for thou didst call me.'1 Sam. iii., 6. Canterbury, N. H. 1891. Angels call me, call me higher, To a realm of purer thought; Call me to the fountain nigher, Where the gems of truth are wrought. Call me here to love and worship, Here to serve and learn God's way, Rise, my soul, renewed, responsive, Meet the Christ that calls today.
