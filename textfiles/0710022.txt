RECIPROCITY One of the famous (and justly, honorably so,) Smith Sisters of Glastonbury, Conn., kindly sent us a Bible—translated literally from the original tongue, by herself—and it is a wonderful performance by a very modest, but unusually talented woman. We feel honored by the gift; and to the thousands of Bible readers whom The Shaker will greet with this intelligence, we can safely predict a new-found pleasure by the procurement and delightful pleasure of this valued novelty. One of the Harvard college Hebrew professors--Prof. Young—has expressed himself in unmeasured terms of praise, that a woman, unaided by masculine talents, should have been able to accomplish the task so literally and so accurately. It certainly is a wonderful work, and is well worth the price—very cheap for so neat and large a volume. Those interested may order through this office. Price, three dollars. There is in Haifa, Syria, a missionary station, where those interested in its sustenance have engaged in the manufacture of pure, olive oil, castile soap; hoping by the sale of the genuine article to maintain the mission enterprise. Olive oil in Syria is of small account, for reason of its abundance and cheapness. It has heretofore been extensively used for illuminating purposes ; but petroleum has displaced it. Now, the purest soap imaginable is being made of the olive oil—the genuine castile—and the samples sent us speak very highly for it. The only agency for this excellent article is that of T. B. Nichols, 71 William street, New York. As the enterprise is a charitable one, let us help it.
