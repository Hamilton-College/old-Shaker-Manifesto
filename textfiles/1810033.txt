In Memory of Sister SUSAN A. MINER. Summoned away from earth life, Our precious Sister's gone, Gone from her lot of usefulness, Gone to the vast unknown. No warning voice was given, No time to break the fall, To reconcile the feeling To this most solemn call; But as a bolt of heaven From out a cloudless sky, So suddenly this good Sister Was rudely called to die. The morning saw her cheerful Within our pleasant home, � The evening, crushed and broken, A subject for the tomb. This may be gain to Susan, May be we should not mourn, But 0 ! as her poor body � Our hearts are rudely torn. We can but weep, our Sister, Our hearts will overflow, Though joy and peace await thee, Where thou art called to go ; A life-long, faithful servant, A consecrated soul. Go then, in peace dear Sister, ' Thy faith hath made thee whole.' North Union, O. W. W. A.
