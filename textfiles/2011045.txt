Prince of Peace We have received the advanced sheets of the 'Prince of Peace,' and take much pleasure in commending it as a work of high reputation. Those who are familiar with the writings of 'Pansy' are at once assured of an interesting and instructive publication. The book will contain some 600 pages and 300 illustrationsHere is the story about the fishermen of Galilee. 'These friends were a little way off washing their nets. They had been at work all night, but had caught no fish ; and now discouraged, had given up the attempt and were getting their nets ready to put away. Jesus stepped into one of the boats, which was Peter's, and motioning him to come, asked him to push out a little from shore. Peter did so, and Jesus sat down in the boat and talked to the people on shore; afterwards he turned to Peter and said; Go out a little farther from shore and let down your net.' Said Peter, 'It is no sort of use; we have been at work all night long, and haven't caught a fish,' and I suppose that he farther explained that the night was the time for catching fish, and if one failed then, it was folly to attempt by daylight. But I think he saw something in Jesus' face which made him hasten to add; 'Still, if you say so, we will let down the net again.' No sooner was it done than the fish were drawn into it in such numbers that the net began to break, Peter and his brother Andrew were so astonished that I suppose they hardly knew how to act.'
