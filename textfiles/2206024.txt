Sonyea, N. Y. May, 1892. 'March may blow and April try, But May will tell who'll live or die.' Sunny May lias showered the parched earth to a fulness; six days of continuous rain has caused all living vegetation to 'bud and blossom' as the rose. Peach, pear and cherry trees are laden with their perfumed fruits, a forerunner of 'the great and glorious harvest' in which all men delight; if drought and frost do not blight them. 154 rods of barbed wire were built the past week in connection with much more farm work. The sowing of spring grain was finished some days since, and the sowers are watching the upspringing of their labor with interest. Housecleaning scenes are among the principal plays of the day. As the curtains go up, a clearer and brighter view of external things is presented to the vision, and all out door life appears beautifully beautiful. The Sonyea depot, owned by the Erie Co., was burned on the morning of the 26th. ult. As it was but a port of shelter for waiting pilgrims no loss of property was sustained; fortunately the wind was light, had it been otherwise, the large ware-house standing in the rear would also have been destroyed. We are thankful for its preservation. G. D. G.
