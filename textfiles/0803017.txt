CORRESPONDENCE Solomon Rankin, South Union, Ky My Dear Sir :—I have read all the papers you gave me... Cairo, Ill. Feb. 1, 1878 Solomon Rankin, South Union, Ky My Dear Sir :—I have read all the papers you gave me, relating to Shakerism, and I must say that I have derived much information and much comfort. I say comfort designedly, because your religion aims at a close similitude to perfection, and embraces a clear determination to follow the example of perfection. When Christ said 'Follow me, I am the way and the life,' he said it with a full knowledge of its import. That import was a separation from the world and its alluring follies ; and if the followers of Christ remain in the practice of worldly and unchristian pursuits, where is the 'following' that Christ rec- ommends ? I am more than impressed with the points of life as set forth in the pamphlet you gave me, and I wish to visit you again and learn more of your people and their religion. I desire you to , treat me as a novitiate, because I am in love with your holy lives and sublime truths. I am sick of Sin ; I see my own shapeless deformity as a sinner: I want more light, more truth, more rest THE SHAKER MLAJSTHPESTO. from Sin under Confession and Repentance. In spirit I am a Shaker. I will yet come to you. Your friend and pupil, Charles R. Pryor
