The relations of friendship that have been so long and steadfastly maintained... The relations of friendship that have been so long and steadfastly maintained between the Canadian Indians and the Colonial government were given fresh and gratifying prominence by the recent visit of Earl Dufferin, the Governor-General of the dominion, among them. The respectful, even affectionate reception given him at Ookneeka by 3,000 industrious, intelligent, well-fed and happy Indians, who, having been established in certain definite rights and privileges had long trusted the power that guaranteed them, was a strong contrast to the suspicion and hate born of our contradictory American policy, which is every day getting us deeper and deeper into trouble and complication. He went among them to show the personal interest he took in all classes coming under his administration, and renew those pledges that had been so long and so faithfully kept. He assured them that they should not be violently forced into the white man's rigid mode of life, but mapped out for them an attractive path of peaceful progress, and pointed to a higher plane of development which in time he expected they would reach. The comfortable and contented condition in which he found his wards was a refutation of the idea that the Indians are incapable of civilization, and a rebuke to those who hold it. While Lord Dufferin was travelling among the red men of his dominion, noting their condition for himself, and giving them good advice, the President of the United States was on a junketing trip, and the National forces were prospecting among the Black Hills, where they had no business, inasmuch as they constructively broke faith with the Indians by being there, and unnecessarily made enemies where the English policy would long ago have found friends.
