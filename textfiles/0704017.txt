When Cornelius Vanderbilt departed this life... When Cornelius Vanderbilt departed this life, the clergyman at his funer1 said that his last moments were hap)y because Christ had died for him, in whom he had 'a singularly child-like 'aith' as his Saviour.

Jeus said that a camel might go through he eye of a needle easier than a rich man enter the kingdom of heaven ; and Vanderbilt thereupon proceeds to amass fifty or an hundred millions, to show his ' singularly child-like faith.' We don't see how it was child-like, except in the sense that shows a babe's wisdom. But it is not necessary for a man of property or good position in society to get converted. We never knew such a man to die, who, however destitute his life might have been of any religious purpose, was not at once, by the hand of some theological exponent of the divine counsels, safely landed in Abraham's bosom.
