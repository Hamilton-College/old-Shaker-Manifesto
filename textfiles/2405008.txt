THE WORLDLY FAITH. By Sophia Wayne. 'Tis strange that on this transient sphere, Where all things fade and disappear, That many prize this life so dear, Nor note how fast time flies. They choose a life both vain and gay, Still know how short must be their stay, And yet they dread a reckoning day, Where conscience never dies. How inconsistent such will be, They fear the signs of death to see, That comes to set the spirit free So that it may arise. They fear to draw their latest breath, And tremble at the name of death; It is because they hold a faith That conscience never dies. If they believe such stringent laws, And preach and advocate their cause, Then why not in their follies pause And note how fast time flies. If they have faith in endless pain, Why live so sinful and so vain, Allowing evil thoughts the rein, If conscience never dies. Ballston, N-. F.
