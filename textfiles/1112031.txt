OUR PARENTAGE M. J. ANDERSON Is the erratic idea of no fathers and no mothers in the gospel logical? If so, how can we acknowledge the fatherhood and motherhood of God, or claim to be children of a Divine Parentage, or, indeed, how can we be brothers and sisters ? If we renounce the first relation why not disclaim the other ? Be monks and nuns; but, even these in their separate communion, claim their leaders respectively as parents, styling them the father or mother-superior, as the case may be, and yielding to them implicit child-like obedience. A true natural household is Father and Mother, brothers and sisters; all other connections by ties of consanguinity are outside of the family circle, not necessarily a part of it. Progenital names and relationships do not at all apply to, nor will they ever be likely to become a part of, our spiritual unioh, which is organized on the basis of parental government ; and only as the father and mother elements harmonize mutually, for the welfare and happiness of the children of their adoption, can there be a happy, flourishing and well-ordered household. It requires all the faculties of the natural man and woman, purified, refined and turned into the channel of spiritual life, to fit them for the high trust of paternal and maternal government in Zion. Those who are deficient in the qualities that would make them proper heads of families in the order of nature will be found wanting in the elements that would gather, nurture and bear with souls until they come fortli unto the birth of the regeneration. Wisdom and love combine to bring forth perfection. All hail to those full-orbed souls that shine as suns amid the lesser stars in God's grand universe of life. These are my fathers and mothers in the new creation, and their obedient children are my brothers and sisters, the hundred-fold relation of promise ; the only kindred I claim. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
