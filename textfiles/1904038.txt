NOT THE PROPER CREDENTIALS. The following incident is said to be true : A preacher out west, Mr. H., was a good man, but very rough in his ways and very much given to chewing tobacco. One time he was riding on horse-back through the country when there came up a shower. Riding up to a cabin he hastily hitched his horse and knocked at the door. A sharp looking old lad} answered the summons. The preacher asked for shelter. 'I don't take in strangersï¿½I don't know you,' replied the old lady suspiciously. 'But you know what the Bible says,' said the preacher. ''Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.'' 'You needn't quote Bible,' said the old lady quickly; 'no angel would come down from Heaven with a quid of tobacco in his mouth, as you have.' The door was shut and the preacher unhitched his horse and rode away in the rain.
