God in Man Decisions We invite the careful perusal of the article upon ' Spiritual Communion' by our venerable brother Fraser. It contains elements of deepest and highest value to the thinking classes of to-day. The special reference to the divine in our humanity, of matters which call for a higher arbiter than our selfish judgments, is simply a grand statement. We especially refer to the paragraph after that answer to a series of selfish cpieriesâ€”' Certainly they shall fare alike.' Read,ponder, act conscientiously.
