'God Speed the Day.' BY E. H. WEBSTER He speeds the day; it is his own, And hastens swift along; For suffering souls there yet is born A gladness bright and strong. He speeds it most in seeming ill, In times of trouble sore ; For when each earthly idol's still, We turn to Him the more. A peace is born of conflict deep With carnal selfish ways; And those who this sweet peace can keep, Fear not while truth delays. He speeds it in the hurricane, The fiery fiend and hail, To help us find that greater gain, Which tempests can't assail. He speeds it iu Ihe justice deep, Which sinful living scorns; That what we sow we sure shall reap, And not the grape of thorns. That if our life is full of greeds, And narrow, selfish aims, The sphere we move in feels the seeds Which such a life proclaims. The miasmatic state it breeds, Engenders evils sore, Until in pestilence the seeds Spring up and grow the more. Or, if in burning lust or hate The life be inly spent, The outer sphere is only mate To that by which it's rent.
