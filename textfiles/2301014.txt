With this number of our welcomed little periodical, we wish our dear friends, 'A Happy New Year.' This to us is not an idle pass-word, but from our hearts we send a greeting to all, trusting that happiness the result of faithfulness, may rest as a benediction in every home which the Manifesto visits. Our harvest months seem to have been a reaping time for more than the sowing of men; for the Angel Reaper has garnered four sheaves from our field, so fully ripened, that it was indeed a well-timed harvest. The last of these, Sister Betsey Crosman was gathered just in time to be in at the angels' Thanksgiving. As these noble veterans of our cause pass on, does it not behoove us to look well to the position we hold in the ranks, to know that not only shall our names be upon the roll-call, but that our lives shall be an entire consecration. Let no one allow himself to be mustered in, only for the daily rations. We have a steady, upward march to make, and it needs the single-hearted, valiant, earnest soldiers, brave to conquer the foe within, and courageous to contend with prevailing errors, which inevitably creep into every organization, by the way of unregenerated human nature. On the occasion of the funeral of our worthy father, Elder Daniel Boler, we were happy to meet even though for a short time, so many loved and honored representatives of the Eastern Societies. Need we wait for funerals for the much needed conferences of leading members? Will not our second century, begin a new era? A. J. C.
