DR. TYNG AND THE TIGER. Lyman Abbott, in the Christian Union. Dr. Stephen H. Tyjstg, of St. George's Church, New York City, was speaking in his Sunday school one Sunday afternoon. He had told the children that in all of us there is an animal nature, and he had run this familiar idea out in forms which appealed to the childish imagination. 'The liar' he said, 'is a serpent, that creeps in secret and sinuous ways to strike with his fangs and poison with his virus. The frivolous boy is a monkey, giving himself up to antics and grimaces. The vain child is a peacock spreading himself to be admired by others. The angry child is a tiger, passionate and untamed.' Then he gave out a hymn. The children did not make ready promptly, and began to sing it in confusion and disorder. Instantly his face flushed. He rapped sharply on the desk with his book, and gave vent to some exclamation of impatience. A little girl in the rear of the room, standing on the seat, who had been swept away into forgetfulness of self by the vehemence of the preacher's eloquence, pointed her finger at him, and called out in a childish voice, hut loud enough to be heard all over the room, 'Tiger!' Instantly a hush fell upon the room. Dr. Tyng laid down his book, walked down the aisle, took the little girl, shrinking and frightened, in his arms, quieted her fears with his benign smile, walked back to the platform, and, caressing her, said to the children, 'Yes, she has told the truth. My enemy all my life has been the tiger in me. I have hard battle to keep him caged. Every now and then he breaks loose in spite of me; and it is because I have had such a hard battle that I want you children to tame the tiger that is in you while you are young.' ISTo child that was present will ever forget the lesson of that incident, and no man of less consecrated spirit could possibly have made this childish rebuke such a means of ministry.
