REMINISCENCES OF LIFE AMONG THE SHAKERS. The following poem was suggested by the writer's being shut into the closet which served for a hiding-place for Mother Ann. Many visitors to Shirley from the other Societies have sought the opportunity thus to realize the trials of that day, and many is the memento of a splinter of wood taken from the rough boards which form the interior of this lonely apartment�not with superstitious reverence, but as loving memorials of the sufferings of Mother and the Elders. The dimensions of the closet admit only of a sitting posture. It was secured from observation by a bureau standing before it. In a manuscript collection of items from the experience of the primitive Shakers I find the following taken from the lips of Jemima Blanchard, i most devoted disciple of Mother. 'At the time the mob, that whipped Father James, was at Shirley, Mother sent for some of the Harvard people to come to her. I went in company with several others on foot, (a distance of about six miles.) Soon after we started we were joined by some Brethreu on horseback from N. EL, who were going to see Mother. While on our way we were met by a messenger from M' ther, who said that none must go but those who were willing to give up their lives. The men turned off another way, but the company I was in went fearlessly on feeling that it would be a privilege to give up our lives for Mother. We found the house densely surrounded by a mob, but we passed straight through it, the mob giving way, it seemed involuntarily. We found Mother cheerful and undismayed. Soon after the mob departed with the Elders, Mother said, w I feel that there will be blood shed,' and having given us some bread and cheese, which we ate in great haste, she said, �Now run home.' We started on the run and ran most of the way without feeling in the least fatigued. When near home we were hailed by some young women, (not Shakers) who were weeping. They said 'We are afraid they have killed your Elders.' The relief was inexpressible on learning that it was not so ; but our hearts were still filled with grief for the iuhuman abuse of Father James.'
