Dear Brothers and Sisters... New Zealand, Apr. 16, 1893. Dear Brothers and Sisters :ï¿½ Your literature containing the most advanced views, came duly, addressed to the Order of the Temple, and was read before the Order with great pleasure and profit. We clasp your hands with loving appreciation, and thank God that you too, know that all so-called love, based upon sex, is animal attraction, and can never be anything else, no matter how refined it may become in its methods. You are so much older than we, that we ought to be able to learn a great dt al from you. Have you any printed particulars, or rules, containing the statement of your co-operative efforts ? How does any one join you? If they already have worldly possessions, do they carry such into your Society? Can one retire from- you if he should undergo a change of mind ? I do wish you would kindly take the time to give particulars. We have an enormous work founded here, and there are some THE MANIFESTO. 233 thirty or forty families who live the new life. By that I mean lives of chastity and continence. There are many more almost ready to take the step. Our Sunday evening audiences are sixteen hundred people, and we have a large school and Sunday School and many other things. Of course the Order of the Temple is the heart of our work, and its members are wholly consecrated to service. None of them retain money nor any other property. We have felt great pleasure in receiving the Flaming Sword and other leaflets from Koresh. We judge they are doing a grand work. I am writing by this mail to Sister Victoria, of their number. I have gleaned from their paper that she is the head of their Unity. Is it not glorious to note how the thought of the higher spiritual life on earth, is taking possession of the wise ones of the world. This New Zealand is a wonderful country, and the people are a God-fearing one. We hope to transform them into a God-loving one. It is a grand place to make the foundation of a work. We have every advantage and opportunity here, for a great co-operative work, and our minds are full of the study of methods. So I know you will give us whatever hints you are able. For are we not a part of yourselves? [Yea, you are.] Shall I ask you to pardon intrusion ? No, you will I know, feel it as we do, a privilege to point the way7 to others. We send you warm loving greetings. Sister Magdala.
