Some of the Doctrines and Practices of a Professedly Religious People. Lebanon, Warren Co., ( hio, June 1889. Strange indeed are the facts arrived at by the study of the tenets held by the several religious denominations of our land. We find the great stream of humanity emanating from the oame great Creator, governed by the same moral laws, looking back to the same examples and precedents, endowed with intellectual power by the same giver of all wisdom and knowledge, yet arriving at conclusions from their contemplation of these, which separate them so widely in some cases that the observer can scarcely trace the likeness which we naturally expect to find existing among the followers of one king, be he spiritual or temporal. There is not, perhaps, a reader of the Republican-Gazette, who has not heard of that queer sect of people, commonly known as the Shakers, but called by themselves Christian Communists. There is located in this county the largest existing community, and after a large number of visits to their village, and a somewhat close observation of their customs, the writer thought that a description dealing with their every-day life and occupation, as well as a general description of their creed, might not be without interest to your readers. They originated in England about the year 1770. They were at first an offshoot of the Friends, or Quakers ; but in their theological ideas, as well as in their practice of celibate life and in community of goods, they now differ entirely from the Friends. In 1747 some members of the Society of Friends near Manchester, Eugland, formed a distinct association, of which James and Jane Wardiey were the leaders. Of this society the parents of Ann Lee were members, and iu 1758 she became one of its adherents. For several years this little company were only remarkable for greater physical manifestations of their spiritual illumination and inspiration than most of the assemblies of Quakers, such as dancing, shouting, trembling, etc., from which their present name, Shakers. These manifestations excited the hostility of the populace, just as did the actions of early Methodists, only to a greater degree ; they were charged with violating the Sabbath, and many of the members fined and imprisoned. In 1770 Ann Lee professed to have received by special manifestation of divine light and inspiration, those revelations, in virtue of which her followers have ever since given her the name of Mother Ann, and have regarded her as a person inspired by the Christ of the female order, as Jesus was inspired by the Christ of the male order. Christ is applied by them as a generic term to the highest or innermost sphere, exterior to the deific sphere, called in the Scriptures eternity�'the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity.' In 1774, under authority of a professed revelation to Mother Ann, ten of the more prominent members of the society, including Ann Lee, emigrated to America, and eight of them subsequently settled near Albany, N. Y., where they increased to quite a number. In 1805 missionaries visited Ohio and Kentucky, and founded four societies in Ohio�Union Village, Watervliet, White Water and North Union ; and two in Kentucky: Pleasant Hill and South Union ; a number of societies have since been organized in different States, some now being in a prosperous condition, others having gone down entirely and ceased operation. Now I wish more particularly to describe the community which it was my pleasure to visit. Union Village, Warren county, is located four miles east of Lebanon in one of the best farming regions of the State. The Shakers at this place own five thousand acres of slightly rolling land, any part of which would make 'glad the heart' of a Pennsylvania hill-side farmer. Driving out the broad macadamized road from the beautiful town of Lebanon, the visitor first arrives at the office building, a good substantial wood structure of considerable size. Just beyond this on the same side of the road is the largest family building of the community, a building capable of accommodating near three hundred people. This house is divided through the middle by wide halls, and was erected for one family, the male members occupying one end of it and the females the other. The property is owned by the community, a certain portion being set apart for each family, the number of acres being in proportion to the size of the family. From this land, set apart for their use, each family must make enough to meet all their necessary expenses, laying by as a reserve fund all received above this. In this way they have grown very wealthy. Each family house, as the one spoken of above, contains a chapel for family worship and a council, and consulting room for the use of the elders, of whom there are four in each family, two men and two women. Besides these family elders they have a ministry composed of two brethren and two sisters, who have the oversight of from one to two societies. In this ministry is vested all power of admission aud dismissal of members. The temporalities of phi Ii family are cared for by two deaeoms-es. There are three classes of members : 1. The novitiates, who, receiving the doctrines of the Shakers, still prefer to reside with their families and manage their own temporal concerns for a time. 2. The juuior class, members of the community, but who have not relinquished their property to the society. 3. The senior class, who voluntarily aud deliberately consecrate themselves ,tnd ;ill their property to the society, never to be reclaimed by them or their legal heirs. All who retain their connection with the community are amply provided for in health, sickness and old age. Li Union Village, besides the agricultural industries which must necessarily follow the owning of so much landed property, we found an extensive broom manufactory, and a large medical laboratory, in which was prepared their remedies, which are quite extensively advertised throughout the United States. Perhaps the most interesting character in this village is Elder Charles Clapp, formerly a successful merchant of Akron, Ohio, in the early days of that city, who some forty years ago came here, leaving his home and his fortune to his family, to become a despised Shaker. Too much could not be said in praise of this man's life. He is noted for kindness, and in fact all the virtues which go to make up the ideal Christian. In the fact that he visits his family (sons and daughters) quite frequently we have proof that conscientious motives led, and not family troubles drove, him from a happy home to this seemingly foolish life. Charles Clapp, and many others of this community, have attained very old age, he with a great many others being between 80 and 90, while quite a number have nearly reached the century mark. The village lias a school house in which the children they adopt are given good advantages for a common school education. Also a meeting house or hall. In the services there is usually an address by one of the Elders, after which they sing a hymn, then they form in a circle around a band of singers, to whose music they 'go forth to the dance of them that made merry.' The funerals, one of which I attended, are conducted in nearly the same manner, little reference being made to the dead ; all that is said pertaining to the living. The Shakers hold that the revelation of God is progressive ; that in the first or antediluvian period of human history, God was known only as a Great Spirit; that in the second, or Jewish period, he was revealed as the Jehovah, he, she, or dual being, male and female, the ''I am that I am ;' that Jesus, in the third cycle, made God known as Father ; and that in the last cycle, commencing with 1770, 'God is revealed in the character of Mother, an eternal Mother, the bearing Spirit of all the creation of God.' This is in substance the doctrine and mode of life of these almost unnatural beings as I found them. Yet notwithstanding all this, I think of the Shaker of this village it might be said: 'No man ever entered his town hungry and he gave him no meat�naked and he clothed him not.' Many poor, helpless women have entered the village with their famished and naked children, where they have been cherished, fed and clothed, and the children educated and raised. It is worthy of note that they are the only people on this continent, if not in the world, who have maintained successfully for a century a system of living, one of the fundamental principles of which is a community of property. In 1888 they had 18 churches, 68 ministers and 2400 members throughout the United States. A. L. S. Clarion Republican- Gazette.
