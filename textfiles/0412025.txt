BEAUTIFUL ANGEL HOME 1. O, my beautiful angel home! Fraught with blessing and peace, Where no sorrow of earth can come, Where inharmonies cease; 2. Storm and tempest may wildly reign, Clouds as dark as the night, Gather over the golden plain, Shutting thy glory from sight. Bas'd and built on the rock of truth, Rear'd by an Almighty arm, Shall not hands of a holy pow'r, Chase and scatter the mist, Heav'nly vigils protect thy youth, From all danger and harm. That the light of a brighter hour, With thee may ever exist? O, my beautiful angel home! Fraught with blessing and peace, Bright immortals around thee come, Crowning with joy thy increase. Thus the oare of a father kind, And a mother's pure love, Bid thee prosper and union find To fair Zion above ; Storm, and tempest and cloud defied, God thy life and support, Hosts of heaven upon thy side, Light to the nations thou art. Chorus : O, my beautiful, etc. Bound to hearts that are willing here, Toil and labor are mine, Till my spirit and life appear In thy glory to shine; Till thy truth like a flood shall roll, O'er a sin-darkened earth, Drawing hither the burdened soul, Weary of spiritual dearth. Chorus : O, my beautiful, etc.
