'Blessed are the Pure in Heart,' HARRIET A. JOHNS. We often read, From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, and As the heart is, so are we. It is the fountain from whence springs our thoughts, words and actions ; and as in nature a stream cannot rise higher than the fountain from which it is supplied ; so the streams of love and affection, welling up and dictating our actions, are governed and guided by the impulses of the heart; if they be earthward, as is too often the case, they lead us from God, and we become blinded to his goodness. Through purity of life, we approach nearest to God, and are better able to understand the Divine nature of that Being, who is the embodiment of all righteousness. We may possess many virtues, and pass for Christian men and women ; yet as long as envy, hatred, pride, hard and unkind thoughts, find admission, we are not strictly pure, saying nothing of the grosser elements that so often control human beings. Christ likened the impure heart to a cage of unclean birds. God requires us to give our hearts to Him; and would they not be very unacceptable in this condition ? As man was made in the image and likeness of God he is, or should be, his representative on the earth. This likeness is manifested by the development of his attributes in the heart. When we strive to become pure, God draws near. If prepared, we see Him to-day and eternity will perfect us in the knowledge of the Divine. ' The seven attributes, constituting the nature and essence of God, ' revealed to mankind, from which all others proceed, are: Truth, Wisdom, Mercy, Justice, Holiness, Love and Righteousness. Exercising ourselves in these according to our best understanding, we are able to receive additional knowledge, aur sight becomes clear, and we comprehend more and more the spirit of God. But the work of first purifying the heart must be done'; for unto the pure only is the promise given ; ' They shall see God. ' Canterbury, N. H.
