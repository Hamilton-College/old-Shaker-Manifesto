Sabbathday Lake, Me. Oct. 1891. On looking over the 'Notes'1 of last month's issue of the Manifesto, we are reminded that the time is at hand for more and wonder what we can say that will be of interest to its many readers. We have heard that 'there is nothing new under the sun.' This of course does not include a bit of news now and then. The last flat roof in our village has been removed and a more modern one taken its place. Our ox-barn has been undergoing repairs and is now almost an entire new building. It has been quite an expensive job. Now all our barns are in good repair. We wish we could say that about our other buildings. The ensilage corn which was cut and put into the silo last week grew to a great height, some of the stalks measuring fourteen ft. and eight in. A goodly harvest of squashes has rewarded the Brethren for their labor. About five tons and of splendid quality, the genuine Hubbard, and we are saving the seed for market. We have also an abundance of pumpkins, have cut and dried over one hundred good-sized ones, beside having a plenty for present use. Thus for many days to come we shall have the much prized pumpkin pie, while our Sister Society is enjoying the appetizing cranbei'ry sauce. And we can say with our good New England poet:ï¿½ 'What moistens the lips and what brightens the eye, What calls back the past like the rich pumpkin pie?'&gt; Our aged brothers, Samuel Kendrick, Thomas Noyes, Paul Nowell and Pliny Worcester are bright examples of industry and patience. During the long days through the heat of summer, we have seen these good fathers busily at work on the wood. They have split and wheeled into the wood houses about 200 cords. Brs. Pliny and Paul have also husked and strung on wires all the sweet seed corn for market. Br. Pliny has also driven the team to Poland Springs twice each week all through the season. We love and cherish these dear aged ones, for the time will come when they will not be with us. Now we want to tell you how veiy near our good Sister Aurelia came to losing her life yesterday. She was walking through the dwelling house with company and stepped backward from the head of a flight of stairs without thinking she was so near. She fell the whole length and came to the landing below. Nothing short of a miracle could have saved her. We are filled with thankfulness at every thought that her life is spared, and are glad to tell you she was unhurt and laughed at the frightened faces she saw around her. A. S. C.
