We all believe in the power of good deeds... We all believe in the power of good deeds, and the fragrance of kindly offices rendered to the poor and lowly of earth. The only monument erected to the memory of a woman in America is the one erected in a 'Public Square' in New Orleans to ' Mother Margaret. ' Some one inquired of a street Arab as to 'who is that?' He replied 'why, that's Mother Margaret.' ' Margaret whom?' the stranger questioned. 'Dunno, sir, Mother Margaret, that is all I know. Everybody in New Orleans knows Mother Margaret.' 'What did Mother Margaret do? that the city should give her a monument?' 'Well, sir, folks say she was the kindest woman that ever lived. She kept a bakershop, 'Mother Margaret' did, and she was always kind to the poor, and especially to orphan children, and she left them all her money when she died, and so I suppose that's the reason the rich people built her this monument.' The Knight.
