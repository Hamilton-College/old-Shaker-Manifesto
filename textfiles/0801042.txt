FARM and GARDEN Improved Bloom Powdered charcoal strewed thickly at the base of plants in blooni; will increase the richness of the flowers to no inconsiderable extent. Lice on Plants The fumes of tobacco is the best curative of lice and other insects on house-plants. Set a little smoking tobacco on fire under the plants, and let the fumes be directed thence to all parts of the plant. Curculio We tested the plan of strewing tomato vines under plum trees, as a preventive of the curculio; and on a tree that we have invariably lost all, or nearly every plum, we had a nice quantity of most beautiful fruit. We shall practice the simple provision. Melons A dry, warm season has proved the very best to develop melons, in size and flavor. We wish to render praise, in especial manner to the variety of muskmelon known as 'Sill's Hybrid,' as foremost in the estimation of all who tested it hereabouts.
