Pleasant Hill, Ky. Beloved Elder Henry:�Since last addressing you, we have been sorely tried on every hand with that unwelcome visitor La Grippe. We had quite a number of severe cases. The weather has been cold and rainy with occasional slight snow falls. On the morning of the 6th inst. an inch snow fall greeted us, which quickly vanished in the bright morning sun. Reports were that most of the fruit was killed, but we learn from good authority that it is not. How thankful we should feel, for fruit is one of our great resources of livelihood. The Kentucky river is quite high; a steamboat passed Shaker landing on its way up the river, a few days ago, with a calliope on it. A company of young Sisters went down to see and to hear, but it had not returned. But they were rewarded with a glorious view of towering cliffs decked in their spring-tide robes of beautiful fragrant bloom. Thoughtful hearts and loving hands brought the pretty wildflowers and brightened the rooms of those less fortunate. It is 'whispered in the air' that great improvements are under consideration here. We hope soon, to give a more definite account. May success and prosperity attend all indefatigable workers. The farmers are thankful to see a few sunshiny days at last. M. J. Our season is very backward, as March and April have both been wintry and the frequent rains have prevented the farmers from plowing. It now gives promise of warmer weather. We are trying to do our best, although the laborers are few who are at work in the Lord's vineyard. We have resolved to be faithful and keep the gospel lights brightly burning, that others may be welcomed to our gospel home. We shall pray that God's will may be done. Your Brother, J. W. S.
