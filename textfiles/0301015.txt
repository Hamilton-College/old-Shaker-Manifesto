WASTE BASKET 'Write and educate yourself and others. No wellmeant effort in mental discipline is lost; it is even as in spiritual things, ' where no labor in the Lord is ever in vain.' Words are mediums through which to convey ideas ; the knowledge and use of them is often termed education. But what if a person should know how to speak and write with all the tongues of men and angels, and yet lack ideas, would they not be learnedly ignorant? as when possessing the gift of tongues, of healing, of knowledge, and all spiritual gifts, yet lacking the gift of charity, or love, they are nothing when judged by the standard of true Gospel travel of soul. Write, therefore, for the Shaker and Shakeress. The contents of the 'Waste Basket' will rise up and claim its due share of honor in its support. At any race of half a dozen men or horses, do each one win the prize ? or can only one win at a given time? Write, therefore, and keep the Waste Basket full, and The Shaker well supplied with good matter. ' What is the chaff to the wheat?' saiththe Lord. Why, without the chaff there could be no wheat; it is as necessary as a Waste Basket. Therefore write, meditate ; and re-write on one side of the sheet only ; after preparing as best you can, and it having passed the ordeal of the society's local editor, send it neatly folded, ready for the Waste Basket, for we must have plenty of matter for our Shaker and Shakeress, as we could not make even a world out of nothing.
