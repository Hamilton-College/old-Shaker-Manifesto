Those Beautiful Church Bells. It is both a gratification and pleasure to note the great and general satisfaction which the McShane Church Bells give wherever sent. Following is a letter published by pel-mission of the firm, and it speaks for itself; after stating that he was glad that his Bill was settled, he says, 'Sow, I have another Bill to square and settle; 1 mean the Bill of honor with respect to your Bell. It is for me a duty, both of justice and courtesy to acknowledge, as highly as possible, that you have fully and entirely settled your obligation towards me. Your Bell, is very nice, very strong, and very sonorous, giving general and entire satisfaction. its way to the church from the Kailroad Station (some ten miles,) was a triumphal one. The people, as it passed along, being roused by i:s mighty voice. The day it was fixed up in its steeple was a feast day, the whole parish was gathered all around to see and to hear, and the satisfaction goes but increasing. Now, this Bell is spoken of to its praise in every part of this country. I am sure that no other company could do better than you did. I shall not fail to praise and commend your Bells at every opportunity, and the next time I want a Bell,, I shall not fail to apply to you again.' There is a good, and true ring in this letter, and demonstrates that the Henry McShane &amp; Co., Bell Foundry, Baltimore, Md., can supply the world with superior and perfectly satisfactory Bells, possessing, as they do, the most complete facilities for furnishing the most satisfactory and superior Bells in every respect.
