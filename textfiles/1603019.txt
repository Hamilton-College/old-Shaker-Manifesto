SUNLIGHT. MARTHA J. ANDEBSON. Do not shun the sunlight, it is the elixir of life. Too many people, like cellar grown plants, lack vitality and strength, and lose the bloom of health, because they do not have sunshine enough to generate nerve force, and keep the blood in proper circulation. It is caloric that creates steam, and keeps the machinery of the human system in motion. Light, heat and electricity, are the sun's- potent forces, powerful for good, when rightly applied, for the production of energy throughout the vast arcana of nature. The food that builds up and sustains our physical structure is brought to perfection under these very elements ; and by their action the atmosphere we breathe is purified, changed and kept in motion. And as the universe is dependent on the sun for all its life and beauty ; so are mankind equally indebted to the same source for bodily development and perfection. Then all ye who are suffering from the ills that humanity are heirs to ; shake off the shackles of indifference, and deem it your duty and privilege to bow before the rising sun, in recognition of his benign influence ; to admit its cheerful rays in chamber, shop and sitting room ; let no habitable place be deprived of its magnetic charm, while its glorious light rounds out the precious hours of day. And never forget, when it has ran its course, and the last lingering rays paint earth and sky with beauty, to thank the good Father and Mother for this greatest of earthly blessings. Mt. Lebanon, N.
