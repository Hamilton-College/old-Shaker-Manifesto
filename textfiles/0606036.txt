VALUE OF DEVELOPMENT JOHN STUART MILL A government or community cannot have too much of that kind of activity which does not impede, but aids and stimulates, individual exertion and development. The mischief begins when, instead of calling forth the activities and powers, and enlisting the interest of individuals and bodies, it substitutes its own activity for theirs ; when, instead of informing, advising, and upon occasion, admonishing, it makes them work in fetters, or bids them stand still and does their work instead of them. The worth of any organized body, in a long run, is the worth of the individuals composing it; and a state that infringes, abridges, or postpones the interests of their' mental expansion and elevation, by a little more of administrative skill, or that semblance of it which practice gives in the details of business ; a state which dwarfs its men in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes, will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished ; and that the perfection of machinery to which it has sacrificed every thing, will in the end avail it nothing, for want of that vital power which, in order that the machine might work more smoothly, it has preferred to banish. We were very sorry tq learn of the demise of Dr. W. W. Hall, of Rail's Journal of Health. Aged only 52. He was a most voluminous and sensible writer. Died in a fit in the streets of New York, May 10th.
