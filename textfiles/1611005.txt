TESTIMONY OF ANNE MATHEWSON. My father's name was Philip Mathcwson; I was born in Providence, Rhode Island, June 24th, 1763. In my childhood I was instructed by my parents in the principles of morality and religion. In my youthful days I became greatly, exercised in my mind about religion. My earnest desire was to find some way of deliverance from sin�some religion which I could depend on for salvation. In the former part of the year 1780, I joined the Baptist church in Ashfield, (as I then lived in that neighborhood,) and continued in communion with it one year. But I could not rest there ; because I could not find that godliness which I had so earnestly desired, nor could I obtain power and victory over sin. I still found myself destitute of Christ, and felt my soul reaching forward to find something that I could rest upon�something that would feel like an enduring substance. When I heard of Mother Ann aud the Elders, from the very nature of the report, I believed them to be the true followers of Christ, and from the operation of the Divine Spirit in my soul I was fully confirmed in it, and felt a great desire to go and see them. In February, 1782, I visited them for the first time, at Harvard, being then eighteen years of age. Mother Ann received me with kindness, and taught me the way of God. I felt full confidence in her testimony, and had a privilege to confess my sins. This 1 did in the sincerity of my soul, as doing it to God, in the presence of his witnesses, and found great releasement of mind by it. I then fell a full assurance of salvation, provided I kept my faith and obedience, which, through the mercy of God, I have never lost to this day. Some time in March following, Mother and the Elders visited Ashfield, and took up their residence at the house of Asa Bacon, not far from my father's, where they tarried about two months. While they were there I was with them most of the time. When they left Ash- Held I returned to my home. The next fall they came to Ashfield again, and tarried till the spring following. I spent most of my time with them. In the fall of 1783, I went to Watervliet, and lived with Mother Ann till her decease in September, 1784. Taking the time all together, I lived in the house with Her about a year and a half. Part of the time I lodged in the same room with her, and ate at the same table, and was subject aud obedient to her in all things as a child. Indeed 1 felt myself as a child blest with the best of mothers. Yea, I loved and feared her, because I found that the spirit of Christ dwelt in her, and her life was a life of purity. She taught me the way of God, and how to walk in it. She taught me to take up my cross against my own carnal nature and all its propensities, and to forsake every sinful way and follow Christ in righteousness ; and she promised that, in so doing, I should find full power and victory over sin ; which I have found to be true. There have been many false and scandalous reports published and circulated abroad in the world concerning Mother Ann ; but I certainly know for myself, that she was not such a person as her enemies have represented. She was the most temperate woman I ever was acquainted with, and an example of chastity aud godliness to all womankind. She was, in truth, a woman who feared the Lord and faithfully served him. These things I know, for I was with her at all times and seasons, in public and in private, by day and by night, in her sorrows and sufferings, as well as in her joy and comfort. The conduct and conversation of Mother Ann and the Elders, was at all times according to the gospel. I have enjoyed many precious privileges with them, and have received much heavenly instruction and much good and wholesome counsel from them, both in public aud private. They were faithful in their duty, at all times, ' both in season and out of season. ' In teaching, admonishing, reproving, encouraging and comforting, they spared no pains. Mother Ann, especially, was always alive in the work of God. Her spirit seemed wholly devoted to God, and in reproving sin she was like a flaming sword ; yet she knew well how to separate between the precious aud the vile. She would not indulge any evil propensity in herself nor in others ; yet her charity to souls disposed to repent and turn to God, would often seem to melt her soul in tears. I cannot feel the least doubt or scruple of her being a chosen woman anointed of the Lord, any more than I can doubt her existence. These things I can testify ; because I have seen and heard aud felt them, and know them to be true. And I feel myself in duty bound to maintain the cause of justice and truth, and to stand as a witness against injustice and falsehood. Mother Ann's spirit and testimony was a swift witness against all sin ; and this is the very reason why such a flood is cast out of the mouth of the dragon against her, to try, if possible, ' to destroy the remnant of her seed ;' but ''the earth will swallow up the flood.' Balaam may come from the east aud try to curse ; but the Lord will bless. The present generation of people boast much of living in an enlightened age, and of being blessed with the bright effusions of the gospel of light; and yet how few there are who appear to under- stand even the plain and simple comparisons which Jesus Christ made of the natural things of time and sense ! There are many who do not seem to understand that a tree is known by its fruit ; that a thorn-bush cannot bring forth grapes, nor figs grow on thistles. '0 faithlecs and perverse generation !� How is it that ye do not understand?' Many Bible Societies have been formed, and missionaries have been sent abroad with the professed object of spreading the sacred truths of the gospel of Christ, as recorded in the scriptures ; yet blindness and ignorance are so prevalent at home, that the people ' are like the heath in the desert;' they know not Avhence good cometh. It is indeed lamentable that darkness, depravity and loss have so covered the earth�that such a vast portion of the human race are so involved in blindness that they do not know the day of their visitation. How evident it is that the Jews did not know, though they were called God's chosen people: for if they had known that Christ was the Lord from Heaven, they would not have crucified him. 1 Cor. ii., 8. And did the Gentiles of that day know any better? Or do those of the present day know any better? There are but few, in this day, who will pretend to deny the agency of the first woman in leading mankind into sin. Why then should it be thought incredible that the agency of a woman should necessarily be first in leading the human race out of sin ? Mother Ann's testimony and example, evidently show that she was led by a spirit totally opposite to that which led and influenced the first woman. To the truth of this, all who have heard her testimony and faithfully followed it, can bear'witness ; because they have in reality, been led out of sin ; and they are able to testify that, 'she taught as never woman taught before. ' I was present at the funeral of Mother Ann. Many people from Albany and the neighborhood around us, attended with solemnity. Elder James Whittaker and others of the Believers addressed the Assembly, at her grave, with much feeling. Samuel Fitch said that, ' the deceased had been one that had faithfully served the Lord; that she had been greatly persecuted by the wicked ; that she had l'een more persecuted than any other person in his knowledge ; and the reason was, she had more of God in her than any other person in his knowledge. ' I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ in its first nor second appearance ; for it has been '' the power of God unto salvation' to me ; and for it I feel to give thanks to God always. These things I have testified from my own knowledge and experience, and have written them with my own hand. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
