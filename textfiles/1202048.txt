CLEANLINESS As a rule, every boy and girl, every young man and woman who will, can have clean clothes, a clean body, clean face, hands and feet, clean teeth, and a clean sweet breath. Now, in your own mind, contrast cleanliness with its opposite. If we were only seeking to please the eye, the former is worth all the care necessary to secure it; we go farther than this, however. No one can be careless of his person, and unclean in his habits, without producing or perpetuating like disorder in mind, and in all he does. Our bodies are covered with innumerable pores or holes, so small that the naked eye can not see thejn, and through these there is, or should be, a constant passage of effete dead matter. In warm weather we are made sensible of this fact by the perspiration which stands upon our faces and hands, or saturates our clothes. This effort of the system to cleanse itself inside is constant, whether we know it or not. Suppose now that you neglect to keep your body clean outside ; these little holes are stopped, the dead matter which should come out is kept in, the blood becomes impure, the brain wearies or gets lazy, we are lazy all over; then we are slack and careless; we do not like to study or think, even of nice things, and so we are injured all through if we do not keep the surface of the body clean. Of course, while we are at work or play, we get our clothes, face and hands soiled, and sometimes our whole bodies are covered with dust and perspiration; then what a luxury it is to bathe ! It is not bad that we sometimes get dirt on us while doing our duty, but it is bad to be careless and let it remain there.â€”The Guard
