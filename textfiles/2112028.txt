Sabbathday Lake, Me. Nov. 1891. Beloved Eldek Henby:ï¿½What shall we say that will be interesting to our Brethren and Sisters now that 'The melancholy days are come, The saddest of the year, Of wailing winds and naked woods, And meadows brown and sear?' Our fields and meadows are brown and seared for want of the rain which has not yet appeared, and the wells that we have always depended upon have failed, and all the water that we use has to be brought from a distance. One of our old woodhouses has started on its travels out into the world, having been sold to one of the neighbors. It has stood in our village for many years, in neither of the rows of buildings and blocking up the street. It leaves a very pleasant out-look towards the South which improves the beauty of the place. To-day a letter was read in our meeting informing us that our dear Mother Eldress Ann had resigned her place in the Ministry. It is now that we deeply feel what a true friend she has been to us for many years. If it is so that we cannot see her again as we had hoped to do, we know that she has those with her who will do all they can to soothe her sufferings and administer to her every want. Our precious loving Mother the blessing of all Zion rests upon you! We have lately enjoyed a very pleasant visit with beloved Eldress Rosetta Henf drickson and Sister Eva Larkin of Watervliet, N. Y. They brought a great deal of love and gospel ministration which we thankfully received. We close our notes, the last for the year 1891. A. S. C.
