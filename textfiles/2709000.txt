SELF-GOVERNMENT. By Elder Henry C. Blinn. IT was Jesus that complimented a rich publican whom he met on one of his journeys, and made of him a friend and an assistant in his religious work, instead of provoking a controversy and making him an enemy. Jesus evidently had some knowledge of this rich man previous to the visit, and felt quite well assured of a kind and pleasant reception. The singular story of their meeting, the informal manner of introduction and the final closing of the scene, evinces a care in both persons of well-directed self-government. It is a lesson that is well worthy of a Christian mind, and that need not diminish in its application to our daily life. From the earliest history of the race, throughout all the savagery and ignorance that has so plainly markt its passage, and through all the dominant influences that have been exercised by the strong over the weak, there has always been found a growing, manly regard that has lookt upon the government of one's own mind as being much in advance of the most refined slavery. The selfish influences in man, like the same qualities in the beasts of the field will ever struggle for the mastery, as these for ages have been, largely, the ruling power. The march of man, however is upward into better regions of thought, into higher moral and spiritual conditions, which aids in the unifying of the race, more closely, and makes it more dependent as individuals upon each other. Thousands of years ago this excellent lesson was learned and placed on record as follows;�'He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.' SEPTEMBER, Any savage conqueror, with a sufficient following might destroy many human lives and much valuable property, and then pLce himself as a ruler over others, who at once are made slaves to his dominant passions. In many cases the family of man has adopted this extremely seiiish course, a:id made 'Might to be right,' and through this power of usurpation governed accordingly. On the introduction of the Christian religion a better system of procedure was initiated and men and women were urged to change their minds by leading a higher order of life, and by walking in a new and narrow way. Instead of being so anxious to dominate over each other, for selfish interests, they were incited to treat others as they would wish to be treated if placed undt r similar circumstances. At the same time that this Christian faith was made manifest it was found that two classes were now permanently placed before the world. The one to continue its ruling through inordinate selfishness, so far as was possible which was done in multiplied ways as the strong opprest the weak. The other class, under a different ministration was instructed to deal justly, to love mercy and to minister deeds of kindness to all of God's creation. As human nature is quite the same in all ages of the world, and the selfishness of man so like the selfish, dominant nature in all the animal creation, it is sure to assert itself unless ameliorating influences of a strict self-denial are brought into daily practice. A professing Christian who fails to live in the spirit of gentleness and meekness, becomes a sorry specimen of a disciplined order, and the religion which is supposed to be the active exponent of an honest heart, is at best but a faint imitation of the Christ spirit. One of the Apostles in his illustration of religion, said it was to miuister to the needs of the afflicted, and so to live as to keep unspotted from the world. And if a man thought himself to be religious and did not bridle his tongue, his religious experience was of little or no account. More wounds have evidently been made by unguarded expressions and sharp speeches than were ever made by poinards or daggers. A sacred writer also says, 'the tongue is full of deadly poison,' and this is literally true, when we make reference to an unbridled or undisciplined tongue. An education in ribaldry whether among the rich or poor, young or old becomes a prolific source of uncleanness and makes infectious even the atmosphere around us. History informs us of a class of low, ignorant and selfish persons, whose disreputable language received the name of Billingsgate from the district where these people resided, so that now the coarse, undisciplined, vulgar language of one person to another is known by that name, to the disgrace of the one from whom it proceeds. It is quite unfortunate that any circumstance should ever arise to call forth any expressions otherwise than those that have been well matured under the influence of a good spirit, as such things may be so thoroughly imprest upon the minds of the young, that even in old age it may not become obliterated. The Shakers in the early days of their organization dwelt long and earnestly upon the necessity of kindness of speech. In forming the Societies, their members were taken from the several Christian churches, as good men and good women, zealous for the honor of their religion and for the forms and ceremonies which were demanded. The baptism of the body, however and the fear of losing their place in the resurrection, had all failed to baptize many of them into an element that would wash away the selfishness of the human heart, or cleanse it from that inheritance of the flesh which abounds in the language not congenial to the spirit of the church of Christ. The Shakers believed as was written by the prophet, that God would turn to his people a pure language, as well as clothe them with a pure spirit. They not only talkt about it, but they sang about it. They were emphatic in their declarations of right over wrong and testified that even a Christian faith was of no value only so far as it had an influence for good on the daily life. To make this change of the mind more effectual for good the testimony was clothed with musical harmony, to the decided advantage of every one. And here fellows one of the simple lessons so potent for good. 'With a new tongue I now will speak, My words shall be both mild and meek, A gospel union I will seek With all my dear relation.' Other minds in other walks of life have been imprest in the same manner and have given voice to their anxious hope, through these simple ministrations to cultivate the beautiful spirit of kindness. 'Speak gently, it is better far, To rule by love, than fear, Speak gently�let not harsh words mar The good we might do here.' No better admonition than the above could be placed before those who have accepted the testimony of Jesus the Christ which is the gospel of love, and the members of every Community of Believers should seek to emulate each other in the cultivation and use of a language so pure that it may be publisht to the whole world, to their honor and glory.
