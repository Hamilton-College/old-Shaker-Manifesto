When any person gets a piece or pieces of glass in the foot... When any person gets a piece or pieces of glass in the foot, hand or any part of the flesh, extract it at once by excision; then hold the part in water as warm as can be borne, five or six days, night and day consecutively. This will so far soften all the muscular fibres that they will easily part with every atom of the glass, and all the virus also, leaving the wound perfectly clean and healthy.â€” Union Village, Ohio.
