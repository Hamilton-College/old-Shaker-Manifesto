A THOUGHT. REBECCA A. SHEPARD. As a sweet smelling sayor O may my life be, Ever fragrant with holiness, love, purity, As a well watered vine in the Vineyard of God, Bearing fruit all divine, thro' the power of his word. As a plant in his garden, that's pruned with great care, And as well garnered wheat, fanned from chaff and the As a well-spring of love, giving joy to the soul, [tare, As a beacon of light, where the dark waters roll. Canterbury, N. H.
