It is not the changes of stature, or position, or circumstances, or anything else that can be seen outwardly that makes or unmakes character, hut it is the changes that are made silent and unnoticed in the hidden chambers of mind, where formless and vague lies the material out of which motives are shaped and character is builded. â€” E. A. S.
