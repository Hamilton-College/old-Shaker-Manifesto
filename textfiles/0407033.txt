HOME We have a home from the cold world hid, A spot consecrated to God; And our feet are shod for the blest highway Here we can ban ish the cares of earth, And fancies that lead astray; 'Tis here we strive that the angel death Here waves of love around us roll, And open the beauties of grace; Till their power of good be comes for us Which the ransom'd before have trod. Here the star of Innocence for ever shines; And beams of Charity glow; May never becloud our way. Thus the growth of a life in God is ours, The strength of the Conqueror's light, A heavenly home and place. And thus we're hid from a cold world's gaze, To know of a sinless rest; Here The When the inner thoughts are attuned through faith, To virtue's melodious flow, To virtue's melod'ious flow, joy that futurity's bliss reveals, With immortality bright, With immortality bright, the breath of our being upward wings, To float in the land of the blest, To float in the land of the blest. O home for the soul, Heaven begun below; We'll sing of thy beauty and tell of thy joys, Till all thy glory shall know.
