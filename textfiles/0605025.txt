PARTON'S APOLOGY Mr. Parton'S article on the ' Caricatures of the Reformation ' furnishes a lively illustration of the droll humors of that period, and of the characters of the leading actors in the scene which found its denouement in the establishment of Protestantism. Apropos of a picture representing Calvin at the burning of Servetus, Mr. Parton offers a goodnatured apology for the part taken by the illustrious Genevan divine in that unhappy transaction : The former was not indeed present at the burning, but he caused the arrest of the victim, drew up the charges, furnished part of the testimony that convicted him, consented to and approved his execution. Servetus was a Spanish physician, of blameless life and warm convictions, who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Catholic and Protestant equally abhorred him, and Protestant Geneva seized the opportunity to show the world its attachment to the true faith by burning a man whom Rome was also burning to burn It was a hideous sceneâ€”a virtuous and devoted Unitarian expiring in the flames after enduring the extremest anguish for thirty minutes, and crying, from the depths of his torment, 'Jesus, thou Son of the eternal God, have mercy on me ! ' But it was not Calvin who burned him. It was the century. It was imperfectly developed human nature. Man had not reached the civilization which admits, allows, welcomes, and honors disinterested conviction. It were as unjust to blame Calvin for burning Servetus as it is to hold the Roman Catholic Church of the present day responsible for the Inquisition of three centuries ago. It was Man that was guilty of all those stupid and abominable cruelties. Luther, the man of his period, honestly declared that if he were the Lord God, and saw kings, princes, bishops, and judges so little mindful of his Son, he would 'knock the world to pieces.' If Calvin had not burned Servetus, Servetus might have burned Calvin, and the Pope would have been happy to burn both.
