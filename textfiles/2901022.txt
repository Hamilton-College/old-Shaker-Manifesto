East Canterbury, N. H. Jan. 1899. God bless the survivors of 1898! May they realize a prosperous 'Happy New Year' is the fervent wish which sounds through our ideal 'Alpine horn,' as we seek to communicate with our sister societies east, west, north and south, across the snow-clad Union. Yea, let the message of good cheer reach from New England's hill-tops and vales to the heights and levels of Kentucky. Let it wing its way to New York, thence to far Narcoossee, thus wafting a breeze of comfort to every Christian home between these distant points, and finally reaching out to the 'whole, whole world' to which we ever have a duty. The busy old year is gone—its material harvests are stored—but we have many benefits to recount as we reflect upon the past. Were we to try to number the common blessings of a day even, how futile would be the attempt! The blessing of daily association with a large household of true friends, is not of small value. Plenty of honorable employment always at hand precludes the necessity for soliciting work which yields the 'daily bread.' Toiling at our several tasks by our own pleasant firesides, where are none to 'molest or make afraid,' is certainly an added mercy. Greater than this is the conscious integrity of striving daily to grow in grace by the unselfish performance of duty in its varied aspects, helping the many rather than the few, thus gradually outgrowing the narrowness of innate selfishness. Let New England, therefore, breathe the 'home notes' of musical content, even though the blizzards have come and the summer warblers have flown. We love the birds, the summer breezes, and the flowers, but—listen! A chickadee is singing even while we write his name. Every syllable of his evening hymn is enunciated as clearly as a profest elocutionist could utter them. He seems to say, Chick-a-dee dee-dee-dee, The drifting snows don't trouble me, There's Jots of fun in yonder tree, Chick-a-dee-deedee-dee The bobolink can't rival ine, and so he seems a perfect impersonation of content. Truly, 'A contented mind is a continual feast.' The storm which proved so disastrous around the coast of the Biy State reacht us on the 27th ult., but no loss of life or property is recorded for this vicinity. Asenath C. Stickney
