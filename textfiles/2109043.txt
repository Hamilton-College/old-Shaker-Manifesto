A PLEA FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WHY SHOULD RICH AND POOR CHILDREN BE SEPARATED? WHO ARE THE PHILISTINES? The private school may be more fashionable than the public school; it is certainly superior in nothing else. The typical pupil of the private boarding-school is the philistine child. He has plenty of money and spends it freely on what only harms his better nature; he is shallow and sordid, but he makes great pretences, and is supremely satisfied with his littleness. The typical pupil of the public school is the boy who is not rich and is not very cultivated. His code of honor or of manners is not burdened by conventionalities: he values your son for his manliness and pluck, not at all for the shape of his collator the size of his cravat. He is uncouth: but when on'-e real refinement is brought to him, he admits its charm and is anxious to win some of its richness. Is it not better for your own son, if you be a rich man, that he avoid this lifeless, conventional boy of fashion; and find a playmate in the bright, hearty, it may be rough boy from the middle class or from the home of poverty?ï¿½From a 'Remedy for American Philistinism,' by Charles Lewis Slatteky, in New England Magazine for August.
