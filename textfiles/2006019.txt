AN EVENING REVERIE. Jennie H. Fish. One Sabbath evening after the day's reading and writing had been laid aside and we were quietly prepariug the mind for prayer service ; sweet music floated out on the evening air from an adjoining dwelling. As I listened, I recognized a favorite melody, to the following words : 'I will call home the wandering, And hush their sighing ; To my fold they shall come, And mourn no more.'' We had often sung these wrords, yet to-night they came home with a new meaning. The wanderers, who are they? We had always in mind a dear brother who had been loved, dearer than life, but who had strayed into the far West, and was perhaps without home or friends, and the question had often arisen, Will he ever come home? Again we though; of the many brothers and sisters who had wandered from home and who were dear to other hearts. Is it not our duty to pray, work and sing for all the wanderers? VTe do not know the temptations that may have been placed in their way, when the helping hand was withheld. Certainly we caunot judge another, since 'Every heart knowreth its own bitterness.' We have often read and been affected with the parable given by Jesus of the prodigal Son, and have looked upon him as very wayward and sinful. He finally repented, and, as we like to believe, turned from the error of his way. His father received him with joy. But what of his elder brother, did he accept him with a Christian spirit? Ah, nay, the constant care and protection of his parents, had made him selfish and jealous. He probably attributed his virtue and seeming stability as nsuliiig from his own goodness, taking the merit, belonsing to his parreuts, home to himself, thus feeling ï¿½ebove his younger brother. We do not need to roam into a far country to become wanderers. There are many prodigals at home, who refuse to obey the counsel of friends, ill-treat parents and guardians, and those who have borne extra burden in the heat of the day, that they might find rest. It is very natural for si ch to look out upon their brother or sister, who has wandered from home, as a sinner greater than themselves. Let us not, therefore, judge harshly our fellowmen, lest we finally see that the greatest failure lies at home. Remember the words of our Savior, wLet him that is without fault, cast the first stone.' Canterbury, N. H.
