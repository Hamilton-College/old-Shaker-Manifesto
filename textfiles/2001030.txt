Watervliet, O., Aug. 1889 Beloved Elder Henry :â€”Your kind note of the 12th. came duly to hand. We are very busy at this time. The Brethren and Sisters who are coming to live with us, will be given a hearty welcome to all that we possess. We are one family, heirs to one gospel privilege. This is the greatest blessing that coulJ be offered to poor man in the flesh, and O, how little appreciated. 'Darkness covereth the earth and gross darkness the minds of the people.' There seems to be but very little awakening, in the land, for the true light of God. My prayer, is that God's work may be hastened, and that honest souls may enter the gospel work. Your Brother, Stephen W. Ball
