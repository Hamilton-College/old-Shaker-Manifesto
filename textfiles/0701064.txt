Cui Bono? The answer of a youth who was asked: What are the benefits that you receive by having a home among the Shakers? It is a great blessing to me to be removed from Irreligious or vain companions, through the influence of whom I might have become equally as irreligious, and may be, far worse. At the same time my privilege places me among a cultivated and religious people, who believe in living acceptably to God, through the purity of their lives, and who teach all ethers the same practical religion. In this it gives me the privilege of leading a better life than I otherwise could have done. It teaches me the confession of all sin before God, an act which a certain gifted divine says, cannot but make a person better. It gives me a union which my beloved Brethren and Sisters who have lived this life and who work earnestly to develope the good in those who choose the same way. Finally, it makes me conscientious and teaches me to work from a christian principle. Shaker Village, N. H.
