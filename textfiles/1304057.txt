Peggy Patterson Peggy Patterson, Jan. 13, at Watervliet, Ohio. Age 82 yrs. 5 mo. and 2G days. She received the faith when a mere child, and kept it through her zeal and faithfulness, and did much to build up this branch of our Zion. She was a woman of singularly bright intellect and almost prophetic discernment. She exercised a remarkable self-control and through a long and severe illness her thoughts were centered on the welfare and comfort of others. For many years she officiated as our Eldress in the Society, loved and respected by all who knew her. A. E. Dayle.
