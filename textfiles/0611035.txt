TREATMENT OF AN UNMANAGEABLE HORSE A beautiful and high-spirited horse would never allow a shoe to be put on his feet, or any person to handle his feet. In an attempt to shoe such a horse recently, he resisted all efforts, kicked aside everything but an anvil, and came nearly killing himself against that,and finally was brought back to the stable unshod. This defect was just on tlie eve of consigning him to the plough, where he might work barefoot, when an officer in our service, lately returned from Mexico, took a cord, about the size of a common bed-cord, put it in the mouth of the horse like a bit, and tied it tightly on the animal's head, passing his left ear under the string, not painfully tight, but tight enough to keep the ear down and the cord in its place. This done, he patted the horse gently on the side of the head and commanded him to follow ; and instantly the horse obeyed, perfectly subdued and as gentle and obedient as a well-trained dog, suffering his feet to be lifted with impunity, acting in all respects like an old stager. The gentleman who thus furnished this exceedingly simple means of subduing a very dangerous propensity, intimated that it is practiced in Mexico and South America in the management of wild horses. N.
