Sabbathday Lake, Me. Nov. 1804. As I commence writing, the chirp of a robin is borne to my ears. Poor foolish bird to tarry thus long in this cold region! The first snow fell here the 5th inst; more has since been added and the weather has continued quite cold. To-day the prospects are that it is going to be a little warmer and we may yet have a pleasant season before winter sets in. Lovely bouquets were brought into our rooms from the gardens the day before the snow fell, but we shall get no more from outside until another year. Now we must depend upon our house plants. With us it takes eight months of the year to provide for the other four and we find no time to lay up for ourselves 'treasures upon earth.' Yet at the same time that we are struggling for existence we can be laying up treasures in heaven by a discipline of spirit in every good word and work. Thanksgiving will soon be along which will draw out a chord of good cheer: 'When, the gray-haired New Englamler Sees round his board The old broken links Of affection restored.' Ada 8. Gummings.
