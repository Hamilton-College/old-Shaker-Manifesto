SHAKERISM. Can the universal objection to Shakerisrn, be answered successfully? If true, all should adopt it. In that case the world would be depopulated in a given time. Answer�Shakers are especially called of God to their manner of life. Faith to live it is the gift of God. Jesus said: 'No man cometh to me except the Father draw him,' prepare him. Consequently, the will of God is the motive power. If so, is there any danger of the race becoming extinct, unless it be the will of God that the earth become depopulated, for a season, in the future as it has been in the past? Geologically, the earth was once without form and void, in a gaseous state, as are other globes to-day. And in the theological future, this earth will be burned up. The last trump will sound and the Lord Christ will descend from Heaven, with a shout that will awaken all the countless billions who have lived and died upon this earth. There will be a general resurrection. The saints will be caught up into the air,�the spirit world,�and so will they ever be with the Lord. The human race will be extinct. Astronomically, as the earth was thrown from the Sun in a gaseous condition by centripetal force, so is it cooling, condensing and being drawn back to the fountain by centripetal force or gravitation, to be again melted by its fervent heat and to have its elements used up in the formation of other worlds, to run through the same cycles of existence that we have been and are passing through. Thus it may be seen that the common and apparently formidable objection to Shakerism that it will ' run the race out ' has neither a scientific nor ecclesiastical basis to rest upon in the encyclopedia or the Bible.
