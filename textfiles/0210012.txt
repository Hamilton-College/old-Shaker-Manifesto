The Modern Baptist and Christ The much-abused and neglected Swedenborg stock is rapidly rising in the theological market. A writer in the Golden Age thinks the whole tendency of religious thought, for thirty years, has been in this direction. Now, let it be understood, that Swedenborg was the angel of Spiritualism, the forerunner, or John baptist, of Mother Ann; that he did declare, ' the Lord is preparing at this time, a new learen, of such as look to him in their lives.' liet the good work proceed. The body of Christendom is being found and acknowledged n the labors of Swedenborg; the soul of Ohrisianity will ineyitably appear in the life-labors of those who practice the principles inaugurated by one, An'jt Lee. We call egpecial attention to the leader in March number of The Shaker, Vol. I, upon this subject. #
