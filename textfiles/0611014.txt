A GREAT TRUTH J. HACKER Man is of the earth, earthly. All things earthly are subject to corrosion and rust. Weeping, like acid poured into a rusty machine, softens and loosens the rust, and laughing, like pure water, washes out the rust. Hence, the wise man said there is a time to weep and a time to laugh. Hence, weeping and laughing should be indulged in, in the proper times. Berlin, N. Y., September 4, 1876.
