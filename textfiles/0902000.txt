FIRST MORNING THOUGHT MARY WHITCHER I've waked to duty, waked once more To view the labors of the field, And put my hand, as heretofore, To work for what the earth may yield. Alike, my spirit life must toil For golden grains of love and peace ; Alike, kind Providence will smile, And give my soul a rich increase. Canterbury, N. H.
