Shaker Station, Conn. South Family. April 1894. Farming began in earnest in April. We are putting in some soiling crops for our milch cows. These need a variety of feed, and respond to such care in a pleasant manner. The farmer ought to study the conditions that will bring success to his business. At the present time there is more scientific knowledge applied to farming than ever before, and good harvests show the results. We sowed rye last fall to be cut and fed in the barn as early as possible. Oats and peas are the second dainty dish as soon as pastures begin to fail a little. There is a great deal of albuminoid in peas. Corn fodder, oats and peas, fall feed then barley sowed early in July. May the cows furnish us with plenty of milk. We are sowing twelve acres of oats and peas some for early feed, green, some for hay and some to ripen to be threshed for grain which will save buying nitrogenous feed. The haulms of the peas are equal to good timothy hay if cut with dry corn fodder. We have sowed some early garden seeds, and wait in hopes of a taste of the good things there. We were just getting ready to sow oats when last night a heavy snow storm set in and is still with us. Having had April in March, March comes in under the name of April. This will no doubt retard our farming. The fruit trees are neatly trimmed and now patiently await the spray pump. Spring work of housecleaning is rapidly advancing. The blessing of health is desirable in our little circle just now. Our good Elder is confined to the house with slow fever of the typhoid type accompanied with malaria, in January. We hope he will soon recover and be in usual health again, as the spring days are coming we trust, to renew strength and vigor. Maria Withani. Church Family. April, 1894. 'Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven'ï¿½true possessions that will not wear away; they are abiding and they supply happiness in time and in eternity. Would we lay up lasting treasures? Let us begin now. This is the harvest time. Let us use it to do deeds of goodness, righteousness, purity, truthfulness, which shall bless, not only ourselves, but others. It is well to have faith in God, but He is not going to overcome our inward foes, that is our work. Are we in our duty? Virtue speaks the same pure, refining language to all. The true and virtuous are childlike, angelic, and Christ said, 'Of such is the kingdom of heaven.' Let us exemplify in daily life that which is pure and true. Remove the blot of sin's dark stain, Then truth and virtue will remain. 'The most curious village in the world is situated on Saginaw Bay, an arm of Lake Huron. It is without a name, has a population of about five hundred, and consists of modern huts on wheels to the number of one hundred and fifty, which, when the fishing season arrives, are rolled on the ice in the bay.' 'The largest lighthouse in the world is that near Havre, France.' 'The first cast-iron bridge in the world was erected over the Severn at Coalbrookdale, Eng. in the year 1779.' ******* Great improvement in thorough-bred poultry has been made in the last few years. It is possible to combine all the excellencies in one breed in a moderate degree, so as to have good layers and a fair weight of body. The Plymouth Kocks are an illustration of the best that can be accomplished in this way. Daniel Orcutt.
