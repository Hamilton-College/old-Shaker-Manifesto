THE TWO PLANES Two planes there are for mortal manOne level with the earth ; The second is the Gospel plan, Which leads to the new birth. We see and choose with open eyes, If but the first we ask ; Our joy is here, the earth we prize, And in her pleasures bask. But if the light of higher life Should break upon the mind, And this we love, how vain the strife For peace on earth to find. We 're like the bird that's fledged for flight, Mount up we must and will; For, how can we, with wing and might, Remain as nestlings still ? Nay ! God ordain'd that we should soar Till truth shall all control, And we with praise forevermore, Find life that's for the soul. We shed the earthly ' man of sin,' Put on the new and pure, And with the angels here begin That life which will endure. And then, by virtue of the cross, In God we live and move, Redeem'd, arisen from our loss, Our life and home is love. Mary Whitcher, Canterbury
