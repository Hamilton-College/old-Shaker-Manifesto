Buying a HORSE .â€”If any one should consult me relative to the purchase of a horse, I would advise him to look well to his eyes, then see if he has sound limbs, and good feet (not flat), and whether he cleans his manger. If these requisites are found, he will be a horse of great endurance, whatever his shape may be. With respect to color, the adage of a Dutch woman was that ' a good horse never had a bad color.
