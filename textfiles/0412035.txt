Liberty of propagandism has almost always been greatly restricted in France 'The liberty of propagandism has almost always been greatly restricted in France —narrowly limi- ted by drilling and excessive regulations. In our unfortunate country it is not as in free America; it is difficult to stir without authorized permission. Without Government authority a lecture cannot be given, a place of worship opened, a meeting held, or tracts distributed. Added to this, the Catholic priesthood is very powerful —more so, alas! at the present time than ever, exercising particularly in small towns and country places, considerable influence upon those in authority. It succeeds in fettering us in a thousand ways. It does all it can to discredit us in the eyes of the nation, attacking us violently from its pulpits, and not hesitating to employ against us the grossest calumnies. Most young Frenchmen are brought up in a holy horror of Protestantism, and traces of this early impression are even found clinging to the minds of men of independent thought —nay, of those whose boast it is that they are free- thinkers.'
