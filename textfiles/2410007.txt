RANSOMED. 'He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, to set at liberty them that are bruised.'Luke iv., 18. Canterbury, N. H. 1894. Turn the feet of those who wander, into paths of peace to move, Bless the hearts of those who falter, with the impress of thy love. Bring to Zion all her children, wayward, sinsick, wand'ring, poor, Now, 0 Lord, for their salvation, let the fount of love run o'er, Let the fount of love run o'er.
