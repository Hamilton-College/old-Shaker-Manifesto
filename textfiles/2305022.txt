NOTES ABOUT HOME Mount Lebanon, N. Y. April, 1893. 'April now appears A child of smiles and tears.' So says the poet, and so we say, when realizing how little we know from hour to hour what weather to expect. Mark Twain in humorously describing New England weather, says he has counted one hundred and thirty-six kinds of weather inside of twenty-four hours. This can be literally true when we consider that all the weather we have is inside of some twenty-four hours; there is no other place to have it. Be that as it may we agree with Mark Twain when he says, that New England can not hold all her weather, it is bulging out on every side, and that is why we, who are so near the border line, are favored with such a variety. On the 4th inst. the mutterings of distant thunder were heard, and the air seemed sultry. On the morning of the 6th we awoke to find one of the most beautiful weather pictures of the year, spread out before us. The ground was covered with snow eight inches deep, which had fallen so lightly, that the most slender twig had its share, without disturbance. When the sun rose the clouds fled, and over all this whiteness, was the brightest blue dome of sky that ever bounded our vision. As we gazed about us with delight, we could easily imagine that we were in fairy land, or were looking at a panoramic picture, so perfectly calm were all the forces of Nature. But this part of the panorama was soon designed to move on, and at noon of the 7th we were wading knee deep in as severe and blinding snow storm as we cared to experience, over paths which an hour before were innocent of even moisture enough to call for rubber overshoes. This, too, soon passed away, and the 8th gave us a succession of electric storms with heavy rain, from 11 a. m. until 3-30 p. m. This is variety enough, we think, to suit even the most changeable, and we can all enjoy the part we like best. But what a commonplace subject for Home Notes. The weatherï¿½which all know so much about. What else can we write of? Spring? Every one knows about that also. Wood is being sawed and split? That part of the programme always comes with the bluebirds and robins. One special blessing is ours. Beautiful flowers in our dwelling house all winter, made a possibility by our steam heat. If steam heat does have its unpleasant feature, we forgive and forget it all, when we realize that no place is too cool for the growth of some plant. The best part of it all is the interest and care given them by some of the elderly people, who intend to live in the beautiful Now, ignoring the custom of frequent comparison between Now and Then. Those who live in Tuen, will never see the advantages of Now. Says the writer, 'We need not be prophets, or apostles. The commonest life may be full of perfection. The duties of home are a discipline for the ministries of heaven. Amelia ,/. Calrer.
