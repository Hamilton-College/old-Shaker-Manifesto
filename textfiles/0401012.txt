A PRAYER O Lord, thou who seest all things, and orderest aright the way of the sincere, enlarge the scope of our understanding, that we may comprehend the truthful import of thy require- ments to us. O God, unlock the prison doors, so strongly barred by our own transgressions perverted habits, and sensual hankerings foi unnatural stimulation. Make us, 0 Lord, to feel satisfied with, and thankful for, thy in struction, plainly showing us how to escape from the present quagmire of disease anc premature deaths, mainly induced by our own transgressions. Distil, O Lord, the bright shining rays of thy truthfulness into our souls, to understand that there is no transgression of thy law, either in mind or body, without its attached penalty according to the greatness of its duration amount, and number. O God, open our hearts to understand that thy primitive natural laws are all truthfulness, reflecting thine own image of beauty, perfection, and health ; and that al the misery and trouble comes from the many soughtout inventions of man, perverting thy natural law, in both his doings, habits, tastes and inclinations, thus unhinging thy whole economy for his true comfort and happiness 0 God, open our eyes to see and obey the truth, and gird us with thy armour of strengtl so sufficiently that we may no longer hanker after the flesh-pots of Egypt, or unnatura' poisons and narcotics, or thirst for stimulants in this our day. And thus, O Lord, shall we be enabled, b] degrees, to travel into the full perfection of thy present requirements â€” freedom from sickness, disease, and premature deaths, satis fied with the real needfuls of life, instead of their fancies. And all the praise, honor, anc glory shall forevermore be thine. Amen.
