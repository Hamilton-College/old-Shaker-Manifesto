TIME. Maria Witham. How swiftly flies the wheel of time, How rapidly it whirls a change of clime, Successive seasons in their course appear, But go, before we hardly know they're here. The summer fled and autumn soon was gone, And rigid winter now comes rushing on, His loud, rude blasts now sweep from shore to shore, And hail us with their wild, unwelcome roar. The warring elements seem all at strife, To banish comfort from the stage of life; A mantle cold enwraps both hill and plain, And one vast scene of desolation reigns. The fleeting seasons in their rapid course. Conviction pour with unremitting force. They seem a mirror in which I trace, How short this life, this sublunary space. Then to the youth I say, learn to be wise; Improve each moment as it passing flies ; To labor now while it is said To-day, The chance to-morrow may have passed away. Enfield, Conn.
