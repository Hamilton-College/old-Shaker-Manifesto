A TRIBUTE TO OUR LOVED SISTER, MARY ANN HILL. Prudie A. Stickney. Before tin- dawn of morning, Had tinned the sky witli gold, An Angel entered softly And claimed one of the fofd One we have loved and cherished, One who was true and tried, Whose life was full of blessing, Whose soul was purified. Our Mother heard the summons, The Angel's voice so sweet; 'Come home, thou'rt worn and weary, Your loving friends you'll greet. Fear not the rolling river, Nor dash of the boatman's oar.' She then embarked with the Angel, And crossed to the other shore. Her mansion was all ready. Her friends were waiting there; And songs of joy and welcome Rolled on the balmy air. She saw the light of the City, And saints in rubes divine, As pressing on to greet them, 'Thy will,' she said, 'not mine.' Thus on through fields elvsian, And streets of purett gold, The pearly gates were open, Into the Shepherd's Fold. The angel choir chanted The anthem 'welcome home, Yea welcome, loved one welcome, In fairer lands to roam.' Thy life of patient labor, Of toil and earnest prayer, In heaven is recorded, By angels' watchful care. Each deed, each loving token Some needy soul relieved; While words of truth were spoken The erring heart believed. We'll miss our Angel Mother, Her words of love and cheer, Her gentle, tender accents, Were sweet to every ear But if the chair is vacant, The hands are still and cold, Her spirit will be near us, With blessings as of old. Yet for a season only, The time will not be long, When we shall meet in heaven, And join the angel throng. Now from all pain and suffering, Her weary form is free, Her faithful labors ended.' Dear one, 'tis well with thee! West Gloucester, Me.
