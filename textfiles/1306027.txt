In the year 1851 I begged Senor Ermeneta, the proprietor of some of the richest mines in Chili, to send some specimens for the great exhibition as samples of Chilian wealth. He forwarded me two large stones, one weighing three hundred and fifty six pounds, and the other three hundred and forty nine pounds and told me that perhaps the strength of the miner who excavated these masses, and brought them from the mine, was as striking as the richness of the specimens themselves. Both stones had been taken from a depth of more than three hundred feet, and had separately been borne on the shoulders of a man, he having to ascend, not by ladders or other aid, but by climbing up the nearly perpendicular slope of the mine. The food the miner lives upon is an interesting subject to physiologists. His chief diet is the haricot bean, and without this nutritious vegetable he could never get through the work required of him. The beans are boiled until they are quite soft, and eaten with bread.
