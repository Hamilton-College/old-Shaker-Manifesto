Shaker Station, Conn. 'Whosoever shall give a cup of water in Christ's name, he shall not lose his reward.' There are many needy travelers on the journey of life who are fainting for the cup of cold water that we might give. It is a little thing to do, and there are none who have not some opportunity of giving it. Are we always ready to do some good deed? The cup of water, the word of sympathy, the many little ways in which we can do good if we have the love of the Master in our hearts, may reach some struggling soul and help him to conquer a sinful life. The word in season, well chosen and fitted in at the right moment, may make an impression never to be effaced, and sinking deeper and deeper, may turn the heart that has received it to walk in the way of eternal life. I only wish to call attention to those little things we consider trifles, but which mean so much to those in trouble, or to 'the stranger within the gates.' Let us be up and doing while our day lasts. There are calls for help in every direction. We have a work to do, and if we do it well and hear the blessing pronounced, 'Well done good and faithful servant,' will not that be sufficient reward for all our suffering? Business in poultry keeping should start small and work up. Get good poultry and learn from observation and experience. Chickens make the best growth on whole wheat with no sloppy food. To make poultry business profitable requires calculation. This is required in any business. Eggs represent cash. Our largest hen's egg for July weighed five ounces. Very acceptable. 3921 spaces of cream were sold in July. D. Orcutt.
