In Memory of our Gospel Father, STANTON BUCKINGHAM. By Orren Beaver. HE passed from earth on the 17th of January, to dwell in realms supernal. To us all he was a much-loved father and friend. He was the oldest Brother in this Society and probably one of the oldest veterans among Believers. He has passed a long life and has spent nearly seventy-four years in our lovely Zion home. Faithful to the last in all things, temporal and spiritual, while health and strength remained. He was truly a pattern of godliness in all his dealings with his Brethren and Sisters. Pure and chaste in his deportment, simple and child-like in his manners. He was indeed, a tower of strength to the ï¿½ young thus evidencing what Mother's gospel can do for all souls who willingly yield obedience to its elevating, soul-saving principles. He often remarked that he thought we had too much of the spirit of the world among us, as a people, to have a fruitful travel in this soul-purifying work. That we needed to retrace our steps to the foundation principles of our faith, before we could expect to have that measure of justification and spiritual prosperity as a body, for which our spirits were so earnestly praying. The religion of our dear father was eminently practical; not a dead, lifeless formalism, but one whose noble aspirations reached to all humanity, for their future happiness. Honest and upright in his dealings as an Elder as well as a Trustee, he ever manifested that inflexible regard for loving-kindness to all, that it deeply enshrined his memory in the affectionate regard of every consecrated Believer. Though we shall greatly miss him in our little home circle where his pure influence ever rested like a sacred benediction, we rejoice that his noble spirit passed quietly from the scenes of time to enter the beautiful mansion 'Over There.'
