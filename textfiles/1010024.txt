SHORT RULES FOR HOME USE The Brethren at Work presents the following: . Put self last. When others are suffering drop a word of sympathy. Tell of your own faults rather than those of others. A place for every thing and every thing in its place. Hide your own little troubles, but watch to help others in theirs. Take hold of the knob and shut every door behind you without slamming it. Never interrupt any conversation, but wait patiently your turn to speak. Look for beauty in every thing, and take a cheerful view of every event. Carefully clean the mud and snow from your boots before entering the house. If from any cause you feel irritable, try the harder to do little pleasant things. * ******* You will not be sorry For being courteous to all ; For doing good to all men; For speaking evil of no one ; For hearing before judging; For thinking before speaking; For holding an angry tongue ; For being kind to the distressed ; For asking pardon for all wrongs ; For being patient toward everybody ; For stopping the ears to a tale-bearer; For disbelieving most of the ill-reports.
