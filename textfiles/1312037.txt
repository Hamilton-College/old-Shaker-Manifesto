Professor Threadwell, of Massachusetts, found that a half-grown American robin in confinement ate in one day sixty eight worms, weighing together one ounce and a half, as much as the bird himself, and another had previously starved upon a daily allowance of eight or ten worms, or about twenty per cent of his own weight. In troublesome bleeding from the nose... In troublesome bleeding from the nose, snuffing up powdered alum will generally control it. It will also almost always stop excessive hemorrhage from a cavity caused by the extraction of a tooth, by being placed in it. It is not wise to go out in the early morning air before eating at least a few mouthfuls.

Smell of Paint. â€”To get rid of this most objectionable odor, slice a few onions and put them in a pail of water in the center of the room; close the doors, leave the window open a little, and in s few hours the disagreeable smell will have almost gone. Another method is to plunge a handful of hay into a pailful of water, and let it stand in the newly-painted room over night.
