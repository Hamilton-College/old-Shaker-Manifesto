Smell of Paint. â€”To get rid of this most objectionable odor, slice a few onions and put them in a pail of water in the center of the room; close the doors, leave the window open a little, and in s few hours the disagreeable smell will have almost gone. Another method is to plunge a handful of hay into a pailful of water, and let it stand in the newly-painted room over night.
