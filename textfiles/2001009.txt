THE NEW YEAR Maria Witham The new year is the awakening of promise, the revealment of the future. May it teach us lessons of endurance, of fortitude, of thankfulness. We would have the new year ledolent with praise, not from the lips only ; from the heart may sincere longings of our spiritual needs be awakened. Willing to lay all upon the shrine and altar of devotion to the cause of Truth. The new year is the period for new beginnings, higher aspirations, and good resolutions, when the brand of the interpreter of human thought is thrown, kindling the fire of examination and self-criticism upon each and every one, and there lay before God an acceptable offering. Now may we plant the seed that is imperishable. The treasures of earth soon pass away; and its glitter will vanish. Every word becomes valuable, if we would make earth the gateway of heaven, and do good to all around us ; we will make the new year bring happiness and peace to our homes and associates.
