MY GUARDIANS Unseen hands are daily sowing Precious seed of love and care; In my soul I feel them growing,— Germs of truth develop there. And I know the source is heaven — Whence these treasures come to me ; Though by impress they be given, Or through mortal agency. Let me hold a claim upon you,— Spirit friends released from time; Deal to me of wisdom, prudence, Strength and love, from purer clime. I, so weak and erring, daily Need a watchful Savior near; Such be thou to guide my footsteps, Keep my spirit free and pure. Teach me lessons true and holy,— Rudiments of higher life; Fit my soul to dwell with angels When I cease the mortal strife. Teach me, while on earth I journey, How to live with saints below; — How to keep my union sacred, And in heavenly graces grow. Elizabeth Martin, Canterbury, N. H.
