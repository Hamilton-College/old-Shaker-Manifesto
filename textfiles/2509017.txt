West Pittsfield, Mass. East Family. Aug. 1895. Beloved Elder Hkney;Will you plense give a few Home Notes from the East Family a little corner in The Manifesto? We that are young, are thinking we would like to see how they will look. We sincerely hope our long silence will not give the impression that we have no home, for indeed, we have a beautiful home, or at least it is so to us. It affords many temporal blessings for which we render grateful thanks to the Giver. Then the opportunity it gives to live a pure and unselfish life is appreciated above all things else. We wonder if among the New Hampshire hills and mountains there are as many atmospheric changes as there are here, among the Berkshire hills? We frequently get a sniff from the four seasons in one week; but in spite of the cold waves, frosty air and scorching heat, the prospect for good crops of all kinds is very encouraging. Our garden enclosing over twenty different kinds of vegetables, never looked better. The hay crop, quite as good as usual, apples and pears good; peaches and plums few and far enough apart not to waste by coming in contact with each other. Our mother Hannah A. Agnew, is spending a short season with us, imparting that courage and strength which only the true and faithful mothers can give the children. Such examples should inspire the young to greater efforts to live a high and noble life, doing good to all, whereeverand whenever an opportunity is given. Celia A. Thorpe.
