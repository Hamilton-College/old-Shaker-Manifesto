THE BOYS WE NEED Here's to the boy who's not afraid To do his share of work; Who never is by toil dismayed, And never tries to shirk. The boy whose heart is brave to meet The lions in the way; Who's not discouraged by defeat, But tries another day. The boy who always means to do The very best he can; Who always keeps the right in view, And aims to be a man. Such boys as these will grow to be The men whose hands will guide The future of our land; and we Shall speak their names with pride. All honor to the boy who is A man at heart, I say; Whose legend on his shield is this : 'Right always wins the day.' E. E. Rexford
