Juvenile CATCHKG Sl'XSHKE My next door neighbor's little girl, A cunning two-year old, Wondered one day why drooped her flowers, And pleaded to be told. Then said her mamma :—'Here-in-doors The sunshine does n't come To warm and bless and gladden them And drive away their gloom. And so they droop, as children do Who get no tender love To cheer them on that upward way Whereon we all must move.' 18 SHAKER MANIFESTO. Next day, when mamma went to seek Her darling at her play, She found her standing in the sun In just the queerest way : For there she held aloft a cup Above her pretty head, 'What are you doing, LuLu dear?' Mamma, astonished, said. And she, her cup still held aloft— Bless her, ye heavenly powers ! 'I'm catching sunshine, mamma dear, To give my 'ittle f'owers.' Type of all children there was she; Who in life's garden stand, Still holding patiently aloft Their life cups in their hand. And so the world is kept alive, And freshened every minute, By the dear grace that overflows The children who are in it. Anon THE BOYS WE NEED Here's to the boy who's not afraid To do his share of work; Who never is by toil dismayed, And never tries to shirk. The boy whose heart is brave to meet The lions in the way; Who's not discouraged by defeat, But tries another day. The boy who always means to do The very best he can; Who always keeps the right in view, And aims to be a man. Such boys as these will grow to be The men whose hands will guide The future of our land; and we Shall speak their names with pride. All honor to the boy who is A man at heart, I say; Whose legend on his shield is this : 'Right always wins the day.' E. E. Rexford
