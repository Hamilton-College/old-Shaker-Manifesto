The Sunday Question A correspondent, from West Pittsfield, Mass., says: 'I have often thought that Sun-day, being a day named after the sun by the worshipers of that planet, should not be recognized by us as the sabbath, etc,' This is the same ground of : objection not long since used by our worthy 1 Elder Evans. Our pcnwoman continnes: 'Sunday being the .fint day of the week, 'while we were strictly commanded to keep the seventh, etc.' We would say to Mary R. 1 Wheeler, that if her first objection, to our present sabbath has any force, it destroys whatever reasoning may be used in defence of ' her second. All the days of the week were named after gods or kings; and there is no more good reason for objecting to Sun-day as a sabbath for religious thought, than there is to Moon-day, Saturn-day or the very licentious signific,;nce of Fr;-day; or the day devoted to the god of thunder-Thurs-day; or the day highest in the estimation of the idolatrous Germans and Scandinavians- Wednes-day; and what better the day named after the god of war, :Mars-Tues-day? Let the union of the spirit be the principal thing concerning the sabbath to be kept, as well as all things else about which there may questions arise. We raise a much more important: I question, so liciting answers thereto: How I can the Sabbath be most profitably observed?
