MUST WE FORSAKE THE GOOD? In the initiative, let us particularly make declaration: We love Jesus, the Christ, so well, that we think no life better than his, and as his love of life was and is, so would our love be expressed in imitating his excellent example. It is commonly admitted that the testimony of Jesus was denunciatory of evil, and that this testimony was peculiarly sustained by his unsinful life. We do not, on this account, render to Jesus any especial credit beyond what we gladly bestow upon many companions of to-day. Ninetynine one-hundredths of the people condemn deeds that bear on their faces the marks and intents of actual sin. Jesus was no exception in this. The world at large are ready to accept and to unite with us in condemnation of the sinful; and we must very occasionally give large and an increase of credit to some who are severer in their terms upon sin itself than we the Shakers are. While we have so much sympathy or testimony against evil, we find the largest, strongest op- 252 THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. position toward taking one step farther —the relinquishment, the entire renunciation as a duty, of any good thing or practice. The great majority are against us in this ; will not hear us, nor harbor the thought for a moment. And yet here is where Jesus became and remains pre-eminent—by the denial unto himself, and unto his followers, of every feature of worldly good, upon which we all so naturally incline to place our affections ! Do not the Shakers admit the good of marriage and reproduction by the children of the world ? And did Jesus ever condemn it there ? And yet, Jesus being 'the Resurrection'—the life raised up above even the good of marriage and reproductions—did he not forsake these worldly-good things for the attainment of the very much better things of the spirit ? Why did Jesus deny himself of being a good husband and father ? deny himself of wife, children, houses, land, and did crucify his very worldly-good life, with all its affections, loves and lusts ? And why did he imperatively enjoin upon his disciples, these same renunciations of worldly-good things—the nearest, dearest and most intensely satisfactory possessions to a worldly mind? Were his instructions of denial to these based upon their wickedness ? Not so, emphatically, Nay ! The gospel of Jesus meant progress; up from, out of and away from even the good and best of worldly relations and practices, to the formation of unworldly, regenerative, angelic followers called Christians. In his day his immediate disciples were implicitly obedient to his instructions ; and they left off the practices of husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, holders of personal possessions, children, houses, lands, etc., and forsaking the good and bad of the carnal, worldly life, accepted the life of Jesus as a most glorious substitute—a tetter and the test life. Among the myriads professing Christianity since the days of Jesus, there have been extensive, retrograde movements. Those very features which Jesus and his little company actually forsook, regardless of their most endearing fascinations to their worldly inclinations, are too commonly made sacraments of by the churches and people professing his name! Belief is now extensively taught that Jesus did not mean 'forsake ' when he said so, when he lived so, and which others who followed him, forsook to live like him ! The profession of Christianity remains abundantly to-day ; but ask a man to hate the wife, yet love the woman as his sister in Christ; ask the woman to hate the husband life of the man and yet love him as her brother in Christ; only ask men and women to forsake the good and bad which Jesus forsook, and which they must forsake to be genuine disciples, and there rises an opposition which vents itself in derision, contempt or in open, violent persecution! Yet here stands the testimony, unmoved as the heavens; here will stand through all eternity the radical truths of Christianity, which to learn, demand the actual relinquishment of worldly good, and the acceptance of new relations by humanity, better and best, and all in the progress of godliness. Let those deride who please; but for us, Jesus the Christ, has lived as a heavenly example. Our following, even imperfect- THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 253 ly, gives us by the world-loving the opprobrious epithet 'fanatical Shakers;' while we, in ' despising such shame ' as coming only from those more unlike Christ than we are, will be happily content to continue in the life of Jesus, in Virgin' Purity, in a United Brotherhood, as Peacemakers, and as nearly Unworldly as was Jesus, as we can. Must we forsake any good thing ? To be like Jesus Christ, to be his followers, we must forsake many good things, as well as all bad ones; and we shall be enabled to count all such forsakings, as decided gains unto a Christian heaven.
