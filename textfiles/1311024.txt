Cleaning Woodwork. â€”An exchange, speaking of the necessity of cleaning woodwork, comments as follows: It often happens that the woodwork on doors, particularly near the handles, will become quite dirty and badly stained by the frequent running back and forth of careless children. In these cases it is sometimes found impossible to remove the marks with cold water, or -without the vise of soap, however undesirable. If this occurs, throw two tablespoonfuls of powdered borax into a pail of hot water, and wash the paint with it. Do not use a brush: but if found impossible to remove the marks in this way, the soap must be resorted to. Rub the soap on the cloth and then sprinkle on the soap dry borax, and rub the spots faithfully, rinsing with plenty of water. By washing woodwork in this way the paint will not be injured, and the borax will keep the kands soft and white. Borax is not half as freely used in domestic labor as it would be if all its usefulness were better known. Its help in increasing the cleansing properties of soap, and at the same time correcting its corrosive tendency, is one most of its valuble properties.
