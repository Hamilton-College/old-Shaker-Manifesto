A. G. Hollister, Brother:--It is with feelings of the deepest sincerity... San Buenaventura, Cal., Jan. 12, 1888. A. G. Hollister. Brother:--It is with feelings of the deepest sincerity that I acknowledge the receipt of your kindly New Year's greeting and expressed good wishes of the fraternity you represent. Words cannot express my appreciation and I can only ask you to accept a soulful return of the same kiud feeling. I verily believe the outflowing of soul reached me before it was transmitted to paper, as about that time 1 received a baptism of blessing from some source such as I have not experienced for a long time. At the time I wondered if it could be the effect of the Soul Communion wave, if so, I felt there could be no denying the power of silent forces. Whether the blessing came of soul communion with this or the angel world, as of those who, while still in the flesh can realize and 'recognize the kinship which is higher and more durable than that of merely flesh and blood,' I return thanks, and the wish that they may be blessed in return. Thanks also for accompanying tracts. I have read them with much interest and can see the beautiful and true in the divine life set forth�a life I should have found it easy to have led had I been surrounded by its influence in youth, and by so doing should have perhaps escaped many troubles and trials by 'he way, for I know my nature never was adapted to the institution of so-called holy marriage, albeit while under the law I tried to make the best of it. 1 have long seen that the present social system is very defective�indeed wholly so. About fifteen years ago, as it were in answer to my earnest prayer for something better for those who should come after me, Communal life was shown me in a vision ; something I had never thought of, but 0 so grand, so beautiful ! It flashed on me like a light from heaven. Either it was a revelation of life in the higher spheres or a prophecy of the yet U be, the New Jerusalem that is to come dowu from heaven. I wait in hope. That which was shown me was life attuned to perfect harmony. I should like to know more of the workings of community life as established by your Order. I can see where celibacy makes it so much more possible to give up all than where anxious care for the future welfare of posterity stands in the way. But this is sure, every day I see more to convince me of the inefficiency of the present system. What assurance is there for protecting care in old age? Of this I have an illustration in my own life experience. For years I have been the sole dependence of an aged and widowed father who, in spite of abundant possessions in the way of property, might have been uncared or and his possessions wasted but for the incident of my own life which made it possible for me to devote myself entirely to his service, though at a great sacrifice to my own best interests in many ways ; the most trying of which is complete isolation ; his mind of late being iu such condition that he cannot endure the presence of strangers, and it is but seldom that I can even have the privilege of my children visiting me. But yet he is not what might be termed insane, and though in his 87th. year, is iu robust physical health and may quite likely last longer than myself. I enter on these particulars that I may introduce a question that often comes up for solution and on which I have pondered much : Filial duty requires that I care for my father. Jesus said ''Let the dead bury their dead, follow thou me.' Now to all intents and purposes of this world my poor father is dead in mind, being deaf and almost listless ; but think you that I could feel justified in deserting him in obedience to a call to other work, even though it might be in the Master's vineyard? No, humanity would forbid. There may be sacrifices to make under any condition of life, but under the present system it is life-long sacrifice with but little compensation in the way of real happiness. I know that communal life is the better way, but a person requires to be '' born again ' to see it, and then it requires great faith in humanity to adopt it. I hope I may sometime have the opportunity of visiting a Shaker Community. I should think it would be 'like a little heaven below,' so many united on a true spiritual plane. Yet the little cherubs must be missed. I always feel that there is something very heavenly in the love of little children, and that there is no mission more holy than caring for them in their helplessness and guiding their youthful minds in the right direction. It has often been a perplexing question with me as to how your system is perpetuated� whether by adoptions from the outside world or in what way ? It has never been my good fortune to live near a community, neither have I had an opportunity for gaining much knowledge in regard to the system, though with what little I have learned I have been very favorably impressed. But as there is a wide gulf between the present stage of humanity and the perfected condition I feel that as yet there must be au intermediary. This subject I am making my life study. Some form of communal life that will fit the present requirement and lead to the more perfect development of the race. I believe 1 am called io this work. As yet with my pen is the only way I can make an effort in the direction, but I often feel that the position I am placed in is for a purpose of education in the utter inefficiency of the present system to guarantee 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness' to mankind. Likewise, we must ever be trampling on laws human or divine, trying to serve two masters�God and mammon. The worst feature of the present system is that it is conducive to selfishness- -compelled by the necessity of self-protection. I will here add that in my vision of communal life the children were a very prominent feature, for it was shown me that motherhood was a holy and divine mission of which no sensual lust should form a part; that the love from whence it sprang should be a divine sacrament, and maternity wholly under woman's control. I believe that as yet, a communal life of degrees, each community according to its plane of development, but the end and aim perfection ; is all we can hope for the world at large. For myself, however, the purely spiritual is all I find pleasure in, and should I be spared to arrange for future years I should most assuredly situate myself where I could have such association. Please allow me to express myself as equally interested in your able spiritual articles in W. A. T. We sometimes have come very near expressing the same ideas. I ask that your Order will remember me in their communings sometimes as one in the spirit of truth with them, and free of all carnal ties. Fraternally, Adelaide Comstock.
