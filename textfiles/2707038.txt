The Outlook The August number of The Outlook will be its annual Educational Number. It will contain several features of special interest to teachers and students. One of these will be an illustrated paper by Professor Todd, of Amherst College, on modern methods of astronomical work, with special reference to the trip made by Professor Todd and his party to Japan for the purpose of observing the last eclipse of the sun. Bodolf Ltinciani, the famous archaeologist, has written for The Outlook a peculiarly interesting.article on Modern Borne, which will be profusely and beautifully illustrated furnisht by the author. Miss Susan E. Blow, perhaps the highest American authority on the Kindergarten, will write on that subject; Professor A. C. Lane writes on Beligion among Men of Science; Bev. E. Boss, on Educational Functions in the Church; and other distinguisht writers will treat various important educational problems. [3.00 a year, The Outlook Company, 13 Astor Place, New York.]
