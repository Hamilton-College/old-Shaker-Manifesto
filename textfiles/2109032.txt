INQUIRY. No. 2 . What is the creed of the Shaker Church ? No creed has ever been formulated for use in the Shaker church. A creed is an instrument of force, an ecclesiastical barrier over which one may not pass without censure, as may be witnessed by the long and acrimonious controversy that is entered into on some of the ecclesiastical trials. Human creeds and confessions of faith have been handed down from generation to generation, and these largely constitute popular Christianity. Three creeds have been written and are more or less effective at the present time; as the Apostles' Creed, 'which is supposed to be as old as the third century, but there is no reason to believe that it was composed or used by the apostles.' 'The next olde'st is the Nicene Creed. It was completed in 381. Next in time comes the Athanasian Creed,' in which the doctrine of the Trinity is the leading feature. Theophilus, bishop of Antioch has the credit of being the first to make use of the word Trinity to express the distinction of this mysterious Godhead. We think that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and a present revelation of God's love to man. 'Know ye not that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates ?' 2 Cor. xiii., 5. No number of creeds can bring this gift of inspiration to the soul. It can be obtained, only, by those who live as Jesus lived. We have no need to fetter the mind with a mass of verbiage over religious mysteries which no one can interpret, so long as light and truth are freely extended to every one that accepts the gospel of Jesus and departs from all iniquity.
