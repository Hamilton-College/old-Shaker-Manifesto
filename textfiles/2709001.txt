SELF-LOVE. By Eldress Anna White. SELF-LOVE leads to great efforts to establish our own righteousness on all occasions. Self-abasement leads to active exertions to detect and prove our unrighteousness and if by reason of faithfulness this can not be done in any matters of importance, then will there be the more diligent inquiry and search to do it in smaller matters. . 'Confess your faults one to another' is a rule that if used every day, would have a most beneficial effect upon the character. 'Turn the battle to the gate' by as free and full a criticism of our words, intents of tue heart and acts as we would use toward others. Blessed is the man or woman who tells us of our faults; should be our motto. This would make even our enemies, as they might think themselves, our valued friends, for whom we can pray, that for the good they have -done us, unintentionally it may have been, in helping us to perfect ourselves that some one will help them to correct their faults. It is thus, that if a man's ways please the Lord he will make even his enemies to be at peace with him. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
