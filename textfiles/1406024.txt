'I SHALL NOT PASS AGAIN THIS WAY.' The bread that bringeth strength I want 1o give, The water pure that bids the thirst}1 live; I want to help the fainting day by day; ' I'm sure I shall not pass again this way. ' I want to give the oil of joy for tears, The faith to conquer crowding doubts and fears; Beauty for ashes may I give alway; ' I'm sure I shall not pass again this way.' I want to give good measure, running o'er, And into angry hearts I want to pour The answer soft that turneth wrath away ; ' I'm sure I shall not pass again this way.' I want to give, e'en as the Master gave, Help to the erring; and I want to have Forgiveness in my own heart from day to day ; ' I'm sure 1 shall not pass again this way. ' I want to give to otheis hope and faith, I want to do all that the Master saith; I want to live aright from day to day; ' I'm sure I shall not pass again this way.' Selected.
