NOTE. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. What a sweeping declaration that was for an apostle to make, ' We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.' 2 John v., 19. Why? Because he abstained from that forbidden 'tree' which in the beginning God commanded, 'not to touch ' until further orders ; and which the whole world is most eager to grasp, consequently is now suffering under its penalties. North Union, Ohio.
