Canterbury, N. H. The return of spring must date with the return of the little birds and the swelling of the buds on the maples. Winter has held the 'right of way,' over the wood to be burned and the garments to be worn till within a few days, when a change of temperature has been announced. Large numbers of robins and bluebirds have returned after a long absence, and seem very much at home. The sugar harvest is over. Two camps have been in operation and some hundreds of gallons of nice maple syrup has been secured. At the camp in our family one Brother and two young men have taken charge of some 300 trees. They kept one yoke of cattle at the camp and when not engaged in the hauling of sap, they were made useful in hauling a supply of wood for another year. This camp has furnished some 190 bbls. of sap and some 98 gallons of syrup and for this pleasant luxury we shall be made happier during the whole year. The Honey Bees are yet imprisoned in the cellar, and as they eat less honey while held in close confinement, it is a point in economy to hold them till the return of spring is made a certainty. Xo honey can be obtained till the last of May, and not even any bread till the catkins are in flower, so that the thousands of active little bees if away from the cellar, must be fed daily or there is danger of their falling into bad habits. In accordance with the time-honored custom of the early fathers, our Society regarded the proclamation of Governor Tuttle of N. H., and enjoyed a very satisfactory meeting. Such seasons of religious communion are always profitable.
