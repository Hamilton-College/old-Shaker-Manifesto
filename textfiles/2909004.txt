FINISH THY WORK. Finish thy work; the time is short; The sun is in the West; The night is coming downtill then Think not of rest. Finish thy work ; then welcome rest; Till then, rest never; The rest prepared for thee by God, Is rest forever. Finish thy work ; then wipe thy brow ; Ungird thee from thy toil; Take breath, and from each weary limb Shake off the soil. Finish thy work; then sit thee down On some celestial hill, And of its strength reviving air Take thou thy fill. Finish thy work ; then go in peace ; Life's battle fought and won. Hear from the throne the Master's voice; 'Well done! Well done!' Finish thy work; then take thy harp, Give praise to God above ; Sing a new song of mighty joy And endless love. Give thanks to him who holds thee up, In all thy path below; Who holds thee faithful unto death, And crowns thee now ! British Friend.
