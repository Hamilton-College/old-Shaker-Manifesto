Speaking.— In speaking, the object is, to be heard and understood. Every speaker to public audience, whether few or many, should stand while speaking. To sit is disrespectful to the audience. Speakers in public should measure the magnitude of the room, and so pitch the voice that all may hear — should speak 3lowly and articulate clearly. If the hall echo, speak very slowly.
