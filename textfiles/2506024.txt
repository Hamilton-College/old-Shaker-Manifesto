East Canterbury N. H. May, 1895. Seed-time and harvest will never fail. So says the good Book, and it is a consolation to know that some good things are permanently secured for our happiness and prosperity while on our pilgrimage to the land of souls. The beauties of spring have come to us in abundance, and we will accept the generous and wonderful contribution just the same as though we had ordered it to be prepared for us. Even the honey bees and humble bees are made happy by this early supply of bread and honey, and the trees are made alive with the buzzing of these industrious little workers. But few bees, however, are kept in central New Hampshire, as it is difficult to carry them through the long, severe winters. One of our Brethren rejoiced in the possession of two colonies in the month of April, but for some cause they went out on a strike in the month of May and have not yet returned. A report from the dairy informs us that we have over sixty gallons of milk a day. This more than supplies our large family with butter and allows us to place some upon the market. When we wrote our last 'Notes,' the only birds to be seen or heard, in tliis vicinity, were crows, blue jays and English sparrows. Although they were not so musical as some birds, they seemed to enjoy their own style of singing and indeed in mid-winter it was not to be despised. Now, at exactly 3-30 a. m. robin redbreast opens the bird concert, and soon the sparrows, bluebirds and bobolinks and others are filling the air witli their beautiful songs. //. C. Blinu.
