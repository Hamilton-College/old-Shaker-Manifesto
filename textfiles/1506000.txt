THE MANIFESTO. MARY WHITCHER. So happy under ray own vine, And reading what the saints have said; - - Can I appreciate my time If thoughtful only to my good? Nay, let me read and then apply The worth to others far and near, With prayerful heart that such draw nigh To share the good, to me so dear. A peaceful home, a quiet mind, An interest shared in common lot, Such as the Spirit hath combined, And such the selfish world hath not. It is a Christian noble plan Wrought out by Christ in very deed, Possessing all, but not a man Can claim beyond his real need. When shall we love our brother right? When Christian faith by works is shown, Then shall the day dispel the night, And God to each in truth be known. Canterbury, N. H.
