STILL HIGHER. [Contributed by Amelia J. Calver.] High hearts are never long without hearing some new call, some distant clarion of God, even in their dreams; and soon they are observed to break up the camp of ease, and start on some fresh march of faithful service. And looking still higher we find those who never wait till their moral work accumulates, and who reward resolution with no rest; who do the good only to see the better, and see the better only to achieve it; who are too meek for transport, too faithful for remorse, too earnest for repose; whose worship is action, and whose action ceaseless aspiration. J. Martineau.
