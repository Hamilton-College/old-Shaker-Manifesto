STRIFE. LEOPOLD HOHMAN. Strife: has been the rule of ages. Pound in all historic pages. Wounds are made, the pain assuages Grief and bliss commingled rages. The right and wrong do oft collide And men for both have often died. Defined, the strife on either side Is always easy to decide. But where both are mixed, confusing Neither gaining ground, but losingAll that's good is not amusing, But to death of both conducing You give the world be-dazzled Youth ' An eye for eye a tooth for tooth ' Where actions gives them thoughts uncouth They think they know it all forsooth. Aged seniors truth preserving From which there should be no swerving Empty forms and rites conserving Only harm the undeserving. They each in each their place should take And from their lethargy awake To close the strife, firm friends to make, A good to build, an evil shake. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
