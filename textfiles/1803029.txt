Remedy for Poison by Ivy It seems to me that I read all kinds of cures for ivy poison except the right one. I have always endeavored to keep it before the public, but have failed. It is to dissolve sugar of lead �a bit the size of a hazlenut�in half a teacup of sweet milk or varm water. Apply as warm as can be easily borne with a soft, linty piece of linen rag. Three or four applications are sufficient to effect a cure. If the poison is on the face and nearing the eyes or mouth, this astringent wash may be constantly applied. It is a marvelous cure, and by watching closely one can see the fevered blisters turn from white to yellow during the application. This remedy for ivy poison should prevent a great deal of suffering. It is well where a member of a family is easily poisoned to keep sugar of lead in the house all the time. Let it be labeled and kept where it can be found the moment it is wanted. Keep it well wrapped up, that it may not lose its strength. Cor. Ohio Farmer.
