Sanitary Hygiene for Singers Mme. L. Cappiani gives some hints in The Voice for lady singers which are valuable. She says : ' Singing should be done without any exertion in the throat, even in the greatest dramatic climax. Those singers who swell the throat and become red in the face at Forte passages cannot stand operatic work very long, as this is nothing else but an unnecessary muscular exertion counteracting the free development of force, and blurring and thickening the tones. The throat should not be expanded. It must be kept loose, in ord^r that the vooal bands can resound without pressure; which pressure simply hinders the circulation ot the blood, thus injuring general health and causing red face and red throat, followed by exhaustion. Brutal muscular exertion can never produce the power as well as the refined tone required by the true artist. Fortissimo and Pianissimo should be made in the same manner, by sending more or less air through the vocal bands. The throat is but the tube in which these cords resound; the air from the lungs, touching them, brings forth tones or sounds like the JEolian harp. Who that has been in a storm at sea, can forget the wailing of the ship's rigging? A rope is mute in the hand; but at a ship's mast the wind develops vibrations, and the storm gives it a voice.' Herald of Health BOXING THE EARS There ought to be a statute in every state severely punishing this practice or rather an infliction of blows on the head, so common in families and schools of inferior grade. A recent investigation of medical records reveals fifty-one cases of serious injury to children from ' boxing 'or ' cuffing ' on the ear�in some cases chronic and ultimately resulting in fatal brain disease, deafness, insanity, etc. It would be impossible to discipline all offenders, but much might be done by special care in giving notice of the law and penalty through the newspapers and by circulars distributed by board of health inspectors, and by instructions to the police promptly to arrest parents or others seen cuffing children� as they may be seen at all hours of the day in certain regions of every city. Sanitary Era. The Diet of Strong Men The Roman soldiers who built such wonderful roads, and carried a weight of armor and luggage that would crush the average farm hand, lived on coarse brown bread and sour wine. They were temperate in diet, and regular and constant in exercise. The Spanish peasant works every day and dances half the night, yet eats only his black bread, onion, and water melon. The Smyrna porter eats only a little fruit and some olives, yet he walks off with his load of a hundred pounds. The coolie, fed on rice, is more active and can endure more than the negro fed on fat meat. The heavy work of the world is not done by men who eat the greatest quantity. Moderation in diet seems to be the prerequisite of endurance. Remedy for Poison by Ivy It seems to me that I read all kinds of cures for ivy poison except the right one. I have always endeavored to keep it before the public, but have failed. It is to dissolve sugar of lead �a bit the size of a hazlenut�in half a teacup of sweet milk or varm water. Apply as warm as can be easily borne with a soft, linty piece of linen rag. Three or four applications are sufficient to effect a cure. If the poison is on the face and nearing the eyes or mouth, this astringent wash may be constantly applied. It is a marvelous cure, and by watching closely one can see the fevered blisters turn from white to yellow during the application. This remedy for ivy poison should prevent a great deal of suffering. It is well where a member of a family is easily poisoned to keep sugar of lead in the house all the time. Let it be labeled and kept where it can be found the moment it is wanted. Keep it well wrapped up, that it may not lose its strength. Cor. Ohio Farmer.
