Guessing enigmas is an innocent recreation... Guessing enigmas is an innocent recreation; but guessing enigmas in order to win a prize and paying a sum of money or purchasing an article, for the privilege, is a 'game of hazard, in which small sums are ventured for the chance of obtaining a larger value, either in money or in other articles,'and this is Worcester's definition of a lottery. Its motive is 'to gain something for nothing,' which is the motive for gambling. Its effects upon the mind and character of its victim may be as injurious as the effects of gambling. Its prizes are given on the same principle by which a gambling house divides the 'bank' among the fortunate gamesters. It allures to repeated trials, not only novices but also successful as well as unsuccessful guessers, by the chance it offers of winning coveted aniDunts and by the certainty of receiving a certain value, as a package of tea or a subscription to a paper, in return for trifling outlays. The well-baited inducements offered by the papers which have recourse to the enigma lottery, for the double object of notoriety anil of increasing their subscription lists, constitute, in fact, lottery, advertisements, and subscriptions to these papers are sold in place of lottery tickets.
