Ayer, Mass. Jan. 1892. How beautifully Br. Daniel Offord wishes us all a 'Happy New Year' and then he gives some reasons why all cannot enjoy the happiness of a New Year. Selfishness is one among the many things that is a peace destroyer in society. 'Consistency is a jewel,' and let us have this jewel in all things. It is a valuable acquirement to obtain that moral stamina that we may be able to speak the truth, and if need be say, I cannot afford it. As there is no honor in riches there is no disgrace in poverty. Indolence may incur debt, and debts may sadly mar the peace of society. To do our duty and make the best of life should be the aim of each one. We may not reach the highest standard of a Christian character but our trials for perfection will no doubt help us attain unto a much better state. We have passed from the old into the New Year, and would gladly have passed from all the burdens of the old year, but unfortunately the 'La Grippe' is bound to bear us company and there is more sickness at the present time in Harvard than has been known for the last ten years. We trust, however, that we shall all come through safely and be able to render kind thanks for constant care. Our first snow storm came on the fifth of January and made it much better for the drawing of wood and lumber. We have had a short call from Elder Joseph Holden of Mount Lebanon. The mantle of our beloved Elder Giles now rests upon him, and we rejoice in his faithfulness, as a representative of the gospel work who manifests so clearly before the world the fruits of a life of self-denial.
