East Canterbury N. H. Nov. 1895. We are just now in a waiting mood. We want some ice for the use, first, of the dairy as it is difficult to obtain cream without ice, and then we want the warm weather to continue with us so long as it may, as it saves the fuel and is more agreeable to northern minds. The leaves have all fallen from the trees, and the birds have gone to more southern homes. The farmers, and the Lord has blest them, have secured abundant crops and have husked more than fourteen hundred bushels of corn. Two silos of one hundred tons each are full of the best of ensilage, and the cows look with pleasure upon the liberal herdsman as he gives to them their daily allowance. The reconstructing of the dairy has brought advantages to that department, and the blessing rests upon the whole Community. Light and shade, with its sunshine and clouds move with us on our journey tlirough this world. We have had great pleasure in seeing the wild and the cultivated flowers as they have blossomed from early spring till late in the fall, but they are all gone and may be to prepare more beauty for the new spring and summer that is soon to be with us. The flower garden,is it still with us,after so many of its beautiful plants have been plucked up by the roots, to spirit them away? And here comes a pleasing contrast. Some of the children are already wishing for a 'good big snow-storm so that we can bring out our sleds,' and the churches are looking forward to the winter for a season of religious revivals. God is good! 'Who soweth good seed shall surely reap.' 'The year grows rich as it groweth old; And life's latest sands are its sands of gold.' H. C. Blinn.
