Agricultural. A Connecticut Dairyman, who has been experimenting... A Connecticut Dairyman, who has been experimenting with turnips as food for cows, thinks they are worth twenty-five cents a bushel. There was no saving in the amount of hay consumed, but they increased the flow of milk, and were an aid to the digestion of hay and other dry fodder. European experimenters have come to the same conclusion. How to estimate crops per acre How to Estimate Crops per Acre.— Place together four light sticks, measuring exactly a foot square inside, and with this measure walk into the field and select a spot of fair average yield, and lower the frame square over as many heads as it will en-' close, and shell out the heads thus inclosed carefully, and weigh the grain. It is fair to presume that the produce will be the 43,560th part of an acre's produce. To prove it, go through the field and make ten or twenty similar calculations, and estimate by the mean of the whole number of results. It will certainly enable a farmer to make a closer calculation of what a field can produce than he can by guessing. Box measures Box Measures. ¦— Farmers and market gardeners will find a series of box measures very useful; and they will readily be made by any one who understands the two foot rule, and can handle the saw and the hammer. A box 16 by 16 1-3 inches square, and 8 inches deep, will contain a bushel, or 2150.4 cubic inches, each inch in depth holding one gallon. A box 24 by 11 1-5 inches square, and 8 inches deep, will also contain a bushel, or 2150.4 cubic inches, each inch in depth holding one gallon. A box 12 by 11 1-5 inches square, and 8 inches deep, will contain half a bushel, or 1075.2 cubic inches, each inch in depth holding half a gallon. A box 8 by 8 1-4 inches square, and 8 inches deep, will contain half a peck, or 298.8 cubic inches. The gallon dry measure.

The weight, by law, of a few of the articles named, to a bushel is not uniform in all the States, and, therefore, may vary slightly from the above in some places. It is customary in measuring coal, potatoes and like articles to ' heap ' the bushel, as it is called, and, in that case, five even pecks are about equal to one ' heaped bushel.'
