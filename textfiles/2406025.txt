So far as I have seen... So far as I have seen, materializing seances do not amount to much. I do not say that they may not have very high value sometimes, but so far as I am concerned, I have not seen anything that was at all conclusive in the way of materialization, which is no doubt my misfortune, not my fault.ï¿½ W. T. Stead in B. P. J.
