REFLECTIONS J. G. RUSSELL Time, thou art fleeting, seasons come and go, While change is stamped on all things here below ; The buoyant hours of childhood soon are And earth receives her rightful claim at last. But what of time allotted to us here, For usefulness within this mundane sphere? Year follows year in quick succession round, Springtime and harvest with their own abound ; But mortal, thou, who hast a living soul, And over which usurps supreme control,— Does history's pages give a record true, Of well-spent hours? and canst thou here review The fading past, and find no misspent hours That might have wove for thee a wreath of flowers. Hadst thou been diligent to well improve Each moment, passing in its checkless groove ? Methinks I hear the sad, responsive wail, Of fleeting time, I read my verdict—fail! Some golden moment numbered in the past, Before my vision like a meteor cast, Reminds me of neglected act or care, Which haunts my waking moments everywhere. Some sunny spot in life made darkly dim, Some cup of sorrow swelling to its brim, Some debt of gratitude yet left unpaid, Thorugh negligence or want of kindly aid. O may this sad reflection be to me A lesson learned and fixed indelibly Upon the mind, henceforth my heart to move, Each golden moment wisely to improve. Enfield, N. H.
