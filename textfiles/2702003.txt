FATHER SAMUEL. By Elizabeth C. Durgin. Dedicated to Samuel Kendrick, Sabbathday Lake, Maine. Afar there glimmers out a morning star, And softly shine the lights of dawning day: Lo! unseen hands the gates of life unbar, And bid a child fare through the earthly way. The babe knew not what perils round him prest: Love held him fast; and, as he wept and smiled, An angel said : 'With peace he shall be blest; He shall not feel life's tempests fierce and wild.' Through fourscore years and five his soul hath found In quietness and confidence its strength, And still he seeks that knowledge without bound, Of love the wondrous height and breadth and length. O happy soul, turned ever toward the light! For thee with light all life and death shall shine; Rare Heavenly visions open to thy sight: All good thy heart can hold is freely thine. O Breath Divine ! Thou Spirit of our God ! Breathe through this soul whom years can not make old ! When through this life his patient feet have trod, Before him may the endless bliss unfold! Deering Center, Maine.
