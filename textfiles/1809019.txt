NEVER MIND. Rev. Henry Burton, M. A. Did you hear the angry word? Never mind; Let it be as never heard� Never mind; 'Twill but rankle in the breast, 'Twill but break thy spirit's rest, Cast it from thee, that is best� Never mind. Have you planned and toiled in vain? Never mind; Loss sometimes is highest gain, Never mind; Honor is not bought and sold, Character is more than gold, These are yours�a wealth untold� Never mind. Does the night seem dark and long? Never mind; You can cheer it with a song, Never mind; Darkness always leads to dawn, Night is but the gate of morn. Out of griefs our joys are born� Never mind. Does the east wind rudely blow? Never mind; Does the north wind bring the snow? Never mind. 'Twould be south, or 'twould be west, If thy Father thought it best; Face it, like the vane, and rest� Never mind. Is the future all unknown? Never mind; Thou shalt never be alone� Never mind; Turn above thy weeping eyes, Heaven is watching through the skies, Trust the love that never dies Nevermind. The Catholic.
