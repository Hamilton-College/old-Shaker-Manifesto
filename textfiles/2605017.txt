One of the frequent errors of early education... One of the frequent errors of early ed ucation has been mentioned. It is that of enlarging the stomach quite beyond its natural size, till it comes to demand a most unreasonable quantity in order to be satisfied. Multitudes of old and young people distend their stomachs too much every day they live. Children from the very first are trained to be gluttonous. Preserved food whether by salt, salt petre, smoke, spices, spirits &amp;c, &amp;c, are more or less objectionable for the stomach. One great objection to pickles is that they are so changed by vinegar, salt or other appliances as have been used for preservation, as to resist chymification, and even solution. Green grapes, green tomatoes, green cucumbers, green peppers and the like are of themselves insoluble and unwholesome. Medicated food is opposed more or less, to the natural operations to the system. Of medicated substances which in one ilace or anotlier,are either found in food or added to it, are saleratus, sal-soda-assaietida, ginger, allspice and common salt. Many tilings which we eat contain sugar enough for our health, without any additions at our tables. Thus wheat flour contains eight per cent, oatmeal eight; cherries eighteen; plums eleven; beets five; milk seven; peas, corn and rye contain from one to three per cent of this substance. Dr. Alcott.
