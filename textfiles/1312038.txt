HOUSEHOLD HINTS. Ceilings that have been smoked by a kerosene lamp should be washed off with soda water. Hellebore sprinkled on the floor at night destroys cockroaches; they eat it and are poisoned. A tablespoonful of turpentine boiled with your white clothes will greatly aid the whitening process. Paste for labels is made by soaking glue in strong vinegar, then heating it to boiling and adding flour. Good fires should be kept up during housecleaning time, even though the doors and windows be kept open. A piece of stearine candle,, spermaceti or white wax as large as a robin's egg will give a nice gloss. A teaspoon of salt to each pint of starch prevents sticking. When silk has lost its gloss and becomes limpsy it may be restored by sponging with a solution of half an ounce of gum tragacanth in a pint of hot water. Painted woodwork is washed with soap and water, or a little ammonia and water on white paint. On grained work cold tea is sometimes used. Very little if any soap should be used on varnished work. In washing woodwork do not use so much water that it runs down and streaks the wood, and wipe thoroughly dry. Before re-papering a wall it is best to remove the old paper. This is a troublesome operation. Moisten a portion of the wall at a time to soften the paper and paste and then scrape it off. When it is desired to paper over a whitewashed surface, first scrape off the loose lime, fill cracks with plaster of Paris and apply with a brush a sizing made by adding eight ounces of dissolved glue to a pailful of hot water. Hard-finished walls may be washed with soap and water and wiped dry. Grease spots on wall-paper can sometimes be removed by applying a thick paste of boiling hot starch spread thickly on the spot, then allowed to dry and rubbed off with a soft cloth. Other stains may be cut out with a sharp knife and a piece of clean paper matched on.
