Solomon Rankin H. H. H. 'Happy are they 'Who die in the Lord.' 'Death loves a shining mark' was never, perhaps, more fully demonstrated than in the death of the Subject of this sketch, for he was pre-emmently a man of God, as a l6ng' and eventful life consecrated to his Mastel's will fully attests. He knew the paths laid out by the 'Divine Law Giver,' and with an unerring step walked therein having ever in view 'the pearlof great price.' No wonder then that death was robbed of its terror when his calm and peaceful spirit wended its flight 'over the River' there to join in sweet anthems of praise with loved ones gone befote. Yea, dear brother, we miss thee, and in yielding thee up we drop a silent tear to thy memory yct we have the consolation feft, if we but heed thy pious counsels we will some day meet thee in that 'Sweet Bye-and Bye.' The deceased was a believer from youth to old age and died in, the faith; was a tower of strength to this Society, with an eye single to its every want; was one of the first Settlers here consequeutly shared its adversities and . prosperities alike; held many offices of trust, all of which he fllled with dignity and with a christian spirit; was by nature possessed of a strong will and was firm as the 'Rock of Gibraltar' in what he conceded to be right. If charity can be claimed as one of the christian graces then to him must be awarded a double share, for his was the very soul of charity, as hundreds-yea, thousands could testify and no eulbgy, though wefe it from the most gifted pen, could do ample justice to this venerable old Patriarch, who has now gone to reap the reward of a life well spent while here.
