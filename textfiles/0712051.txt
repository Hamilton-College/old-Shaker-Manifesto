Useless expenses USELESS EXPENSES. 1 The Louisville Courier-Journal propounds the fol- { lowing: 'Why should this government, in times of profound peace, maintain a general and a lieutenantgeneral and their glittering establishments, at a cost ' of perhaps $75,000 a year, when a major-general, * with his glittering establishment, at a cost, say of 1 $10,000 a year, would do just as well? But if you go ( on hunting up such conundrums as this, you will rob , the government of the luxury of uselessly squandering at least $50,000,000 per annum.
