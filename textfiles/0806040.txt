For wounds For Wounds. The aching and stiffness caused by wounds can be almost entirely re- lieved by holding the wound over the smoke of burning sugar. One of our correspondents, who gives us this information, punctured his right leg with a large awl, and the limb became in consequence very painful and stiff, so that he walked with great difficulty. A tablespoonful or two of sugar poured on some live coals in a shovel and held under the wound so relieved him that the day after he could walk as well as ever. It is said that if a poultice of pounded peach leaves is placed upon a wound so soon as it is received, lockjaw need not be feared. Tribune
