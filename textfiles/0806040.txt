Washing Washing.—Borax, put in the water used for washing ginghams and highly colored prints, will preserve the colors. Corns Corns.—-Troublesome corns, it is said, can be entirely cured by rubbing them over with ordinary white chalk each day for a number of days. To penetrate smoke To Penetrate Smoke.—By wetting a silk handkerchief, and placing it over the mouth and nostrils, one can pass through the densest smoke with but very little inconvenience as to breathing. For wounds For Wounds. The aching and stiffness caused by wounds can be almost entirely re- lieved by holding the wound over the smoke of burning sugar. One of our correspondents, who gives us this information, punctured his right leg with a large awl, and the limb became in consequence very painful and stiff, so that he walked with great difficulty. A tablespoonful or two of sugar poured on some live coals in a shovel and held under the wound so relieved him that the day after he could walk as well as ever. It is said that if a poultice of pounded peach leaves is placed upon a wound so soon as it is received, lockjaw need not be feared. Tribune
