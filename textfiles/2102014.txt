Since the publication of our last number of the Manifesto... Since the publication of our last number of the Manifesto, the voice of mourning has been heard, more than usual, in our Community. To be overtaken by sudden disappointment in the loss of some choice treasure, may in turn, be the result of deep sorrow, and far deeper than this, is that loss which deprives us of the earthly presence of one whom we have known for many years as a faithful, unwearied spiritual guide and protector. This sudden transfer, even to spirit home, awakens our sympathy and we mourn the loss to a part or to our whole Zion. The soul's journey of exploration is a subject over which there has been endless speculations. To dwell upon these would be as time thrown away, and the' satisfaction to be derived, would, at the best, be ephemeral. Our pleasure, our interest and our spiritual compensation is largely centered in that which surrounds us in our gospel home, while dwelling upon the earth. This is the beginning of our eternity, our heavenly manifestation in which is to be found the hope of the resurrection in Christ. It is our peaceful prosperity as men and women while fulfilling our mission in the duties of life. To disturb this soul communion agitates our whole being and changes, essentially, the current of our earthly and heavenly anticipations. Our recession from the body through that God-given transition which some call death, into another and more exalted sphere of existence, although it may be only as the passing from one room into another, is liable to so affect us, as mourners, that we quite forget the position we had previously accepted. The soul that is made alive in Christ can never die, and to pass from the activities of this realm, and to escape from mortality, is that these same activities may be resumed in the City of our God. To be thus suddenly transferred to the heavenly kingdom, awakens our sympathy for those who suffer directly as well as for those througha out our whole Zion home, even though we readily admit that there is great rejoicing in the accession to the invisible throng. It would seem that the cry of� 'Come over and help us' is the voice to be heard in both worlds. We know that it has ever been the urgent petition of the Sons and Daughters of God and can never be laid aside so long as there are souls that need instruction in the testimony of our Lord, Jesus Christ. In this is embodied the wisdom that comes from above, which is first pure and then peaceable, which spiritually, is to become as a little child, trusting, obedient and teachable ; an operation in the moulding of minds that requires a prayerful spirit, and a strong faith in the efficacy of the gospel work to accomplish the desired result. Although the mind of a selfish, animal man may be prone to evil, and may be the offspring of those who have for generations pursued the same low standard of morality, yet as we see through faith, the 'silver lining' to every cloud, we may in the same manner see a germ of growing humanity which may by constant care, develop into an image of the Son or Daughter of God. It may not be possible to count the number of years that have already passed over this world, and the evolutions and revolutions that have been made in order to accomplish the development which we find in mankind, and yet there are seers who are penetrating the long avenues of eternal progress and find man far in advance of any who are upon the earth at the present time. Is it a wonder that 'those who have tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come,'* that those who can make even a faint estimate of the progress already made in the mind, should be anxious to assist others in the same good work ? To make on earth what we all believe God intended from the beginning ;�a Paradise of Peace ! Whether in the body or in the land of souls, it must be the same progressive work of God, and it is quite essential that the soul work be well done on earth and ready for its increase in the celestial kinodom.
