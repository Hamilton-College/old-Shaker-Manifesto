In Memory of Brother STEPHEN BOISSEAU. By Louisa. Away from earth and all its cares, His spirit finds a rest Remote from changing scenes of time And all that can molest. God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither shall there be any pain, sorrow or affliction. Blessed assurance. Oh! saddened weary mortals a little while longer and tears sh all be unknown to thee; and we shall be rejoicing with thousands who like him have been freed from all those troubles. So try to live that when the sun of our existence sinks in night, memorials sweet of mercies done may shrine our names in memory's light. Not for thee our tears are shed, our sighs are given. Why mourn to know thou art a free partaker of the joys of heaven. Finished thy work kept thy faith, glorious reflection! may we ever cherish the memory of the good example and faithful toil in loving gratitude. The departed Brother has heard the glad sound, welcome home, come take thy rest, for peace and happiness is thy just reward. Gone but not forgotten, in the mind of every one. Blessed Lord, thou didst give and thou hast taken. If I could express in words, the feelings my heart contains, it would be only in a feeble way. Pleasant Hill Ky.
