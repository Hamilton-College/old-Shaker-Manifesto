ENCOURAGEMENT. CHARLES JULIUS PRAETER. Feeling desirous to find a permanent increase in faith and good works, and being convinced that by obedience to godly principles we become beautified and adorned with the graces of simplicity, truth, and purity, I thought to make a few remarks, which I hope may lead to the encouragement of the younger part of my Brethren and Sisters, who have had but a short privilege in living among the people of God in this day of Christ's second appearing. I have learned by a lengthy exuerience in God's holy Zion .on earth, that the maxim is certainly correct, 'If we want to be happy we must make others happy. ' It is written, 1 Peter iii., 10. 'For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile. ' 'If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man.' James, iii., 2. ' He will send his angels to gather out of his kingdom all that offend and them that do iniquity. ' Matt. xiii., 41It is a true saying, a good Believer will never give, nor take offence. Our blessed Mother Ann's testimony was ; ' Never speak to or reprove any one in excitement, or passion, for if you do, you put into him ten times more a spirit of evil, than you take from him. ' 'Brethren if a man be overtaken with a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness. ' Gal vi., 1. ' Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. ' Matt, v., 5. ' And a meek and lowly spirit is precious in the sight of God. '' ' The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.' Isa. xi., 6. This is an allegory, representing the different characters and dispositions of men, and declaring, that all leaders among the people of God must be innocent and harmless, kind and lovely, as generally all little children are. I have become fully convinced, that the grace of God has a great deal to do with our travel on this mundane sphere. Our Savior taught us to . pray in the Lord's prayer. ' Leave us not in temptation. ' We must infer from this, that God may leave us in temptation or not, just as he sees fit. ' God resisteth the proud, but giveth his grace to the humble. ' It is therefore plain and evident that nothing short of a spirit of meekness and humility, charity and love, will cause the grace of God to be extended to us, for it is explicitly required to love Him with all our soul, heart, mind and strength, and our neighbor as ourselves. These principles can only be carried out by doing all the good we possibly can do, temporally as well as spiritually, never harbor the least enmity, against any one, no matter how much we might have been abused, always to do good for evil, and manifest a spirit of love and charity. ' Charity is not easily provoked, beareth all things, endureth all things. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three, but the greatest of these is charity. ' 1 Cor. xiii., 5, 13. Chastity, meekness, humility and obedience are going hand to hand with charity. Therefore, it is obvious, that all who carry out and live uj) to these requirements, are under the special blessing, favor and protection of God, and have a foretaste of heaven, or the world to come, whilst living here on earth. The wisdom that is from above is first chaste (a gny in Greekï¿½pure is not correct.) In the German version it is translated chaste; for although purity and chastity belong together, the proper definition of these words are a little different, as for instance water, or air, could not properly be termed chaste. This shows, that those who are in possession of divine wisdom, must be above all things, first chaste, peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocrisy, and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. ' Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. ' Matt, v., 6. Jesus was the prince of peace, not a warrior, f&gt;&gt;r he said; ' He that takes the sword shall perish by the sword. ' Can it not be seen by this that, '' Darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people; ' for do not all sects and denominations in the world, with only a few exceptions, go to war and butcher one another? Where is the peaceable kingdom of God to be found, where they live together as Brethren and Sisters in the bonds of love and union, and have all things in common, except among good Believers, who crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts, and live righteously, godly and soberly? 'Whosoever will save his (carnal) life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel shall save it. ' Mark, viii., 85. Peter began to say unto him, 'Lo we have left all and have followed thee. ' Mark, x., 28. This is an incontrovertible evidence that he left his wife and she became a sister, for Jesus answered and said; ' Verily I say unto you, there is no man that has left house, or brethren and sisters, or father or mother, or wife or children or lands, for my sake and the gospels, but he shall receive a hundred fold now in this time, houses, and brethren and sisters, mothers and children and lands with persecution, and in the world to come eternal life.' Very few of our friends perhaps have noticed that the word wife is omitted in the reward and persecution fills out her place ! Now I can testify to all men, that I have received an hundred fold, all that Jesus has promised, and the heavenly Father declared, that he would withhold no good thing from those that would love and serve him. The blessings of God, and a conscience void of offence to all men, is a greater reward to the faithful and honest soul, than all the treasures that this world can afford, for ' Heaven is within. ' It is more a condition than a location. Who of all my dear Brethren and Sisters will therefore be so unwise, as to sell their precious birthright for a mess of pottage, like Esau, to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, and lose that glorious reward, of which we read, that ' No eye has seen, no ear heard, neither has it entered the heart of man, what God has promised to them that love and serve him? ' 'No cross, no crown !' The cross has to be faithfully borne to the end, so that when we have ended our time of probation in this mundane sphere, we can with confidence expect a glorious reception in the spheres of bliss, with those cheerful words of our Savior, ' Welcome good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. ' I have written the foregoing from pure love to my younger Brethren and Sisters, and hope to God, that all may come to the knowledge of truth and be saved, With regard to the happiness and welfare of all my fellow mortals, I truly remain your friend and well wisher.
