INCENSE ...Little words are the sweetest to hear; little charities fly furthest and stay longest on the wing; little flakes are the stillest; little hopes the fondest, and little farms the best tilled; little books are the most read, and little songs the dearest loved. And when nature would make any thing especially rare and beautiful, she makes it little—little pearls, little diamonds, little dew. Agar's is a model prayer, yet it is but a little one, and the burden of the petition is but for little. The sermon on the mount is little. Life is made up of littles; death is what remains of them all. Day is made up of little beams, and night is glorious with little stars. __ 'Religious controversy is the gates of hell.' —Elder F. W. Evans. __Be careful: A certain Shaker preacher, expatiating upon the beauties, and Christian necessity, of the 'all things common' doctrine, attempted a 'golden saying' thus: * * * ' So closely do we attempt to follow this Christian rule, that we fain disown a dollar's worth of property. Nothing that we have is our own, but Society's ; even the clothes I have on my person arenot mine.'''' A lady in the audience, hearing the address, complimented the young man freely, and then added : ' If the clothes he had on were borrowed, he borrowed them of some body who was just of his size!' Shaker preachers, be careful of what you say.
