KIND WORDS OF US That invaluable periodical, Foote's Health Monthly, reminds its thousands of readers that : ' The Shaker Manifesto is the title of a twenty-four page journal which comes to us regularly as an exchange. It is the official paper of the Shaker societies in the United States, and serves a useful purpose to their members as a medium of thought exchange; but the interest in it is by no means limited to them, for it contains exposition of Shaker doctrines and customs that makes it very readable to all who are interested in various phases of religion and experiments in communistic living. The Shakers are much misunderstood, and often misrepresented by those who attempt to tell something of them ; and any one who desires to become rightly informed concerning their institutions, ideas and customs, cannot find a better way than by sending sixty cents for a year's subscription to The Shaker Manifesto, Shakers, N. Y.' And that very big light in dark placesâ€” the noble and chaste New Jerusalem Messenger, New York, thus compliments and copies us : ' The Shaker Manifesto does not believe in the doctrine that the death bed is the supreme moment when the usefulness of a religion may be tested. We append the following sensible words : ' One of the strongest arguments favoring Christianity has been that no one has regretted its practice on the death bed. We present a stronger and strongest; no one having lived it, and enjoyed the purity and excellence of its radical features, ever wished to live or die by any other life doctrine. . . The death bed is no place to create a criterion, but the active, healty, good sensed man or woman can tell the truth more effectually.''
