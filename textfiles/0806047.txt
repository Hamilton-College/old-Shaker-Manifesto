A tablespoonful of guano... A tablespoonful of guano, dissolved in one gallon of warm water, and used twice a week, or every fourth day, is also an excellent stimulant for all kinds of plants. Liquid fertilizer, made from horse or cow manure, is equally good; but care must be taken not to use it in too strong doses, as it will burn up the tender rootlets and kill the plants.
