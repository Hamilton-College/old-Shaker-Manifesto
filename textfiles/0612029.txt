COMMUNITY IDEAS 'The family should be a community. To make it truly so, there must be common interest. Alas, for that household where the father's business, the mother's social cares, and the children's sports and pleasures, are not shared by each other! Then it will not be strange if the expenditure is out of proportion to the income, and if the companions and resorts of the children are evil. Happy that home, where the cares and joys are so divided that the former are not oppressive and the latter are multiplied —where the hearts grow closer as the years roll by, so that the separations which must come to every family are only bodily, and therefore temporary! '—Arthur's Mag. A little common sense, digesting the above paragraph, teaches a lesson which individuals, if dullards or determined self-seekers, would not learn until, so far as their lives are concerned, Communities, Shaker Organizations, etc., came to an end. The one-man or one-woman power is a disorganizer, either in families or societies — a combination of families. Whoever has attempted it, has either experienced a success in inevitable disruption of the unselfish determinations of societies, or in his or her own personal degradation. If there exists a curse for any, there remains a very unpleasant reward for one who uses the consecrated labors of others for sinister, selfish — and when it arrives so far—devilish ends!
