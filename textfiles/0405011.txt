HAPPINESS The desire of the Creator in bringing human beings into existence on this planet was for happiness. We deal with facts—facts within the reach of mental ken. In this world, hap- piness is the result of obedience to law— misery, of law's infraction. Why not so in other worlds ? By universal law, cause and effect are bound together. No power on earth, nor in Heaven, will divorce them. ' The reward of every man's hand shall be given him.' ' Whatso- ever a man soweth, that also shall he reap ;' and wisely so. The suffering, inseparable from law's infraction, is the remedial agent—man's best friend, Heaven's best mercy—without which, man might be an eternal transgressor. The writer of this article has had a somewhat diversified experience—has been associated with men in various conditions in life— rich and poor, wise and otherwise. He has now had a brief acquaintance with the Shakers ; finds them the most law-abiding— physiologically, morally and spiritually—of any people of his acquaintance, and, of course, the balance, Happiness vs. Misery, is decided in their favor; not because they are a superior race of humans, but because of the advantages of community over isolation, for self-disciplinary and other purposes, enabling to divide the cares, and double the enjoyments—all that is worthy of the name of enjoyment—and thus preparing them for happiness, in all future states of being, in the most rational manner conceivable.
