Dear Children:--To turn over a new leaf in the volume... ENFIELD, Ct., 1891. Dear Children:ï¿½To turn over a new leaf in the volume of your lives is always in order. Let there be no blots on the page. You cannot go back on your past lives to repair aught that was amiss. You can best evince your regret for past errors by resolutely striving to avoid them in future. The present is yours, wisely improve it. Think what you should do, and strive to do it. Make each day a useful day. A wasted day in your lives should be regretted. There is always an effort to make, if the heavenly prize you would take. Work and win it. Be strong in faith and deed, ere long you will succeed. It is every-day work living to God. Begin now. Battle for the right and be right yourselves. It hardens the heart to live in sin. Spare your sins and spoil your happiness. Don't yield to sin. Make and keep good vows, let them call forth daily practical effort. Good eilorts will gain reward. Let virtue be your guiding star. Pure thoughts and deeds are of untold value and thousands disregard their worth. If you are pure in heart, others breathing your spiritual atmosphere become nobler and purer. Whether you intend it or not, you are always either helping or hurting others by your unconscious influence. You can never say, 'Though I do not help, neither will I hinder,' for you are ahvays doing one or the other.. Let your example be for good and not for evil. Be watchful and prayerful and avoid grief and trouble. Commit yourselves to God for instruction and guidance. 'In Wisdom's way there is joy and delight.' Walk therein. Make your heaven here. It is heaven all the way to heaven. Be modest and unassuming. Walk in the light, in the truth persevere, This will insure you a Happy New Year. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
