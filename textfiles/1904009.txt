SHAKERISM. IS CELIBACY CONTRARY TO NATURAL AND REVEALED LAW? Daniel Fraser. 1st.�Man is in possession of, aud manifests a two-fold life�an animal life, represented by animal emotions, and an inner, a higher life, represented by the emotions of benevolence, goodness, and aspirations God-ward. 2nd.�Adam and Eve are the type of the animal man ; within their province lies the work of multiplying aud replenishing the earth, subject to law, nevertheless. 'The day thou eatest thereof,' contrary to law, '�thou shalt surely die ; with shame shalt thou cover thyself. Thy conceptions shall be multiplied, and in sorrow shalt thou bring forth'�a correct delineation of the present condition of the human family. Additional evidence that law has been, and is violated, is found in the many diseases which infect humanity. The Adamic, the old man, can only claim the right to multiply when subject to law. Use, not Lust, is the rule. 3rd.�Jesus Christ was the type of the New, the inner man. k&gt;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' He was not of the world ; his life constituted the resurrection ; he was a celibate ; and all in his life, are as he was. And whenever two or three are gathered together in that life, they will constitute a new order of human society�the resurrection or Christ order ; having property in common, the strong bearing the burdens of the weak, as do the Shakers. 'By their works ye shall know them.' 4th.�Can the New man marry and be given in marriage, and follow Father Adam, the old man�and still be the new man ? The new man cannot recognize the old man in any of his works, therefore, he must be a celibate. 5th.�-Was Jesus, who took on himself the nature of his brethren whom he came to redeem, a celibate? He was. And were the members of the Pentecostal Church celibates? They were ; and as proof thereof, they had goods in common, and abstained from war. This order of society existed about four hundred years; had they married, there would have been among them a plurality of center^ of affection and of interest, consequently a community of goods could not have been maintained. 6th.�Are the so-called Christians of to-day lineal descendents of the Pente,costal Church? They are not. The lineal descendent of a horse is a horse, having the attributes and manners of a horse. The Christians of to-day are the lineal descendents of the children of this world; they marry, held private property, take advantage of one another, fight a great deal, and quarrel generally. It is said of them that 'There is no peace in the church, in the meeting house, in the school-house, in the sewing circle, nor anywhere else among them.' 7th.�Should the Adamic man cease from committing sin, and propagate in accordance with law. would he still be the old man ? He would still be the old man, beautiful in his order, yet of the earth, earthy. 8th.�Do you infer that it is in accordance with the higher nature or life in mau to be heavenly while he is in the body? I do ; it is principles worked out�embodied, which constitutes heaven. Heavenly principles, worked out, will bring forth heavenly fruit, without reference to locality. In heaven they do not marry ; therefore, if heaven is ever found on earth, neither will they who are in that kingdom marry, they will be celibates, assuming that state, as a first condition that they are not of the world. 9 th.�You have quoted from the Scriptures, showing that celibacy is a condition of the higher life, but what manifestations have been presented in the history of our race, that celibacy is a condition necessary to the fulfillment of human wants and desires, said desires being in accordance with any laws of man's nature? We can only know of law by its manifestations, and that there is a law in our nature responding to a virgin, a celibate life, is evident. It has cropped out in all ages, from the earliest historic times. It was manifested in the Theraputas of Egypt, and has flourished for thousands of years in Thibet. It cropped out among the Jews in the Nazarites, and was developed as a permanent institution in the community of the Essenes.�It may be traced f.mong the Brahmins and Ascetics of the East. The Monastic orders of Europe speak of its existence during a period of nearly two thousand years. And a class of heretics so-called by the Catholic Church, boldly declared that the law was written on their hearts, and they lived it out in their lives. The order of the vestal priestesses in the Roman temples lasted about a thousand years, and gave sanctity and power, and shows the innate veneration of the human soul for a life of absolute purity. No persons could be more honored and trusted than these females were. Lastly, the Shakers of America are living respondents to the law, that absolute purity of body and spirit ia an essential preliminary to their happiness�the manifestation and growth of the life of God in the soul. They believe that all may enter into a heavenly state, by cultivating heavenly principles. And that it is their mission to keep an open door for all who live as Jesus did, and walk as He did walk. He was the first born of many brethren. Having these abundant evidences in view, we say that Shakerism is not ��'founded on a lie,' but on that law which, when operative, has in all ages brought forth the manifestation of God in human spirits. On this rock, and with such materials, will Christ�the elder brother�found and build his church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. And that the world may not run itself out, by its own doinga, before the appointed time, we kindly advise all to draw a little nearer to the example of the Shakers, so that their offspring may not die off prematurely, and that a measure of the blessing of God, bodily health, peace and prosperity, may be theirs.
