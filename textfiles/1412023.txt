SCHOOLS. According to The Evening Wisconsin, of Milwaukee, the public schools of that city are complained of as having a tendency to make the pupils despise manual labor. 'Very few boys, ' it says, ' enter the mechanical trades when their school course is completed. Many of them, moved by the false idea that labor with the hands is not respectable, go into the already overcrowded professions. Oth ers take up clerkships which lead to nothin better. Both these classes can hope to receiv for their services as a rule no more than,canty pittance. Meantime the more lucrave and equally honorable places in the workshops, it is complained, are being filled )y foreign workmen. To remedy this alleged vil the introduction of a system of industri1 training in the schools is demanded. ' Is not that true as scripture with the whole 3ublic School system of the United States? t was established coeval with Slavery. Slavery made labor dishonorable, unpopular. The Slave system is abolished, and the Public Schools should now teach morality, industry and Physiology. Let every child be instructed in some form of manual labor by which they could earn a living, be taught how to gain and maintain good health, and then morality will not be among the lost Arts, and the professional Office seekers and Tramps will disappear together.
