Why? Because of his love, honor and obedience to God... Moses has 17. Why? Because of his love, honor and obedience to God; his life is the grandest mentioned in the Old Testament. His institutions show forth a spirit of purity, intelligence, justice and freedom, not found in others. He changed the Hebrews from a nation of shepherds to a people of fixed residence and agricultural habits. Otis D. Bell
