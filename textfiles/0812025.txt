WHICH SHALL WE HONOR MOST, Honest Infidelity or Dishonest Christianity? It is a singular fact, that while the socalled Christianity of popular churches, and the Infidelity of The Boston Investigator type, are at bitter variance concerning theologies, they strike hands as a unit, and are '^as the heart of one' in opposition to PShaker principles. We honor every one for clinging to honest beliefs. Iniidels to Christianity are to be honored, if we can credit their sincerity in opposing Christian principles from honest motives. But what shall we say of those, professing Christianity, who yet as boldly, and more vituperatively oppose, condemn and crucify the lifeprinciples of Christ, than do any infidels ? The Boston Investigator has a correspondent to deal with,—one who wants to live without work—live upon the earnings of others—and who foolishly thinks the Shakers are the people whom he can fleece. We coincide completely in the parting advice to him of the Investigator; but we present its article entire to show how intelligently it speaks of our principles while disagreeing with them ; and to ask particular attention to the fact, that while it opposes, it acknowledges our principles to be very Christian— first class Christian ! While the majority of so-called Christian Churches, not only are dishonest in opposing Shaker principles because of their dislike to practice them, but also call them unchristian, to ease their guilty consciences ! Churchism and Infidelity at one on Shakerism! But which deserves the most honor?
