'The Shaker.' BY MARIA WITHAM, ENFIELD, CONN. Hail, lovely Shaker ! What with thee can compare In beauty, and goodness, and truth, ever rare ! No dew drop, that glints in the morning sun's beam, Can brighten and bless like the truths of thy theme. How I long for thy coming, thon herald of peace ! Thou fountain of goodness ! May'st thon ever increase! On, on, o'er the earth, and bear on thy pag'e Glad tidings of truth, both to youth and old age ; And teach all mankind false opinions to leave, To use God-given reason, and light to receive. Thou glorious volume, which in wisdom art made, May'st thou understandingly, ever be read, And, as thon adVancedst, let my zeal improve, And glow with the ardor of consummate love.
