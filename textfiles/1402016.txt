TRUST. Mary Whitcher The wing of an angel May shade for a time, At which thou wonld'st neither Complain nor repine, Well knowing the spirit Of God lieth near, And thou hast no reason For doubt or for fear. How gracious to trust Though thy sky seems o'ercast, The heavens remain Through the tempest and blast; Even so all thy good Shall securely remain Through every tempest, Through sorrow and pain. Canterbury, iV. //.
