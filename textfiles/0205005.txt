Gods BY F. W. EVANS The Jews worshiped the God of battles— the Lord of hosts of fighting angels—a great warrior. The Heathen, when converted to Heathen Christianity, made a God of Jesus— declared him to be Jehovah—the God of the Jews—and as such, he could not object to Marriage, Private property, nor War, all of which, as Jehovah, he had blessed, in his chosen people—the Jews. Therefore the Heathen Christian nations practice all of these things unto this day—for all people will be like the God they worship. If Jesus was a celibate, it was because he was God, not man. If he owned no property, it was because he did not need it; and if he did not marry, it was because he could make children out of stones. And the reason he did not fight was, that he himself had created the weapon and him who used it.
