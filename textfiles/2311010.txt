THE BURNING BUSH. Sarah J. Burger. The natural law, the law of correspondences, can be traced through the whole universe. The natural is typical of the spiritual, and to be able to see and understand the different degrees of development from the natural to the spiritual, will enable us to gain a truer and more enlightened interpretation of the mysteries of life. There are the positive and negative forces, life and death; heat and cold; all proving in a more or less tangible way the universal law of correspondences, the centripetal and contrifugal, also the loving and hating, refusing and yet entreating for some powor to sustain and uplift. These are the elements that make man the aspiring creature that he is. It was this cry for mercy which went from the hearts of the poor, oppressed and afflicted, that ascended to the throne of the Infinite for deliverance from the cruel slavery of Egyptian bondage, and it was this same earnestness and fortitude of soul which Moses felt for the people of Israel that enabled him to see with spiritual eyes the Burning Bush on Mount IIoreb, or, Mountain of God as it was called, from the fact that the spirit of God appeared to him thereon. The Mountain having had two peaks the other was called Sinai from Seneh, a bush, because it was in a bush that the appearance was made. It is said that the spiritual element of fire pervades all space, is its life and soul; and it was this spiritual element that Moses beheld, while watching the flocks of the priest of Midian, as he led them through the desert and came to the Mountain. This manifestation of the Divine Spirit in the midst of the Burning Bush was an evidence that God's ear was not heavy that He could not hear the pleadings of his children, nor his arm shortened that He could not protect his chosen people through afflictions that weighed heavily upon them, for it was during their journey through the wilderness that they were guided in a marvelous manner. The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day, and by night in a pillar of fire which gave THE MANIFESTO. 257 them light. With such manifestations is it any wonder that the ancients were credited with worshiping visible fire? The Parsees were so charged because they faced the fire, also the sea and sun as they represented to them the Light of Lights, source of all Life, and which they named Hormazd, which signifies the eternal principle of Good. And again no true Parsee will ever smoke, as they consider it a desecration or profanation of the sacred symbolï¿½Fire. The Burning Bush, as also the pillar of cloud and fire was a beautiful symbol of the Divine presence, and was a continual proof that the Lord was ever near his people to guide and protect them. It has been related of Zoroaster that he retired to the mountain, to study wisdom, and also for the benefit of solitude, and that while there the whole mountain was enveloped in a flame, out of which he descended without harm, and for which he offered a sacrifice to God as an evidence within himself that God had appeared to him in the midst of the flame. The Burning Bush, so beautifully spoken of, is a significant emblem of the Israelites in their various stages of affliction and persecution. Though they passed through the fires of adversity yet they were not comsumed; it also represents the Church of God in the wilderness, where the enemy of souls was hurling the fiery darts of envy and jealousy to destroy and scatter those who would follow the true and living; God ; yet through faith and firm reliance in a Divine power, they were preserved from all harni, as is every one who drinks at the spiritual fountain of life, after which they may enter the Koly of Holies and bow before the altar of living inspirai ion, and feel the fires of truth fanned within their own being, and are continually made purer by this flame which consumes the evil yet preserves the good. What was it that saved the three Hebrew children from being destroyed in the fiery furnace, because they would not worship the golden image set up by the king, when the decree was sent forth that all who would not bow in reverence at the sound of the dulcimer, harp and other instruments would be cast in the furnace ? Knowing the command, ' 'thou shalt have no other gods before me, thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters under the earth, thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them,' could they be false to their faith when they knew that God's promises were sure and would save to the uttermost? Nay, they cast all fear and doubt aside and passed through the flame unharmed though the furnace was heated seven times hotter than ever before, proving that they walked with God, clothed with an invisible power or substance that no external or natural fire could penetrate and consume. 'A cloud has gathered over the fire altar, the once fragrant wood of Truth is wet with the deadly dews of doubt.' May the spirit of caviling be cast aside, that the fires may be renewed and burn with greater intensity until all wrong shall be consumed, and as this cloud 258 THE MANIFESTO. passes away, may the spiritual vision be so clear and bright, that others may witness like manifestations and hear the voice of God as He speaks to the soul out of the midst of the Burning Hush, leading, guiding and directing toward the holy land, the land of promise, the New Jerusalem.
