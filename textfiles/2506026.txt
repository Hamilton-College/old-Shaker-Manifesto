Sabbathday Lake, Me. May 5, 1895. May has come, bringing its burdens to the farmer and gardener. Most of the help is engaged at the saw-mill just now, yet the farm work is not neglected. About 350 fruit trees have been set out, THE MANIFESTO. 141 250 apple, and the rest are peach, pear, plum and cherry. A new strawberrybed is also in progress. Our young Brethren have built a greenhouse which is heated with a wood furnace. In it they started about eightyfive dozen tomato plants, also 3,300 celery plants. The tomato plants will mostly be sold to people living in this vicinity. They are raising the celery for the Poland Spring Hotels; the seed was sown in Feb. and the plants are at present seven inches high. Celery is now grown as a common garden crop, yet few understand its cultivation. It has to be thoroughly irrigated during dry weather and a few weeks before taking up it is bleached with hay or earth. The weapons of cleanliness are being wielded, for as John Wesley says 'Cleanliness is next to Godliness' we must remove the dust and dirt in order to become godly. Our surroundings will show if we are what we profess to be,a godly people. Though the Sisters have not yet a greenhouse, they have done a goodly amount of seed starting. They have at this time hundreds of seedlings grown in their sunny rooms. Carnation Pinks, Asters, Dahlias, Cosmos, Antirrhinum, Pansies and other flowers which are soon to be transplanted to the garden plots. We often think of the untiring efforts of the Editor and printers of The Manifesto, during these warm, pleasant days, and heartily extend our grateful thanks and well wishes, exclaiming with Dickens, 'God bless you every one.'
