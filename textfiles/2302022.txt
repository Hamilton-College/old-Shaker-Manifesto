All the readers of the Manifesto... All the readers of the Manifesto will be interested in this number, as it is largely, one of affectionate regard for our beloved Elder, Daniel Boler, of blessed memory. This manifestation of love should be carefully cherished as it is the natural as well as the spiritual outgrowth of the better qualities of the mind. And while on the one part this bond of love and spiritual affection has been honestly earned through a long series of years which have been consecrated to the best interests of the gospel work ; it has no less been a life of interested care for the peace and prosperity of the Community as a whole, and then of the uprightness of each individual member. A consecrated lii'e, that gives to God and to his people all that we may possess, is quite different from a selfish life that is wholly absorbed in the interests of me and mine, that the two could not consistently abide in the same person. Communists who accept the testimony of Jesus as their rule for life, must, like their divine Teacher, enter in at the strait gate. Their lives, like his life must be molded agreeably to the will of God as their souls become established in the principles of gospel righteousness. Many witnesses testify that this has been the life work of our beloved Elder Daniel. He entered the Community in childhood, and from that early age, on to one of more than fourscore, was an interested advocate to make his home one of peace and no less one of brotherly love. Jesus was peculiarly emphatic on this point, and made it one of the essential tests to a rightful membership among those who accepted his order of life. 'By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one for another.' In this manifestation of love, toward a gospel father who has so devotedly spent his life for the good of others, there is a simple and pleasant recognition of merited appreciation. It meets in its simplicity one THE MANIFESTO. 45 phase of the gospel work, and aids effectually in the diffusion of love and harmony throughout the whole Community. Although the dear father may not be seen walking with us on the earth, to-day, yet he is evidently, near to these over whom he has watched as a spiritual guardian with such solicitous care. Elder Daniel is not dead, �He has not even fallen asleep. As he was while with us an active worker in the resurrection order of Christ, so is he the same in his heavenly home. It was one of the beautiful promises of Jesus to those who believed on him, that they would never die. Corruption has no place in the testimony of Jesus Christ. That belongs exclusively to those who sow to the flesh. As Paul so clearly taught the disciples at Galatia, the word of God, so may he teach us, as he says,�'' Be not deceived ; God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that spweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption.' The disposition that may be made of the body of man, at the close of its wrork on the earth, is of as little consequence as is the disposition that may be made of food he eats to-day. That law of God so carefully worded by one of the inspired writers, may need no change, and it is quite doubtful if it ever will be changed. While the body serves the interests of the soul, as best it can, during its pilgrimage, be that of many or of few days, the law is, 'Dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return.' Those who walk with God to-day, God takes them, without doubt, as he did those of an earlier age : not out of the body but to make them ministers of his word, and those who go up into a heaven, just above the clouds, as did Elijah in a chariot of fire, evidently go only in the visions of the seer. One of our writers has expressed himself very clearly on this subject of the resurrection of Jesus. 'It is said in Rom. viii., 29, that Christ was the first-born among many brethren. This has reference to the spiritual birth, being born of the spirit out of a sinful nature, and all that receive this new birth are brethren. That which is born of the spirit is spirit and that which is born of the flesh is flesh. No one can be numbered with and become one of his brethren while living a worldly life. The lessons to be learned from this are, first, Jesus was a man born of the flesh like his brethren, and second, that he had been dead to that spiritual life into which he rose. He could not have risen from the dead except he had been dead; but being born of the spirit by obedience to God, his spirit arose from the dead, and this was his true resurrection to which he always had reference, and not to his natural body.'
