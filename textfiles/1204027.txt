STORY WRITING Composition is the bugbear of the children, not without cause. When J. is told to write upon the subject, 'A Conversation among Themistocles, Aristides and Pericles, on the Proposed Appropriation of the Funds of the Confederacy of Delos, for the Ornamentation of Athens,' no wonder she groans in spirit, wishes the schools were at the bottom of the Â¦sea, or at least, that she had the management of school affairs for a short time. With what a glorious feeling she would abolish from the curriculum all composition! And woe to the luckless wight who would dare to suggest its re-installment! Alas, poor J. ! thou hast not the power to do this thing; but we hope that wiser teachers of an advanced and wiser age will pursue a course which will make composition pleasant. A teacher of experience says, 'Let us call it story-writing, for story-writing is a word which every child understands, and composition is not. I would have my reading-lesson first, and have every member of the class read a paragraph; then order all book? to be put away, slates to be distributed, and the subject of the lesson made the subject of the story to be written by the children.'
