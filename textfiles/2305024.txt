NOTES ABOUT HOME Mount Lebanon, N. Y. April, 1893. 'April now appears A child of smiles and tears.' So says the poet, and so we say, when realizing how little we know from hour to hour what weather to expect. Mark Twain in humorously describing New England weather, says he has counted one hundred and thirty-six kinds of weather inside of twenty-four hours. This can be literally true when we consider that all the weather we have is inside of some twenty-four hours; there is no other place to have it. Be that as it may we agree with Mark Twain when he says, that New England can not hold all her weather, it is bulging out on every side, and that is why we, who are so near the border line, are favored with such a variety. On the 4th inst. the mutterings of distant thunder were heard, and the air seemed sultry. On the morning of the 6th we awoke to find one of the most beautiful weather pictures of the year, spread out before us. The ground was covered with snow eight inches deep, which had fallen so lightly, that the most slender twig had its share, without disturbance. When the sun rose the clouds fled, and over all this whiteness, was the brightest blue dome of sky that ever bounded our vision. As we gazed about us with delight, we could easily imagine that we were in fairy land, or were looking at a panoramic picture, so perfectly calm were all the forces of Nature. But this part of the panorama was soon designed to move on, and at noon of the 7th we were wading knee deep in as severe and blinding snow storm as we cared to experience, over paths which an hour before were innocent of even moisture enough to call for rubber overshoes. This, too, soon passed away, and the 8th gave us a succession of electric storms with heavy rain, from 11 a. m. until 3-30 p. m. This is variety enough, we think, to suit even the most changeable, and we can all enjoy the part we like best. But what a commonplace subject for Home Notes. The weatherï¿½which all know so much about. What else can we write of? Spring? Every one knows about that also. Wood is being sawed and split? That part of the programme always comes with the bluebirds and robins. One special blessing is ours. Beautiful flowers in our dwelling house all winter, made a possibility by our steam heat. If steam heat does have its unpleasant feature, we forgive and forget it all, when we realize that no place is too cool for the growth of some plant. The best part of it all is the interest and care given them by some of the elderly people, who intend to live in the beautiful Now, ignoring the custom of frequent comparison between Now and Then. Those who live in Tuen, will never see the advantages of Now. Says the writer, 'We need not be prophets, or apostles. The commonest life may be full of perfection. The duties of home are a discipline for the ministries of heaven. Amelia ,/. Calrer. Shakers, N. Y.. North Family. April, 1893. One of the sure harbingers of spring that we have longed for has arrived, viz., the song birds. How pleasant it is to hear their sweet notes in the early morning. The robins and bluebirds are among the best of our native song birds. This must be classic ground if we are to judge by the number of crows that are congregated here. The author of 'A Plea for Purity of Language' has conferred a great benefit upon fellow mortals in the compilation and publication of that article. Wish it could find a place in the columns of every paper in the land. We feel rebuked and admonished to have our language more in accordance with the testimony there given. The old adage that 'persons are known by the company they keep,' can also be 120 THE MANIFESTO. applied, that persons are known by the language they use. Our beloved Elder Alexander is at Sonyea, settling up unfinished business. Left the 13th of March, but we have not been without a shepherd. The more we study the subject, the more convinced we are that psychological influences are a strong factor, and wield an important influence in human lives. Ever since our admittance into the Society, we have realized to a greater extent than ever before, the influence of the Mother spirit. Being the earthly home of our founder, her strong personality has impressed itself upon the place. May we that are young drink deep of that maternal inspiration to the uplifting and consecrating of our lives to this holy faith. How blessed it is that Brethren and Sisters can dwell together in the bonds of pure love, where the elements of the old creation never enter. May we walk with a humble and pure heart so as to be worthy of that relationship. Hamilton DeGraw. Canaan, N. Y. April, 1893. We venture, this month, to cast in our mite in all humility of spirit, small though it seemeth. The beautiful spring-time is approaching; the time to prepare the soil and sow seed. This we are actively engaged in. But not material seed in earthly soil alone would we sow, we have sowing and planting of a superior kind to attend to. We have an interesting company of young people in our family, who form what they call 'Our Educational, Ethical, Floral Circle.' Educational, because it afford; opportunities for education. Ethical, because good manners and morals, culture and refinement are included. Floral, because each member is designated by a flower name symbolic of brightness, cheerfulness and innocence. The circle denote equality as all have equal opportunities, equal advantages and are equally compensated by making equal exertions. They hold meetings bi-weekly in which very interesting original articles are read, poems and dialogues recited, and one subject discussed verbally at each meeting. Music vocal and instrumental is added. One of the members is chosen to preside over the neeting whose duty it is to make out a written programme which she gives out at each meeting assigning a task suited to the age and ability of each one. We feel anxious to sow this garden with good seed, to have the rain of heaven (spiritual baptism) descend thereon and the bright rays of God's sunshine (eternal truth) beam upon it, that beautiful plants may be brought forth of knowledge, wisdom, righteousness and peace; blessed fruits of the heavenly kingdom, and we therefore humbly and earnestly solicit the prayers and good feelings of our gospel relation in our and their behalf. We can not afford to give all our time and attention to the maintenance of these physical bodies. We feel pressing upon us the responsibility of transmitting the testimony of this beautiful gospel to other souls that they with us may help to carry on the grand work of human progress and redemption. We fully indorse the ideas of Elder O. C. Hampton and are ready and willing to curtail our wants to our necessities and thereby gain the much desired time for mental and spiritual development; but do not as yet see clearly how matters can be changed and satisfactorily adjusted, but hope the good time is not far off. Emily Offord.
