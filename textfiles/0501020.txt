A man diseased in body... A man diseased in body can have little joy of his wealth, be it ever so muc h.. A golden crown cannot cure the headache nor a velvet slipper give ease to the gout, nor a purple robe fray away a burning fever. A sick man is alike sick, wheresoever you lay him â€” on a bed of gold or on a pad of straw ; with a silk quilt or a sorry rag on him. So no more can riches, gold and silver, land and living, had a man much more than ever any man had, minister unto him much joy ; yea, or any true or sound joy at all, where the mind is distract and discontent.
