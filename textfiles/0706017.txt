Time's Lesson Time to me this truth hath taught, 'Tis a truth that's worth revealing; More offend from want of thought,^ Than from any want of feeling. If advice we would convey, There's a time we should convey it; If we've but a word to say, There's a time in which to say it! Many a beauteous flower decays, Though we tend it e'er so much : Something secret on it preys, Which no human aid can touch. So, in many a loving breast, Lies some canker-grief concealed, That, if touch'd is more oppressed, Left unto itselfâ€”is healed. Oft, unknowingly, the tongue Touches on a chord so aching, That a word, or accent wrong, Pains the heart almost to breaking. Many a tear of wounded pride, Many a fault of human blindness, Had been soothed, or turn'd aside, By a quiet voice of kindness !
