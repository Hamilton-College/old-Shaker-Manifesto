A Word to Grumblers The Dansville (Ky.) Record says: 'Don't be a grumbler. Some people, old and young, contrive to get hold of the prickly side of everything; to run against all the sharp corners, and to find out all the disagreeable things. Half the strength spent in growling would often set things right. You may as well make up your mind that no one ever found the world quite as he would like it; but you are to take your share of the trouble, and bear it bravely. You will be very sure to have burdens laid upon you that belong to other people, unless you are a shh'k yourself; but don't grumble. If the work needs doing, never mind about the other one who ought to have done it and didn't. Those workers who fill up the gaps and smooth away the rough spots, and finish up the job the others leave undone, they are the true peace-makers, and worth a whole regiment of growlers.'
