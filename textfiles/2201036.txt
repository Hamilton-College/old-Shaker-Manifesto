[Contributed by Harriet Shepard.] A GENTLE GUIDE A heart by Jesus gentle made and meek, Has power to rule his people few and weak, Won all the world by true love's gentle might, By words said tenderly, and deeds of light; A gentle voice makes obedience sweet. . A happy captive, all his actions prove The power there is in gentleness and love. . . 'Love one another,' try the gentle way; Think not rough words and savage blows pre'Tis not the waterspout, the raging hail, [vail The thunder's bellow, nor the lightning's sheen 'Tis the soft shower that makes the valley green, When thou art tempted roughly to respond To him who hates thee, choose some phrases fond, And breathe them out in accents kind and low So shalt thou find a friend in him who was your foe.
