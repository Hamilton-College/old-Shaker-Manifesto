FROM WESLEY'S WRITINGS [Contributed by Sarah S. Woods.] A LLOW me the liberty of conscience. Allow me the right of private -LJL judgment. Allow me to use the expression just as often as I judge it preferable to any other expression and be not angry with me if I can not judge it proper to use any one expression every two minutes. You ma}7, if you please, but do not condemn me because I do not. Do not, for this, represent me as a Papist, or 'an enemy to the righteousness of Christ.' Bear with me as I do you; else how shall we 'fulfill the law of Christ?' Do not make tragical outcries as though I were subverting the very foundation of Christianity. Whoever does this, does me much wrong ; the Lord lay it not to his charge! I lay, and have done for many years, the very same foundation with you. And indeed, 'othei foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, even Jesus Christ.' I build inward and outward holiness thereon, as you do even by faith. Do not, therefore, suffer any distaste, or unkindness, no, nor any shyness or coldness of your heart. If there were a difference of opinion, where is our religion if we can not think and let think? What hinders but you may forgive me as easily as I may forgive you? How much more, when tliere is only a difference of expression ! Nay, hardly so much as that! All the dispute being only whether a particular mode of expression shall be used more or less frequently. Surely we must earnestly desire to contend with one another before we can make this a bone of contention. Oh, let us not any more, for such very trifles as these, give our common enemies room to blaspheme. Rather let us at length cut off occasion from them that seek occasion! Let us at length—oh, why was it not done before?—join hearts and hands in the service of our great Master. — John Wesley
