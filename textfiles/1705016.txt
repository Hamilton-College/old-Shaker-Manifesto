A statement having reference to the use of Alcoholic drink... [A Statement having reference to the use of Alcoholic drink, made by Eliab Harlow and Garret K. Lawrence of New Lebanon, Sept. 15, 1828. These physicians were good advocates for the temperance cause, even at this early date. Ed.] '' We use alcohol in tinctures and syrups when we think it necessary and in no other case whatever, unless the stimulus of ardent spirits is indispensable. We find that medicine without spirits is far more efficacious, than when given in combination with it, in the majority of stomach complaints. In cases where alkalies, such as Soda or Salts of Tartar are indicated, we add these to syrups which preserves them from souring without the addition of spirits. No definite rule can be given, but it is our firm purpose never to make a free use of alcohol under the cloak of medicines. '
