THE TEMPERANCE CAUSE May God bless the woman's righteous war between rum and reform, and bring forth victory by laying low earth's deadliest enemies — intoxicating liquor and lust! Like fiery demons — red dragons — they enter many peaceful home-circles to despoil and lay waste ; breeding therein a writhing, wretched mass of wild scorpions, to corrode, poison and bring to the very death, all hope of peace and prosperity. Thereby many noble forms are leveled to the dust, no more to rise, but are shrouded in shame — covered with a pall of black despair. Again, God bless the women crusaders who have engaged in the temperance cause. That work is committed to their trust. Love and Prayer are the means — the spiritual weapons — by which they must work and win. May they produce mighty results in the glorious reform so much needed. Ah! woman, worthy worker! Every one who is struggling against intemperance, and for emancipation from the slavery of sin, is worthy. God is your Leader, and we have faith that He will give you the victory. The Shaker Sisterhood are with you in spirit, and reach forth the hand of fellowship to all who are conscientiously engaged in the work, regardless of station, wealth, color, or sect; and with you we uplift our voices in prayer, that God will speed the good time coming when truth and righteousness shall reign throughout the whole earth; when peace shall nil the land with joy and gladness, and mortals dwell together in unity as sons and daughters of the New Creation of God — blest by Angels of light and love — children of one heavenly Parentage. Once more we say, God bless the workers in the Temperance cause, and speed the glorious end.
