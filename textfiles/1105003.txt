CALL OF THE SPIRIT OTIS SAWYER Let me treasure joys eternal, Let me drink of waters pure ; Let my love in God be boundless, Build upon foundations sure. More in earnest, be devoted, Consecrated heart and soul, Ev'ry moment rilled with breathing, That God's power may through me roll. Never period more momentous,— Louder ne'er the spirits' call — Lo a voice is heard from heaven: ' Zion rise both great and small, Shake yourselves from sloth and slumber, Shake from selfishness and pride ; Talents which the Lord has given, No more in a napkin hide. 'Let the self-exalted spirit Pall before the throne of God ; Let the doubting, double minded, Cleanse their hands, and with God's word THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 101 Cut asunder flesh and spirit, That a piercing light of truth May reveal their false position, And in honesty come forth. ' Fleeting, fading, evanescent, Are the alluring scenes of time ; Carnal joys in pangs resulting, Sink the soul in sin and crime. 0, for strength to lift the fallen— O, for balm to heal each wound— O, for faith by which to waken, That they hear the gospel sound. Feigned your love to God in heaven, If you fail the least to love, Of your hrothers or your sisters, With a pure angelic love. O, let earnest prayers be offered, That conviction, like a wave, May roll on and touch each conscience, Sure to quicken, strong to save. West Gloucester, Me.
