RESIST NOT EVIL. Hamilton De Graw. To the true follower of Christ this saying is fraught with deep meaning. It not only implies the mere passively submitting to wrong; but also to return good for evil. To suffer wrong rather than do wrong in itself is not enough. The practical Christian should also be philosophical, reasoning from cause to effect; then he would see that resisting evil with evil only increases the difficulty to be overcome ; and that two wrongs will not make one right. He should evince a spirit of aggressiveness if the word may be used in this sense, and whenever opportunity offers and also to seek opportunities for doing good. How many national and individual disputes might have been settled amiably and the principle of love and good will toward man practically illustrated if both contending parties had been anxious to arrive at the truth, and willing to view the other side as impartially as they were determined to vindicate their own. The old adage that one cannot quarrel alone was brought to my mind while conversing with an advocate of war as a means of settling national disputes. He asked this question in referring to our late (un) civil war, 'What would have become of our country if the North had maintained the position that you Shakers do, and refused to rise in arms to save our countrvfrom dismemberment?' I replied firstly, that if the contending parties had been actuated by Christian principles, the causes that led to the war would not have existed. And secondly, that as one party cannot quarrel alone, and the North had refused to resort to war, peaceful means would have been found to remove the cause of contention, and the sacrifice of human beings to the God of War, and the untold misery and suffering entailed upon the survivors would have been avoided. This style of reasoning may seem foolish to the soul under the influence of the lower law, but to those that are striving to obey the higher law, and are earnestly praying and laboring for the fulfillment of that heavenly condition, 'ï¿½Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is done in Heaven,' cannot but look with sorrow upon the wealth and inventive power of the human mind that is used in developing weapons of destruction. When, ' Were half the power that nils the world with terror, Were half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts, Given to redeem the human mind from error; There were no need of arsenals or forts.
