Keeping the Tongue Keeping the Tongue, Keep it from unkindness: Words are sometimes wounds. Speech is unkind sometime. when there is no unkindness in the heart so much the worse that needless wounds are inflicted-so much the wane that uninte national pain is caused. Keep it from falsehood: It is easy to give a false coloring, to so make a statement that it may convey a different meanir.g from, the truth, while yet there is the appearance ot truth, that we need to be on our guard. Then are many who would shrink from telling a lie, yet who suffer themselves in such inaccurate exaggerated or one-sided statements, that they really come under the condemnation of those, whose' lying lips are an abornination unto the Lord.' Keep it from slander: The good reputation of others should be dear to us. Sin should not be suffered to go unrebuked; but this should be according to the scripture method: 'Go and tell him of his fault twixt thee and him alone.' What is too often considered as harmless gossip, runs dangerously near, if it does not pass the confines of slander. A reputation is too sacred to be made a plaything of, even if the intent be not malicious. (Waverly.)
