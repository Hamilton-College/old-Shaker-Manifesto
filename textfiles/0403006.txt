COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE Something like forty years ago, when the Shaker Community at Union Village, Ohio, was full of people, and, in the zenith of its prosperity, Jason and Daniel, Prophets, from Canada, made a visit there. The Prophets had hospitable reception, and were in ecstacies of delight — for a season. But the spirit of sadness came over Daniel. He seemed caught up, as were Prophets of old. Looking thro' the Prophetic telescope, he exclaimed, ' They are going ! —¦ They are going!! — 'Twould seem they'd all go But they'll not. There'll be some left.' For a time, animation seemed suspended. A new scene burst upon his vision. He arose clapping his hands, he exclaimed —' They come! — From the East, and the West, and the North, and the South !! 'Twould seem the whole world would come.' The Prophets were in a second transport of joy, largely exceeding the first.
