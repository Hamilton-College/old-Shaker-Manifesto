Prepared Glue In half a pint of water in a wide-mouthed bottle put eight ounces of best glue, place the bottle in water, and heat until the glue is dissolved. Then stir in slowly two and a half ounces of strong nitric acid. Cork tightly. Glue thus prepared is always ready for use, and may be applied to mending furniture, broken vessels, and other articles not exposed to water.
