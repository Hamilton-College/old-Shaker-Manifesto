West Pittsfield, Mass. Feb. 1897. Little February, altho the shortest of the Year's children, should not be slighted we think, for great size does not always increase value, nor length of time insure happiness, and does she not bring to us some of the brightest, merriest days? During her stay she extends many invitations to those who delight in sleigh-riding and her merry bells are heard tinkling merrily on the air. We gaze on the newly fallen snow, after a night of busy work by the snow fairies, and we think how like it is to the lives of true Christians, whose kindly deeds, falling as quietly as the snow-flakes, cover all around them with brightness, making the dark places light and changing the dreary mountains to immense mounds of beauty brightening all with which they come in contact and proving true, that the steepest difficulties, once surmounted and beautified, become the greatest blessings. Eldress Marion from Canaan, called here with her four little girls for a few hours' enjoyment, and we were glad to feel her genial, motherly presence. Last week huge cakes of clear, crystal ice, were conveyed from nature's refrigerator, up among the hills to a more permanent one, in the valley. It was of excellent quality, being about fourteen inches thick, and plentiful in quantity, giving about two hundred tons. La Grippe, of past renown, has been trying to renew old acquaintances, and form new ones, in our family, and, like the 'Spider and the Fly,' famous in rhyme, if not reality, many have fallen victim to his endearments and become entrapt, much to their sorrow, but none have become so closely wound but that exit was possible. Brother Ira, we think has taken a start on the road to recovery, and tho the progress is slow, we trust it is sure. Anxious friends are for furnishing this road with resting places, and smoothing and levelling as much as possible. Yet withal it is a weary journey, and we look to our Guide who we know is 'able to keep us from falling.' Fidelia Estabrook.
