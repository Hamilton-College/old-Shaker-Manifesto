Ayer, Mass. Dec. 1891. Deae Editor ;—It has been said, that a hero is one who in an emergency would do that which would be a shame for him not to do. Doing duty at any cost, is heroism. In judging of the acts of our friends let us accord to them the meed of true heroism, if faithful in duty. 'Hands at work and heart to God,' was the testimony of Mother Ann. This shows the necessity of gaining a gift for manual labor. 'Conviction, were it never so excellent, is worthless until it converts itself into conduct.'—Carlyle. Let each one improve the talent with which God has blest us. One faithfully improved is more acceptable than five neglected. In the days of Israel, all were not hewers of wood and drawers of water, each had a place to fill to make God's temple complete. Home duties are being done as fast as possible, and we are making preparation for winter. Thanksgiving afternoon was spent in adjusting the premises about home. A. D. B.
