When once a waterproof is... When once a waterproof is put on to defend the body from wet, it should on no account be taken off until the wearer has not only taken shelter, but is in a position to change his clothes. What a covering of oiled silk does for a wet rag in surgery- - namely, convert it into a poultice- -the waterproof does for the clothes ot its wearer. The insensible perspiration which finds a way of escape througli ordinary clothing is kept in by the waterproof, and the clothes are saturated with moisture. A verf few minutes will suffice to render the underclothing 'damp' under a waterproof, particularly if either the wearer perspires freely or the weather be what is called ' muggy ' as well as wet. When, therefore, the wearer of a waterproof takes off that article of clothing because it has ceased to rain, he is in the position of a person who has damp clothes on and, if he sits in the saddle, or walks home, or rides in an open trap, he is more likely to take cold than if he had not used the waterproof at all. If, therefore a waterproof is once put on, it should on no acconnt be removed until the clothes can be changed or dried by a fire without reduction of bodily temperature. - - Health and Home.
