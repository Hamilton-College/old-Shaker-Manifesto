BEACHING THE MASSES. DANIEL FRAZER. Mother Ann Lee and her followers reached the masses, by going to them where they lived in their fallen state and condition. Tfrey used the gospel net of the mortifying Gospel of Christ with which to fish for sinners, and none could* escape, great or small. They turned the sinner completely inside out to himself, showed him the unreasonable and foolish opposition of his proud fallen nature to the saving gospel of the Son of God. They taught them to bring their deeds to the light by a full confession, and repentance. They taught them to right every wrong, pay their honest debts, and make the best restitution in their power. They taught them to take up a full cross against the morbid and evil propensities of a fallen and corrupt nature, honestly, and with full purpose of heart, and in naming the name of Christ to depart from all iniquity in thought, word, and deer], and then they would know for themselves that this Faith did overcome the world within and without, and was a present salvation in a loving obedience to the same. They taught that religion of the heart meant something, it was allegiance to God and His Christ, with implicit faith in the same. His Wisdom, His Grace, His Power was sufficient to regenerate, to resurrect into newness of life by putting off the old man with his deeds, and by putting on the new spiritual man even Christ, and by so doing we would become New Creatures. Without a doubt, for God and His Christ with the Holy Angels with Believers who are just men and witnesses of this Covenant of Grace and security for its saving power. 'As far as sin hath reigned And souls have been enslaved; As far as they've awakened And would be truly saved, As far as they're convicted, To feel the loss of man, So far shall be esteemed The name of Mother Ann.
