Charity is indeed a heaven sent messenger... Charity is indeed a heaven sent messenger; she goeth forth as an angel with consolation on her tongue, love in her heart, pity in her eyes and relief in her hands; she inclines her ear to the suffering and the poor; she seeketh out distress, nor ceases from morning to evening her mission among the homes of the sorrowing; she heeds not the scorn of the proud, the shrinking of the fearful, the eyes of the inquisitive, nor rain, nor wind, nor the bitter frost, but keeps on, and her way is compassed about with gladness. The hungry, the ill-clad, the sick and despairing rejoice at her approach. She shuns ostentation; she has no set time for her labors, but worketh always for want, suffering and grief are ever in her path. She pities the afflicted and is ever mindful of what she owes herself in her duty to others ; her motto,'Love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself. Seneca.
