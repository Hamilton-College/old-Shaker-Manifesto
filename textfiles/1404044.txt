Kind Words for the Year 1883. I think the Manifesto... Alfred, Me. Oct. 31, 1883. I think the Manifesto is even better this year than last. John B. Vance. We are well pleased with the Manifesto... Sonyea, N. Y. Nov. 1883. We are well pleased with the Manifesto, and hail its coming with delight. The articles are pleasing and instructive. The letters from the little folks are very interesting. Articles in regard to our health claim our attention. You have our best prayers, that peace and prosperity may attend you. Geneveve De Graw. I am richly rewarded in perusing the contents... Waupaca, Wis. Dec. 1883. I am richly rewarded in perusing the contents of the Manifesto. I look eagerly for it each month, and when I have finished reading it, I wish there was still more to read. Its influence is ennobling, and it leads the mind into the path of purity and deep piety, which brings the reward of peace. Harriet N. Miles.
