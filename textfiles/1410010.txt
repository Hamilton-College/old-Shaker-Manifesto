Esteemed friend: Your interesting letter of... Mt. Lebanon, March 1884. W. Baker, Sen'r, Otago, New Zealand; Esteemed Friend :�Your interesting letter of 8th January is received. It is good news from a far country. To learn that in that far oft land of abundance in earthly things, there is at least one who hungers after knowledge of an order so unpopular as Shakerism is really good news. I shall proceed to give you answers to your several questions, in the order you have put them, witnout re writing them. Some years ago, I had a correspondent, John Finlay, in Balerat Australia, to whom I sent a great deal of reading matter. He was a school master. He died. He did intend to come to America. In England I held many meetings, the most important was in St. George's Hall. Am glad you have that lecture. Have you seen Hepworth Dixon's 'New America?' If not, you had better read it. That would give you ' how and from what classes of society our societies are kept up ;' also, how new societies originate, the material that composes them. Religious revivals are the preparatory processes. By religion we mean all forms of truth, from naturalism to Shakerism. Believing that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and that no good thing will God withhold from those who truly love and serve him. There are no better ages for new comers than from twenty-one upwards. It is easy for young men and women to become Shakers. At that age they know something of the world, yet have not used up their life energies. Young men and women are strong to overcome the world, to bear the burdens of society. They are the first guests called to the marriage supper. The second class, from the streets of the city, are widows and orphans. The third class, compelled, by necessity, from the highways of travel and the by-ways of sin, come for a home and to be saved from the wickedness they have fallen into. Many of them are thus called arm few of them are chosen. Only a small proportion remain permanent members. But the labor upon them is not lost. Good will come of it. Having once had a taste of community life among the Shakers, they never forget it, but either do, or will, in or out of the body, re-enter the order to go no more out forever. They arc our loudest preacher because the world will believe what they say. I speak now of the honest and sincere, not of reprobates�violaters of their own consciences�who defile the flesh, speaking evil to cover their own wickedness. All real Shakers do as did Jesus and His Apostles�make themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. They are not made eunuchs of men. That only is circumcision that is of the heart and of the spirit of God. It leads men and women not to look at each other with lustings. About doctors, etc., you have heard the Spanish proverb, 'Every man is a fool or a physician.' The Law of Moses was of God. It saved its subjects from the diseases of the Egyptians. ' The Lord your God shall take all sickness away from the midst of you, ' was the promise. Should not the Gospel retain all the good of the Law, which was only a school-master to bring or prepare souls for the Gospel ? ' No man cometh to me except the Father prepare him. ' As yet we are only in the first of seven cycles that will develop Shakerism, the Gospel. When a people are prepared for a religious community, they usually have properly enough to begin with and they soon create more. .vhakers all labor and nothing is lost by idleness, waste nor sensual pleasures. Godliness is profitable for all things, the world that now is and the world that is to come. It creates Heaven upon earth, and supplies all normal wants. About a second visit to England I think co-operation, infidelity to a false church, temperance, physiological reforms and many other forms of truth have well-nigh prepared a people for our order. The rate of mortality of the Quakers in England is about eight years beyond the mass of the population, as near as I can come at it. The rate of mortality among the (Shakers is about tea years. It should be twenty five when the system is fully proved. I have sent a letter by Vincent; also a paper published in the Tribune, our leading paper. I will send other things as I get time, the autobiography for one. We have volumes of the Shaker and Shakeress that I will send to libraries if they will pay postage and have them bound. Weather�We are in the midst of winter. Good sleighing. Do you have snow and ice ? What have you done with the cannibals? I always think of maneating in connection with JS'ew Zealand, that they eat their missionaries. Is it any greater crime for Christians to eat one another than it is for them to shoot one another? Would they do either it they did not violate the command, 'Thou shalt not kill ? ' I send my love to all who believe in doing right, until there be no cross in it, and that sin consists in wrong-doing, in unrighteousness. Your friend, F. W. Evans.
