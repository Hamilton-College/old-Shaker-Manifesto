THE CARE OF CHILDREN'S TEETH. The care of the teeth can not be begun too early. If a child loses those of the first set prematurely the jaw contracts, there being nothing to prevent it from so doing; the second teeth have not space to stand properly and are crowded. Particles of food lodging between the teeth cause them to decay early. It is a wise precaution to teach a child to pass a thread of silk or dental floss between the teeth after eating, as well as to brush them regularly. Salt and water is a good antiseptic, and answers for a dentifrice as many more elaborate and more expensive preparations. Ladies' Home Journal.
