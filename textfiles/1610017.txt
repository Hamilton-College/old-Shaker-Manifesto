THE RELIGIOUS ELEMENT. That religion belongs to men and that it belongs to them while they are upon the earth is generally accepted ; but from our present standpoint, it would seem that it had been our misfortune to live upon the earth in the prophetic 'last days.' There have been Edenic days when men could hear the voice of God, and days when He would direct all their duties both official and domestic. Days when lie could send his word to man through the mouth of a prophet, and days, even, when the Son of God came among men and wrought the most wonderful work that was ever placed on record. But alas, the brightness of those days have all passed away, and only the story of them is left, over which we may find a ray of faint and sweet consolation. If we are to believe the voice of Christendom, God no longer walks and talks with men.�He no longer has the need of a class of prophets as it is unnecessary to make known any farther his mind and will to the race of man. In the 'last days' perilous times will come. The perilous times have already reached us and we are told that wickedness walks abroad at noonday, and infidelity is largely among the people. Men are choosing darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil. They are willing to crucify the son of God afresh and put him to open shame. The Bible is set aside to become a common book, the Sabbath is desecrated, and the rel'gious observances passed by very carelessly. ' Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, proud, and blasphemers.' And even these times have really crossed the threshold and entered our dwellings, and have made captives in our cities and villages. To a great many persons this seems to be the present state of the world, and with but little chance for improvement. If any thing is done for the salvation of the world, be it much or little, a spirit power independent of mau must do it. But our calling has been as laborers in the vineyard of God, to work faithfully and diligently in seeking and saving that which was lost. Our duty is first to cleanse our hands and purify our hearts from all unrighteousness and then, look up ! The angels of God are above us, and ready to minister to us the heavenly gifts. 'Preach the word,' and believe what we preach. Ask and we shall receive, but be sure and ask aright, lest our prayers be consumed on our own selfishness. Have we not read the story of patient Job, and shall we have less confidence in the spirit of God than an Arab priest who lived some three thouTERMS. sand years ago ? Through all his afflictions, through all his trials, through all his losses he maintained an unflinching consistent reliance in the belief that an over-ruling Providence could help and sustain him, and in this he was not disappointed. If we can believe that a spirit ministration, has in an early or in a more recent age been of any benefit to mankind in aiding them to bear the cross, or to win souls from the paths of unrighteousness, shall we whine in our unbelief or indifference and make the work of God of less value in this enlightened age? Men are no less anxious for a moral education, no less interested in the blessings of a spiritual and divine ministration than they have been at a former date. No less willing to make sacrifices for the good of humanity by taking upon themselves the work of the good Samaritan. If any thing has arisen in the pathway that leads to God, to prevent a success in righteousness and peace, that will equal or transcend that which has been in the past, it must be in the workmen who may be consulting their own pleasure and self-interest, rather than the more vital interest of harvesting souls from the world. A neglected vineyard may become overrun with noxious weeds, and a neglected residence soon gives unmistakable evidence of dilapidation. If they are to be maintained as worthy of a close and extended inspection, they will require the aid of much hard work from willing and honest hearts, and if a higher aid is invoked as being more conducive to success, it will be remembered that, 'God helps those who help themselves. ' 'Would it not be well for us to sing with the friends who have gone on before us.� 'Thou church of God, awake, awake, For light beams from on high; From earth and dust thy garments shake, Thy glory's drawing nigh. ' It may require a powerful awakening and a powerful shaking to banish from the soul the elements of an earthly life, and to make it a suitable temple, for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Let us bear in mind that ' the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save ; neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear.'
