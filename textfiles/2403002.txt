HISTORY OF SOUTH UNION, KY. No. 5. IN 1817, President Monroe made a visit to New England, and while traveling through the state of New Hampshire, called at the Society in Enfield and was introduced to the family, by Father Job Bishop. President Monroe also made a visit to South Union on the 17th of June, 1819 and was accompanied by General Andrew Jackson and family. The new meeting-house was finished and the first service held on Sabbath, November 28, 1819. Several Brethren from Union Village and from Pleasant Hill were present, who had assisted in the work of the building. In 1828, the people of South Union, were strongly reminded of the story of the flood, as they had a term of forty days, in which it rained a large part of the time. Since the organization of the Society, all the cooking of the food had been done in the fire-place. To some persons, this seemed to be the best arrangement for the business, that possibly could be devised. But the cooking stove had been introduced into a great many families, having all the modern conveniences, and one of these was brought home for the use of the Sisters. From this date, the fire-place had less and less advocates, and finally was abandoned altogether. Not less than twelve valuable horses have been poisoned with strychnia. Several of our neighbors have also suffered in the same way and yet no clue can be obtained of the perpetrator. Although most of the rogues that we have mentioned, have been white, yet the colored men were not all strictly honest. Some one entered a building in the North family in 1832 and broke open the chest of one of the novitiate members and stole from it $260.00 in MARCH, 54 THE MANIFESTO. silver. Suspicion fell upon a negro and he was confined for several days, through hope of obtaining a confession. He was then given his freedom, but told to return the money by Sunday. Sunday came, but no negro nor any money. They took him up again and he concluded to confess. He escorted the Brethren to a small cave near Bowling Green, a distance of fourteen miles, and there unearthed $204.00 saying 1hat was all he had. So they took the money and let the negro go. After this, his master, who was a Shaker, sent his slave to the Iron Works in Tennessee, from which place there was little chance of escape. Some of the blacks who were at work at the North family, resolved themselves into a court and impaneled a jury of black men, to try a negro by the name of Tom for stealing a jackknife. The case went to a hearing and the jury found him guilty and ordered that he should have ten lashes, well laid on, and after that he should be treated to a supper, and his waiters should be three black gentlemen. Tom received the lashes, and then had his wounds washed. When supper was ready, the gentlemen were appointed to carry out their part of the seatence. They waited on Tom handsomely, and the Court and Jury were satisfied that all things were done in good, African style. The knife was restored, the law satisfied and Tom was again admitted to fellowship. The Believers at South Union were quite interested in the manufacture of silk handkerchiefs. They had ample accommodations for the raising of silk worms, and in 1832, in the month of June, the Sisters picked the first crop of cocoons for the season, and had one hundred and thirty-seven pounds. One pound would be eight hundred and five cocoons, making in all, 110,285 cocoons. Some remarks were found among the writings of J. R. Eads, referring to slave labor in 1835. The renunciation of the practice of hiring slave labor, generates new feelings. This, with the changes that have been made in our family arrangements, is calculated to awaken us from our quietness. In 1844, a negro, who seemed to be under a religious excitement, came into Elkton Co., and spoke in the street for two hours. Among other things, he said, .'I have been sent to proclaim, that the time of the end is near. I am not come in the name of Stephen, but in the name of the mighty God of Israel. You may not believe me, but you will yet be convinced. This government is a government of strife, confusion and gloom, but that which shall succeed, will be a government of universal emancipation.' In twenty years from this date, the above prophecy became true, when a universal proclamation was sent throughout the United States by President Lincoln. In July 1850, there was a discussion on the subject of lightning-rods and it resulted in putting the rods on the Trustees' Office, the meeting-house and on the family dwelling. None had ever been used up to this time, and whether these proved beneficial or otherwise, we have no record to inform us. THE MANIFESTO. 55 The cost was fifteen crntsa foot for the rod and one dollar each for the points. In June 1855, a disaffected class attempted to raise a company and by mob violence, drive the Shakers from South Union and then seize the property for their own use. An old resident of the County, a doctor by profession, had been riding about the country for some three weeks, striving to enlist the populace in the scheme, and agreeing with them to meet on the first of June, at the cross-roads, on the way to Russellville. The causes for this raid, or intended raid, are vnrious, but the principal cause is said to be the interference of one of Ihe Brethren to procure the freedom of some persons of color, illegally held in bondage by some of the party. Some friendly neighbors had the kindness to inform us of these unlawful proceedings. A meeting was appointed and the .friends of the Believers were notified to be present. Two lawyers volunteered their services on the side of the Shakers, and an able lawyer from Elkton was engaged to plead the case. The complainants then urged that the meeting be held at the residence of Dr. Ehea. The meeting was called to order by John Burnham, a merchant of Bowling Green. Our attorney then proposed to address the crowd. No, no, no, resounded through the air. They did not wish to waste time. It was then agreed to leave it to the crowd whether or not he should speak. A vote was taken and a large majority decided that he should speak. The lawyer then addressed the crowd, as law-abiding citizens, appealing to their sense of right and arguing a legal course as the proper one to pursue. If the Shakers had violated any law, let them be prosecuted;ï¿½but if they had not, those who disturbed the Shakers would be liable to indictment and prosecution. After several others had spoken, some for the Shakers and some for the complainants, lawyer Briston demanded a separation in order to discover who was in favor of legal proceedings and who was not. Accordingly, the separation was made, showing a large majority on the side of law and justice. The meeting then adjourned to some subsequent day, but to this date (1872) it has not convened.
