Woman as an Inventor .—It is mentioned, inter alia, that women obtain from the II. S. Government an average of about sixty patents yearly; seventy is the number for the year ending July, 1880. As might be expected, most of them relate to lightening women's work. Among them are a jar-lifter, a bagholder, a pillow-sham holder, a dress protector, two dust-pans, a washing machine, a fluting iron, a dress chart, a fish-boner, a sleeve adjuster, a lap-table, a sewing-machine treadle, a wash-basin, an iron-heater, sad irons, garnient-stiffener, a folding chair, a ward-robe bed, a window-cleaner, a napkin, a clothes-pin, a weather-strip, a churn, an invalids bed, a strainer, a milk-cooler, a sofabed, a dipper, a paper dish, and a plaiting device. In a recent patent law-suit, a woman (Helen M. McDonald) conducted her own case and won it, establishing her right to her skirt-protector, planting an injunction on a bold infringement, and utterly routing one of the most distinguished of the patent-law barristers.—Exchange.
