EDEN OF TO-DAY 1. Shall we wait for the morrow of promise, To brins; us the kingdom of life ? Shall we pause for the soul-thrilling future To prompt us to enter the strife? 2. Nay, we know that the germ of salvation Hath growth in the toil of today; While the vows for futurity's action, Sweep blossoms of vigor away. 3. We will reign o'er the errors prevailing, And stem the wild current of wrong, Tor the life giving now spend our labor, And still be advancing along. Shall we rove in the fancies that please us. And think through their guidance to win The virtue of immortal knowledge, That lifteth from darkness and sin? And we fail in the noblest of purpose, We're lost in the shades of the past, While thoughts of life's imperfect duties, The deepest of gloom o'er us cast. Thus prepared for the increasing glory, The spiritual Eden of light, We'll enter the courts of Redemption, In triumph o'er earth's darkest night.
