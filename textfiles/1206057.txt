Every man is a missionary Every man is a missionary now and forever, for good or for evil, whether he intern's or designs it or not. He may be a blot, radiating his dark influence outward to the very circumference of society; or he may be a blessing, spreading benedictions over the length and.breadth of the world; but a blank he cannot be. There are no moral blanks; there are no neutral characters. We are either the sower that sows and corrupts, or the light that splendidly illuminates, and the salt that silently operates ; but being dead or alive, every man speaks.-CM. Union.
