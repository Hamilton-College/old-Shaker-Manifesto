[Juvenile] Letter Box Enfield, Conn., 1885 Dear Children ;â€”Again you stand on the threshold of another New Year. Has the time given you by the Great Master been well spent? To thoughtful minds this question will come, bringing more than on? regret over some wasted opportunity, some willful neglect, or failure through carelessness or thoughtlessness. Alas! there are so many who, with good impulses, yet wanting in stability of purpose or action, make great resolutions for doing good, and often begin some worthy work, and then grow discouraged because of little obstacles, and lack the perseverance to go on through difficulties. The New year is a time to make good vows for future action. A good beginning is an essential element of success. Count each day a golden privilege. Profit by experience both bitter and sweet. Make the most of life and its possibilities for goodness. Improve the little opportunities for gaining happiness. Greater opportunities will not come byneglecting these. Perhaps the little duties, as they seem to you, are the most important things, in which you can be engaged. The Father knoweth. If you perform faithfully whatever you ought to do, neglecting no opportunities, trusting all to God, you will be doing the best you can, and you cannot go far astray. Have the courage to be true and virtuous, have the love and faith to be Christ-like, and may heaven bless you with a HapJ&gt;y New Year. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt
