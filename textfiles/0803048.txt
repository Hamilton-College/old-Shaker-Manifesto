Beyond the Veil : By P. B. Eandolph. Published by D. M. Bennett, 141 Eighth St. New York. A new arrival from the emerald soil, was once asked : 'What is a posthumous work?' He answered quickly: 'It is the work a man does after he is dead!' Here we have a work which is purported to have been done by its author since his death. It comes by his inspirations through two venerable ladies, and is| most elegantly compiled. If the truth of this volume could be as easily substantiated, as even we can vouch for its most beautiful diction, then it would be most well for every body to get a copy and read it. Whosoever does so, will suspend, every now and then, spell-bound. 74 THE SHAKER The Journal of Invention and Manufacturer : Henry Connett, Editor, copied most kindly, with beautiful, almost flattering comments, the entire article on 'Shaker Inventions,' for which we return thanks. It is only 25 cents a year and illustrated. Burke and Fraser, 37 Park Eow, New York. The Weekly Commercial Advertiser : Largest and cheapest newspaper published in New York city. It is full of good reading, and news of markets etc. only 1.00 per. year. Address H. J. Hastings Nassau and Fulton sts. New York.
