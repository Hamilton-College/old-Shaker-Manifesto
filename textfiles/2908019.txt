THE ABUTILON. By Martha J. Anderson. Hail, queen of the bells, the fairy bells, Whose bloom gives such delight, Thro' the summer days and wintry haze, And the close veiled hours of night. Thy chalices deep are filled with gold And crown each towering stem, Where emerald leaves rich tracery weaves Around thy diadem. Thy clustering buds each day increase, And blossoms fair unroll, Then withering fall to earth's dark pall Robbed of the flower-soul. Oh, the blushing rose and lily white May all our senses please, Their odorous breath they yield in death To the passing summer breeze. Not so with the bright Abutilon, When its flowers lose their hue, At their base is seen in the calyx green Clear drops of honey dew. Oh, lesson new for my heart to learn, 'Tis the secret of God's grace, Some sweet surprise life underlies Though we fill the humblest place. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
