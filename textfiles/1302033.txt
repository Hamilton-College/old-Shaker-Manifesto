VEGETABLE DIET. 'Gunshot and other wounds never heal as quick in flesh-eating nations as in vegetableeating nations. Flesh-eaters are especially subject to inflammatory diseases, particularly fevers and dysentery. Over-indulgence in animal food gives an unnatural life, leads to sensuality, sensuality brings on exhaustion, exhaustion demands stimulation, ending in sickness, insanity and death. A vegetable diet, based on physiological principles, with a sound mind in a sound body, may be considered an absolutely certain safeguard against fevers, bowel complaints, cholera, small-pox, and similar diseases. Abstinence from animal food, tobacco, snuff', alcoholic and fermented beverages is conducive to piety, moral goodness and long life.' J. H. Ruttley, M. D.
