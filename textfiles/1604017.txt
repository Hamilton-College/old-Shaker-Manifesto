BROADCAST THY SEED. Broadcast thy seed! Although some portion may be found To fall on uncongenial ground, Where sand, or shrub, or stone may stay Its coining into light of day; Or, when it comes, some pestilent air May make it droop and wither there� Be not discouraged; some will find Congenial soil and gentle wind, Kefreshing dew, and ripening shower, To bring it into beauteous flower; From flower to fruit, to glad thine eyes, And fill thy soul with sweet surprise. Do good, and God will bless thy deed� Broadcast thy seed ! Woman's Journal.
