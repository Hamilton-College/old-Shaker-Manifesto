[The following interesting, social and theological letter, is from the pen of our beloved brother, Elder William Leonard, of blessed memory, and will no doubt give pleasure to many of our readers. Ed.] South Groton, Mass. Dear Br. James G. Russell ;�I have not forgotten our agreement to exchange a few lines, and by no means have I forgotten my correspondent; so far from that, I think that there has not been a week pass since I was at your place, that I have not been favored with a tender recollection of yourself, the young Brethren and Sisters, and your more matured Brethren and Sisters. When this vision of the past flits across my recollection, I never fail to desire your prosperity. I discerned among the young, powers, which when developed and more perfected by experience, will enable them to do much good to themselves and others; and I have prayed that their growth might be steady and their prosperity certain. The Bible record of the past you say is not as reliable to you as nature's universal law. This is not to be wondered at, and I know not why it should be censured. If you were able to confide more in the whole chain of history, of God's past dealings with his covenant people, perhaps you could draw support to a greater degree from past inspiration, as well as from the laws of the universe ; thus the difference would be in your favor. Your faith in the promises and prophecies given in scripture is creditable to your candor and good understanding; as some say, 'to your head and your heart;' this reliance will be a strength to you in coming years. I do not marvel that you suppose the sacred record lays a foundation for divergent theories; the land, if religion divides much more, will be filled with theoretic creeds. There are millions who pour out gold like water to build up these broken fragments; Where light has not scattered its rays to teach men the whys and wherefores of seeming conflicting statements in the scriptures, these clashing creeds will exist to darken the spiritual horizon. As the Bible is in great measure a compilation of revelations given through different mediums, why should we be surprised to learn that there are discrepancies. If it has been so with us wh\ not so with other chosen witnesses. If well understood I think that there is nothing in the 8th. chapter of Heb. that has any bearing at all to conflict with the doctrine of mediatorship, but exactly the reverse. The first patriarchal covenant being broken in the starting family relation or kindreds of the earth, when the second was given to Moses to cross the race into nationality, it necessarily had to be defective in the extreme, to meet the depraved animal condition of man. This being so, Paul speaks of a more perfect, first Christian covenant given under Jesus, and predicts finally the more perfect, second covenant to be given in the last days. In this last period he promises 'Unto all who look for him he will appear the second time without sin unto salvation.' All these epochs show clearly the leading mediators with whom these covenants were made ; but the subject opens so wide a field for investigation, that it would be difficult to condense it in the contracted space of one, two or three letters. You ask, ' Is tribulation a necessary part of the Christian scheme?' My answer is, I think not. If you should ask me if it is a result of man's loss and the gospel travel, I should return a different answer. In nature entirely out of God's order, there is not a ' thus saith the Lord,' that impels or restrains him in generation ; and he desires none. All his antecedents were sinful, which leaves him in impenetrable darkness respecting God's generative law ; consequently man's nature is perverse. When called into the gospel, then the business before him is to travel out of a nature ' that never was subject to the law of God neither indeed can be.' Now, my friend, if any one can take such a nature and destroy it without eufferiDg, it must be acknowledged that he has made a greater discovery than to have brought out a perpetual motion. The candidate for salvation must bear the common cross laid upon all the household of faith and if any can do this without frequent mental anguish and sorrow I do not think that God or any good spirit would object to it. It seems that Jesus found no way to gain redemption on this system of self-denial made easy. Paul speaking of the spiritual travel of Jesus said, ' He offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared. Though he were a Son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.' Heb. v., 7, 8. It appears that we all have to tread the same wine-press. Still with you I do not thiuk that God created in man the necessity to bear and to suffer. Man was created upright in nature and had he so remained till as John saw 'a door was open in heaven' for him to pass through and travel from that state into the gospel state, I think we would have heard but little about his great sufferings. He certaiuly would have been a different being, consequently would have had a different travel. I have passed hastily over these pleasant and well meant queries to secure time, and space to notice one point in your letter at some length. Xou say, ' I am no candidate for theological distinction, no teacher, but simply a plain farmer with a desire for spiritual knowledge.' I doubt not you are well aware that the labors of the husbandman or any other hand labor practiced under our order can be worked up into one of the most important theological principles ever incorporated with the Christian life. It is generally thought that Mother Ann was the originator of hand labor for Christians, I think differently and iu raising such an inquiry we will endeavor to get up a plain, common sense conversation. HAND LABOR CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY. It is our privilege not only to inquire but to understand how every principle was introduced that we are called to practice. It has been said by our deepest ^thinkers and best theologists that Mother Ann introduced no principle that Jesus did not introduce before her. Evidently Jesus planted the germs or seed of every principle on which the New Creation is to be built and stand. Therefore it was his work to plant them on parth and it was left to Mother to bring them to perfection. Among the most important of these confessedly stands hand labor. Our inquiry will be, Did not Jesus and the Apostles introduce hand labor as a Christian principle into the primitive Church by practice and injunction. THE PARENTS OF JESUS WERE POOR WORKING PEOPLE. They had their life experiences evidently among the lowly ; they dwelt in Nazareth the most inferior district in Jewry. However upright, they exerted no great influence in society ; for when on a religious pilgrimage, they were compelled to find lodgings in a manger where the Redeemer was born and where the shepherds were sent to bow in simple worship to Jesus. Joseph being a working man knew well the privations of the needy. When Jesus was entering public life as an inspired teacher, a simple incident presents to us the occupation of his father. With power and authority beyond the Scribes he came out and declared his mission and immediately the inquiry went round, kWIs not this the carpenter's Son.' Matt, xiii., 55. JESUS LEARNS A TRADE. Dr. A. Clark says, 'Among the ancient Jews every father was bound to do four things for his son. 1st. To circumcise him. 2nd. To redeem him. 3rd. To teach him the law. 4th. To learn him a trade.' This last was founded on the following just maxim. 'He who teaches not his son to do some work, is as if he taught him robbery.' Then, this requirement was squared alike upon the rich and poor by the law of God. Joseph evidently taught Jesus the same occupation at which he toiled for his daily bread. After he had ended the affair at the temple with the Lawyers and Doctors and had been admonished for marking out his own course he passively returned from Jerusalem with his parents and came to Nazareth and was subject to them. Luke ii., 51. Then between the ages of twelve and thirty years Jesus perfected himself as a tradesman, in the Village where he was brought up, Luke iv., 16, for when he began his mission many were astonished at his wisdom or knowledge and said, 'Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary.' Mark vi., 3. And they were offended at him. They considered him of too low origin for a divine teacher, too unlearned a laboring man, hence they looked down upon him and set him at naught. How little thought Jesus and others when he was toiling through long hours in youthful life that the very hand labor he was performing he would eventually be called upon to establish as a cardinal principle in the Church to aid in the salvation of the human family. Yet such has been the fact in the first and second advent and will be till the last offer of redemption is made. THE HABITATION OF JESUS. John the Baptist met Jesus as a stranger (for he said, 'I knew him not,') and in the act of baptizing him John received the sign from the heavens which taught that he was the Christ. The day after his baptism, John stood in company with two of the disciples and directing their attention to Jesus, said, 'Behold the Lamb of God,' and the two disciples followed Jesus. Jesus turned and said to them; 'What seek ye?' They say unto him, 'Master where dwellest thou?' He evidently had a home, an abiding place of his own, a then present residence. He saith unto them, 'Come and see.' They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day, for it was the tenth hour. Johni., 37, 39. Jesus could entertain his friends the disciples whom he invited to his residence ; there he welcomed Nicodemus, who came to him by night, and no doubt others. He could provide for�thema day, and if so he could have kept them longer. He could say as said Peter, 'silver and gold have I none.' Then he must have supplied his humble residence by his own industry. From this item of history we may more than infer that the disciples first saw and began to study the equalizing principle at the humble home of Jesus. They saw it was founded on industry, prudence and Christ like liberality. John seems to refer to this early state of things when he says, 'That which was from the beginning, which we have heard and looked upon ; for the life was manifested and we have seen it.' 1 John i., 1, 2. Here seems to have been the starting ground of Christian community, the gathering at pentecost, the Church at Jerusalem and among the Gentiles was an outgrowth from this. Mother Ann was prepared by prophecy, and suitable provision was made for the coming of the Believers. This was one of her strong arguments to prove her mission. With the facts before us we may conclude with safety that Jesus did as much to prove his mission. At the habitation of Mother Ann, the Believers first studied Christian community and a universal brotherhood, while the present expanded state of our order, shows a far riper growth. Thus though ages roll between, with changes, overturns and the downfall of empires how beautifully succeeding degrees of inspiration bring out the same truths and their results corrected and improved by the Almighty Authors. THE APOSTLES WHEN CALLED WERE WORKING MEN. All the disciples, or learners, were working men withont doubt by design, instead of accident. We have no knowledge that any were agriculturists, but they were made up of fishermen, tax gatherers and perhaps other laboring men. As they were to practice hand labor as leaders in the Church, it was evidently desirable that all should have this qualification to start with. For we eaa. show positively that this important requisition was laid upon all who were called Apostles, after they commenced their Christian ministry, not excepting Paul who was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel.
