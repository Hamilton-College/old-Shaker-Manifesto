REVELATION CECELIA DEVYR 'Tie but the morning twilight now, The ancient shadows fainter grow, The light that rims yon summit's brow Will flood the soundless depths below. The dawn, advancing in its might, Reflects the work of which we dream ; We watch the sun's advancing light, Along the mountain flash and gleam, Where lightning writes upon the cloud, And thunder tones proclaim its doom. Though still doth ignorance enshroud And rob the earth of joy and bloom, We see the hilltop's gilded crown, While cliffs and woods are veiled in mists The fertile plain, the busy town, Give little sign that they exist. We see the gushing fountain rise, While sweeps the rayless tide along ; We hear the lark that thrills the skies, 'Ere other warblers wake to song. The glory falling from above, Upo,n the noble of our rdce ; The gift of God's o'erflowing love, The inspiration of His grace ; These are the source of each Reform That comes to dissipate the night; That comes to vivify and warm, To bring the truth and spread the light. Then speak, O worker, speak aloud! Let thunder-bolts of thought be hurled, And they will break the night-mare cloud That long has settled on the world. Flow out, O fountain heart, and bring A blessing to the low and poor ; Thou soul of inspiration, sing The gladness of the just and pure, Till every outpost, wall and dome, That sheltered wrong shall sink from sight And earth is one vast happy home, Where God has spread His perfect light. 0 then will Revelation glow Upon our hearts, without a shade, And, by the things external, show The things that are eternal made.
