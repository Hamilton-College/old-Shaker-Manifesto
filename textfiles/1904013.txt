TESTIMONY OF THANKFUL BARCE. When I was young, I was in great trouble of mind about my sinful state, and was much concerned to know how I should find peace with God ; for I often read in the scriptures that there was no peace for the wicked. While in these exercises of mind, one night, I saw a very admirable woman. As she advanced, I saw a very large flock of sheep following her. They appeared to be the most beautiful flock L ever saw, and were clothed with the cleanest and whitest wool that ever my eyes beheld. The woman advanced till she came to a large plaiu, where she halted; and I saw her bait the sheep with something that was in her hand ; to my view it resembled salt. The sheep all seemed to gather round her and eat. I did not hear a word spoken by the woman ; nor did I speak to her; but I viewed her very attentively, and wondered what it could mean : for the scene appeared very solemn. Tn the spring of 1780, I heard of a strange people living above Albany, who said they served God day and night, and did not commit sin. I thought if there was such a people on earth, they must be the people of God. I did not believe the professors of Christianity around me had this power: for they said they lived in sin, and I believed it; I and I knew I had not found any thing that saved me from sin. Under these considerations, I went to see these remarkable strangers ; for I was determined to see and know for myself what sort of people they were. When I arrived, Mother Ann met me at the door, took hold of my hand and led me into the house. Her first salutation to me was iu these words : 'Being a daughter of Zion, how earnest thou hither without a cap on thy head ?' She sat down ir a chair, and I took a seat by her side. Her eyes were shut, and it appeared that her sense was withdrawn from the things of time. She sung melodiously, and appeared very beautiful. Her countenance appeared bright and shining, like an angel of glory, and she seemed to be overshadowed with the glory of God. The graceful motion of her hands, the beautiful appearance of her countenance, and the heaveuly melody of her voice, made her seem like a glorious inhabitant of the heavenly world, singing praises to God. As I sat by the side of her, one of her hands, while in motion, frequently touched my arm ; and at every touch of her hand, I instantly felt the power of God run through my whole body. I then knew she possessed the power of God, and I saw that she was the very same woman I had seen in my night vision, several years before. Could I then dispute the work of God in this woman ? Nay, in no wise ; I could not but acknowledge God iu her ; for God was in her of a truth. Mother Ann and the Elders always maintained a strong testimony against all sin. They taught us to abstain from 'the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye aud the pride of life ;'�to take up our crosses against deceit and lies�agains all fraud, theft and intemperance� against wars and fightings, and every kind of evil. They taught us to con. fess and forsake our sins ; and if we had wronged or injured any of our fellow creatures, to go and make restitution to the full satisfaction of the iujured party, and thus fulfil the strict demands of the moral law ; and follow Christ in the regeneration, by a daily cross against the nature of evil. By becoming personally and intimately acquainted with them, I found their lives and conversation to correspond with their testimony. According to their teaching, I confessed my sins to God, and told these his faithful witnesses what I had done : for I fully believed that in the communion of saints, there was forgiveness of sins. By faithful obedience to what I was taught, I received the gifts of God, and found that power over my own sinful passions, that I was never able to find before, and which gave me peace and justification. I visited Mother Ann at different times, and in different places ; and I never saw anything in her or the Elders, as far as respected their Christian precepts and examples, but displayed a spirit of love and peace, gentleness and meekness, forbearance and long suffering. And though their testimony was sharp and powerful against the fallen nature of man ; yet they were kind and merciful to the humble and penitent soul that was convicted of sin, and sought the mercy of God. If I ever saw the image of Christ displayed, I saw it in Mother i Ann. I considered her a perfect pattern j of piety. When the wicked came to take Moth- j er Ann and the Elders to prison, I was ' present, and was an eye witness to the scene, and to us it was truly a mournful scene. She prayed earnestly that they might be able to endure with patience all that should come upon them. She often prayed for her persecutors, when they came to abuse her, in these words: 'Father, forgive them ; for they know not what they do.' I feel under no necessity of asking those who seldom or never saw Mother Ann, what kind of person she was; because I know for myself. I was with her and the Elders several weeks at Hancock and Richmond ; and was knowing to their being accused of swearing and blasphemy; but I saw none of these things among them. I there saw several mobs who came to take Mother ; and I knew they were under the influence of something which made them act very inhumanly. Had she been a lewd woman, as they said, they never would have persecuted her as they did. It was the purity and innocence of her life, and the pointed plainness of her testimony against the sins and abominations in which they lived, that excited their enmity against her, and caused them to revile and persecute her. I was with her, day and night, for weeks together; and I knew of her purity and innocence. I was with her at Ashfield, and saw the power of God among the people, through her ministration. I have known her to search out and expose sin and the secret thoughts of the heart, by the discerning power of God, and have seen sinners tremble before her heart-searchiug testimony. When she was at Nathan Goo^.rich's, in Hancock, I was there, and prepared food for her and the Elders, and took care of her room. I know of u cer- tainty that Christ did commence a second appearance in Mother Anr, 'without sin unto salvation.' And I am thankful to God that I have seen her and believed her testimony : for it has saved me from sin, aud still affords me daily peace aud consolation. , As every thing iu nature brings forth its own likeness, so the gospel has always produced good fruits�the fruits of righteousness and peace, honesty, justice and truth. And by these fruits I know it to be the gospel of Christ�the fountain of eternal life�a stream that is never dry ; for such it has proved to my soul; it refreshes, strengthens aud comforts me day and night. Many hundreds of souls have heard, received and obeyed Mother Ann's testimony, and confessed their sins, taken up their crosses and followed Christ in the regeneration ; and I know that all such souls can witness the truth of what I say. The people of God in ancient days, always had some one to guide and direct them in the way of righteousness ; and they still have a guide. Mother's ministry has ever been maintained by her successors, who have kept her testimony pure and uncorrupted; and in obedience to their counsel and instruction, we can still feel the blessing of God upon our labors. It is my indispensable duty to bear witness to the truth ; and I cannot be justified without it; for I know mankind have been greatly imposed upon by false reports. Our accusers say, the Elders have taken away our property, and we are kept iu bondage by them ; but I know this accusation to be false. We are all free thai are in Christ; we act according to our own faith, and we receive the reward of our own labors, both in things spiritual and temporal. The wicked accuse the people of God' of all manner of evil; and why is it so? It is evidently because these accusers have not found a gospel which can save them from sin : for if they had found such a gospel, and were subject to it, we should hear no more of these accusations. But as they live in all manner of wickedness themselves, they judge us out of their own wicked hearts. When I first heard of these strange people, I was asked what I thought of them. I replied that L was not able to judge ; that if the work they were in was of God, it would stand ; but if not, it would fall without any of my help. Many deprive themselves of a great blessing by speaking against this testimony : for I know by the revelation of God, that all souls that ever find salvation, must find it by obeying this gospel. This is my testimony, and 1 have written it in the fear of God, and can bear witness to it, in truth and soberness, before all my fellow creatures, in time and eternity. New Lebanon, 1827.
