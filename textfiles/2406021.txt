THE MONEY WE WASTE. [Contributed by Amelia J. Culver.] A Washington special to the Atlanta Journal recently quoted some internal revenue statistics showing that in spite of the hard times we have wasted enough money in the past year to make everybody in the country comfortable. The Americans, who were howling about the financial depression, spent in the past twelve months $609, 000, 000 for whiskey! The same crowd spent in that period $617,268,4(50 for beer! For cigars and tobacco they spent $275, 750,000! The grumblers and growlers who talked economy to their wives and children and prayed for the return of good times, managed to scrape up about ï¿½1,600,000,000 for their common drinks and their cigars, and what their wines and brandies cost we may imagine! This enormous sum, the correspondent says, is more than our entire volume of circulation. It is $27 per capita more than the present per capita circulation. It is 195 for each head of every family in the United States! This money would pay all the appropriations of a billion-dollar congress and leave enough to more than half pay the 146 THE MANIFESTO. expenses of another such congress. It would pay six times over for our annual cotton crop. It would pay the cost of a long foreign war. It would feed and clothe in a plain fashion every family in the union! We do not present these startling figures with the hope that they will bring about an economic revolution, but we believe that they can not fail to influence thousands of thoughtful readers and create a prejudice against extravagance and waste.. This is not a temperance editorial. It is simply a statement of facts which must open the eyes of men to the true explanation of most of the poverty and suffering now prevailing. The American liquor and tobacco bill would be frightful enough in a period of prosperity, but what shall we say of it in these hard times!
