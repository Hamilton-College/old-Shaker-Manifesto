EXAMPLE. We scatter seeds with careless hand, And dream we ne'er shall see them more; But for a thousand years Their fruit appears, In weeds that mar the land, Or healthful store. The deeds we do, the words we say, Into still air they seem to fleet; We count them ever past; In the dread of judgment they And we shall meet. I charge thee by the years gone by, For the love's sake of brethren dear, Keep, then, the one true way In work and play, Lest in that world their cry Of woe thou hear. John Keble
