The sugar harvest has commenced, and already several hundred trees have been tapped, and a specimen of nice sugar has been manufactured. While the Editor of the American Bee Journal, takes pleasure in recommending the use of honey for the cure of weak lungs and sore throats; who knows but that a little maple sugar or candy may be a twin panacea for these and many other ills. Indeed, I think it would be a rare case to find a throat so sore, that the possessor could not discuss the merits of either the honey or the candy. We advise all, to take the honey and the candy when they can get it. It is decidedly better than most of the quack nostrums that are flooding the market. A string of nice pickerel were on exhibition a few days since, the results of one day's work on a small pond; and it would be well to add the result of a hard day's work for three young men, who were obliged to cut the fishing holes through ice that was twenty inches thick. They say the work and the success were enjoyable.
