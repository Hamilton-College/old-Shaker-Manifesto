KIND WORDS. Beloved Elder Henry:--I wish to express my thankfullness... Sonyea, N. Y., Nov. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½I wi&gt;h to express, my thankfulness to you for the feast of good things that you have laid before the readers of the Manifesto in the November number. 'Editorial is full of food for thought, inspiring and uplifting towards the goal which we are all striving to attain. 'That peace which passes all understanding,' is a substance that is attainable and when it has taken full possession of the soul, the discordant elements of earth that are working such misery to the earthly man, pass by as the idle wind that we heed not. I believe it is an important duty that devolves upon each and every one according to their ability to sustain the ''Manifesto,' and by words of encouragement make the editorial labor one of love The swing of the pendulum to the other extreme, caused by the false teachings of blind leaders of the blind, which has given the materialistic torn? to the thought of the age is being remedied or restored to its proper equilibrium. The Macedonian cry has gone out from awakened souls, 'come and help us.' The forlorn hope of the advance guard of human progress have organized into an army with banners. The signs of the times are ominous of impending changes in the thought of the age. The Manifesto occupies an important place in the arena of spiritualistic journals and must be maintained. In kindest love I remain Your Brother, Hamilton DeGraw.
