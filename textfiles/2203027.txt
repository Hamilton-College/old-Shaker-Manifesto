Hamilton De Graw. Esteemed Friend:--As the Manifesto has come again... Washington, D. C. Dec. 1891. Hamilton De Graw. Esteemed Friend :As the Manifesto has come again laden with good things, and seeing your article, 'Looking beyond the Shadows,' I feel that I can not be silent nor let my pen rest any longer. I live in the same hope expressed by a good Brother when he says, 'But I live in hope and trust that Divine Providence will guide me aright and give me strength to do his will.' I have not seen this Brother but know his spirit language, and may God grant those petitions going up to his throne. I agree with Elder A. L. Work, that 'the world seems all right so long as we are content with her ways ; but after we get a glimpse of that higher, Christ-life, then the colrl .shoulder is turned to us and it seems we no more belong to her.' Thank God the messenger of good news, 'The Manifesto,' goes to the aid of those who are in sympathy with its work, and who hope in his own good time to be gathered together to that better partthe spiritual life and love, where God and Christ shall reign supreme in the soul. Greetings to the Sisters and to our friend A. L. Work, and to you my beloved Friend. If opportunity presents itself, I long to see you. God bless you and all the household. Yours in sympathy, J. G. Toepper.
