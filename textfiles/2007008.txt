'WRITE SOMETHING FOR ME.' Grace H. Bowers. Composed for, and read at the funeral of Sister Olive Walker. These are the words that seemed to sound in my ears when all else was hushed in the silence of night. Could I refuse, and thus wound a spirit I so deeply loved ? Her mortal lips were sealed in death ; but her soul, triumphing over physical pain, rejoiced in a glad release. For twenty years it has been my privilege to be associated with our dear Sister, and I fully appreciate the virtues and excellencies of her beautiful character. A strong bond of love and I friendship united us closely in spirit, and though the years of her earthly pilgrimage far outnumbered mine, still there has always existed a mutual feeling of sympathy, good-will and pleasant companionship. Perhaps it would not be amiss to mention a little circumstance that took place about eighteen years ago, as an, explanation of my especial regard for her. I was then a child, and my plastic mind readily 'eceived indelible impressions. There chanced to be quite a company of Sisters together, when some unpleasant occurrence served to agitate the feelings ; on the impulse of the moment she spoke hastily and unwisely. I took no notice of it as I was not especially concerned. Shortly after when I retired for the night, Sister Olive entered the room, and bending over me, whispered; 'My dear child, I have come to tell you how very wrong it was for me to speak as I did this evening: I condemn it, and ask your forgiveness for so doing. I would not set you a bad example, and will be more guarded in the future.' I cannot tell how many, many times that one act of self-condemnation has since recurred to my mind, always bringing with it a feeling of admiration and respect. Since that time I have always cherished a deep, undying love and affection for her; it also taught me a lesson for life, that my actions whether virtuous or evil�especially in the presence of children�had an influence either for good or harm, and I realized the responsibility resting upon me to guard well my words and ways, and strive always to impart the good that returns in blessing. Shall we wait until the shroud and pall remind us of their departure ere we eulogize our friends ? Commendation is sweet to the living, and spoken praise drops like a jewel in the heart's treasure-casket. All knew her but to love and cherish her self-sacrifice, devotion, patience, humility and purity of heart; we prized and extolled her active and expansive goodness of life, and knew that even in her trial and suffering, her consideration of others, curbed every selfish desire and needless wish. Two days before Sister Olive's demise I called to see her, and returned thanks for many kindnesses received, and spoke of the blessing her righteous example had been to me: It seemed like being in the presence of an angel. When I am called to put off the mortal, I shall ask no greater boon, than to be ushered into the great and glorious beyond with as rightful a recommend as our dear Sister has to-day. Surely blessing follows the righteous, and peace is their everlasting inheritance. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
