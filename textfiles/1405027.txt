[Contributed by George Severance,] THE BIGOT AND THE SHAKER. 'Salvation is of us' the bigot cried, 'Accept and live or perish in your pride ! Salvation is of us�we are the Church; Seek heaven here or else give up the search.' How many, Reverend Sir, are on your roll [pole? Of all earth's millions spread from pole to 'Why one in twenty thousand, less or more Is seeking heaven thro' ours the only door, ' If none are saved but you and all else d... .d, Then heaven runs no risk of being crammed; But of those few who form your congregation How many souls are certain of Salvation? 'Not one in five succeeding in his search Finds a new heart and joins the church; Which proves the innate depravity of man, Gainsay the past who can?'�'Art married? 'Yes, thank God ! I have a wife And ten dear children, blessings of my life,' 0 worse than brute ! slave of unhallow'dlust. Against such odds to raise up souls from dust Does not thy conscience smite thee thus to have given Eight souls to hell and only two to heaven? If human nature be indeed so base Why do you thus perpetuate the race? Either the doctrines taught by these are evil, Or thou art but a pander to the devil. Oh ! how can peace within .thy bosom dwell, Recruiting sergeant to the ranks of h..l? Go then, enlarge your scheme for man's salvation Or else in God's name cease your propagation.
