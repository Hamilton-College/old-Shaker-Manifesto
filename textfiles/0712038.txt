Some one, zealous in behalf of Shaker principles... Some one, zealous in behalf of Shaker principles, has been 'contending for the faith,' by writing letters to the Voice of the Angels, a Spiritual paper, published in Boston. Just how successful their logic was, we do not know ; but extracts in type speak very favorable, and perhaps the weakest portions were printed. But we must condemn the silly practice of sending anonymous communications. We have no means of knowing who wrote these letters, as care was taken to leave off' even the postal address! We esteem honor and propriety so highly among the brethren, that we are ashamed to own that they were indited in any of the Societies. We prefer to believe they were the work of an ex-Shaker. But, whoever it was, let your light shine over your own name. Do not engage in the disreputable practice of being ashamed of seeing your name attached to any defence of Christ and his words.
