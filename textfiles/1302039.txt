There are thousands of acres... There are thousands of acres of almost worthless rough, stony, and poor sandy lands in the Eastern and Middle States, which, if properly planted with forest trees, would in It few years become highly .valuable from their growth. Among those most certain at present to give the largest profit are the red' cedar, yellow locust, sugar maple, hickory and black walnut. The timber of this last is now the most valuable of all grown in Amer-: ica, as single large trees are, worth from $20 to over, $100 each, according to their size and facility of getting them to market. The maple is not only valuable for timber, but still more so for the, production of sugar. The black walnut and hickory yield excellent nuts as' well as timber, and on one sort of the latter we know they are grown with. shells as tender as the almond, and their meat is of the richest quality. These nuts sell at a high price.
