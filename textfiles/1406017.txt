RELIGION, FAITH AND BELIEF. OLIVER PRENTISS. In all deference to superiors, who have essayed, or may hereafter essay to give definitions, or draw lines of demarkation. I also would show my opinion, not dogmatically, but by way of casting in my mite. Religion, is the germ of Divinity in us. All there is of us worth talking about, latent it may be, you may call it the Soul, if you want to ; whichever you call it, it is the element, in our mal-:e up, which connects us with the great hereafter. Faith, is the Divine vlffiatus, vivifying the Latent Germ. Fanaticism, sometimes, usurps the throne of Faith, producing unhealthy action. Belief,�the result of education, of dictum, or of investigation. Sensible or otherwise, according to the progress of the age, and status of the individual. Theology,�a set of ideas, or dogmas, the concoction of would be master minds, a kind of substitute for living faith and practical Righteousness. Individuality,�Whether, in coming worlds, we retain our present individuality, or take other forms, is not, an open question. We modestly leave it an open question, for others, to solve for themselves, in their own way. The material of which we are composed beingunannihilable, we are bound to exist in some shape. Should we, in coming worlds, retain our present individuality, a life squared by living faith here, will be largely to our advantage there. Should we take new forms of individuality, that individually will be like the material elevated and refined, or otherwise, of which the new formation is composed. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
