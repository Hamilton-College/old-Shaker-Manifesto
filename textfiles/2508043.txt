Cosmopolitan 'O, will he paint me the way 1 want,' As bonny as a girlie, Or will he paint me an ugly tyke, And be dd to Mr. Xerli! But still and on and which ever it is, He is a canty Kerlie. The Lord protect the back and neck Of honest Mr. Nerli.'* This, one of the last verses ever written by Robert Louis Stevenson, is in reference to the portrait of himself, which is given to the public with his verse for the first time in the July Cosmopolitan. The lines might have come from the pen of Burns, and are inimitable in their way. The portrait was declared by Stevenson himself to be the best ever painted of him. In this same number of The Cosmopolitan Rudyard Kipling tells an Indian story, to which Remington adds charming illustrations; Mrs. Burton Harrison makes a serious study of New York society in 'The Myth of the Four Hundred,' and Kate Douglas Wiggin contributes a storjT of one of the most delightful of Welsh retreats. The Cosmopolitan was with this number reduced to ten cents per copy, and as a consequence, notwithstanding its large edition, it was 'out of print' on the third day of publication.
