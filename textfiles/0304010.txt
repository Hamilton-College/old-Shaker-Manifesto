He is truly a man who is in full enterprise... He is truly a man who is in full enterprise ; who is perpetually planning new works; who is constantly acquiring new thoughts ; who is all the time opening new chambers; who is every day furnishing the rooms of his mind with new pictures and new furniture ; who is incessantly spreading for himself a new table with noble aspirations and endeavors, as the sign of soul life. Every man who really lives is living by a generous use of the future. â€” Beecher.
