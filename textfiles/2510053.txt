The Journal of Hygeio-Therapy The Journal of Hygeio-Therapy for August has a beautiful article on Religion. The spiritual or religious life stands in advance of the intellectual or moral life, and is indeed the embodiment of all that is good or can be known as God. That such an article should be found in a medical journal, that has to interest itself in all manner of diseases, is evidence that the author's mind rises above the many ills that flesh is heir to and finds time to explore a region where religion and the spirit of God is better known. This subject can not but have a health giving influence and the reader is made better through this manifestation of life to the body and no less to the soul.
