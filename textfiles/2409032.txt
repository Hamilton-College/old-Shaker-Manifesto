PLUCK AND PRAYER. By Josephine Pollard. Thebe wan't any use o' fretting, And I told Obadiah so, For ef we couldn't hold on to things, We'd jest got to let 'em go. There were lots of folks that'd suffer Along with the rest of us, An' it didn't seem to be wuth our while To make such a dreffle fuss. To be sure, the barn was 'most empty, An' corn an' pertaters scarce, An' not much of anything plenty an' cheap But wateran' apple-sass. But then,as I told Obadiah It wan't any use to groan, For flesh and blood couldn't stan' it; and He was notliin' but skin an' bone. But, laws! ef you'd only heerd him, At any hour of the night, A prayin' out in that closet there, 'Twould have set you crazy quite. I patched the knees of those trousers With cloth that was noways thin, But it seemed as if the pieces wore out As fast as I set 'em in. To me he said mighty little Of the thorny way we trod, But at least a dozen times a day He talked it over with God. Down on his knees in that closet The most of his time was passed; For Obadiah knew how to pray Much better than how to fast. But I am that way contrary Than ef tilings don't go jest right, I feel like rollin' my sleeves up high An' gettin' ready to fight. An' the giants I slew that winter I a'n't going to talk about; An' I didn't even complain to God, Though I think that He found it out. With the point of a cambric needle I druv the wolf from the door, For I knew that we needn't starve to death Or be lazy because we were poor, An' Obadiah he wondered, An' kept me patchin' his knees, [out, An' thought it strange how the meal held An' stranger we didn't freeze. But I said to myself in whispers 'God knows where his gifts descends; An' 'tisn't always that faith gets down As far as the finger ends.' An' I would not have no one reckon My Obadiah a shirk; For some, you know, have the gift to pray And others the gift to work. ï¿½Selected.
