Cannon Farrar says... Cannon Farrak says, ' If Christianity is to hold her own, Christians must beware of stagnant doctrines and dead theologies. Prophetic were the words of John Eobinson to the Pilgrim Fathers : ' I am persuaded of the Lord that he hath more truth to break out of Ins Scriptures. ' Theology must learn to change her line voluntarily and by her insight, and not be forced to do so only when the strangling grasp of science or criticism is at her throat. And above all, America must show to the world the true ideal of national righteousness. You are, or soon will be, the greatest in strength, the most affluent in wealth, of all the nations of the world. Why? Mainly, I believe, because your fathers feared God. God has said, ' Him that honors me I will honor.' Will America dare to spurn the low degrees by which she did ascend? I believe she will be preserved from these perils by the memories of the dead and by the virtues of the living. I believe she will justify to humanity her majestic faith in man. I believe it is for these objects that God has given her the atmosphere and stainless azure above her head, and boundless territory beneath her feet, and rivers that plow her fertile fields, and double ocaans sweeping her illimitable shores.
