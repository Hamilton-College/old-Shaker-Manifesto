The design of God in placing the soul within a material body... The design of God in placing the soul within a material body was, doubtless, to secure for it a proper limitation. Both soul and body are endowed with matchless qualities. They are both God's creation. They are both God's possession. Both suffered the curse of sin; and both are redeemed by the life of the Lord Jesus, who came not to save the soul alone from death, but also to ransom the body.
