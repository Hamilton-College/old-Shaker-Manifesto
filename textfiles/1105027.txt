EFFECTIVE RETALIATION A Quaker had a quarrelsome neighbor, whose cow being suffered to go at large* often broke into the Quaker's well-cultivated garden. One morning, having driven the cow from his premises to her owner's house, he said to him : 'Friend T——, I have driven thy cow home once more, and if I find her in my garden again—' 'Suppose you do ?' his neighbor angrily exclaimed, 'what will you do?' 'Why,' said the Quaker, ' 'I'll drive her home to thee again, friend T-----.' The cow never again troubled the Quaker.
