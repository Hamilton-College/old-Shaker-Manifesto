ANCIENT LATIN ELEGY [From Prudentius, a Latin Christian poet, born in Spain, A. D. 348. Bentley called him ' the Homer and Virgil of the Christians.'] No more, no more in tears complain, Cease, mourners, cease your sorrow vain ; Give these dear pledges to the earth ; This death is but a second birth. What mean these sculptured marbles fair, O'er the cold clay reposing there ? Mute tokens of the faith we keep, He is not dead, but lies asleep. What though upon this silent brow No light of thought is beaming now ; It only rests a little hour, To waken with a nobler power. Returns the day when his dear form Shall kindle with the life-blood warm, And once again the glowing mind Visit the form it left behind. These senseless clods, so long that lay To the devouring grave a prey, Upward on eager wing shall soar, Following the souls they loved before. So from the dry seed blossoming, Joyous the blessed life shall spring; And gazing from the turf below, Its own full ripened fruitage know. Receive, O Earth ! this treasure blest, Hold it within thy loving breast; This dust of man, in death how fair, How noble, yield not to thy care. This was the saintly soul's abode, Built by Thy breath, eternal God ! And in this sacred dwelling place Christ sojourned once in truth and grace. Then guard thou well this holy trust Till, mindful of his clear loved dust, The risen Lord of life demands His own true image from thy hands. Onward the year of justice rolls, God's fulness for all yearning souls, When this dear form, thy charge no more O open grave ! thou shalt restore.
