St., N. Y. USES OF HOT WATER. Hot water is one of the best among simple remedies, says The Ladies' Home Journal. For instance, headache almost always yields to the simultaneous application of hot water to the feet and back of the neck. A towel folded several times, and dipped in hot water, and quickly wrung out and applied over the toothache or neuralgia, will generally afford prompt relief. A strip of flannel, or napkin folded lengthwise, and dipped in hot water and wrung out, and then applied round the neck of a child that has the croup, will sometimes give relief in ten minutes. Hot water taken freely half an hour before bedtime, is helpful in the case of constipation and has a most soothing effect upon the stomach. A goblet of hot water taken just after rising, before breakfast, has cured thousands of cases of indigestion, and no simple remedy is more widely recommended by physicians to dyspeptics.
