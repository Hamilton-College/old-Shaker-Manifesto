In Memory of ELDRESS MARY VANCE. By Margarette Bennett. Methinks the joy of the Angel band Is heightenedaye, renewed, For Mother is safe in the Summer Land, Has passed the mystic flood. We've often prayed, dear suffering one, This bitter cup might pass, That thou with us might longer dwell, As guide through righteousness And though thy voice be silent now, Thy willing hands at rest, Thy children should no murmur know, Since they through tliee are blest. All nay, for thou art still with us In sympathy and prayer, Thy spirit presence oft shall bless And bring us heaven near. By faith we see thee robed in white Upon thy head, a crown Encircled with celestial light Reflected from the throne: And hear thy promise to return In some glad, future day To take thy loyal children home, To live with tliee alway. Alfred, Me.
