The Shaker Manifesto, one of our New Hampshire publications, appears in magazine form on the opening number of the eighth volume. This is the official monthly publication of the United Shaker societies, is published by N. A. Briggs of the Canterbury family. It is devoted to the defence and advocacy of the tenets of their belief, but contains much spicy and interesting reading.

A few agricultural hints are inserted, the fruit of their own experience, and we hope to see this department enlarged, for the Shakers have a reputation of being successful farmers. It appears in new type, and is the work of Shaker hands alone. We trust that their efforts at improvement will be attended by remunerative patronage. The People
