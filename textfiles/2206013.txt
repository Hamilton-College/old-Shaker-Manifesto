In Memory of our Sister SARAH A. WEATHERFORD. Mary C. Settles. When Death comes to those who are far advanced in years, and have 'borne the burden and heat of the day,' we feel it is a blessed release for their weary feet, and although we may be crossed to part with our aged ones, yet it is what we may expect;but when Azriel, claims for his own, the one in the prime of life, and with ruthless hands, bears her away, from our midst, we are constrained to weep and mourn that one so useful should be taken from us, one with whom our youthful days were spent. Joy and sorrow alike shared with each other, and how swiftly time has borne us on through varied scenes of toil and care. Dear Sister we would not call thee ack for we know thy pure spirit now rejoices with those who have preceded thee to the Summer Land but we shall hope to meet again, and be parted no more. May we who remain, [join 'So live, that when thy summons comes to The innumerable caravan that moves [take To that mysterious realm, where each shall His chamber in the silent hails of death, Thou go not like the quarry slave at night, Scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.'
