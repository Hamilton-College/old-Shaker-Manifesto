Dear Sister E ;—As I am going to... Mt. Lebanon, Dec. 31. 1882 Dear Sister E ;—As I am going to meeting this afternoon, I am thinking of what I have so often been told;—to remember all we could of the speaking of the good brothers and sisters. It would teach us to be good, and help us to behave properly in public, by giving our attention to something useful instead of the dress, looks, and actions, of our companions. I was thinking and talking to the girls, yesterday of the beautiful holiday we had the past autumn and our ramble on the mountain gathering Ferns, Evergreens, &amp;c. also our visit to the Cranberry patch. I never knew before that they grew on little creeping vines close to the ground, andO, so thickly matted together. They say Br. James has worked seven long years to get the vines in such beautiful order, and they gathered over one hundred and sixty bushels this year from the little piece he has cared for. Not much more than one acre somebody told one of the girls. I think him very good and kind, but he seems very feeble. I have much to make me good and happy in my home and will strive to be a dutiful child to those who do so much for me. Your affectionate, Fannie,—Age, 12.
