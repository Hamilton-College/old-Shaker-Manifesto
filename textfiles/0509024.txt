I love to peruse the 'S— and S—...' I love to peruse the ' S— and S—,' and would signify my approval and appreciation of its contents. I feel deep interest in the welfare of humanity, and would rejoice in spirit to see them elevated to better conditions ; to see them rise out of the sphere of self-serving and self-pleasing, and devote their time and talents upon the broad basis of universal love to God and mankind. Then justice would rule in the affairs of men. Great reforms are needful; but where is the power to meet the present exigency ? Men and women, unassisted by the grace of God, cannot effect the needed change ; it must be wrought through faith and prayer, accompanied with good works. Omnipotent Power must fathom man's loss, And teach him the glory of bearing the cross, Until from all sin he finds a release, Enhancing his joy, and his blessing. My sisters in suffering, I oft pray for you That angels of mercy may guide you safe through, Where together we'll meet on Canaan's bright shore, A heaven of glory possessing. Julia Scott, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
