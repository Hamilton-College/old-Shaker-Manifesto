First thing a truly religious man should seek to be is... The first thing a truly religious man should seek to be is a perfect animal. Holiness, wholeness of body and perfection in bodily structure are the first triumphs a religious man can win. To be strong with all possible strength ; to be beautiful with all possible beauty; to be perfect in that which is least, as a stepping-stone to perfection of that which is greater, is the first ambition of intelligent piety. â€” W. H. H. Murray
