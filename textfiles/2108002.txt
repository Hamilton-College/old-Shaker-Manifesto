REVERENCE. M. J. Anderson. I deem myself but some poor lifeless clod Without a sense of homage for the good. 'Twere better e'en to bow to stone or wood Than have no inner consciousness of God. As breath of spring upon earth's frozen sod Awakes and quickens from her sombre mood, And gladdens e'en the dreariest solitude Where grasses wave and beauteous flowers nod; To stir the living forces of the soul, And dormant powers to active service rise, When love infinite holds supreme control And all unfolding life intensifies. Then we behold with truth and glad surprise That reverence deep all goodness underlies. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
