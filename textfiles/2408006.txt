My Esteemed Brother in the Faith... [Beloved Elder Henry;Will you please give the extract from a letter of one of our enquirers a place in the Manifesto. I am not at liberty to give names.] My Esteemed Brother in the Faith ;Last year, I wrote a few lines you will excuse me at this time if I open my mind, as it is pressed full. In all the societies of this world I fail to find perfection, but in many are some (more or less) who are true to the core. Having known a little about the Society of Believers, covering a few years, I see a real need of a revival of the inward working and goodly manifestation outwardly, saving and cleansing the whole person, as was the case with Ann Lee. She is reported as saying, 'I feel the blood (life) of Jesus Christ coursing all through my being, purifying me unto himself.' That, as I understand, is the power of Eternal Life. Has the life or blood of Jesus Christ lost its power? I think I hear you say, Nay, and Isav, Amen. Let me assure you, my brother, there are many men and women out over this wicked world, yes over these New England states, who are by him set apart to live and walk in the Spirit, Holy, and they could be gathered in his Spirit, in his name, to the vacant houses and distressed lands of your Societies. Your only hope seems, that you take up the work afresh, just where Ann Lee was taken from it, and casting down and out all false or perverse spirits, rise up to glorify God in the power of the Holy Spirit. I have no personal thrusts to make, I only write of Shakers, so called, as I have seen them. Sorry to say I have met believers in Robert Ingersoll and modern spiritualists in among your leaders. What would Ann Lee do or say, were she to come back now to the gatherings. I think she would, inf olio wing her precious MasterChrist, drive out, with what was to her power even the fire of the Holy Ghost. E. E. N.
