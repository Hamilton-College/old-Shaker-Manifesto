In the October, 1872, number of 'The Shaker'... In the October, 1872, number of ' The Shaker,' edited by Elder G. A. Loinas, was given a succinct account of a meeting which he attended in a pine grove in Canaan, at the ' Social Gathering,' of the three families of the novitiate order at Mt. Lebanon. He made mention of a conversation that took place at the time between six young sisters, which he thought worthy to appear in print. Some of our outside friends have since urged its publication ; for they were anxious to see it. Though somewhat lengthy for our small paper, we have concluded to publish it. It was prepared by the sisters expressly for the occasion, and was repeated from memory.
