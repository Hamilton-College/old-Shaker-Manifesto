IF WE KNEW. Ir we knew, when walking thoughtless In the noisy, crowded way, That some pearl of wondrous whiteness Close beside our pathway lay, We would pause where now we hasten, We would often look around, Lest our careless feet should trample Some rare jewel to the ground. If we knew what forms were fainting For the shade that we should fling; If we knew what lips are parching For the water we could bring, We would haste with eager footsteps, We would work with willing hands, Bearing cups of cooling water, Planting rows of shading palms. If we knew, when friends around us Closely press to say good-by, Which among the lips that kissed us First would 'neath the daisies lie, We would clasp our arms around them, Looking on them through our tears; Tender words of love eternal We would whisper in their ears. If we knew what lives are darkened By some thoughtless word of ours, Which had ever lain among them Like the frost among the flowers ; Oh, with what sincere repentings, With what anguish of regret, While our eyes were overflowing, We would cry, 'Forgive ! forget! ' If we knew ! Alas 1 and do we Ever care or seek to know Whether bitter herbs or roses In our neighbor's garden grow God forgive us ! lest hereafter Our hearts break to hear Him say : ' Careless child, I never knew you, From my presence flee away.
