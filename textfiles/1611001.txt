WEIGHTY CONSIDERATIONS. OLIVER C. HAMPTON. Prom some one cause or another we all need discipline. Our rudimentalisms are such and our selfishness so prevalent, that we find ourselves opposed to making great, and oftentimes even little sacrifices for the comfort and benefit of our fellow beings. And yet it really seems, that is what we were made for. When I was about eight or nine years of age a little episode will give the reader an idea how selfish I was. I lived in a romantic corner of our homestead called the Square House and situated in a beautiful valley. How many hundred times I have longed to go back in my years and live over again the life and scenes connected with that valley and the breezy hills and woods surrounding it. One day the Brethren from our family and a number from the other families went out into the woods to the North of us a mile or so, to fell great oaks to get their bark for tanning. All took their dinners along. When dinner time came however, it was found that the pigs had made a raid on the good things of this life which our Brethren from the village had brought with them. Of course our Brethren from the Square House proposed immediately to shai'e our dinner equally with them, which was gratefully accepted and we all sat down together and quite comfortably and contentedly discussed what there was, and all went off' very pleasantly with all parties except one individual, and that was your humble correspondent who was almost enraged at a most provoking and vexatious liberality which deprived me and our family of half our dinner. How many times in after years have I marveled how I could have been so supremely selfish. What an excellent lesson and matter for serious and reformatory reflection that little occurrence has afforded me during my lite. What a luminous insight into my rudimental selfishness ; to be forever after strictly guarded against in every possible relation I might stand in, toward my fellow beings. The present outlook relative to the prospects and probabilities of our beloved Zion, are ominous and impress me solemnly. For we are to be found watching and praying for constant accessions to our goodness and holiness as individuals ;�and as a church, to be in the perpetual exercise of sacrifice and self'-abnegaiion for the benefit and blessing of all humanity. This dear Brethren and Sisters, is our solemn covenant before God and iti 'he presence of each other, which cannot be ignored in time or eternity. These are the qualities of our heavenly Father and Mother and we are exhorted by our Holy Savior to 'be perfect even as they are perfect' including the fartherest stretch of all benevolence (viz.) 'making our sun to shine upon the evil as well as the good' and 'sending our rain of mercy and love upon the just and the unjust. ' How otherwise can we fulfill the conditions involved in our Savior's invocation in Jno. xvii., 21, 22, 23. We cannot be one with Christ as he is one with the Father, only by cultivating and developing in our spirit tke same mercy�benevolence�love�purity etc., which are in them. Now as it is a time of spiritual dearth both in Zion and over the earth generally, and our minds are not necessarily engrossed with the burden of many sinsick and convicted souls flocking to Zion 'like doves to their windows.' it is a most excellent season wherein to discipline ourselves into that perfect charity and goodness toward each other which is every moment bestowed upon us by our Heavenly Father and Mother. This Kingdom of Heaven is doubtless within us, but we need to rise iuto its realization by practical self-sacrifice of all low rudimentalisms and selfish considerations. Then indeed may we sing 'Spring up O well; sing ye unto it: The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it by the direction of their law-giver. ' Numb, xxi; 17. This is the well of water springing up into everlasting life, and which is discovered and perpetually enjoyed in the course of every truly self-disciplined spirit. If we will open the doors of the day with prayer earnest and solemn, to walk in this holy discipline of Love, we shall undoubtedly be able to close them in peace and inward consolation. Now if we can be persuaded to make this use of our pilgrimage through the present wintry period of our travail and experience, we shall not only gain an unspeakable boon of contentment and peace, but also be in the best possible condition for receiving poor sorrowing souls when our Heavenly Father and Mother shall see fit to send them Zionward for salvation and deliverance from sin and its accompanying guilt and sorrow.
