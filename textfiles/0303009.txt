METHODIST SERMON 'The Jlrst requisite with a little child is not to teach it the Lord's Prayer, or ask it, What is God? — What is heaven, or hell? But teach it to take care of its health; teach it physiology ; teach it, as it can understand, simple facts in science. ' Just so with men and women who tell me they are ready for heaven, and know exactly God's intentions about the race. Why, they cannot tell you the difference between a cabbage and a goose ! They know about God, and don't know one simple law of health! Ready for heaven, and so ignorant of themselves, they bring children into the world with not enough physical stamina to live! And why? Because, by debauchery and sin, they have entailed on their children their own rottenness and weakness. ' We must learn to raise children aright before we talk of religion. Religion, I insist, is last, not first. We must learn all about this world before we study the next world. Better learn to boil potatoes than study theology. ' Why have we so many skeptics in the church ? Why do not our young men attend church ? because they have been taught authority—authority all their youth up, instead of being taught to rely on their own strength — to stand on their own two feet. ' First, that which is natural, said old Paul. He was right. First, know the laws governing your own bodies—first, know of this world : first, study science, and then build your religious faith on that science. 'You cannot get science f rom!the Bible. The fathers of the church tried to do that, and a flat world, with angels above the molten heavens, to drag the sun out of a pit in the morning, was Bible astronomy. This is all wrong. We have begun at the wrong end. The true law is science first, and then religion.'—Bann of Light. True science is Shaker theology.— Ed.
