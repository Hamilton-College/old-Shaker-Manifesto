IF YOU WOULD BE HAPPY. Beware of the man of two faces. Persevere against discouragement. Take a cheerful view of everything. In all promised pleasures, put self last. Trust in God and mind your own business. Pray for a short memory as to all unkindnesses. Do not talk of your private, personal, or family matters. Put not your trust in money, but put your money in trust. Cultivate forbearance till your heart yields a fine crop of it. Give your tongue more holiday than your hands or your eyes. Examine into your own short-comings rather than those ol others. Be content to do the things you can, and fret not because you cannot do everything. Do the duty that lies nearest thee; thy second dut} will already have become clearer. Never reply in kind to a sharp or angry word; it is the second word that makes the quarrel. Make the best of what you have, and do not make yourself miserable by wishing for what you have not. The Good Way.
