Pleasant Hill, Ky. April, 1895. Beloved Elder Henry:I always read The Manifesto with great interest and am glad we have this exponent of our faith and of the glorious salvation from sin we have found in obedience to the teachings of Christ. I am sure all who have tasted of the joys of the world to come and realized the satisfaction of a selfish life laid down to take up the burden of the Lord, would willingly proclaim to the whole world that 'now is come salvation and the kingdom of our God.' Of the many children for whom we care, it seems that many are led to love the life of Christ, but when the test is applied, 'Except a man forsake all that he hath he can not be my disciple,' many prove moral cowards and are slaves to the passions which rule the heart of the natural man. Yet, how many are thankful they were educated with the Shakers and when stricken with poverty or death, their first thought is that their children be placed with the Shakers to receive a like education. All we can do is to offer to those who come among us, the gospel of love and purity in all its attractiveness, and some good fish will remain while the others go back into the sea from whence they came. May the Lord bless and unite his people and send faithful workers into his vineyard. Lucinda M. Reynolds.
