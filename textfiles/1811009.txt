Read at the Funeral of Brother SIMON T. ATHERTON. No eulogist can tell thy long and earnest life To those who know thy diligence in daily toil. A sheaf of full ripe wheat is garnered now, And left a void in grateful saddened hearts. Ah! we shall miss that busy step at early dawn, That wrought the deeds that built thy temple fair; We see thee now in the silence of great death, Calm as the eternal hills upon whose front Shines the soft radiance of a pure white day. We see the crystal beauty of thy Soul Unclouded as the marble of thy face. And within our hearts we say, he is not dead, But living in the glory of his work� In things accomplished that no fate can kill� In deeds done, that grateful hearts still cherish. For he has lived for truth and manly deeds : Touched with the spirit of our common weal. And so he passed, not like the petal blown, Or like the floating mists of summer sky, But is immortal in that glorious life, That beats from age to age in deathless man. Bright as the morning freshness of pure light, In this fair memory he is emblazoned now. He is a part of the illustrious past Which naught can change, and naught can dissipate. With what a solemn glory over life Death draws its mystic and unfathorned grace; Its wealth may seem to perish, but transformed Becomes a brighter lustre, purpr stream. Humanity dies not, and in its soul 0 valued Mead, tliou hast a ro3'al grace. The labor thou hast done, is ours, is man's, Within our thoughts and love, thou art alh e : The stream dries not, invisibly it flows, And makes more sure the upward steps of man. Thou art at rest, thy work on earth well done, But the untiring earnest of thy soul, Like pulses of the summer air, still touch The world to beauty, and our hearts to hope. Harvard, Mass. Oct. 3. 1888.
