Dear Friend; Yours is duly received... Shaker Station, Hartford Co., Conn. April 1885. Dear Friend ;ï¿½Yours is duly received and I feel much pleased with your candid reply. As regards the distinction between the Moral and the Spiritual ; to my view it is thus : Jesus Christ said, ye miiot be born again before you can enter into the Kingdom of God, that is out of the natural into the Spiritual. The Highest the natural man can attain to is the moral, but the spiritual man embraces or takes in both. You do not, in my view, put it in order when you say the spiritual is aggressive, passive ; as I view it, it is passive, active against all sin and wrong. The spiritual is what is needed to guide and rule the mental and the animal in man, to bring all things into order. The spiritual man is under increasing inspiration and is God-guided in all he says and does ; the natural man gets all he knows not by submission as the spiritual man, but by outward observation through the sense medium. You ask me, What is purity? I would reply, it is obedience to all moral and divine law. Man can be pure as a natural man, as he walks in obedience to moral law. The spiritual is a step higher, and embraces the moral, takes that in as a necessity ; for, though man can be moral but not spiritual, he cannot be spiritual without being moral. The difference between Virgin Purity and moral purity is, when man keeps moral law as a generative man, that does not make him a Virgin character: it is only he who follows Christ in the regeneration that can be termed a Virgin ; for regeneration involves a ceasing from generating. You ask, if all were to do this, wonld not the race run out? Most assuredly it would ; we do not profess to have any revelation as to what God intends with the continuance of the race of man, but we do say that He has revealed his mind and will to us that, as professed followers of Christ, in order to follow him, we must cease generating or we cannot be Christian or spiritual. We then leave it to God to dispose of, how the race will continue to exist. There is one thing sure if man goes on in violation of all moral law as he is doing, it is only a question of time as to the continuance of the race. Robert Owen and J. P. Greaves, were two great and eminent characters, and I am much indebted to both those men for what I am to-day. As you observe there remains some of the fruit of their labors in the co-operative movement, and there is a very extensive movement in dietetic reform, that is the fruit of the labors of J. P. Greaves and others in England to-day. You will I think perceive the difference, from what I have said, between the natural and spiritual, and between the order of Christ's Kingdom and the order of the world. The two cannot be blended ; flesh is flesh, and spirit is spirit, and the one is antagonistic to the other ; for the flesh lusteth against the the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the. other. You observe truly that were it not for a life of Virgin Purity we should have been overrun by all the various schemes afloat at this day. I was formerly acquainted with a number of Oneidan members. From the first of my acquaintance with them I saw they were doomed to fail, if they adhered to their disgusting idea of male continence. But such was their delusion that they had in that idea something of a far more self-denying life than we could lay claim to. My experience in two attempts at community life, before I joined the bhakers gave me ample evidence that the relation between the sexes must be pure, or there could be no success. I have good reason to believa that failure m this respect was the cause of the end of both the experiments I was in. You remark that Shakers are the most likely of any of the sects to introduce an Eden state or be pioneers of the same. I would here say, that we are full believers that by taking up our cross against all wrong in our knowledge we are enjoying that state, and that it secures to all, who truly live out the self-denying life of Jesus Christ, a condition of blissfulness and rest from the fruit of sin. It is admitted by all who profess the Christian name that sin is the root of all unhappiuess and misery ; even we socialists perceived that it was the violation of the laws of nature, that was the source of all unhappiness, and as sin is a violation of law it follows that all man needs is the power to live above all sin. This we can confidently affirm to our fellow man, that we find in the life we live, and we see no other way 'whereby man can live a happy and justified life. It is easily to be perceived that so far as man in the order of a worldly life, lives up to a moral standard of right so far he enjoys its fruit, yet it would be impossible to find perfect happiness under any condition in the order of a worldy life. I send yovx a pamphlet that may give you further insight into the grounds of our life. We have larger works that are more elaborate and explanatory of our life, faith and principles. Should you like to examine further I shall be happy to furnish you with the loan of them. You say truly that an association of virgin brethren and sisters can enjoy each others society far better than it exists at present in the order of the world ; and I would add that even were the world to enjoy all that a pure generative condition would give they would then come far short of that which is to be enjoyed in the order of the Kingdom of Christ. Inasmuch as the natural man understandeth not the things of the spirit of God, these being spiritually discerned, so all out of this order of life are incapable of knowing the higher relationship that exists between brethren and sisters in Christ. Hoping that these few remarks may aid you in your investigations after truth, I will pledge myself to do all that is in my power to aid you in your honest pursuit of truth. Were you acquainted with William Galpin, who was Secretary of the Ham Colonization Society? He lived at the Ham Society when I was there. He died among the White Quakers in Ireland. Spring is just opening upon us, it is a very late spring. With sincere regard I am yours in the truth. Robert Aitken. P. S. 'The Healthian' was pub- lished at Ham. When I was there, there was a printing press and we published a weekly called the New Age. Altogether there was a deep movement in that affair, and its effects are still leavening into English society. I hear through the Vegetarian Society that the Pater is deceased, but his widow still lives in England.
