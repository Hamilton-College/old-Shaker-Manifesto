MY MORNING THOUGHTS. ANDREW BARRETT. The manifestations of the spirit are given to all to profit by. Reason's bright light kindled by God's love is one of our choicest gifts. All men or women hi this wor*d or in the spirit world are naturally attracted to the society of those like themselves. What is more necessary in this life than the culture of a spiritual relation to those we are going to unite ourselves with when done with mortality. Never despair; be always Brave; understand the power of the spirit, which gives us soul strength. So the obstacles in our path of progress.�Temptations which now overcome us,�Sorrows which now oppress us. Fears which are only shadows of our dreams, will become exercise for our strength to nerve us up to show how much real Christian fortitude of character we have in possession. Trials, what are they? They are the gymnastics of a spiritual life ; what would the soul be without them to draw out from the depths of the mind those precious and noble thoughts. My young friends do you know how much good the present discipline is going to do you in future life? Do you know it is the Dictionary that is going to open or unfold to you all the Knowledge you need to secure that long looked for inheritance in the heavenly spheres? It is the link that is going to weld you into the chain of union with your dearest and long loved friends who have crossed over the river. Nerve up my young friends don't let the weakening spirit of discouragement light upon you.�Keep it off if you can�run for your life when you see it coming�clinch up anything to fight it� a club, a stick ; shake, war, do something to keep it out into the cold from you. Anything is better for an associate than a discouraged spirit. , Look at the poor miserable creature, lank, lean and barren of any social life ; moping along under the fears of some dreadful thing that is going to come upon society : He has no friends, for no sensible person who feels for their character will ever listen to his or her foolish harangue. When he comes to the table for a little of the sustenance of life to keep soul and body together, which I fear will fall apart before long unless there is a decided change soon, his eyes are' cast' around the Kitchen, knowing before many days he will be deprived even cf these blessings. What then is going to become of the homestead? All the older people have left the ranks and gone to report for higher promotion, and who is going to support us? Poor miserable creature, how I pity you. If you would only go to work and give up your whining, murmuring spirit and take hold of gospel liberty, you would soon see who was going to keep the homestead. Have you put your hands to the gospel plough? Where are your eyes? Certainly they are not looking ahead to the further end of the furrow. A good ploughman never looks behind until the furrow is finished, and then he looks for the crooks and bad places, to mend them the next time. Do you profess to be a follower of Christ? He said, those who have put their hand to the plough and look back were not worthy of his association.T He has gone too far, poor discouraged �creature ; he can't get out of his bed this morning. His vital powers have finally succumbed to the false imaginations of his head and of course he is dangerously ill. Call the Dr. Down goes a stream of 'Caster oil. hot drops, or Cordial; for he must be attended to immediately. There is great danger of the softening of the brain, and we shall have a case of insanity upon our hands. Poor, ignorant man don't you know he is already insane, by letting his mind run upon such needless things. Dr. What are those needless things? A. Why his hobby has been for years that A\e were all running out; and that there would not be enough left in a few years to hold the homestead. Dr. How is his appetite? A. He eats his three meals a day with as good relish as need be. Well now what do you think will meet his case? Dr. lie needs a good shaking up in spirit to give him new vitality and show him what he needs to do. Send him to some good and loving Elder, and he will soon open his eyes to see in a different direction and change things. Harvard, Mass.
