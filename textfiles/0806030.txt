GOD BLESS THE AGED From Maine to Kentucky, and from all the Societies and hamlets corresponding with us, a unity, of blessing The Manifesto by the aged, is recorded, with the first exception to be heard if there is any. On a flying trip to Mt. Lebanon, recently made, we met nearly a score of these saints, whose ages included 75 and 102 ! Had we been some one much better than the editor of The Shaker Manifesto, we might have been more worthy of the long line of blessings showered upon us. Every one of these took especial delight in The Manifesto ; and with the blessing of one such saint in its favor, we can very pleasantly bear contumely and the croakings of the other class, until death relieves them or they reform.
