A Good Beginning A new, religious movement has just started in Michigan; is 'prospering wonderfully,' having as its only test of membership the following, very sensible paragraph. We want to enroll ourselves members of that church, and to hold out the petition for other signatures. We are on the road to a perfect the. ology : 'We believe Christianity is not a belief, merely, but rather a life; that the sayings of Christ are the plainest possible statement of religious truth and constitute the only true theology; that any person who believes and earnestly tries to live in accordance with those sayings is entitled to church privileges.'
