In Memory of ELDRESS BETSY SNEEDEN. With saddened heart I read the words That told me mother's gone. Gone for the Angels wanted her To dwell in their bright home. 0 could she longer stayed with us Her earthly friends to bless ; Most gladly we would flock to her For gifts her soul possessed. A mother true she's ever been, Through every scene of life, Her brave and loving spirit shone A conqueror in the strife. Though many treasures she possessed Of one we now will speak. It was the gift of charity, That clothed her spirit meek. Her very presence brought new life And cheered each weary heart, Like sunbeams casting light afar, All goodness she'd impart. To every one some kindly word Our sainted mother gave, And noble deeds thro' her were wrought Her work was souls to save. Her spirit seemed to over-flow With patience, peace, and love, And round her shone a radiance That cometh from above; Our sainted mother Oh ! we pray Return and bless us now. Give of your love as you have done In prayer we humbly bow. Again we say farewell, farewell, Till our earth life shall end 0 watch and guard your children here And be our constant friend You've fought the fight and kept the faith Maintained our Savior's word Your spirit pure shall ever reign Blest Angel of our Lord.
