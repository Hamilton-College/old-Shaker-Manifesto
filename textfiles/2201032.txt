TOO LATE [Contributed by S. A. Collins.] What silence we keep year after year. With those who are most near to us ami dear; We live beside each other day by day, And speak of myriad things but seldom say The full sweet words which lie Justin our reach Beneath the common-place of common .speech. Then out of sight and out of reach they go, These close familiar friends who loved us so, And sitting in the shadow they have left Alone with loneliness, and sure oereft, We think with vain regret of some fond word That once we might have said and they have heard. For weak and poor, the love that we expressed Now seems beside the vast, sweetunexpressed And slight, the deeds we did, to those undone, And small the service spent, to treasures won, And undeserved the praise for work and deed, That should have overflowed the simple need. This is the cruel cross of life, to be Full visioned, only -when the ministry Of death has been fulfilled and in the place Of some dear presence is but empty space; What recollected services can then Give consolation for the 'might have been.'
