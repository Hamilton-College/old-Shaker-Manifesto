THE LIGHT OF TO-DAY. Abraham Perkins. The eye of truth is a discerner of hidden mysteries ; even the most perverse crookedness and evil devices of the human heart. The greater the comprehension of the structure of humanity, the fraction of excellence in its composition, the greater is human wTonder, that the Lord is mindful of man. An estimate of the qualities of the lords of creation suggestive as fragmentary and far from being complete, may shock the senses of those who consider the condition of the present generation but a little lower than that of the angels, and thus, such judgment was belittling the work of the Almighty. Such views are not profound. The conditions of to-day are greatly changed from those of the early creation. Wickedness did not then fill the earth, nor was the earth then corrupted. In the beginning, man was made upright, and all created things were pronounced good. But what does history tell us followed? Man, realizing his free agency, and being of the earth earthy, unwisely listened to his earthly, animal part, yielded to his weaker powers and thus assumed his independence that he might become as god. From this experiment, he acquired a knowledge of evil. A^hafc was the result and what the entailment upon his posterity! Lo! the eyes of the once innocent were opened, and both the man and the woman found themselves naked before God. As a mountain, the sin of their disobedience loomed before them to their condemnation, and they were cast out of paradise, driven from blissful Eden. The ground was cursed for their sake ; the fruit of wliich they were to eat in sorrow, all the days of their life. From that day to this, such has been human experience ;� man being 'Born unto trouble as the sparks fly upwards.' Job v., 7. Notwithstanding this rebellion and the spirit thereof, which has been manifested in every dispensation of God's grace to man by Adam's posterity, yet a merciful God has provided a safe means of escape from the curse. Here comes the cross, a sacrifice of all that is animal or beastly found in man's composition. He is no more to partake of forbidden fruit, which, from the days of our first parents, has produced shame, condemnation and death to the spirit. He is no more to eat of the tree that produces life; the effect of such an act is death to the spirit. He is no more to cultivate and give support to the vine of the earth. On the contrary, all his powers are to be given in service to God; every act of his life is to be given in consecration to the building up and support of Christ's kingdom in works of virgin purity, as manifested in the life and godly example of Jesus, who said, 'Follow me,' and your reward shall be eternal life. No more is he to look for justification in the works of the first Adam. No more a resort to arms for satisfaction for wrongs. The Christian command is, 'Put up again thy sword into his place ; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.' Matt. xxvi., 52. No more tooth for tooth and eye for eye, as under the Mosaic law ; but suffer wrong rather than do wrong, and thus work to cause peace to fill the earth as waters cover the sea. No more marriages ; as that institution is an order of the old creation and not that of the new ; as in the resurrection or in Christ,�'They neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.' Matt, xxii., 30. No more mine and thine in earthly things, which are to be used unselfishly as not abusing them, after the manner of the first Christian church at Jerusalem, where 'All that believed were together and had all things common ;' Acts ii., 44, and where 'The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul; neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.' Acts iv., 32. Upon the present generation is the spirit of Christ calling, 'Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.' Matt, xi., 29. He that hath ears to hear, k&gt;t him hear ; and he that hath heart to conceive, let him understand and find strength to obey. Enfield, N. H.
