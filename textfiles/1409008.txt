THE GOLDEN RULE. AGNES E. NEWTON. 'ï¿½ Whatsoever ye would that men should (Id unto you, even so do ye also unto them, ' arc words that will outlive the growth of ages, and burn as beacon lights, guiding the tempest tossed mariner to shores of Christian excellence; portraying the divine wisdom of the great Teacher; by the observance of which the pupils of the school of Christ are distinguished. This rule applies to all classes, grades and ages of individuals upon whom the light of Christian intelligence has dawned. Its influence is powerful for good ; by its adoption peace and harmony are preserved among equals, teachers and pupils, parents and children, all being thoughtfully considerate of each other's good. How satisfactory the result. No code of Chesterfield is requisite to give grace and beauty to the manners of the truly Christian man or woman, in whose lives this rule has been adopted as an abiding element. They arc prepared for every phase and emergency of life found in the Christian's pathway. What an improvement upon the Mosaic law of justice, ' An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. ' The spirit of retaliation can find no place in the heart of a Christian. Love that ' endureth all things, ' tie great criterion by which the heirs of tie New Kingdom are known, is an outgrowth of obedience to the golden rule, which if universally adopted would prove the greatest panacea the world has ever known.
