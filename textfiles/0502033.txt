TO SUSTAIN SHAKER AID SHAKERESS Let Believers contribute eighty cents to each individual, and receive, in bulk, as many papers as individuals â€” if they wish. Can have an equal number mailed to outside subscribers, by sending ten cents postage for each subscriber. For subscribers, in excess of the above, canvassers will remit fifty cents. Canvassers are to receive, of outsiders, sixty cents. Give subscribers' names in full. The three volumes '73, '74, '75, may be had for fl.10. By Believers for $1.00.
