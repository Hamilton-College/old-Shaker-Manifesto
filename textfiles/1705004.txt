AGAIN. 'Tis all for lack of sacrifice That souls are stinted in their growth Our God is just and makes returns For all we give in greater worth : But he who holds his selfish life And will not render time and pains Eor others good is: of tlie earth Arid in the world that soul remains. Canterbury, N. H. M. W.
