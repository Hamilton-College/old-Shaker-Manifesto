West Pittsfield, Mass. Sept, 1892. 'The great ocean is in a constant state of evaporation. It gives back what it receives, and sends up its waters in mists to gather in clouds; and so there is rain on the fields and storms on the mountains, and beauty and greenness everywhere.' We are constrained to quote this beautiful aphorism enunciated by the renowned H. W. Beecher, now in immortal realms, because of the freshness and verdancy of field and forest, now in this glorious autumn season, largely attributable to the refreshing rains of summer. Our grass crop nearly equaled that of last year, which was considered good. Potatoes yielded well, but decay is upon them. We find our supply of apples larger than we had anticipated. Shall have a sufficiency for home use, with perhaps a small surplus. Pears and small fruits not as plentiful as in some former seasons. For some unknown cause our blackberry harvest did not compare in quantity with that of last year. Yet how manifold are our blessings, and how our hearts should expand with thankfulness. What time could be more appropriate for rendering especial praise and thanks to the beneficent dispenser of all good and perfect gifts, than the blessed harvest season? Weather of the past few days was so nearly perfect, that the veil which hides from view the spirit world seemed to be lifted, and we felt as the late venerable expressed it, 'That the airs of heaven blew o'er us.' Love and good-will to our kind Editor and corps of assistants. The peace of heaven be with you. J. L. S.
