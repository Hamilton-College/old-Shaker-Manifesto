LIGHT. A. Y. COCHRAN. I like the sentiment of the Gospel Hymn we sometimes sing, entitled, 'Let the Lower Lights be Burning,' because it so aptly applies to the spiritual life which we are called to live. Our individual light or lamp may be very small and inferior, a tallow candle even ; and yet we are counseled, 'Trim your feeble lamp my brother, Some poor sailor, tempest tossed, Trying now to make the harbor, In the darkness may be lost.' The light possessed by. some individuals may be likened to an ordinary kerosene lamp; others present duplex burners, and their light has a more extended radius. Some are equal to Rochester Burners, while others still more gifted, may be said to resemble the electric light, which the Irishman said, 'beat the sun.' Our success as Christians does not depend upon the size of the light committed to our trust, but upon our faithfulness in keeping our lamp 'trimmed and burning,' that those within the radius of our light may be benefited. He who works by the light of a tallow candle and is satisfied therewith, knows nothing of the mental and physical labor required to produce the electric light, and therefore cannot even appreciate it. Let us all be faithful and keep the 'lower lights burning,' and the work of the great Engineer will thereby be made easier, and the light of truth be more broadly extended. Canterbury, N. H.
