Sanitary. DRUGS AND KIDNEY DISEASES. Pbohably the majority of people are not aware of the fact that the poisonous medicines taken into the stomach must be eliminated through the excretory organs, and chiefly through the kidneys. Many drastic drugs which are not at all unpalatable, and which can be swallowed easily in considerable doses and without disturbing the stomach, are extremely irritating to the kidneys, and much mischief is done to these important organs when they are required to eliminate, day after day, the doses of poisons swallowed with the supposition that they will somehow cure a chronic cough, a disordered digestion or a torpid liver. The continued use of arsenic for a skin disease, iodide of potash or mercury for some constitutional malady, or of simple chlorate of potash for a throat or bronchial affection, may be the means of setting up an incurable kidney disease. The last named drug is perhaps particularly dangerous, because commonly regarded as harmless. It is extremely irritating to the kidneys as well as depressing to the heart, and many persons have doubtless been greatly injured by its frequent and long continued use. ï¿½Selected. The New York Papers... The New York Papers tell us of a man who had become so hoglike that he ate seven pickled pig's feet at a single meal. In twenty-four hours he was dead from acute indigestion. !S'o doubt the hogs rejoiced at such an act of justice. Temple of Health.
