Sanitary. APPLE SAUCE THAT WILL KEEP This is as great a convenience as preserves, the preparation of apples for sauce not being always convenient for the busy housekeeper. Inferior apples may be used in this way, and the windfalls of early autumn, when one is fortunate enough to own an orchard, will be found quite available. They should be peeled, cored and freed from every blemish, then cut up in quite small pieces. A large earthen jar with a cover should be ready to receive them. Into this put first a liberal sprinkling of sugar, with cinnamon to taste, then a layer of apples, then more sugar and cinnamon, and so on until the jar is full. The sugar should be regulated according to the tartness of the apples, from a quarter to a half pound for one pound of apples being the rule. The jar should be placed at the back of the range and the fruit kept covered and gently simmering through the day. It should then be set away to cool and the apples taken out only as they are needed for sauce and desserts. Having no water mixt with them, apples prepared1 in this way are very palatable.
