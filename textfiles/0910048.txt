Sour milk is one of the best feeds... Sour Milk is one of the best feeds for poultry, especially for young chickens, that can be given them; and we fear its value is not fully realized by those generally who keep poultry in the country, as we are satisfied much refuse milk goes to waste that might be given the hens as well as not. Young chicks thrive wonderfully upon a diet of sour milk, and it may be given them in place of water to great advantage.
