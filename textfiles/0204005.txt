Babel Builders It would seem that Noah's posterity became quite as corrupt as the antediluvians. Instead of placing their confidence in a life of virtue that would elevate them above judgments, they conceived the idea of escaping by a high 27 THE SH^KEH. tower; and it is even intimated in Gen. 11, 6, that they might possibly succeed. Taken literally, it was a senseless proceeding to attempt to reach heaven after this manner, however much flood might be escaped. But do we not find among so-called Christian sects to-day as much Babylon in theologies and as much error in their anticipations ? No complicated system of theology will save any one, no matter how extensive its display, nor flattering its prospects. Those who build up as a substitute for a pure life any structure of mere faith, will find they are Babel builders ; the whole will come tumbling down and necessitate a new foundation. While the only true theology and religion is the practice of Christ's life in all of its self-denials, this being eternal because it is pure, containing no elements of error nor decay. C. Dibble.
