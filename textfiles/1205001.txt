WATCHING AND WAITING MARIA WITHAM Lord. lr:r watch thy church is keeping; When shall earth thy rule obey? When shall end the night of weeping? When shall break the promised day? See the whitening harvest languish, Waiting still the laborers toil; Was it vain thy son's deep anguish? Shall the strong retain the spoil? Tidings sent to every creature, Millions yet have never heard; Can they hear without a preacher : Lord Almighty, give the word. Give the word in every nation, Let the gospel trumpet sound, Witnessing a world's salvation To the earth's remotest bound. To the end thy church completed. All thy chosen gathered in, With their King in glory seated, Satan bound and banished sin. Gone forever parting, weeping, Hunger, sorrow, death and pain ; Lo ! her watch thy church is keeping, Come Lord Jesus, come to reign. Enfield, Conn.
