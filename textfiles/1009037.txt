American newspaper directory This immense work of more than a thousand pages will prove an invaluable companion to the thousands of newspaper fraternity and millions of advertisers. Its contents are very tastefully arranged, and no pains have apparently been spared to make it the most complete work of its kind ever printed. It is the handiwork of that enterprising firm, Geo. P. Rowell &amp; Co., New York, which firm has excited the unworthy envy and malice of contemporaries, and yet which stands A 1 with all respectable business men. We commend the same to the patron age of all advertisers.
