Dear Youth :—If you make earthly pleasure your object... Enfield, Conn. Dear Youth :—If you make earthly pleasure your object of life, you will fail of obtaining real happiness. You cannot afford to live without a noble aim or purpose. It is sad to see youth with God-given talents and abilities, yield to the 'Adversary' when he says, 'All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.' It is sad to see valuable youth wasting golden opportunities, regardless of the dictates of conscience. 'Death is the wages of sin.' Be not deceived, but 'watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation.' Cry unto God, 'deliver us from evil.' He is able to keep you from falling. Be pure in heart. Let nothing else satisfy you. 'Seek first the kingdom of God.' Cultivate the immortal part. Exemplify in daily life that which is true and virtuous. Expand and beautify every noble attribute. Now are your golden days. Have a noble object in view, and with all your might, press forward until it is yours. Let your aspirations be high, your intentions honest, your lives pure, and all will be well. Life is a race and you are on the course. Don't 'look back,' or you will suffer defeat. .;.,,Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
