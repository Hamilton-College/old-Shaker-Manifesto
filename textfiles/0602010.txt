FAITH AND WORKS RICHARD FLETCHER 'Words are but signs; they cannot show The fullness of the love we know, By living for each other's good When words with melody unite, The gift of praise gives more delight; And prayer brings more than earthly food. A nobler song, than power of art, God claims — an undivided heart — Holding with sin an endless strife. By deeds alone, can love be shown, No other proof can be made known, Of ' Christ in us ' the hope of life. Too long the truth has been denied, By talk, about One 'crucified Upon a tree,' our death to bear— By which all sinners may receive Free pardon, if they will believe — No cross to bear, but crowns to wear. 12 THE SBEA.KEH. Not Christ, an offering in our stead, But ' Christ in us ' — the living bread — This truth men lay aside to rust. On worn-out words they try to thrive, Pray God to ' save their souls alive—' Poor souls! all honey-combed with lust. If mere repeating, ' I believe,'1'' Could bring salvation, to relieve The sting of unrepented sin; Then might the farmer hope to gain An hundred-fold of golden grain, By sowing wild oats to the wind ! Christ comes to save mankind from sin; Then how can those who live therein Persuade themselves they are reformed? Can vines untrained, wild and deformed, Picture to us the newly born? Does grafted fruit their lives adorn? Since root and branch of earthly love, Trail downwards from the life above, Corroding mortals here with blight; Great is the need —humanity should be Cut off from earthly loves, and free To live for Christ, up in the higher life.
