CHEERFULNESS. Belle Rullhausen. There is a vast difference between cheerfulness and rude boisterous conduct. One shows a noble, cultivated mind, the other an untrained and unsubdued spirit. Any one who assumes a quiet and dignified cheerfulness is always highly valued in society, for their presence is like sunshine. It refreshes and gladdens the hearts of all with whom they come iti contact. 'A cheerful temper joined with innocence will make beauty attractive, knowledge delightful and wit good natured.' It may be thought by some persons that in order to be strictly religious they must go around loag-faced and melancholy, but that is a great mistake ; true religion never called any one to sacrifice cheerfulness of spirit; there have been some of the most mirthful and cheerful people who have been very religious and spiritual; but they knew when to use their mirth, and also when to lay it aside. The Bible tells us, that David king of the Israelites danced before the Ark of the Lord with all his might, and when reproached and scorned by Michal the daughter of Saul, he said, 'I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be more base in mine own sight.' Meaning that he would yet be more joyful in the praise of the Lord, regardless of what the natural man or woman might say of him. Whenever we feel most ^inclined to be melancholy, and look on the dark side of life, then is the time for us to strive the hardest to be cheerful, instead of finding fault with everybody and everything. Robert West has truely worded it, that 'Nothing is easier than fault-finding, no self-denial, no brains, no character are required to set up the grumbling business ; but those who are moved by a genuine desire to do good, have little time for murmuring or complaint.' It shall be my daily endeavor to cultivate a cheerful disposition and always manifest the fear of God in my deportment. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
