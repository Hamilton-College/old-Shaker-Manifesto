THE ANGEL OF PATIENCE JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER BY . To wearjr hearts, to mourning homes, God's meekest Angel gently comes; No power has he to banish pain, Or give us back our lost again; And yet in tenderest love, our dear And heavenly Father sends him here. There's quiet in that Angel's glance, There's rest in his still countenance ! He mocks no grief with idle cheer, Nor wounds with words the mourner's ear; But ills and woes he may not cure, He kindly trains us to endure. Angel of Patience ! sent to calm Our feverish brows with cooling palm; To lay the storms of hope and fear, And reconcile life's smile and tear; The throbs of wounded pride to still, And make our own our Father's will, 0 ! thou who mournest on thy way, With longings for the close of day, He walks with thee, that Angel kind, And gently whispers, ' Be resigned ; Bear Up, bear on, the end shall tell The dear Lord ordereth all things well !'
