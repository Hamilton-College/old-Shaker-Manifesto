The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 28. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Re-written by Henry C. Blinn. From this place Mother Ann and the Elders went on to Niskeyuna. All the Believers who had accompanied them were now dismissed, except Richard Spier, aud returned to their several homes. Having traveled but a few miles, Elder William Lee called at the shop of a Blacksmith, by the name of Johnson and asked him to re-set a shoe on his horse, but the man, in a very rough and passionate manner, refused and seizing a pair of tongs, threw them at Elder William with great violence. They fortunately missed the mark and struck the ground near his feet. Richard Spier picked up the tongs and asked Johnson the reason for such conduct. 'I will kill all of them,' said Johnson, 'if they do not leave the shop.' The Believers thought it was a point of wisdom to move on, and soon reached the residence of Ebenezer Knapp where they had beeD invited to stop. The family had made preparations for the visit, and were pleased when they learned that Mother Abn aud the Elders bad decided to call upon them. Soon after they had entered the house, Johnson with about twenty characters as rough as himself were before the dwelling and ordered Mother Ann and the Elders to leave the place in thirty minutes or they should suffer the consequences. These ruffianly fellows were armed with sticks and clubs, while some had heavy whips. They wound the lashes around their hands that they might the more effectively use their weapons of cruelty. This threatened interference so disturbed the minds of the family and their guests that they were afraid to sit at the table, at the hour of noon. Elder William Lee went to the door and spoke to the mob without fear. 'We came here peaceably to refresh ourselves,' said he, ' and we have concluded to remain here so long as we may choose, and you have no right to disturb us.' No farther abuse was offered and the Believers soon made preparation to continue their journey. On their arrival at the ferry, opposite the city of Albany, they met a party of Indians, and by them the Believers were treated with civility and kindness. After crossing the river they entered the forest, N. W. of Albany where they felt assured that they could rest undisturbed for a few moments. Pursuing their journey through these wild woods, they arrived at Niskeyuna late in the evening on the fourth of September, 1783, after an absence of two years and* four months. [The evangelizing mission of Mother Ann and the Elders has not its parallel on record. Their history tells of a living sacrifice of years on years. Of lives consecrated to God's service in which there was not the shadow of turning. From the day that they received the diviue call, while in England, till they passed from the scenes of time, it was one long aud perilous march through worldly persecution. Remarkable stories have been told of men ; of the tortures to which they have been subjected and of the hair breadth escapes which came at the opportune moment and permitted them to do more and suffer more, while on the pilgrimage through this world. And no less of their suffering unto death in all the agonies that could be concentrated upon the hour of torture. Many cases might also be enumerated where Heathen and Christian savagery has been inflicted upon women by imprisonment, by the rack and by burning at the stake. Remarkable instances of heroism and unshaken confidence in the cause of right, have also been manifested, aud have become the beautiful lessons which to this day enkindle thoughts and acts of self-sacrifice and of loving emulation. But all these instances diminish before this 'burning fiery furnace' into which Mother Ann and the Elders were cast, as they through a protracted period of fourteen years were thrown into jails and prisons and filthy dungeons. They were stoned by an^ry and malicious mobs ; they were beaten with clubs and the flesh torn from their bodies by tha cruel strokes of the lash. They were deprived of their food, and of their rest, and suffered daily at th: hands of religious fanatics an untold list of brutal indignities. In all this they never wavered in their confidence before Gcd, that he would be their Father, guide and protector. They received much consolation in the testimony of Jesus. 'Because you are not of the world, therefore, the world hateth you.' 'It hated me, even as it hateth you.' 'Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.' These servants of the living God, even while under the lash of hard hearted tormentors, would in the exaltation of their minds, sing hymns of praise to God's glory, in that He had called them to suffer, that others might rejoice. And there were times in which these three witnesses rejoiced aud were made exceeding glad ; times even when they could enjoy the fellowship aud friendship of their gospel relation ; when the songs of thanksgiving brought peace aud assurance, aud the voices of little children so captivated them that they would forget the trials and sorrows of the Christian martyr. They were, in the best and most noble sense of the term, men and women, and eminently beautiful representatives of the family of man. Kind, gentle, mirthful aud affectionate. Add to this the love and grace of God and ^e can readily see what made their company so much to be desired by their spiritual children. On the extended mission which they made in the years 1782 and 1783, they passed through not less than thirty six towns, in the states of New York, Mass. and Conn. In many of these places they held religious services, which abounded in songs of praise and thanksgiving and in exhortations of 'peace on earth, to men and women, good will.' The mission was carried into effect when the American people were in a very excited state of mind, arising in part from the demoralized state of society, brought on by wars and fightings, and in part by the intolerance of bigoted religionists who were always ready to institute au inquisition and to tyrannize over all that did not subscribe to their churchal dogmas, and lastly to that sordid selfishness of the human heart that always makes '�'�might to be right' as it dominates over the minds of men; It is a source of congratulation, that Mothsr Ann and the Elders were made able to pass through all these heavy burdens of mind and body, as well as to endure all the cruel persecutions that fell upon them, and then, at last, reach their own beloved home in the wilderness of Niskeyima, and be able to dwell in love and peace, for a few days, surrounded by Brethren and.Sisters, who had covenanted before God to be 'faithful uuto death.' It has been a labor of love to bring this brief historical account of missionary labors of Mother Ann and the Elders, before the readers of 'The Manifesto,' having the assurance that it will awaken an interest in the minds of many, to do more for the cause of righteousness, and less for the selfish interests that '�' perish in their using.' These three gospel leaders closed their labors on the earth, while in active service. Mother Ann and Father William Lee, at their own home in Watervliet, N. Y., in 1784. The first was forty nine years of age, and the other only forty four. Father James Whittaker closed his labors in the Society at ~Enfield, Conn., in 1787. being only thirty six years of age.�Ed. J
