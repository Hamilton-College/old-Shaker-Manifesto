Reed. the leafless trees, and the verdureless earth, we feel a trustful reverence and exclaim with Browning, 'God's in his Heaven All's well with the world.' Indeed the Creator has given mankind a home 'beautiful for situation,' and when man's God-given faculties are used in unison with the Divine will, we shall find that,ï¿½ 'This world is full of beauty As other worlds above And if we did our duty, It might be full of love.' The silence of the saw and hatchet, and the stir of the gardener and farmer, tell of duties done in season, and when we consider the promptness which characterizes our home life, year after year, we rejoice that our 'lines have fallen' where it is recognized that 'Order is Heaven's first law.' Our little people were quite surprised when reading the March Home Notes, that any one could suppose that a school vacation for them meant mischief, when there are so many pleasant and profitable things to learn and practice at home. The month's vacation is not half long enough for all they plan to do. The mountain stream is none the less beautiful, that its leaping, bubbling waters are converted into a useful power; neither is the healthy, happy activity of childhood disturbed by winning it to useful and pleasant employment. True education alternates the exercise of the mind with that of the body, and only when brain power can be put to practical use, is it of service in the march of life. Truly Elder Oliver in his last Notes has given us a beautiful description of those who have attained to the beatific state of the 'kingdom of heaven within.' Such a travel of soul is worth striving for, where self is forgotten, and all our efforts are concentrated to make the world better by our passing through it. Amelia J. Calve?'. 116 THE MANIFESTO. Center Family. April, 1894. We are having some blustering weather for April, the few warm days of March made us all feel that spring had come to stay, but April proves to be the 'true March.' The health of our family is quite good at the present, very few colds. Our aged Sister Ehoda Blake, is in good health for one so far along in years. She is still able to do much for herself. Brother Alonzo Hollister is better in health than he has been for a year past. Our Brethren are doing some grafting of both apple and plum trees, also cutting off the black knot which has become very troublesome; We have a few early chickens but the cold weather is very disagreeable to the little downy things. If the bad weather continues our chances for early vegetables will be small indeed. If it does not kill the fruit buds they will be saved through a special act of Providence. Our Sisters have not begun 'housecleaning' yet, so our Brethren will not have any trouble in dodging a 'Woman's weapon' in the hands of some energetic housekeeper. E. M. Sears. Canaan, N. Y. April, 1894. Some time has elapsed since we were represented in Home Notes. Nevertheless time has worn steadily on and with the feathered creation, we are constrained to sing of the glories of the advancing spring. Of March we can make no just complaint, as his roaring, piercing blasts, generally sweeping with unrestrained vigor through our domains seemed somewhat tamer than usual. He gave us a lively visit only now and then, bringing sufficient force to blow away all noxious gases, accumulations from the remains of decaying vegetation which might have proved detrimental to our well being if not dispersed. Thus through this advantage by careful discipline in dietetic habits, and by an observance of hygienic laws which pertain to the development of a good spiritual as well as physical condition, we are pleased to say that the health of the family in general has been maintained. If the cheerful attractions of our Canaan home have proved inefficient to draw to us people of more mature years, we are not destined at present to fall short of numbers as there are continual applications for the admission of children into our Order. Some, no doubt, are necessitated through the conditions of the prevailing hard times and others through an expressed desire to have them disciplined by higher and purer forces than those operating in the world at large. Under such circumstances within the past three months we have taken seven children ranging from three to thirteen years of age, and our only desire is that Sis they advance in years they may, through faithfulness, honor their privilege and become the 'glory of heaven and flowers of Paradise.' School for the season closed March 30, having been in session sixteen weeks. Our teacher is worthy of much credit, having devoted her time and strength freely to the interests of her pupils who number fourteen of various grades. Through her untiring zeal she has kept her scholars lively and active and now for a short season they will turn their attention to a different form of education in an industrial school.
