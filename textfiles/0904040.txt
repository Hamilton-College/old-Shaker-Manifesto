The Wise Man and the Serpent A wise man one day asked the serpent, ' Of what advantage is it to thee to deprive men of life ? The lion kills and devours his prey. The tiger, the wolf, and other fierce beasts do the same, in order to satisfy their hunger ; but thou bitest thine innocent victims, and sheddest mortal poison into their veins, without reaping any benefit from their death, save the cruel satisfaction of destroying.' ' Why asketh thou me this question ? ' rejoined the reptile. ' Ask rather the slanderer amongst thine own race, what pleasure he finds in poisoning unto death those who have never injured him.'
