Sanitary. No one will deny... 'No one will deny that eating animal flesh stimulates the passions, and gives vigor to that kind of life which finds gratification in sensual indulgence, and in asserting the power of brute force. If. A. Bradbury in World's Advance Thought. SPINAL DIFFICULTIES. Few things are more common among the young of modern times. Dr. Warren of Boston thinks about one half the young women, whom he called 'well educated,1' but he should have said fashionably educated, are affected with some degree of distortion of the spine. Their minds are filled with learned lore as a bottle is filled with liquid. The deformity is not wholly unknown even among boys. Those who have round shoulders, frequently have crooked spines. Dr. Alcott.
