Church and State Union There has not been such a violation of human rights enacted, since the days of the Inquisition, as the trial of D. M. Bennett, of the Truth Meeker, exhibited. Every feature, that would aid in presenting a favorable appearance to his 'fault,' was ruled out by a United States judge, in the interest of the churchal party. The ' fault' was in mailing a copy of a pamphlet, containing testimony so plain and strong against sexual immoralities and abuses, though, in our opinion, advocating other errors as a reform, that the persecutors of Bennett, dubbing it ' obscene,' moved heaven and earth to secure a verdict of guilty. Shakers do not fellowship the freelove principles of ' Cupid's Yokes,' nor do they fellowship the infidelity of ' The Truth Seeker,' while we protest against the inconsistency of Bennett's trial. Under such ruling, by judicial inconsistency, the Bible, Shaker books and pamphlets, and thousands of others, are obscene and unmailable. The testimony of Jesus cannot, according to such erroneous decisions, circulate through the mails. So terribly in earnest appears the church, in its determination to rule the state, that gags for those who dare to preach Christ, may not be only things of the past. We pray the President to interfere, and pardon Bennett, thus offering a protest to clerical domination, judicial inconsistency, and Comestock persecution.
