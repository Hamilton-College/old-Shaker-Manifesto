Lines in Memory of our Beloved Sister, Marcia E. Hastings Who let her light so shine, that others seeing her good works were led to glorify God. We oft recall with chastened heart As in life's school we learn, One precept which our Sister taught, 'All unkind words a harvest sure Of soitow will return.' E'en now we seem to hear her voice As when she gently said, I've sought to heal the slightest wounds Which words of mine have made. And when I meet with early friends Upon the other side, I'll plead; 'Forgive, if aught unkind Within your memories bide.' The knowledge whicli I prize the most Has taught me how to live And pattern him whose rule was love, The erring to forgive. 'Twas thus she lived, 'Twas thus she loved, And thus her spirit blest Ascended to its heavenly home A worthy, welcome guest. We'll take the lesson that her life In daily practice taught; And pray for grace that words of ours, May be with kindness fraught. And should we fail in any case To speak with Christ-like care; We'll seek our errors to erase Through penitence and prayer. Canterbury, N. H.
