The weather of late has been excessively warm; it reached the climax on Thursday last, when the mercury in the city of Pittsfield rose to 95.0 in the shade. We, the Center family commenced putting a new roof of felt on our Dwelling last Tuesday and the heat was almost unbearable, still we survived to tell you and the good friends who read that as a family we are fairly prosperous. Crops pretty good, cherry crop never so large as this year. We have commenced on the pear harvest which bids fair to be quite large, the Mt. THE MANIFESTO. 219 Bartletts are looking finely; should think they would be ready to market in about two weeks. There came a great change in the weather last night which was very agreeable, it being cool and pleasant this morning, but very dry. Since our last 'jSTotes' we have gathered a family of children, or rather a part of it, three girls and a boy. We would much rather gather adults capable of understanding the principles of our Order, and willing to devote their lives to its upbuilding and perpetuity. If it were not for hope, it is said the heart would faint, and so we keep on hoping that our numbers will be augmented. There are honest men and women abroad, and it would seem that they would gladly join our ranks had they a knowledge of its workings. Who shall spread the glad tidings? Timothy Ray son.
