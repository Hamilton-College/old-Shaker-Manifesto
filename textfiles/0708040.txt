Tyndall's advice. Take care of your health. There have been men who, by a wise attention to this subject, might have risen to any eminence, but who by unwise neglect on this point, have come to nothing. Imagine Hercules as oarsman in a rotten boat; what can he do there but by the very force of his stroke expedite the ruin of his craft? Take care then, of the timbers of your boat, and avoid all practices likely to introduce wet or dry rot among them. And this is not to be accomplished by desultory or intermittent efforts of the will, but by the formation of habits. No doubt the will has sometimes to put forth its strength to strangle or crush a special temptation; but the formation of right habits is essential to your permanent security. They diminish your chance of falling when assailed, and they augment your chance of recovery when overthrown.
