Beloved Elder Henry:--With our allotted assessment for the Manifesto... Watervliet, O., Dec. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½With our allotted assessment for the Manifesto we send our love and thanks for the kind and continuous endeavor you are making to have the Manifesto useful and interesting to its readers, not only to our Community, but to all who may receive it. The concept of our doctrine and life -as opened to us by the gospel of Christ's second appearing is surely and steadily increasing among men. Its divine truths will prevail and I feel much encouraged. I believe there are many souls that have been awakened by the sound of the seventh trumpet, mentioned in Revelations, when the mystery of God should be finished. God manifest in the flesh was the mystery begun in Christ's first appearing and will be finished in his second appearing. I greatly desire an ingathering of honest, prepared souls who will help in the building up of God's work in this day. That his kingdom may come and his will be done on earth as in heaven is my prayer. We have many precious blessings and much to be thankful for, which has been our blessing the past year. A happy new year to all our dear gospel friends, in all the Communities. Your Brother, S. W. Ball.
