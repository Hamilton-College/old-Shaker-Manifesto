SERIOUS SELECTIONS A man rose in one of Mr. Moody's meetings and gave his experience. 'I have been for five years on the Mount of Transfiguration.' ' 'How many souls have you led to Christ last year?' was the sharp question that came from Mr. Moody in an instant. 'Well, I don't know,' was the astonished reply. 'Have you saved any ?' persisted Mr. Moody. 'I don't know that I have,' answered the man. 'Well, we .don't want that kind of mountain-top experience. When a man gets so high that he can't reach down and save poor sinners, there is something wrong.' When the saintly Payson was dying lie exclaimed, 'I long to hand a full cup of happiness to every human being.' This was the language of a heart thoroughly purged of all selfish affection, and filled with the spirit of that love which led our adorable Jesus to give his life for human redemption. If every Christian would go out daily among men, filled with such longing for human happiness, what marvelous changes would soon be wrought in human society! The selfish element would be eliminated from the dealings of the Christian business man. Not justice merely, but benevolence, would enter into every act of trade. The same spirit would rule his home and churchlife. He would become an incarnation of good-will toward all, and would so preach the gospel by his deds that the man would see his good works and glorify his heavenly Father. The spirit of Payson is worthy of every man's imitation. Happy he who can truthfully say, ' I long to hand a full cup of happiness to every human being.' Zions Herald.
