THE SHAKER—ITS MISSION MARCIA E. HASTINGS The Shaker, a name that is hallowed and blest, And will be revered more and more ; Your work and your mission will yet be confessed, And souls will acknowledge its power. The Shaker,—and will He not 'terribly shake ' The earth, and the heavens as well ? With earth, this is being fulfilled, no mistake, As present conditions can tell. Look forth to the East, to the North, and the West, The South keep not back in the train; Upheavals, convulsions,—a common unrest, Are prevalent through every domain. Eruptions, and fevers, and fires and flood, Which no human hand can prevent ; Disasters and tragedies, shedding of blood,'] Are doing their work in extent. A shaking of matter, and trying of mind Are greatly the work of the day ; An epoch of change and of progress com- bined, And Shakers are forcing their way. There 're those agitators, both female and male,— Reformers,—they're Shakers indeed, Though diverse their gifts, one for right, they'll prevail; God for them,;we wish them good speed. THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 45 These agents are shaking and sifting throughout, And fanning the chaff from the wheat; One stone on another, when all's brought about, Is not left, as falseness nor cheat. The work will go on, 'tis of God, can't be stayed, Though its agents unpopular be ; And may, being human, some veerings have made; Yet truth, ultimately, we'll see. Offenses may come, we'll not marvel at that The good may be scourged, made more good, The dross more apparent by every attack ; And shaking, the dross will exclude. Let us who have long borne the title, and claim Pre-eminent heirship thereto, See to it, and never dishonor the name, By vaunting ourselves more than due. Be wise as are serpents and harmless as doves, Discreet, take good care not to hurt ' The oil and the wine' in religion and loves; No good may we ever subvert. 'T were better a millstone were hanged 'bout the neck, Than one who owns Christ we offend. The work is momentous, keep human in check, And let Divine wisdom transcend. That wisdom is peaceable, — being first pure,— It raiseth its subjects above The gross elements, and will help them secure, A mission that worketh by love. Ah who, more than Shakers, that people should be To whom will be turned a pure speech ? * May nominal Shakers of every degree Work in the reform this will teach. Then we must divide between Spirit and flesh, Make use of the sharp two-edged sword And pray that God's spirit may dictate and bless Each sentence, and every word. Success to ' The Shaker !' let all raise one prayer: ' Our Father, and Mother Divine: As one, bless our efforts, and help us prepare Thy Zion in glory to shine.' Canterbury, N. H. * See Zephaniah, 3: 9.
