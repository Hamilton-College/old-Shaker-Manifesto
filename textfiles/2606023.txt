A Tribute to the Memory of Elder JOHN B. VANCE. By Ada S. Cummings. The golden sunset's splendor, With its rays so calmly sweet; Settles down on all so tender, When the day's work is complete. And its radiant cloudlets, gleaming As a beautiful, brilliant light; Unfold the twilight's beaming, Betokening the night. Away in the glimmering brightness, When its power enchants the soul, We may see our father's likeness, Where the rays of light control. And there, through the golden beauty, With the radiant spirit band, We know he entered safely The beautiful 'Summer Land.' Ere the last, bright sunbeam fadeth Shutting out the golden light, We may catch a gleam of rapture From our father's home, to-night. We may peer beyond the cloudlets, When the sun sinks in the west, But the mystery we can not fathom Of Eternity's sweet rest. But we love to think of our dear one Beyond the sunset land, Arrayed in spotless garments, With the purified angel band. Beside the crystal streamlet, Where the purest waters flow, 0 there, at my life's sunset! 1 too, would like to go. And when the twilight deepens, And Time's dark shadows fall, May we all, like him, be ready To obey the Keaper's call. He responded to the summons When his work below was o'er; When he saw the golden beauty That was gilding hill and shore. He knew that angels waited To bear his soul away, Into the Holy City, Into the realms of day. Now when the evening twilight Comes flooding o'er the lea, We'll think of thee, our father, Immortalized and free. Sahbathday Lake, Me.
