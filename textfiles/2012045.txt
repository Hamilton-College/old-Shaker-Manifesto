LIGHT. 'Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.'ï¿½ Isa. lx: l. Canterbury, N. H. 1890. Light of lights, beam on my way, Bearing more of truth each day, Shining thro' the realm of thought, Eternal life revealing. What a Father's wisdom loves, What a Mother's care approves Teach me, for my soul would move Within thy brightness ever.
