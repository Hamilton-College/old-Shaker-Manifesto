Kind Treatment Pays X. A. Willard in his new 'Butter Book,'' says: 'It is really astonishing what a large difference in the yield of milk it makes by attending properly to a number of small things in the man agement of stock—and things which to many would seem quite too insignificant to be worth observing. The dairyman should have a genuine, a hearty love for the animals un der his control, providing wholesome, nutri tious food, pure water and pure air—every thing of this kind in abundance; keeping the animals properly sheltered from storms feeding always with great regularity; paying the most marked attention to the manner anc time of milking, withal, preserving uniform kindness and gentleness of treatment throughout every operation—a gentleness extendec even to the tones of the voice. Generally speaking, the cow will do her best that is loved the best and petted the most in hei charge. If you wish a cow to do her best, you must cultivate her acquaintance intimately, and be unsparing in little acts of kindness.'
