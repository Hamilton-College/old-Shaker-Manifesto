A grape vine growing upon a ranch near San Diego, California... A grape vine growing upon a ranch near San Diego, Cal., has attained to such gigantic proportions that it has prostrated an oak tree to which it clung. The tree was perfectly sound and measured two and a-half feet in diameter and sixty feet in height, yet the vine has torn it bodily from the ground. This immense creeper covers several hundred square yards and the yield of fruit is prodigious. The owner declares that from the part of the vine which ruined the tree fully five tons of grapes were gathered.
