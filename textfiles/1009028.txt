PROMOTED A little form stood by my side, The eager look I notedâ€” '0 teacher when vacation's o'er, Say, shall I be promoted ? 'Nay little one, you have been ill, The tasks would be severe.' Then coaxingly, ' Would you not like To tarry longer here ? ' ' It is not you I wish to leave, You're always good and kind, But when my mates are going on 'Tis hard to stay behind.' The blue eyes filled with sudden tears, I stroked the ringlets shining, But well I knew the tired, feet Would stumble in the climbing. The weeks flew by, and once again, In their accustomed places, I saw the children of my charge, With welcome in their faces. But one I missed ; no earthly care May be to thee devoted : Thj' wish is granted, happy child, And thou hast been promoted. O sad, reproachful eyes of blue, 0 tears that dimmed their shining! O tiny feet that struggled on, Nor faltered in the climbing ! But one the Teacher great and wise Hath rightly gauged thy powers, O, may the high and lofty place, Through grace at last be ours.
