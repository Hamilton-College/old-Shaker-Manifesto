THE ETERNAL ONE. BY MOODY CURRIER. Oh! tell me, man ot sacred lore, Where dwells the Being you adore? And where, 0 man of thought profound, Where can the Eternal One be found? Throughout the realms of boundless space We seek in vain His dwelling-place. He dwells where'er the beams of light Have pierced the primal gloom of night; Beyond the planet's feeble ray ; Beyond the comet's devioiis way; Where'er amid the realms afar Shines light of sun or twinkling star. Above, below, and all around, Th' encircling arms of God are found : Where'er the pulse of life may beat, His forming hand and power we meet: While every living germ of earth, That sinks in death or springs to birth, fs but a part of that great whole Whose life is God, and God the soul. From plant to man, below, above, The power divine still throbs in love. He is the life that glows and warms In tiniest mote of living forms, Which quick'ning nature brings to birth,. To float in air, or sink in earth; And every shrub, and plant, and flower, That lives an age, or blooms an hour, lias just as much of God within As human life, or seraphim;ï¿½ For all that bloom, and all that shine, Are only forms of life divine ; And every ray that streaks the east, And every beam that paints the west, With every trembling gleam of light, With every gloom that shades the night, Are but the trailing robes divine Of One whose garments ever shine. The human soul may bend in love, And seek for blessings from above, As well in busy haunts of men, In forest gloom, in silent glen, As in the altar's solemn shade, Beneath the domes that men have made As well may seek a Father's love, And ask assistance from above, Amid the ocean's solemn roar, Or on its barren waste of shore, As in some distant promised land, Where sacred fanes and temples stand. The sou), that beats in sweet attune, Finds in itself the Eternal One; Nor needs to seek for other shrine Than God's great temple all divine. Boston Journal.
