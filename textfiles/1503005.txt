Kind friend; I hope this will find... Lowell, Mass. Martha J. Anderson� Kind Friend ;�I hope this will find you well in health, as I am pleased to say it leaves me quite Avell, also my family. Since my visit to Mt. Lebanon last winter, I have often, yea very often thought of the great kindness I received from the Brethren and Sisters of the North Family, and I have often wished that I might speak so it could be understood how much I appreciate the same, for surely the seeds of love and truth that were sown in my heart at that time, have taken root; I feel a growing desire to thank all who have in any way taught me to be a better man. I often ask myself, how it is that every one is so good to me, and that go where I will, I find friends. I wish it was so that I could leave my business again and compare notes of experience with friends at Mt. Lebanon. I say with friends, because I have a particular feeling of love for, and confidence in those friends ; knowing I am better understood by them than others elsewhere. Then, there is another thing I find welling up in my heart. It is that I am lonesome almost all the time. Now, I have just aa good a home as I could wish for, botli in New Hampshire where my family live, and in Lowell, Mass. where I spend most of my time. I am �surrounded in my business relations and �elsewhere with persons who are ever ready to help in time of need, yet for all this, I feel a desire to fly away from �everything to the place, where for the last twelve years I have felt I would like to call home. I am very sorry I did not spend a little more time with my friends at the North Family, as I would like to have them know more about me, and I think I could have learned much that would 'now be a help to me in many ways ; but the truth is I felt heart sick, and knowing I must return to Lowell, made me feel very sad indeed. When I left my good brother, Elder Frederic, I fully expected to see him again next day, but after leaving him I began to feel so very lonesome that I made up my mind that if I stayed much longer I should not be fit to leave at all, as it was it was hard to breah away, and I suffered much for months after I got back to Lowell, and having no one to whom I could tell my feelings, made me feel dreadful; but �such is life. If I had an opportunity I would like to tell you of my home in England, and the reason of my leaving it. I have seen some trying times in my life, that is, for one of my nature, others possessing different temperaments may have felt otherwise. I was 53 years of age the 27th of last February, and when I look back as it were over my past life, I can but feel to thank God with my whole heart for a something within me that tells me there is such a thing as love and truth. I have heard some say there is no such thing as love. Now I think that is false, and I can prove it, to my own satisfaction, for I feel the happy effects ot it in my own heart. I oftea think of those younger sisters I saw in the sewing room, and speak of them to my friends, how far better off they are than those of the same age that are in the Mills. I have a number that work with me, and they are quite good girls ; but they look very different from those happy young sisters I saw at Mt. Lebanon. My little girls have pale, blue faces, and I fear in these hard times many of them are often hungry. How thankful I am to know that some have their needs supplied, and kind loving friends to care for them. I wish I knew enough to express to you how I feel in regard to the word duty. I am often told by one and another what is my duty as a Christian. For years back I have eudeavored to follow the wise counsel given as far as I could, though that was precious little. I was troubled, and came to the conclusion that I must consider the matter for myself. I then began to question what was my duty, as I really wanted to do right. The first duty I found Avas to look after the interest of Hie Company for whom I work; made a duty because they paid me so many hundred dollars a year. I admit that is my duty. The next, what is my duty to the Church? After thus thinking, I began to feel ashamed, and ask myself another question. Is there any duty I owe to the Church? The answer came in this wise. God forbid that I should ever feel as a duty anything 1 can do for the Church, for my family or for the good of my fellow man. Since then, I have seemed to live in a different climate. Siuce then, I have been working because I have the privilege to work. Yea, I thank God I have a privilege to do right, to love the Church, to love the Brethren anc! Sisters to love my family and the privilege of helping my fellow man. I am not tired now, I can work because I love to work, and I get well paid for it in more ways than one ; and I believe if we live to our high privilege as Christians we may enjoy much that is in store for the faithful. I have very pleasant recollections of good Eldress Antoinette ; her autobiography I have enjoyed reading, and so have others. I find many of my own feelings expressed therein, better than I could express them myself. Of course you know that business all over the 'country is very dull. The question I hear asked over and over again, how do the times look? My answer is, they look bright. My experience teaches that after clouds, there will be sunshine. Those who are cleai -sighted may see the signs of the times, and profit thereby. I often think that it is possible for us to be too well off in this world's goods. I must now begin to close, and as I do, I remember with much love the Brethren and Sisters with whom I exchanged friendly greetings, and indeed, my love flows to all whose object is to live for truth and right. If I have presumed too much in writing to you I hope you will forgive me. 1 felt that I must speak to some one. I now feel better than when I commenced, and if you can make out in part how I feel, I shall be thankful. 1 have received the December number of ' The Manifesto ;' have noticed page i.84 and thank you for it. Please remember me to all my kind friends at Mt. Lebanon. I wish them to accept my everlasting love. Yours for truth and right. j. w. G., Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
