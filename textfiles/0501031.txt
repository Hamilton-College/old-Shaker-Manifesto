EDITORS Editors cannot always help themselves. They are at the mercy of the agents they employ. But the engagement of such agents ought surely to form one of the sacraments of life. A man who undertakes to report what he sees, or hears, ought to make truthfulness his religion, and to be ready to cut off his right hand rather than let it write down falsehood. The lies and slanders which go up and down the land, blighting fair fames, impeding holy causes, and doing the devil's work of perpetuating evil, will take decades of years to undo. And on the authors of those misrepresentations will lie the heaviest guilt — the guilt of perverting good to evil, of wantonly turning the best instrument of truth to the base service of falsehood, and of betraying the confidence reposed in them, and thus weakening trust between man and man all the world over. — Charles Vosey
