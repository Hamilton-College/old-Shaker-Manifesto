ANGEL WATCHES. BY HORACE B. DURANT. Earth hath her mysteries, Round which eternal shadows ever blend; And life is mantled in a darksome guise, Mortal can never rend. Could we have vision clear, As one of old, touched by the Prophet's hand, How closely would this world of ours appear Linked to the Spirit Land ! We, mortals, see it not, Yet sometimes on imagination's wing, We almost reach some fair, seraphic spot, And hear its music ring. Through golden gates ajar, At times, we hear some broken thrilling strain, That sweetly floats down to this world afar, To soothe its grief and pain. We seem at such a time Akin unto that brighter world that lies Beyond the misty river's marge—that clime Unseen by mortal eyes. Oh ! when the lonely heart Grows weary of earth's hollow hopes and fears When all its clinging ties are torn apart, And graves grow thick with years, 'Tis then the soul doth feel A longing for a better world than this ; And shining messengers at times reveal Its dreams of lasting bliss. We never are alone— E'en when bereft, we weep beside our dead, For there is round us many a watchful one, With soft and loving tread.
