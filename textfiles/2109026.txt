Groveland, N. Y. Aug. 9, 1891. 'A lesson in itself sublime A lesson worth enshrining, 'Tis that we take no note of time Save when the sun is shining.' With this bit of wisdom full in view, we renew our note making as the rapid transit of August, the august month of the year is fast receding. We are reminded that a few more sunsets will forever cancel summer from the 'year of our Lord' eighteen hundred ninety-one. Farmers commenced thrashing wheat last Friday morning. The music of their steam thrasher may be heard from early morn till evening late, and the dusty, wearied appearance of the workmen as they retire from their day's labor brings proof that some must be the 'bread winners' in this land where two extremes, 'Capital and Labor' meet. We wonder as we listen to the ceaseless tramp, tramp, tramp, of the mighty throng as they hurry and scurry, each grasping for the largest loaf, how and when and where will end this constant contest for the 'staff of life.'' Yet we know that 'He who hears the ravens' cr.ll, Will not forget his children But will give a rich supply Of his boundless blessing.' A heavy rain and thunder storm spent its fury here about midnight of the ninth inst. and every one says that every body thinks that something somewhere got struck, but as no one can locate the striking point, we are certain the storm returned free from a strike. The harvesting of hay was accomplished in good time and we learn, of the best quality. A few bushels of peaches grown on Groveland soil have found their way here again for a wonder: these with harvest apples secured through the work of an enterprising Sister, furnish healthful food for brain and muscle. Long live the apple and next live the peach. Long live all fruits that live within our reach. G. D. G.
