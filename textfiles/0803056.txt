Edward Fowler At Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Jan. 31, aged 78 years, Edward Fowler . Of this beautiful spirit, so long and faithfully known as Trustee of the Society, it may most truly be said : 'None knew him but to love him, 'None named him, but to praise.' Though his departure was soon to be expected on account of^his age and infirmities, yet his loss will be deeply felt, and his memory remain as an evergreen among the people.
