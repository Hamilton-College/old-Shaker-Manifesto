AFTER MANY DAYS OLA LEONE WHITCOMB Toward the hour of evening, the ships tha launched for me Will come sailing proudly in across the hays, And the worried hopes and frettings which they bore out on the sea Will come back as golden treasures, after many days. In the sober gray of Autumns, when the leaves are falling down, All the seed I scattered in the smiling Mays, Shall their heavy heads be bowing, till I bear them home at night, And my garners fill with riches, after many days. Sometimes the morn will open with a drear and mourning dawn, And the sun will hidden be, beneath its maze, But my heart shall never murmur, for I know it needs the rain, And the light will smile upon me, after many days. While the winter winds are blowing, and the frost is on the pane, While the blinding snow is piled along the ways, I remember June will follow, in the path December trod, And the flowers will wait my coming, after many days. Oh! the road I'm treading daily, seemeth weary and perplexed, Through a labyrinth of thorns and stones it lays, But it will be brighter sometime, and my feet have stronger grown, And the distance will be shorter, after many days. Ah! after many days will the yoke I've barely borne Carry lighter, and reflect the golden rays Of the holy light of heaven, and my heavy cross will be Transfigured to my shining crown, after many days.
