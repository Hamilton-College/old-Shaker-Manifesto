Enfield, N. H. Sept. 1898. The past month has been an especially busy one for the sisterhood, in caring for numerous companies of visitors. One day seventy-eight individuals called, of which number fifty-eight partook of dinner. While consecrated strength has been given to care for temporal affairs, the educational, spiritual and social duties have not been slighted, and we are pleased to record the kindness of friends who have added their gifts with ours to help brighten and edify the lives of our own kindred. Our towns-lady, Inez Packard, a late graduate of the Boston School of Oratory, kindly entertained us for an hour, with various selections of prose and poetry. On another occasion, Mrs. Ida Harrington, of Worcester, Mass, entertained us with music and songs of a high order. As occasional intermissions, some of the youngSisters sang and rendered recitations. We also entertained for a short period, the Kev. M. W. Borthwick, of Manchester, N. H. While with us, he delivered an impressive lecture on Temperance. Among many fine remarks he said, what we would not tolerate in our individual lives we ought not to tolerate in our society. As a people, believing that God takes more notice of our deeds than of our sentiments, we can endorse the above counsel, knowing,He that knoweth what is right and doeth it not committeth sin. Companies of Sisters attended the camp meetings held at Lake Sunnapee and Wilmot, N. H. also the Vermont State Fair. Those who sold fancy articles, report good results. We drew first premium on braided and knit mats, bread, onions and beets. George II. Baxter.
