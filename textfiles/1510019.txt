POLITE MANNERS. Cultivate your manners while you are young and when you are more mature they will come quite easy and natural. To obtain good language is something for which every one should strive. It is not always the correct speech that is considered nice language, although very necessary but the government over the words that we utter is the essential point that I wish to illustrate in my life, as well as on paper. There are so many hasty and improper words spoken without even a thought of the result in the minds of those to whom they are addressed. Now, when you think, has not the mind as much rule over the tongue as it has over the fingers? Every part of the body is really governed by the mind. First have the mind pure by being careful what you read, who you associate with your thought. Now have these perfect and I assure you, there will be less trouble with that great and unruly member the tongue. I have read that silence at times is golden, but I think that truthful, kind, and sincere expressions coming from a good heart are more golden because they accomplish more good. Ida May Farwell.
