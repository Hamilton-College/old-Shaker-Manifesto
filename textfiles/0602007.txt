Reply Dear Doctob: So magnanimously have you admitted so many points in my article, that I can well afford to elucidate the one exception — national debts, entailed by a living generation, upon a generation unborn. At first view, your argument for debt appears plausible, if not logical. Let us look at it a little deeper. You see and admit, that ' Laws, based upon the principles of Right, as set forth in the Cincinnati Convention article — equal citizenship and equality in landed property — would give wonderful impetus to improvements in every civilized country.' Why so? The causes of war being removed, the concentrated energies of nations would be devoted to creating, not destroying. War-ships, monitors, rams, cannon, ammunition, rank and file of army and navy, in time of peace, like the present, would be saved as surplus capital. When right so far prevails over might, that woman co-operates with man in legislation, destructive war will be a sheer impossibility. Then a tithe of the money, now wasted in wars, will make all the improvements, in one generation, that that generation has the courage and capacity to project. Accumulated capital in property and scientific inventions will approximately annihilate space and time, by great national works, as they have already done in railroad travel and telegraphic communications. '' Owe no man any thing ' — individually, nor collectively — is a sound practical maxim. Let us try it, for as many generations as we have been running in debt, and then compare results. We are so near now to total depravity, in Church and State, that almost any change will be improvement. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. F. W. EVANS
