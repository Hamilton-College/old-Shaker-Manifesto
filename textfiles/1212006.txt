AT LAST. When on my day of life the night is falling, And, in the winds from unsunned spaces blown, I hear far voices out of darkness calling My feet to paths unknown. Thou who hast made my home of life so pleasant, Leave not its tenant when its walls decay; 0 Love divine, O Helper, ever present, Be thou my strength and stay! Be near me when all else is from me drifting: Earth, sky, home's pictures, days of shade and shine, And kindly faces to my own uplifting The love which answers mine. 1 have but thee, 0 Father ! Let thy Spirit Be with me then to comfort and uphold; No gate of pearl, no branch of palm I merit Nor street of shining gold ; Suffice it if—my good and ill unreckoned, And both forgiven through Thy abounding grace— I find myself by hands familiar beckoned Unto my fitting place : Some humble door among Thy many mansions, Some sheltering shade where sin and striving cease, And flows forever through heaven's green expansions Thy river of Thy peace. There, from the music round about me stealing, I fain would learn the new and holy song, And find, at last, beneath Thy trees of healing, The life for which I long. John Greenleaf Whittier.
