CITY OF LIGHT Andante. Canaan South Family. 1. There opens before me, invisions of glory, Bright scenes of that fair summer land, 2. When the rude storms of life and its tempests have ended, Sweet praises our hearts shall employ, C1 Where, in beauty and Where the soft, bal my A grandeur, God's City of Light A beacon for ever will stand; zephyrs of soul cheer ing love Brings gladness replete with true joy. There, pure crystal fountains forever are Invision I see thee, thou beautiful flowing, Whose rivers make glad the oppress'd, City! There's nothing so lovely below; f And music supernal breathes tidings of And, when I've relinquish'd the ties o* this peace, To earth, To m welcome the pilgrim to thy bliss ful mansions I'll rest, go.
