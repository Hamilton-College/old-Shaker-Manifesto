South Union, Ky June 30, 1890 Beloved Elder Hi.nry :ï¿½Our wheat threshing will be over in about ten days. It is now blackberry harve.-t wil h us, m&gt; that we can have them on our table. Young Irish potatoes are also on the table. Strawberries and cherries are gone. Raspberries are far on the way. Weather extremely hot. Mer. from 75 to 102 in the shade. I have painted the Venetian window blinds on the Ministry's dwelling. It was rather venturesome for a man who has passed his 84th. milestone, especially to take down and replace those on the second story. H. L. E.
