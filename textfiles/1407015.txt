THE BLESSED MASTER. His hands were liarden'd with carpenters' tools, His sandals were dusty with going afoot: He was all unlearned in the subtle schools ; He was meek and lowly and destitute. The fox in the hill-side burrowed her home ; The bird in the branches builded her bed ; The King of the earth to his kingdom come Owned never a roof to shelter his head. But oh, the grace of his loving face ! The touch of his tender hand ! What joy to stay by his side; alway. As he went through all the land ! To hear him talk in the daily walk By the vineyard or the wheat, To know he has blessed the couch of our rest And the poorest food we eat! Urania Locke Bailey
