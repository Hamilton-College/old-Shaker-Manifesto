TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON. By Aurelia G. Mace. 'The Lord is in His holy temple ; let all the earth keep silence before him.' 'His foundation is in the holy mountains.' THEREFORE, 'my heart is inditing a good matter.' It is of the 'Mount Lebanon Cedar Boughs.' A book the literature of which is of the highest type; gems of poetic genius, written by the Queen's daughters whose clothing is of wrought gold. By them it is dedicated not only to the household of faith, but to all souls in the wide, wide world. They are boughs from the Cedars of Lebanon. The trees are still there, waving in grandeur and beauty. They are poems sent forth to enlighten and educate and to make manifest the intellectual power that has been attained in the spiritual, communistic life. Under no other condition can a door be opened for such a pure and refined education as that gained in the home that has been prepared, whose foundation is in the holy mountain. Here in this favored retreat, minds have been disciplined until sordid desires have been subdued, selfishness destroyed and the animal nature overcome. From this altitude they look upon the children of men, ever ready to lend a helping hand to draw them up to the higher and purer life. It is to this cause they give their strength from day to day. But as they give they renew their strength from the overflowing fountain of God's love. They walk and do not faint,�they run and do not weary. Here also is found that mine of intellectual wealth from which these Cedar Boughs have emanated. We read one poem,�it is beautiful and we want to call your attention to it. We read another,�it is equally good; and so from the beginning to the end of the book. The Mother in the Diety is here made manifest. The Mother in the New Creation here stands in her place. The virgins that follow her are brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work. With gladness and rejoicing they come, for grace is poured into their lips. They ride prosperously, because of truth and meekness and righteousness. Thus the Cedars of Lebanon wave in majesty, distilling dew and sending forth 'Boughs' for the healing of the Nations. The Daughters of Zion have arisen to thresh and to beat in pieces many peoples, and they will 'conseciate their gain unto the Lord and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.' Amen. Even so let it be. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
