GUERNSEY CATTLE GUERNSEY CATTLE. There has been a feeling widely prevalent that milk and beef were antagonistic qualities, that a gÂ°od milch-cow would necessarily make poor beef. Tacts do not sustain this notion. Shorthorns are often great milkers, and such cows, when dry, fatten well. The Dutch cattle fatten well also, and so do the Devons, and yet both, especially the former, are famous for milk. The Guernseys have been bred for milk and butter, and at the same time for beef points. The yellow color in the skin and in the butter has also been cultivated, so that it is exhibited in an extraordinary degree. The cows average fully one fourth and possibly one third heavier than tke Jerseys, and give on an average a proportionately larger quantity of milk. After they have been longer tested, no doubt there will be found many cows which will compete closely with the famous Jerseys so well known as great milk and butter cows. American Agriculturist
