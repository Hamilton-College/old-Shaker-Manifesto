GOD THE MOTHER. [Contributed by S. W. Ball.] The Father has been the ideal of modern religious worship. The time had not matured for the final mystery of godliness to be finished in the revelation of His Femininity. Hardly has the time come for the common religious thought to comprehend the Fatherhood, in the person of the humanity as manifest to the world in Jesus the Lord. Common sense ought to teach the mind of man that the righteous man�when matured�is both the image and likeness of God, but it does not. Even after God's revelation of himself in his own human form and office as the regenerator (reproducer, hence Father,) the Son-of-man, the Son-of-God, the Church fails to comprehend the true character of the Christ. It pretends to worship him as God, but it does not do so, for nothing will exasperate themodern, common, orthodox 'Christian' more than to set the Lord Jesus, the man of Bethlehem, forth as the incarnate Deity in his fulness. Is the Christ, as declared, the fulness of the Godhead bodily? Did Isaiah spea.k truly when he declared of him: ''Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father?'
