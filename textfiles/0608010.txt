RECORD OF A REMARKABLE FAMILY References have been made in The Shaker to the remarkable data connected with the Wells' family, and so many quotations have been made from our paper concerning the same, that we would now correctly put on record the birth and death of each member. Eleven of the fourteen died in this Society — Shakers, N. Y.— leaving only the father, and an infant,* as exceptions to this rule. ' He liveth long who liveth well;' but it is a fact, whether commune life is commended better or not than the more contracted spheres, that it tends greatly to longevity.
