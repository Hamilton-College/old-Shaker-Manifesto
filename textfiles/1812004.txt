FOREBODING. Oliver C. Hampton. Sad forebodings are unwise for two reasons and for these they should not be indulged in. 1st. Such sad anticipations may never be realized and then we shall have had all our sorrow for nothing. 2nd. Such indulgence in forebodings of evil does not fortify, but weakens our courage to meet and cope with scenes of adversity when they come into our experience. Some minds of unfortunate construction, cannot easily parry these temptations to fearful anticipations of coming evil. Still it must be and is possible, to educate one's self out of such mental predisposition. Unshaken faith in God's goodness and love, his wisdom and constant care for us, is a great and glorious boon. Paul says we cannot have this of ourselves but that it is a gift of God. So much the better�we can pray to our Heavenly Father, and most assuredly receive this precious faith, and this is a grand substitute for that spiritual vacuum wherein we feel with Jesus 'Of myself I can do nothing.' Indeed fervent prayer is most salutary and avails mightily in lifting the sincere spirit above the sorrows and crude rudimentalisms of this earthly existence. Gloomy thoughts of the future are unhealthy, both to body and mind. Whatever affects the mind, affects in a corresponding manner and degree, the entire physiological structure in all its functional and organic relations. Joy and peace create health�sorrow and discouragement�disease. We can habituate ourselves to make the most or the least of our blessings. And on the disposition we make of our condition much depends. But above all it is unwise and unhealthy to anticipate evil, which we are not certain will ever come to pass. One of my good ancient Elders once told me a little anecdote which will well illustrate this. One night he was going to mill with a grist, (he said) when a boy about twelve years of age. A very terrible thunder shower was darkening the Heavens. He came to the conclusion, that when he arrived at a certain hill some distance ahead of him, he should certainly be killed by lightning. He was awfully frightened at this coming destruction. He however drove on an:! when he reached the hill sure enough the artillery of Heaven played round him iu the most awful manner. But in one moment as it were all his fright was taken away from him and he was filled full of gladness and joy, and never enjoyed any scene in his life before nor since, more than he did that awful and sublime thuuder shower. And for years and years afterward it filled him with joy to hear heavy thunder. 'From that day to this' said he (and he was then an aged man) 'I have never had the slightest fear of thunder and lightning.' So all his fearful anticipations of death were for nothing not only, but in point of fact resulted in one of the most enjoyable scenes of his whole life. Well, we have fallen on fearful scenes of adversity, cyclones, years of drought, diminution in numbers and strength in Zion ; yet let us watch and pray, struggle and toil, faithfully keep all good Order ; and then be sure our God will not, cannot forsake us, but in the end crown us with the blessing of well-spent lives in the promotion of all good, ''and a crown of Glory that fadeth not away.'
