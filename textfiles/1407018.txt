COME OUT OF THE MIXTURE. DANIEL FRASER. Inspiration is more common than it is generally thought to be. As there is a wisdom which is from beneath so (here is also inspiration from that quarter. In all great events for ill, or for the welfare of the many, Inspiration is generally apparent. In smaller affairs it is not so palpable ; the good and the evil get mixed up ; and the attempts at separation are generally also of a mixed character. In created things, the lines between animation and vegetable life runs so closely, as to be undiscernable. But of the difference between the whales of the ocean, and the cedars of Lebanon, there is no dispute. Hence the lesson from created things is, if you would know which is which, 'come out of the ' Mixture. ' The lower emotions swamped the Adamic Church, swamped the Jewish and the Pentecostal Churches. Hence, to give perpetuity to the church of the 'Latter Day,' come out, and keep out of the 'Mixture.' He who is out of the 'Mixture,' his eye is single. They who are in it are uniformly part ' Ashdod. ' Aud if popular and influential, 'Ashdod' will the more certainly cling to them. ' The righteous shall not make haste. ' Wait a bit. Clear jour perceptives ; be. sure that your emotions, every oue of them, are free from the trail of the snake ; then go ahead. But not so fast as to damage anybody. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
