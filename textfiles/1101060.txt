Farm Tools. Farm tools will rust out sooner than they will wear out. Many farmers injure their farm implements more by exposure to the weather than by the use on the farm. An implement which witli good care would last twenty years, will, when exposed to the weather, become use less in five years, or even less. A farm-cart which, with good usage, would last almost a lifetime, will last only a few years when exposed to the weather. The reason why farming does not pay with many is found in this neglect to take care of the farm tools. All farm implements are costly, and the farmer who has to buy three or four times as many as his neighbor, because he does not, take care of them, of course will not find much profit in farming. The same carelessness in any other kind of business would ensure equally as disastrous results. Lewiston Journal.
