THE CHRISTIAN'S PRAYER. MARGARETTE DAVIS. 'Our Father who in heaven art,' How good to pray to Thee; And 'Hallowed be thy holy name' Is sweet command to me. 'Thy kingdom' let it come; 'Thy will in earth be done,' As e'en in heaven above, And so transform this world below, That all thy perfect love shall know. 'Give us this day our daily bread,' Our Savior taught to pray. For living bread, our soul's great need We ask anew to-day. Forgive us Lord our trespasses, As we forgive those, who May chance to trespass against us; The perfect lives are few. Oh in temptation leave us not But grant us saving grace. Deliver us from evil, Lord, That we may see thy face [power For thine is the kingdom, the glory and Our merciful Father forever and ever. Canterbury, N. H.
