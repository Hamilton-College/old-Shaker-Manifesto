THOU ART OUR GOD EUNICE HUNTINGTON O Lord Thou rulest in the Heavens ; Thy footprints on the Earth are seen; Oft warnings from Thy voice are given In mercy to the sons of men. Ah who Thy voice will recognize, Although in thunder tones it sounds \ And who to Heaven send forth their cries, 'While e'er thy mercy still abounds ! The elements are in Thy hands, The watery depths move at Thy will; Thy laws we may not understand, But of Thy mercies know full well. 64 MANIFESTO. THE SHAKER For Thou didst call by Thine own voice Our souls from Sodom's dark domain; By inspiration, prompt our choice, O'er sin and death to rise and reign. May many thousands hear the call And bravely struggle for the prize; Of earthly claims abandon all, Nor fail to sever carnal ties. That in Thy kingdom they may stand, All clad in spotless robes of white; With palms of victory in their hands And heads bedecked with crowns of light. Abundant mercies of our God Are manifest in gifts of grace ;â€” Thy Son and Daughter, by Thy word, Have brought redemption to our race. Forever hallowed be Thy name, Thou glorious Being all divine ; All hail the Everlasting Twain, Whose brightness thro' the ransomed shine Enfield, N. H.
