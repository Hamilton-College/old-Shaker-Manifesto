THE TWO ANGELS. God called his nearest Angels who dwelled with him above: The tendercst one was Pity, the dearest one was Love. ' Arise, ' he s-aid 'my angels! a wail of woe and sin Steals through the gates of heaven, and saddens all within. My harps take up the mournful strain that from a lost world swells. The smoke of torments clouds the light and blights the asphodels. Fly downward to that under world, and on its souls of pain Let Love drop smiles like .sunshine, and Pity tears like rain! ' Two faces bowed before the Throne veiled in their golden hair; Four white wings hastened swiftly down the dark abyss of a if. The way was strange, the flight was long, at length 1 lie angels Ctune, Where swung the lost and netherworld, red-wrapped in rayless flame. There Pity shuddering wept, but Love with faith too strong for fear, Took heart from God's almightiness, and smiled a smile of cheer. And lo! that tear of Pity quenched the flame whereon it fell, And with the sunshine of that smile hope entered into hell! Two unveiled faces, filled with joy, looked upward to the throne, Four white wings folded at the feet of Him who sat thereon! And deeper than Hie sound of seas, more soft than falling Hake, Amidst the hush of wing and song the voice Eternal spake. Welcome, my Angels! ye have brought a holier joy to Heaven! Henceforth its sweetest song shall be the song of sins forgiven. Selected.
