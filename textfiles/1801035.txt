A Refreshing Drink A drink that is truly refreshing for one suffering from sore throat or cold, is made by pouring a quart of boiling water over a carefully washed handful of Irish moss. Let it stand until the water is cool, then strain through a muslin bag; add sugar and lemcn juice, with a few thin slices of lemon, until it is about like a mild lemonade; a little cinnamon is considered an addition by some people.
