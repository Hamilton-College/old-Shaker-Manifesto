NOTES NOTES. Are we Christian professors ? Then are Ave pupils in the school of Christ. ' EArer changing, eATer aiming toward a higher, better life. ' As Ave seek after truth, Ave develop and exalt Christian principle in our lives. As we, grain by grain, conquer a worldly pride and ambition, we find ourselves, in the same ratio�clothed upon Avith the beauty of humility ; as Ave deny self, we grow benevolent; in seeking to be impartial, we become universal in our loAre and sympathy. In whatever virtue one strives to excel, by the grace of God, downward tendencies are Aveakened, and ' Evil is overcome with good. ' The fleshly inheritance is wasted, and the kingdom of God opens to our view, proving the truth of the text�' If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine. ' The religious teacher Avho would effectually impress his charge with the beauty of living the Christ life, must himself be imbued with the spirit of Christ, to warrant his doctrine effectual, his example safe and his influence spiritually attractive. It is a poor Christianity which* has to watch itself lest it betray sensual Ioa'cs or Avorldly tendencies. The truthful man need not guard his lips lest he speak falsely, or the pure man his deeds, lest he appear unseemly ; for if the heart is directed toward the kingdom of God, the effect of its influence upon other minds will be to lead thereunto. Those Avho have experience in the Christian warfare of self-denial, who haAre really fought the battles of the Lord, through the testing discipline of life, are the only competent Christian leaders. Whoever attempts to preach Avhat he do2s not practice is like unto ' one beating the air, ' or as ' a sounding brass and tinkling cymbal, ' Avithout the effect of the vitalizing poAver. 'Let all Avho name the name of Christ depart from iniquity. ' Let them ' put their hands at Avork, and give their hearts to God, ' in earnest desire that the 'kingdom come' on the earth, and the will of God be done by every Christian professor, so far as his light and knoAvledge may extend ; and then will the harvest be at hand. Said a good sister one day, ' If there is one good aspiration more to be coveted for our Church and for all other churches in America, it is this,- -' To hunger and thirst after righteousness' until we may be filled. Are there many Avho can sing the beautiful psalm of David in these days and sympathize in his spiritual longings�'As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God ! ' ' My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.'' We predict that until this longing preA*ails in every Christian church, especially in our own, there will be few Pentecostal seasons realized, and few souls saved unto God. At a recent meeting of the Century Club in N. Y. : four religious theories Avere discussed, as the great question of the day is being asked, 'What shall avc do to be saved?' Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism and Agnosticism Avere brought forAvard by their respective advocates, and each held up sa the redeeming feature of the age, and by which all men may be saved. In all probability these same orders may require several more seasons for the ventilation of their peculiar views before all men will decide to accept either one as an infallible standard, and then throwing the others entirely aside. The divine authority of the Roman Catholic Church and if the Pope may answer the demand of that people, and shorn of the persecuting spirit, it may be privileged to do much good. The Protestant Church, fragmentary in its existence, has its basis on the Bible, but in many matters of vital interest is fouud to be wonderfully near its mother church. Judaism has the credit of an ancient name and as here represented would be called very liberal, admitting as the � speaker did, that there was good in every religious order that had morality for its basis. The Agnostics have what they term a scientific and humanitarian Church, but think that the] day for religious churches is past. Of course they have a perrect right to form a Church agreeably to their own taste, and if it has no religious principle to govern it, ihey may perhaps, bring in a little science to occupy the place. We may suppose that these representatives of the several forms of religious belief satisfied their own minds with the illustrations which they had given, but we have learned that a religious faith and a religious life are quite different, the one from the other. The apostle renders this unquestionably plain, 'Show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.' ' He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city. ' These theological views as generally presented, bear about the same relation to religion as the chaff does to the wheat. All the churches assume to preach peace and yet they advocate the use of the sword. The spirit of Judaism is full of war. The religious history of either sect is one of cruel and bloody persecutions. The Jews were even spiritually instructed in their cruelty. 'Blessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war and my fingers te fight.' It would be difficult to reconcile this spirit with the advanced thought of the day and denominate them peace-loving churches, or to believe that they are willing that all should grow into the knowledge of the truth and be saved. Either might be reconciled to have all men saved by passing through their narrow and selfish gate while the one in the ascendancy with this dominant love of power, would rule the others with a rod of ironTo do unto others as we would that they should do unto us, has the sound of a kind regard for the welfare of man. All that are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons and daughters of God. It is this divine spirit that brings the redeeming feature and not the dogmas of any particular church.
