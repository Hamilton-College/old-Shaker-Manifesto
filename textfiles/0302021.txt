ANALOGY By Marcia M. Bullard Deak Editkess—Observing in the January number of the ' Shaker and Shakeress,' an appeal for the Waste Basket, I contribute my mite for the support of this honorary appendage of an editor. While contemplating the beauties of God's work with his creatures from the earliest ages to the present time, I see a beautiful analogy of the past in the present. That work which was foreshadowed in Israel finds its anti-type in Zion. In ancient Israel, animal indulgences were atoned for by animal sacrifices ; thus typifying the present work of God, wherein the animal nature of man and woman is slain, and the inspirational influence of Divine Love lifts the soul above the base desires of that nature, up to a higher plane, illumined by the light oi his countenance. When I look abroad upon the face of the earth, and behold the Spirit of God ' moving upon the waters,' striving to raise souls from the horrible pit of indulgences, by the many reform movements in operation, I ask, is there one spot on this fair earth, so far redeemed from the blight of sin, that purity can reign supreme ?—a place where woman no longer forms a part of man ; but, as pre-figured in the prophetic allegory of creation, is taken from his side, and made an independent entity, united to him only in works of righteousness, pure love, kindly feelings ?—where the highest aspirations are to form the Angel character, by a total denial of all wrong appetites, and unchaste desires, thus completely ruling over self? And an echo rolls across the troubled waters, from the dual-masted ' tiny craft,' in answer : There is! and we delight to bear the glad tidings of peace, love and joy in the life of Christ to all people.
