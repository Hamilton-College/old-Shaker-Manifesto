Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1891. As I attempt to write something that shall in part represent our branch of the vineyard, I am puzzled to know just what to place upon paper, as so many subjects crowd before the vision. If the power of expression came as freely, what beautiful thoughts one might place before his readers. How true it is, that the 'songs unsung' and the 'words unspoken' are the sweetest. No lack of material for thought but language often fails to fulfill its intended mission, even when expressed in good faith. Suffice it to say, in our home, every moment of every day has assigned to it, some duty, all of which we may make 'labors of love' if so disposed, and glad are we of this, for duty faithfully and cheerfully performed, gives joy and present satisfaction. We do not envy those who sigh for the weary, tedious day to pass, that night may come bringing its round of gaieties, that make the young, old before their time. We have reason to believe that this style of living is passing into ill repute, even among our sisters abroad, and a more 'sensible view of life's responsibilities as beings destined for Eternity, are taking its place. Last year, one thousand corn-planters were manufactured here under contract; this season only five hundred are wanted, which looks as if all had not heard of this new device for corn-planting or had concluded to let the crows help themselves while they I plant in the 'good, old-fashioned way.' ! The new invention covers securely as soon as the corn is dropped. Our ice was harvested in January, and parties who came from far and near last season to obtain this necessity have evidently procured it nearer home. Some quite warm, pleasant days have j been ours to enjoy, in spite of the severe I cold. At times the thermometer has reg- j istered eighteen and twenty degrees be-! low Zero. Cold enough, and yet, thus : far, no epidemic worthy of note, (as was j the impostor of last winter,) has assailed us. E. B.
