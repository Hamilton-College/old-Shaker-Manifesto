SETTLED AT LAST! It will be seen by the following from the Christian Union, that ' the vexed question ' of the reading of the Bible in the public schools, has been settled in Ohio, and settled rightâ€”that is, against the Bible: At length, after a tedious experience of legal delays and uncertainties, the resolution of the Cincinnati School Board, prohibiting the reading of the Bible in the common schools, has gone into effect. The resolution was adopted Nov. 1,1869 ; and its operation as a law began September 1,1873, the Supreme Court of Ohio having dissolved the injunction against the board which the superior court had granted. The principle of this decision will eventually be accepted by Protestants generally as a true definition of the relations between Clrirch and State in a Republican Government. It presents, moreover, the only basis on which it will be found possible to defend the common school system against its most insidious foes. So far so good. Now, if there is praying and any kind of religious reading in those schools, let that be prohibited also, and confined to the churches; and then the schools, being placed on a secular basis, justice will be done to all parties, and the sectarians will no longer have an opportunity to ' rule or ruin ' thebest institutions in the country.
