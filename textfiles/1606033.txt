RULES FOR WRITERS 1. Be brief. This is the age of telegraphs and stenography. 2 Be pointed. Don't write all round a subject without hitting it. 3. State facts, but don't stop to moralize. It's drowsy business. Let the reader do his own dreaming. 4. Eschew prefaces. Plunge at once into your subject, like a swimmer in cold water. 5. If you have written a sentence that you think particularly fine, draw your pen through it. A pet child is always the worst in the family. 6. Condense. Make sure that you really have an idea, and then record it in the shortest possible terms. We want thoughts in their quintessence. 7. When your article is complete, strike out nine-tenths of the adjectives. The English is a strong language, but won't bear too much 'reducing.' 8. Avoid all high-flown language. The plainest Anglo-Saxon words are the best. Never use stilts when kegs will do as well. 9. Make your sentences short. Every period is a mile stone, at which the reader may halt, and rest himself. 10. Write legibly. Don't let your manu script look like the tracks of a spider hal: drowned in ink. We shan't mistake any one for a genius, though he writes as crab bedly as Napoleon. 11. Always have a heading for your arti cles; and if you wish to rebuke a vice, or an error, mention its name, and don't whip all around a stump, without bringing your whip-lash directly upon the object of your article.
