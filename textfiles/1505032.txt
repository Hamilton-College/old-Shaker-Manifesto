ALMOST SUNDOWN Sidney Smith. I am looking over my labors By the light of the setting sun: For I see by the lengthening shadows That my day is nearly done. My work for the blessed Master Is drawing towards its close ; Far lbss have I done in the vineyard Than I hoped when morning rose. And yet, while the daylight lingers I will work as well as I may, Nor waste the remaining moments Kegretting a misspent day. And 0 ! if now in the vineyard, Are any led there by my hand, I give you this word at our parting, As near to the gateway I stand. Do all you can for the Master; Do better than I have done : And then, when the day is ended, You may welcome the setting sun. Selected.
