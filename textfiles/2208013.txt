Dear Children;--''I pray God your whole spirit and soul...'' Enfield, Conn. June, 1892. Dear Children;'I pray God your whole spirit and soul be preserved blameless.' Your lives will be blameless if you 'bring your thoughts in subjection to the obedience of Christ.' Good thoughts are lovely guests. 'Your thoughts and actions will bless or blight your spirits.' Make the habit of choosing' in every act and thought the habit of choosing right, and it will soon become so much the habit that the opposite course will be impossible. Be firm in your endeavor to shun all wrong forever. Never stray, 'from the high path of duty,' and you will never regret it. To discard evil and cultivate goodness is to beautify your lives. Purity is a heavenly ornament. Strive for it with soul earnestness. Purity is soul-elevating, vice is soul-darkening. The earlier you are saved from sin the better. Be pure in the present, or you will have grief in the future. It hardens the heart to live in sin. Sinful pleasure is short, but the woe is long. Lose none of your soul wealth. It requires self-denying struggles to form true Christian characters. Do your best work in character-building. Think less of self and more of others. Give kindness and strength to each other, to grow better means often to suffer. Store your minds with spiritual things. Grow in grace. Make rectitude your aim. Wrestle for the heavenly prize, you can win it if you are wise. Shun the society of the vicious. The influence of pure associates is refining. 'Pure company will make tlie heart To virtue more inclined, But bad will misery impart, And vitiate the mind.' Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
