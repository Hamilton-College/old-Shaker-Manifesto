SUNSHINE BREAD Mrs. Garfield An extract from a letter written by to her husband ten years ago is quoted by The Student of Hiram College, into the hands of whose president it accidentally fell: ' I am glad,' Mrs. Garneld wrote,' to tell that, out of all the toil and disappointment of the summer just ended, I have risen up to a victory ; that the silence of thought since you have been away has won for my spirit a triumph. I read something like this the other day : There is no healthy thought without labor, and thought makes the laborer happy. Perhaps this is the way I have been able to climb up higher. It came to me one morning when I was making bread. I said to myself: here I am, compelled by an inevitable necessity to make our bread this summer. Why not consider it a pleasant occupation and make it so by trying to see what perfect bread I can make ? It seemed like an inspiration and the whole of life grew brighter. The very sunshine seemed flowing down through my spirit into the white loaves, and now I believe my table is furnished with better bread than ever before.' [Any woman who can write such a letter, having its sentiments originate in her sincere heart is worthy of being the first lady of our nation.â€”Ed.]
