Union Village, O. Aug. 1894. As I passed down the road to the ferry from Pleasant Hill to High Bridge over Kentucky River. I noticed the trees and plants which cropped out from the crevices of the romantic cliffs, perpendicular walls, hundreds of feet high, which rise on each side of this wonderful stream. This scene of cliff, tree, plant and flower, was one of profound silence. Yet here was an invisible energy at work, sufficient to raise a million tons of water into the upper air. From every crevice between the layers of rock, sprang a tree or lesser plant, some so tiny as to be scarcely visible. Perfect peace and concord reigned. No pushing, jostling or contention were here. Contentment and peace pervaded the tiniest plant, the most inconspicuous shrub and the tallest tree. The admirable and inspiring effect of this scene, was not produced by any one object, but by the natural, spiritual combination of the sublime whole. All organizations, from the tiniest plant to the tallest tree, from the smallest insect to the elephant, seem to move in harmonious contentment with themselves and their environment. How beautiful, how inspiring THE MANIFESTO. 217 this vital energy which calmly goes on, 'yesterday, to-day and forever,' in the soundless silence of the fields and woods, the rocks and valleys. Why are peace and contentment to be found everywhere but in restless, roving man? There are good and all-sufficient reasons, which in due time shall be satisfactorily explained to every rational being in existence. When Archimides discovered the law of displacement, he exclaim ed,'Eureka! I have found it.' This is the point I profess to hail from in my experience : not as boasting by any means, but for the comfort and encouragement of others who are dismayed at the pertinence of the above question. We are contending with the present prevailing drouth, in more ways than one. Our dry-house and laundry wood-shed was burned on the 18th of July, ult. The laundryj itself had a close call, but was saved by our tank and hydrant system. We have had two field fires since, but neither was very disastrous. There is no clew to our first fire. We have had no fire in the dry-house for three years. As each of the fires came far short of what they might have been quite a pleasant margin is left for thankfulness and for saying as our beloved Brother Peter Boyd used to say, '-'It is well it is no worse.' We are watering trees, plants and flowers daily and have been for weeks. Notwithstanding we meet unpropitious circumstances occasionally, we manage to keep a good degree of cheerfulness and good nature through it all. Our harvest is abundant. Hay extra good. Barley and oats good. Wheat averages 23 to 25 bushels to the acre. One field of oats, (16 acres) yielded about seventy bushels per acre. I have seldom indeed read any thing more edifying or spiritually uplifting than the Editorial in the August No. entitled 'Purity and Unity.' May the Manifesto, which is replete with good things, long wave'Clear as the sun, fair as the moon and terrible as an army with banners.' 0. C. Hampton.
