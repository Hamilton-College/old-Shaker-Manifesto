MORNING DAWN Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Zion shall arise and blossom like the rose, Her glorious light shine forth to the islands afar, As when the star of Bethlehem arose. The wilderness shall bloom, hills and valleys rejoice. Woodlands sing for joy, and the barren desert smiles To hear the Saviour's voice. Thus saith the Lord, it shall yet come to pass, Many people and strong nations shall come to Jerusalem to seek and to pray before the Lord. Chorus to be sung at the end, of each repeat. Hail! all hail, the coming day I Hail! all hail, the coming day.
