Watervliet, N. Y. Mak. 1891. It is a general time of health. No one sick. This is a great blessing. Ice and snow are plenty, but we are having a few warm days, and the snow and ice may disappear. The South family have been putting in a hot water heater to warm their sewing room, and it has proved to be a complete success. This is much better than a coal stove as it warms the room more evenly. Believing that cleanliness comes next to godliness, they have fitted up a new bath-room with all modern improvements. There seems to be some rivalry, to see which family will have the best care and present the best appearance. This is a move in the right direction. The Second family have made some improvements in the cooking of food for the stock. They have introduced a boiler for heating the water and also for steaming the food. They also have a silo, and of course the butter which they make must be number one. The gardeners at the Church are sow86 ing their tomato seed in boxes, and looking forward for early plants. We have one hundred lambs from our flock of sheep and all are doing well. As a Community we are prospering in temporal things, and are also striving to gather the fruits of the spirit. J. B.
