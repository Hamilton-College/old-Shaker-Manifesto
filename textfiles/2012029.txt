Groveland, N. Y. Since 'brevity is the soul of wit' Hence wit to brevity is allied, The grandest sermons oft are found Where brevity, wit and soul abide. Where soul and wit and brevity reign The sunbeams linger longest there, And briefest music wakes to life The soul of earthï¿½the songs of air. The good old-fashioned Indian summer weather the kind our fore-fathers were acquainted with, made its first appearance on the first of the last month of Autumn; judging from the bright sky and warm sunshine we concluded the nice weather had come to stay for a few weeks, but the ever restless weather like the restless Indian, onljT came to go after a brief stay of two days, and the genial Indian summer has been supplanted by the rain, the wind, the cold and the snow. Some of the busy plowmen are plowing and preparing the soil for spring crops, while others are gathering up and gathering in the fruits of farm and garden, making ready for zero weather whenever it is ready to take up its abode here, and the ambitious house-keepers are early and late trying to renovate the home with brush and broom, fresh air and water, the best mediums at our command. The roads are just paved with mud of the plastic order, rendering carraige drives quite impossible, but evaporation produces no better conditions for they soon become so completely dotted with hills and valleys that whoever and whatever passes over them are immediately converted into pitchers and tumblers. This fall records the greatest fall or failure in preserving the potato crop. The harvest was great, yet the potatoes are few, and rapidly decaying. G. D. G.
