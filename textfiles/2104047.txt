Enclosed, find Postal Note of one dollar as subscription to Manifesto. Long may it live to disseminate the life-giving truth of the gospel of Christ. 'Notes about Home1'1 are always a source of great pleasure to me. Br. D. Orcutt's article on 'Life is mostly what we make it,' is to the point.

Yea, Brethren and Sisters, I earnestly pray that I may truly and unflinchingly live the teachings of Christ and our blessed Mother Ann and thus gain the 'honest soul's reward.' Your Brother, Wm. W. Bellmire.
