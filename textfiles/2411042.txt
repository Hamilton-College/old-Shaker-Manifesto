SHAKERS AND SOCIALISTS. To the Editor of The Tribune. Sir: Having just read in Monday's Tribune R. G. Horr's able article, 'Socialism Run Mad,' I wish to recommend, not only to Socialists, but to all of the thinking class in society, that they read it carefully and without prejudice. The Socialists are striving for that condition which it is utterly impossible for them to realize, only in the Church of Christ's Second Appearing in the female the Shaker Churchthe Church of the 'Great American Republic.' 'That which is born of the flesh ia flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.' 'The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage,' but the children of heaven live pure, celibate lives in this world, and are engaged in establishing the Republic of Heaven on earth, where they have all things in common. An attempt was made after this sort by the Apostles at the day of Pentecost; outwardly it was a failure, but they left a spiritual seed behind which culminated in the establishment of the Shaker Church, 120 years ago. The seed took root then, and is now bearing its fruit. The Shaker communities are so many signs in the spiritual heavensmanifestations of the signs of the timesof Christ in the female part of man. Woman is the natural organizer of earthly homes, and much more so of heavenly homes. Your friend for equality, CHARLES GREAVES Mount Lebanon, N. Y., Sept. 20, 1894.
