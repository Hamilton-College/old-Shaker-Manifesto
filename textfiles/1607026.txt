A STORY ABOUT TREES. If we should get all of the sap out of one tree it would die for the want of something to drink; all trees and plants would die if they did not have water to drink just the same as we eat and drink. The trees have very long roots which could not be dug up without being broken. In the Winter the leaves die and fall off the trees and leave the trees bare. The trees look as though they were dead but they are not. In the Spring they have new leaves and they look as bright as can be; then the buds come and then the blossoms come and after some weeks the fruit comes. Then when it is ripe it is picked and fixed for market or put in cellars to keep through the Winter for family use. The cherry tree bears small red fruit with a small stone in the middle. I think the peach is a very nice fruit. Sadie.
