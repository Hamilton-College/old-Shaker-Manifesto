THE DOG. In the barnyard there is a dog and it is a Shepherd dog. This dog will sometimes bite and sometimes he will not bite. He is kept to drive the cows home from the pasture. One day my Grandmother sent her dog to the store before he had his breakfast with a basket and a note m his mouth. And when he reached the store the man took the paper and the basket, and gave it to him ; and when the dog got out of the store he smelt meat. He let go of the basket and ate the meat all up. When he reached the house, Grandmother took the basket and looked in the paper and found it empty. So she went to the store and asked the man if he had read the note, the man said, he had and had given the dog what was called for, which proved to Grandmother that the dog had eaten the meat all up, because she had sent him without his breakfast.
