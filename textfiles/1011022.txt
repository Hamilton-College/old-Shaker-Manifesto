THE PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT Amos Lawrence once said, when asked for advice, ' Young man, base all your actions on a principle of right; preserve your integrity of character; and, in doing this, never reckon the cost.' A noble sentiment, expressed by a worthy man. But a different sentiment is expressed to-day by men who have influence on account of publicity, who have worshipers, on account of talent, but who, by a peculiar juxtaposition of opposite natural tendencies, or, rather, by a reckless inconsistency of example, speak, in thunder tones, to young men that are ready to take advice: Young man, sacrifice every principle of right for the sake of selfish ends ; and, in doing so, never stop to count the cost to yourself or to society. An ignoble sentiment, but too frequently expressed.
