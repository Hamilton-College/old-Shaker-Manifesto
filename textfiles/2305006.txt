Sacred to the Memory of Sister Hannah R. Agnew. Let us pause for a moment In time's solemn march, And dwell on the theme of to-day; Far out on the ocean In life's failing bark, From time we are bearing away. Away to that clime where The shore is unbroken,� Fair land of our beautiful home; There our Sister with angels In glory unspoken, Encircle the heavenly throne. A royal diadem, peacefully wearing, A purified robe, lily white; She has lived for the Lord, HANNAH BLAKE. THE MANIFESTO. 113 Now his favor is sharing,� Joint heir in his kingdom of light. In memory we honor, And call her most blest; Our Mother, our Sister and friend; Self-sacrificing as we now attest, Faithful and true to the end. On the evergreen shore, In groves ever blooming, Dear Sister, thy home is sublime; A little while yet, And we'll meet with you there, In eternity's blissful sunshine. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
