My Gospel Mother:--Let me be one of the first... East Canterbury, N. H., Feb. 1892. My Gospel Mother :Let me be one of the first to congratulate you on this your natal day. As I write I am thinking how good it will be to have you recover your health. To me the house has almost lost its rest, its quiet and social relation. But with these passing days, I can think, think of the life I have left and of the life I am going to lead. As you know my highest ambition is to lead such a life that I may be blessed of God. I feel that my mission on earth is to do good. When you think of me let this be the thought; 'There is a young man who is trying to live a pure life.' My ideal of a Shaker is a worker, a live worker for the up-building of our Zion home both temporally and spiritually. ] believe these will be the principles that will make this gospel increase. This is the kind of a man I wish to be. I would be clothed in the full armor of true manhood in the gospel; cultivate pure thoughts, sacrifice myself and always be working for the interest and welfare of my Brethren and Sisters, who are my greatest treasures on earth, so said Father James and I want to be able to say thfe same. Believe me, 1 am sincere. Perhaps the following words may please you: they interpret my feelings. 'So keep up heart and courage, friends. For home is just in sight, And who will heed, when safely there, The perils of the night?' And so I look through all the clouds I meet and the trials and temptations of life and think;'I have an aim in life and I will reach that height if it takes my whole life to gain it.' With love and many prayers for your speedy recovery, I am, Your gospel son, Wm. T. Cranston.
