HARD PAN APHORISMS Any kind of an honest job is better than no job at all. Take a dollar a day for your work if you can get no more. A man's best friends are his ten fingers. When,, country boys come to the city, if they will hold on to the old sweet ways they can defy the world. Keep your grip on the hard pan of principle and good conduct, and you will be men of good name and good fortune. When a boy fills a house with bugs, he is all right, provided he don't run after humbugs. He has the makings in him of a great naturalist. A good farmer is better than a poor doctor, and a good horse-shoer is better than a bishop who preaches sermons that nobody wants to hear. A good day's work of what you can best do is the hard pan to which all must come. Society says one thing, and nature says another. Work is good medicine.
