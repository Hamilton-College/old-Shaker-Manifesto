LIFE'S VICTORIES. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. I'll follow Thee, O blessed Guide, Till all thy walks I trace! 2. To 01 i vet how oft retired, Blest mount of praise and pray'r ; 3. Hath not each soul a hallow'd place, A chalice and a shrine, And seek the fields where Thou hast won The corq'ring strength Where aspiration spread her wings, And soared from ev' An altar pure, where Christ shall bring The bread and liv of gracery careing wine? I The struggle in the wilderness, Temptation without sin; 'Tis When trials compassed Thee around, How sacred that retreat, A The garden with its agony Faith's final test may prove; For here the glorious lessons Of life's grand victories begin lone to pour thy soul to God, And heav'nly unction meet. God each human heart shall try, Till perfect in his love.
