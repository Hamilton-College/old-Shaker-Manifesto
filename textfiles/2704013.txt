Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. March, 1897. Before these lines reach every branch of our Zion, there will have been a very important move made. Canaan, the land spoken of in Scripture as 'flowing with milk and honey' will soon be desolate, as her inhabitants are fast leaving to take up their abode in a land deemed more desirable in a temporal point of view. Enfield, Conn., is their place of destination. Some have gone before to prepare the way; by the first of April all will have left for their new home. While Enfield gains in sMount Lebanonthe accession, Mt. Lebanon loses not only in numbers, but a large proportion of its spiritual life and substantial good. The family attended meeting with us on the sixth, and spent the day as a farewell visit. Sister Fannie Tyson, for many years a member of this familyï¿½Mount Lebanon several days at Mt. Lebanon. Br. Wallace Rogers' companion, and three small children are incorporated in the large family group. We are striving to keep the spiritual interests of our home uppermost. Our frequent meetings tend to quicken the dor- mant faculties of the unregenerate man and woman and help also to bring into union and harmony the diverse elements that are naturally disintegrating. With thankfulness for the good that is, and hope for Zion's increase. Ever striving to reach the best, we are with you. Martha J. Anderson.
