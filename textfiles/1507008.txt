GOD. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. Perhaps there is no word in the English language that is used so often by both professor and profane persons as the word God, composed of only three letters. And perhaps there is no word so little understood when used in an unlimited sense. Who by searching ever did or ever can find out God unto perfection ? And yet we may leaim and know all that we need to know to make us wise unto salvation, by Revelation, and by his works. We need not look beyond the starry regions to find God, because lie is every where present. God is 'Spibit' not a spirit, for that would imply a finite being like ourselves. The difference between God and man is, the former is infinite, the latter is finite, and in his present condition, is not worthy of comparison. God is Spirit, and infinite filling immensity�all space�and no place in the universe where he is not. He knoweth all things. We can have no secrets hidden from him. He keeps a record of the human race. His infinity covers the whole ground. We shall not fear to meet him i'n judgment, if we keep his commandments and serve him through love. Although there are lords many and gods many, yet to us who believe, there is only one living and true God, not a descendent of the Egyptian priesthood, nor of pagan deities, but the God of the universe 'in whom we live, move and have our being,' 'who works in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure, ' possessing the attributes of father and mother in the Godhead. Romans, i., 20, revealing Himself indiscriminately, to all nations in the nineteenth century, who rules in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of earth. Man is a compound being made up of soul, body, and spirit, and originally was the offspring of God. Acts, xvii., 28, and will be again, when redeemed by the cross of Christ. His body was created for time, and must die and return to dust, and never have a resurrection ; but his soul and spirit were created for eternity, and must live forever. He was created.for a higher and nobler purpose, than to spend his time in this world in carnal recreations, and vain amusements ; ' enjoying the pleasures of sin for a season,' and then pass into another sphere of existence, either higher or lower, according to what his earth-life has best fitted him for. We repeat God is Spirit, self-existent, unlimited, and undefinable. Man is a spirit, and recognized as such, when he says, although absent in body, I shall be with you in spirit, and at the same time he may be some thousands of miles distant. How can this be unless man is a spirit, and as such, is a part of God? ' Lo ! I am Avith you, alway even unto the end of the world, ' said Christ, and his disciples understood him, whether in the body or out, it is just as true now, as it was when it was spoken. Although his disciples cannot see him with their natural eyes, because Christ is a spirit�a spiritual man, and woman in this day. As God is Spirit, his kingdom is spiritual; his people are spiritual; and at times abound in spiritual gifts ; for �' where there is no vision, the people perish. ' And in all things, the spiritual should have the pre-eminence. Because we cannot see the Spirit with our natural eyes, shall we deny its existence, and say there is no spirit? If we do, we deny God. Because we cannot see the wind with our natural eyes shall we say there is no wind? John, iii., 8. What is man that he can withstand the wind in a cyclone? One of the natural elements, representing God? All things are possible with God which do not conflict with his spiritual laws, by which He governs the universe as well as by his natural laws.
