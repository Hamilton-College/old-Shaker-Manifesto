Canaan, Vt., August 12,1874 Elder F. W. Evans — My dear friend — Your kind favor of August 10, inviting me to be among you upon the occasion of your social gathering, was duly received. And, though against my heart's wishes, must say it will be impossible for me to be present, in body, owing to previous lecture engagements. But I promise to be with you in spirit and the fellowship of heart, which seeks the good of common humanity. Created social beings, it is eminently proper to occasionally meet and mingle upon the intellectual and spiritual planes of life for mutual benefit. Such seasons, comparable to oases, are highly enjoyable. Often do I mourn, because deprived (traveler and pilgrim as I am) of the privilege of oftener meeting congenial souls — those whose sympathies are aflame with reform; whose aspirations reach up to the heavens; whose natures have been quickened by baptismal fires, and who, standing upon the mount of vision, walk even now with the angels of the resurrection. The date of this assures you I am in Canaan, where lecturing upon spiritualism, and reflecting upon the signs of the times, there comes to me this old hymn: ' On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, and cast a wishful eye. To Canaan's fair and happy land, where my possessions lie.' The banks of mortal life are truly ' stormy ' and almost fainting by the way, we often cast ' wishful eyes ' toward spiritual Canaan the Zion of eternal peace and rest. Do we see alike the signs of the times ? The old theological heavens and the political earths are being rolled up like a scroll. The social world is in a terrible ferment. The devil seems let loose for a little season. Surely ' the judgment is set.' And yet, beyond present storms are lightning skies. God has not forsaken the world ; Christ angels are inviting ; the reapers have come and are thrusting in their sickles ; the chaff and stubble of fashions, forms and creeds, and man-made institutions, are being burned up by the unquenchable fires of eternal truth. The granite rock of righteousness is laid bare — and upon 'this rock,' with its seven thunders and seven steps of holiness, an order of society is being built, against which the gates of hell cannot prevail. Weary not, O brothers and sisters, ye are the first fruits, prophesies of the coming harvests. Upon your forehead the angels have written the word Faithful. The teachings of purity, peace, and ' all things in common,' are based upon the foundation of eternal truth and justice. They lead to heaven, to salvation, to-day; to the Zion of our God. I must come up to Mt. Lebanon — the New Jerusalem of the country and century — this fall. I recently had an excellent letter from Elder Eades, of South Union. He is rich in faith, and full of hope for the future. Remember me most kindly to all present — ' One family, we dwell in him — one church above, beneath.' My sincere prayer is, that God and good angels may bless you, one and all. Most cordially thine, J. M. Peebles
