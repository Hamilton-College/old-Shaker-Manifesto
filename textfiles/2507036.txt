FEELING IN RELIGION. 'Feeling is of just as much use in religion as steam is in an engine; if it drives the engine it is good, but if it does not, it is not good for anything but to fizz and hiss and buzz. There are some people who seem to be like yard-engines that never go anywhere, but keep puffing, blowing and hissing, and running up and down side tracks doing nothing, going nowhere. Feeling in religion is of no value at all if it does not propel us along the track of duty toward our final destinationGod. Fine feelings, glorious feelings,we all have them after our own measure; but fine feelings, quick responsive sensibilities do you know that they have been the occasion of the ruin of some of the greatest geniuses that God ever gave to the human race? Feeling is a miserable, cheap substitute for duty. It takes more than being happy on Sunday in church to be religious. My friends, true religion never stops short of holiness. It means that first and last. Religion does not stop at feeling; religion does not stop at tradition, or at respectability, or to ecclesiasticism, or at eloquent preaching, or delightful music. Religion means, always has meant, always must mean, the actual communion of the human soul with God in righteousness and holiness. And that kind of reThis THE MANIFESTO. Hi!) ligion costs; it takes the best there is in a man to be religious in that way.' Rev. J. Parker.
