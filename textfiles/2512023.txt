-Alfred., Me. Nov. 1895. This is the last opportunity we shall have to greet our gospel relation and the readers of The Manifesto this year, and we can not let it pass although our offering is but the Widow's mite. The President and the Governor of our State have set apart a day in which to give thanks to the Giver of all good; but we feel like giving thanks every day for the many blessings we enjoy. Our barns and cellars give evidence of temporal blessings, and our hearts can count with greater thankfulness the beautiful gifts of the spirit. The Apostle while telling of the future coming of Christ was not quite sure as to the manner of his appearing, but felt sure that at the appearing they should be like Him. He has appeared to us the second time without sin and the testimony of 284 THE MANIFESTO. this second coming will make us like Him if we are obedient to it. The November Manifesto was filled with good things. 'Sheaves of Experience' was most excellent. The Editorial 'Double Dealing' was very good and interesting. The quotation from Paul to Timothy 1 think is more sensible in the New Version. We are well along in the eleventh month of '95 and death has kept far away from us,for which we give thanks. At this writing we are enjoying the warm pleasant days of Indian summer, but a week ago two inches of snow fell. October 23rd we enjoyed a short call from two worthy Sisters of New Hampshire. Eldress Eliza Stratton, whom we have met before and hope to again, and Sister Sadie Webber. Both were made welcome and will be again if they come this way. The past three months we have been selling our milk instead of the cream as formerly, which proves more profitable thus far. Fannie Casey.
