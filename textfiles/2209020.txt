Shirley, Mass. Aug. 15. 1892. Beloved Elder Hestey :We have recently had a short visit from Elder Geo. Wilcox. These occasional reunions are very comforting indeed. They are flnone too frequent, however. We have finished our hay harvest which is not so large as we have had, but of a good quality. Eye, very good, the threshing of which is one of present occupations. The straw being called for as fast as we can get it to market. It is no news to tell of hot weather; we have reason to think all have had a full share. Corn promises well, as a consequence. How fast the seasons roll on, and how much food for thought they yield. I have been much interested in the articles in the Manufacturer and Builder. They would make a very interesting book. We still keep up fervent desires for a breaking away of the darkness, and the ushering in of the more perfect day. J. W.
