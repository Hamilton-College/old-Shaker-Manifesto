Rheumatism At this season of the year rheumatism is usually prevalent. Some of our most distinguished men were included among the sufferers during the past month. It is one of the most democratic of diseases, for it spares neither rich nor poor. Exposure to cold is the only known exciting cause of acute rheumatism. Sleeping in damp sheets, and sitting in cold, damp rooms, after having been heated by physical exercise, are examples of the kind of exposure likely to be followed by this disease. Standing in the street to chat to friends after a vigorous walk, is equally dangerous. In fact, any condition which prevents the skin from throwing off exhausted matter by perspiration is liable to result in acute rheumatism. Prevention is far better than cure, especially in this disease, for the reason that those who have once been afflicted are almost certain to become victims again. Some doctors consider that it is hereditary. Injudiciously changing the weight of underclothing brings on the twinges. Not long ago there was reported to us the case of a man who had had a very severe attack caused by substituting wide woolen drawers for an old tight-fitting pair. The lesson taught by this is that the new ones should be washed a few times before it is safe to put them on. The pleasant drafts of air which render life more endurable during the hot summer nights too often pave the way for the rheumatic affections of the winter. Europeans in very hot climates, to secure sleep, make such free use of the punkah, or fan, that they acquire a form of rheumatism against which no remedy can be wholly successful. General Briere de PIsle, of France is one of the number. He was so exhausted from lack of sleep that he had to instruct his servants to work the punkah without ceasing. Herald of Health.
