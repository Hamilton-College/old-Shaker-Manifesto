�Watervliet, N. Y. Second. Family. Apr. 1894. With spring, Mother earth is awakening into life and activity and while we are preparing the ground for planting that we may realize a harvest for the sustenance of the natural body, to our mind it seems quite essential that we also prepare the spiritual soil of our soul, that we may plant and reap a harvest of spiritual food to sustain the spiritual and immortal part THE MANIFESTO. 117 of our being. We are pleased with the efforts of our Brethren and Sisters everywhere who are daily striving to further the gospel work, and our hearts' best feelings go out to the faithful few who are now engaged in spreading the gospel in California. Our Sister Cornelia R. Powers and her son of San Diego have been earnestly engaged in this work for several years past. They have been very desirous ofjjestablishing a Community of Believers in that land, and it looks as if the time has come to have their prajers answered. In a letter from Sister Cornelia dated Nov. 26, 1888, she says, 'I have so often thought that it would be one of God's highest blessings if we could have one of your Communities here where for so much less hard labor you could have much better returns, and there are so many young people who are in need of such instructions as they would receive from you.' And from that time on, she has continued to strive for the conversion of souls to the Shaker faith and principles, we have sent her Believers' publications and The Manifesto, and she has been faithful to distribute them. We hope for Bro. Dowe and Sister Cornelia much success in their missionary work, and if we can not do much at present for them, we can at least pray for and encourage them in their efforts for good. There is one thing sure, nothing is gained without a sacrifice, and blessed are they who are willing to work for humanity's good by giving up all for Christ's sake and the gospel. May all Zion's inhabitants awaken to the needs of the hour for certainly 'the harvest is great and the laborers are few.' Let not our lamps go out for want of oil, which is the testimony of eternal truth against the evils, that would lower the standard and drag us back into the vortex of worldliness and sin. Let Zion offer a universal prayer, that the Pentecostal Spirit may again descend and baptize us with fire and the Holy Ghost. Let us pray in faith, for it is written, 'Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened unto you.' Let us persistently knock at the gates of heaven, until they are opened, by confessing a^id forsaking our wrongs and walking in newness of life, that we may obtain the resurrection power of God;� 'Awake, arise, O Zion, No longer sleep nor slumber, For the Lord Almighty Is passing through the earth. He will sound his holy trumpet 'Twill sound from pole to pole, And gather many people To Zion's peaceful fold. Isaac Anstatt. North Family. April. 1894. Our daily life should be that which enables us at times to pause and consider the momentous question,�What are we living for? We hope that it is not to have the 'mark of the beast' placed upon us by serving self so supremely that we forget our duty to our fellow creatures. Br. Alonzo's definition seems on reflection correct; though we had not thought to consider it in that light. Br. Arthur W. Dowe's suggestion shows a desire to help the poor and oppressed; but would need great judgment in directing it. We fully agree with Elder Oliver that, first this should be a home for the soul, a place for those who are tired, not merely of the external conditions of human life, but weary of the lusts of the flesh and the mind, are willing to obey the injunction fully to 'come out from among them that ye be not partakers of their sins.' Those who are willing to obey this spiritual command are welcome to all of the temporal blessings. The month of March was exceptionally fine. Very few stormy days. At present writing, April 1, it is delightful spring, which makes one anxious to be delving in the soil. But we will probably have all we want before the season is over, and be ready to exclaim for very weariness in the labor of subduing weeds. But we will try to gather some of the inspiration ministered to us in our Church 118 THE MANIFESTO. service to-day when the congregation sang the result of the Grippe which visited us 'Conquering Legions.' We will he one factor that goes to make up that mighty host. Hamilton DvGraw.
