Be Encouraged When dark spirits, round us stealing, Storm the castle of our heart, Let us, to our faith appealing, Bid them, in God's name, depart! Why, with clouds dark o'er us rolling, Veil the radiance of our sky, While bright angels, 'round us calling, Come with sunshine from on high ! All above, around, is beauty, Sun by day and stars by night; Happiness our only duty, And in God our sole delight. Every pulse that beats to heaven, Every thought attuned to prayer, Every tear to pity given, Is a crown of glory there. There each stream is music flowing, And each breeze is melody, Heart to heart in union growing, Soul to soul in purity. See the golden chain ascending, Joining earth to heaven above ; See bright glories with it blending, And its links all formed of love. E. T. Leggett. Union Village
