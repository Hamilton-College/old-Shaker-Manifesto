SPRING-TIDE OFFERING. Martha J. Anderson. Our hearts abound with gratitude and praise this beautiful Sabbath ; as we walk abroad with expanded vision we feel our spiritual senses quickened and our souls seem filled with the rythmic harmony which pervades the Universe. The quiet, restful hue of nature's mantle, formed of the blended shades of blue and yellow, signifying intellectuality and spirituality, indicate harmony, and bring mind and soul in unison with the Great First Cause. We exclaim, 'Verily, the heavens declare his handiwork,' and the earth emparadised in glory speaks of his wondrous love ! What beauty we behold around us, from tiniest blade of grass, to leafrobed monarchs of the forest; from lowliest flower that grows in woodland shade, to pearl and ruby clusters which cradle summer's fruit. What precious symbols of spiritual promise to the soul! Unfolding virtues cherish the germs of perpetual bliss. In the rush of daily duties, and the all-absorbing burden of earthly cares, we pause not to view the tender tracery veining every leaf and flower, or to admire the endless variety of beautiful forms designed by the great Artist ; neither do we fully appreciate the rich landscape pictures laid out on the broad canvas of nature, that are continually spread before our eyes. A true conception of the sublime as revealed in terrestrial things helps to develop the higher faculties of the soul, and brings us to a fuller consciousness that 'In man there is all there is in nature, he is the microcosm of the macrocosm, that is, the universe in little. We all have our seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter. All there is in earth, sky, sea or water, there is in man.' What grand possibilities yet to be unfolded; what glorious states to reach, and what precious fruitage to perfect! [n this calm and holy season, let us drink in the psychic life, pervading all things; the mysterious and potent force which sustains the innermost soul; and while we are enjoying the present, realizing the Divine Presence and blessing, let us not be unmindful that there are millions of our fellow beings who have not a foot of land to dwell upon, and who can scarcely claim any rights of mortal existence. Justice demands that all should have a home. Selfishness and monopoly are the ghouls that prey upon society, aggrandizing the blessings God has given as a free gift unto all His children. Let us help to roll forward the car of progress where equity sits enthroned. Our work, our effort and our zeal must be concentrated in the home that is based on righteous principles ; an asylum for the sin-sick and weary. Ours must be 'a city set on a hill which cannot be hid,' and in the years to come, earnest, truth-loving souls will flock to Mt. Zion, asking, 'How hath this people prospered, ho.v have they sustained an organization which is a glory and honor in the earth?' And the response will be. ' 'By casting out self and sin ; by living in obedience to the laws of God on the higher plane.' One whose chief desire was to reform the world, sadly remarks, 'As we turn heart-sick from one failure to another of experiments, social, political, benevolent, religious, directed to getting crooked natures to live straight, and observe that all fail through one cause, however variously it may work, namely the selfishness of man, we ask is it possible to east out this self ? this unreasonable tormentor of humanity that prevents us from living a truly human life�a life to which nature points�as the only possible blessedness, in a world where everything is created for mutual service and has its being only in giving? a world in which science in her latest revelation of the correllation of forces seems to echo in another tongue the words, 'He that loseth his life shall save it unto life eternal.' Let us pray in the interest of the great brotherhood and sisterhood at large that the kingdom of righteousness and truth may come to all, that self may be cast out, and the grand consummation of equity, equality, love and peace be realized.
