Books and Papers. The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for August opens with a portrait of. the Nestor of New York journalism, George Jones, and an appreciative sketch. A criticism on natural grounds of certain statements by Henry George follows. A very interesting analysis of the mouth's physiognomy, and well illustrated, will give the reader sound reasons for certain types of expression. The second Prize Essay is a taking sketch by the well-known author of 'For Girls.' Following this are ten or more Phrenological 'Hits' that make spicy reading. The interest taken in the new science of mind by Dr. John Bell, Professor Samuel G. Howe, Prof. Morton, the ethnologist, and Nicholas Biddle is related pleasantly by Mrs. Wells in her reminiscences. 'Truth, and What it means in Youthful Life,' forms a well thought out article. In the Health Department we have the effects of hygienic treatment as applied to Toothache, Ague and Fever, etc. What regularity in life will accomplish is shown in the career of Prof. 0. W. Holmes. An article that will be scanned with some ca,re, if we don't mistake, is '\n Extraordinary Claim.' The Editorial Department is more than usually full. Some very striking points are made in the third paper on Systematic Moral Education that should open the eyes of people who wonder at the corruptions of modern civilization. People who have money and wish to do some real good with a little of it should read Who Will Help? This journal is published at the low price of $1.50 a year, or 15 cents a number, and is offered 'On Trial' six months for only 50 cents.
