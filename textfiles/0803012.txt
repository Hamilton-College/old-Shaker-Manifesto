BLESSED SABBATH ANN BUCKINGHAM Blessings on the day ! It is now, we feel, unusually, regenerating gifts from God ; and it is a golden interval of time ; new rays of light descend ; the bow of promise shines resplendently upon the changeful life of earth's poor, toiling millions, whose daily hurrying lives are spent in cares. Thanks, one day in seven, a newer blessing reaches their inner hearts, and man's better nature feels the Sabbath holy, and his thoughts rest more on heavenly things. Thanks, yet again ; for is not it a gift divine ? At every periodical recurrence, still greater thanks ; for rich and podfr, bond and free, now lift their souls in prayerful oneness, above all selfish clangor ; a foretaste of the heavenly future, of equal gifts for equal lives of goodness, is seen and realized more truly and fully on the beautiful, blissful season of this holier day— because more devoted to holiness—the Sabbath.
