Wood Ashes for Fowls Injurious A correspondent of The Massachusetts Ploughman says : ' It is often specified in this recommendation that coal ashes should be applied, but I have lately seen in some of the papers the advice given to supply wood ashes for the poultry to shuffle in. I would caution all against following this advice. Wood ashes are so rich in potash that their effect on fowls' feet is exceedingly injurious. I have seen poultry with bad sores and blisters on their feet from this cause, and in one or two cases have seen birds badly lamed. Coal ashes are excellent, but wood ashes should never be furnished for the purpose above named.'
