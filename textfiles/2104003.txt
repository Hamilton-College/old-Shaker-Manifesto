SPIRITUAL LIFE. Orren Haskins. O give me a life with the lowly, A home with the righteous to live; And I'll freely resign all the glory, That earth's fleeting pleasures can give. For the spiritual life is immortal, Its treasures are worth more than gold; Till we enter those beautiful portals, Its glories can never be told. Mount Zion shall smile in her gladness, Her hills and her valleys will join; For God will banish her sadness, And blend every nation in one. To share in the blessings prepared By Him who is righteous and just, For He to his chosen declared, To save those who in Him will trust. And since by his name we are called, May each one prove true to the cause, And live by the truth that's revealed, Be loyal and true to his laws. O come all ye faint and ye weary, Ye poor and despised of the earth; The lame, halt and blind and the needy, And secure this treasure of worth. The Lord will make up his jewels, Of those who are true to his call; All kindreds, all nations He ruleth, He claimeth the great and the small. Of such is the kingdom of heaven, Little children were called to be, First-fruits of our souls, to be given,ï¿½ Our services, honest and free. Those who will be loyal to heaven, May come to this strait, narrow way, And give all their time and their talents, And live in the light of to-day. Such to the feast will be bidden, Made glad in the city of love, To such will the kingdom be given, With the keys to the mansion above. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
