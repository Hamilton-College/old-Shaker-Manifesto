DIALOGUE Flesh-eater.— Were not all things made for our use 1 Vegetarian.—And man for mine, replied the pampered goose. Flesh-eater.— What reasons have you for rejecting (as food) flesh, fish, eggs, butter, cheese, and grease ? Vegetarian.— See Genesis, 1 : 29 ; and Numbers, 11:13 and 33, where it states that the Israelites lusted for flesh, and their punishment was, to have their fill of it, till it turned into a great plague, and they died with it between their teeth. The Prophet Isaiah (66 :3) said : ' He that killeth an ox, is as if he slew a man.' ' Gather up the fragments, and let nothing be lost' said the Saviour, after feeding the multitude. No one, it is presumed, will question the prudence of the Saviour (in whom were hid ' the treasures of wisdom and knowledge'), because he let ' the whole herd of swine run down a steep place into the sea,' and perish. Is it not reasonable to suppose that he knew that the condition of the man, out of whom the legion was cast, was brought about by his eating the flesh of that unclean animal ? and that the inhabitants of that region were much addicted to it 1 See, likewise, Isaiah, 19 : 8-10. Why all the lamentation, mourning and languishing, expressed therein, if it were not because the people would be vegetarians, and would not buy the fish ? Flesh-eater.— Why don't you eat fine flour bread ? Vegetarian.— I do eat some, when I think it is not (as Elder Frederick Evans says) poisoned with saleratus. T. Frost
