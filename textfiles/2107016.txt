June 6, 1891. Deae Editor :�Farm and garden crops are looking well, but would be improved by a bountiful supply of rain. Cherrie s and pears promise fair results. We are having four of our buildings painted which improves their appearance somewhat. Door-yard lawn is looking nicely and this has a tendency to beautify our home and make it attractive externally at least. Health of family good. Your Brother, T. E. !N'ortli Family. June 10, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�Your kind letter and hints about forwarding home notes so as to reach the printers by the 14th. of the month is certainly very reasonable. We all like to have the Manifesto by the last of the month, and I hope we who have been behind will hereafter be prompt and in season. I will. On the 7th. we commenced our Society Meetings and it was a good beginning. I hope every Society will bear in mind, that next year will be our centennial of the gathering of the Church of Christ's Second Appearing into gospel order; without order it would be impossible to maintain our Communal relation. The gathering of the Church into order was a very important event in our history. There was more in it than the carnal mind has any idea of. The establishing of a system under which all nations could gather and live in harmony and peace for a hundred years must have a great deal of divine goodness in it; human skill alone could never accomplish it. The United States are making extensive preparations to celebrate the discovery of America, the home of liberty, or will be when the true earthly order is established therein. Let us have a grand festival in 1892! 'Kaise the gospel standard higher, let its banners be unfurled.' We are in the usual business of the season; battling with weeds, lice, fleas, bugs and moths and everything with which vegetation is cursed; it is a constant warfare: no time for idleness. The late frosts we have had, did little or no damage in our section. Have tried quite extensively the spraying of our fruit trees with London Purple to kill the curculio &amp;c. At harvest time we hope to gather fruit without worms. A few weeks ago we enjoyed a short visit from Elder Alexander Work of Groveland. He reports that the frost has destroyed all their fruit, of which they had such glowing promise. This is the third year their fruit has been cut off, and not only their fruit but the crops upon which they depend for material subsistence have been destroyed by flood and frost. They really need some practical love administered to them packed well in bbls. �of dried fruit or cases of canned fruit with the freight prepaid; or perhaps what would be better, some well-filled checks sent by mail. Gospel love is like the widow's cruise of oil; it never grows less by pouring on the needy. Bring forth tithes from our stores and pour them into Groveland and prove the blessedness of gospel love. Our Ministry all in usual health start for Watervliet this A. M. ~s In kindest love, D. O.
