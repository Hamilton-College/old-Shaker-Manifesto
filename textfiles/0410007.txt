AS YOU SOW, SO WILL YOU REAP The man who undertakes to live two lives will find that he is living but one, and that one is a life of deception. Causes will be true to their effects. That which you sow &gt;ou will reap. If you live to the flesh, to the passions, to the corrupt inclinations, you may depend upon it that the fruit which is in store for you will be that which belongs to these things. There can be no doubt as to what your harvest will be. If you think that after your day's business is done you can shut the blinds and carry on your orgies in secret with your evil companions; if you think that you can serve the devil by night, and then go forth and look like a sweet and virtuous young man, that goes in the best society, and does not drink nor gamble, nor commit any vice, then the devil has his halter about your neck, and he leads you, the stupidest fool in all the crowd. You deceive nobody but yourself. There is an expression in your eyes that tells stories. Passions stain clear through. A man might as well expect to take nitrate of silver — whose nature is to turn him to a lead color—and not have the doctor know it, as to expect that he can form evil habits and pursue mischievous courses and not have it known It does not need a sheriff to search out and reveal the kind of life that you are living. Every law of God in nature is an officer after you. It does not require a court judge and jury to try and condemn you. All nature is a court room, and every principle thereof is a part of that court which tries and condemns you. Do not think that there can be such a monstrous misadjustment of affairs as that you can do this work of the devil and have the remuneration of an angel. — H. W. Beecher
