Shaker Station, Conn. Dec. 1891. A Happy New Tear.â€”The happiest year of our lives. Let us welcome it with the brave purpose to be more true and virtuous, asking God's blessing on our efforts. May every one of its three hundred and sixty-five days bring to us some joy of service, some added blessing of gratitude from a fellow pilgrim guided heavenward by us. The service we render may seem to us to be small, but if the purpose be in our souls, there will come the blessing. So many souls need Christian help all over this broad land. Let us give of our gospel, strength, joy, affection and peace. Ah! this soul-wealth is just what we can give. We can spend it freely and not impoverish ourselves. May our hearts be full of symjiathy and our hands full of help. And as the new year offers us a time for growing better, let us see to it that our Christian kindness is in- exhaustible, and that we are liberal in using it. 2469 spaces of cream were sold in Nov. A large crop of corn and of good quality. Several buildings are improved by new shingling. The most important feature of poultrygrowing is the financial basis. We do not claim that there are millions in it for a single individual, but it is certain that properly managed, poultry raising is a paying business. To all, who faithfully attend to the needs of their hens, their efforts are crowned with success. A variety of food is necessary to secure eggs. No one ration will furnish all the needed elements. D.
