THE SPARROW AGAIN. We are receiving letters from different parts of the country in defence of the sparrow. A New York lady writes of long observation of sparrows eating in perfect harmony ivith other birds, in some cases driven away by other birds but never driving other birds away. Miss Soule, teacher of the kindergarten school, Gorham, N. H., gives similar testimony. But nothing has come to us more important than the following, which we take from the 'Boston Evening Transcript' of June 30 :� STRONG EVIDENCE FOR TEE SPARROW. Boston, June 30, 1890. George T. Angell, Esq., President: My dear Sir,�My boy, Jack H. Bowles, this morn, ing shot, on my grounds in Canton, an English sparrow.

Mr. and Mrs. Bowles have brought to my office this morning the sparrow with the live worms squirming in his mouth. Gbo. T. Angell.
