An Unanswered Prayer ROSIE MORSE Oh, saints on earth, and powers above, Do grant one boon we pray! For it we ask, for it we plead, Oh, turn us not away : Oh, give us one breath of pure air, Our waning strength revive ; One sniff of oxygen, O grant, To keep our souls alive. Our vital energies are weak— Our aspirations dead! Our inward fervency is spent— Our zeal and ardor fled ! All for the want of God's free air! Essence of mortal life— That all-supporting element, Which warms us for life's strife. In church, I cast my eyes around, To find an open door; But through no crevice comes the air, My dull brain to restore. And here, we're breathing o'er again, The air that's been exhaled ! I think, O whither can I go, And oxygen prevail? Ah, might I roam through trackless air, And like the eagle soar! To this benighted, mundane sphere, I would return no more. I'd take my flight most joyously— In the air of heaven I'd lave— I'd feed and feast on oxygen, As pure as God e'er gave. But while I'm destined here to stay, I must not soar too high; To earth, I turn reluctantly, But give me air, I cry. Throw up the windows, ope the doors— Give nature broader scope ! We shall be paid in better gifts, In spirit, life and hope. Now should we be denied this boon That serves to vitalize? Nay, let us heed before too late, Exhausted nature's cries. I do implore, with all my prayer, In supplication's voice : Oh, gospel friends, let's breath pure air, And then in truth rejoice. Shirley, Mass.
