RELIGION. M. J. Tatterton. Pure and undefiled religion, says an inspired writer, is, 'To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.' Pure religion then manifests itself in acts of kindness and charity toward our fellow-men. It implies an unspotted character freed from all selfishness and sin. It is the love of God shed abroad in the soul, diffusing a halo of light and holiness through our entire being. Practical religion consists in doing the will of our God, according to our highest light and understanding. It is living a life of purity and holiness, it is manifest in our prayers and in a daily straightforward, consistent, Christian life. The religion of our lives should be a living witness of the power of Christ to save souls from their sins. True religion shows if self in all our conduct, it is like the sap of a liviug tree which vitalizes every leaf and twig. Canterbury, N. H.
