EATING BETWEEN MEALS Half of all ordinary diseases, says Dr. Hall, in his Journal of Health, would be banished from civilized life,and dyspepsia become almost unknown,if every body would eat but.thrice a day at regular times, and not an atom between meals, the interval being not less than five hours, that being the time required to digest a full meal, and pass it out of the stomach. If a person eats between meals, the process of digestion of the food already in the stomach is arrested, until the last which has been eaten is brought into the condition of the former meal; just as, if water is boiling and ice is put in, the whole ceases to boil until the ice is melted and brought to a boiling point, and then the whole boils together. But it is a law of nature that ai: food begins to decay after exposure to heat and moisture for a certain time. If a meal is eaten and in two hours another, the whole remains undigested for seven hours, before which time the rottening process commences, and the man has his stomach full of carbonâ€”the very idea of which is horribly disgusting.
