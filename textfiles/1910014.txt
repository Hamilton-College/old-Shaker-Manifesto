THREE THINGS. [Contributed by W. L. Lincoln.]The church in Philadelphia was commended by the Lord for three things : we hear him saying (1) 'Thou hast a little strength ;' (2) 'and hast kept My word ;' (3) 'and hast not denied My name.' If you find a company of believers of whom it can be said that they have a little strength, you may conclude that God is there. What little they have is real. They may have but a scant supply of the gold of earth ; but they have nobler treasure�even the 'gold tried in +Iie fire' spoken of in Eev. 111., 18. What value the Lord puts upon a little strength ! A little strength means that there are dealings with God in that church, and that more strength is coming ; for unto him that hath shall be given. But 'a little strength' does not remain inactive. Wherever there is a little strength there is obedience�''�And hast kept My word.' It is vain to talk of being endued with power from on High, if that power does not lead to obedience to the Word. There must be 'fruits meet for repentance;' and one fruit of 'a little strength' is this : that God's Word will be kept. True enlargement of heart is ever followed by obedience. 'I will run in the way of Thy commandments, whea thou shalt enlarge my heart.' Psa. cxix., 32. Neither does 'a little strength' remain silent. It testifies: and its testimony has to do with a Name�the Name that is above every name�'Ami hast not denied My Name.' Wrhere there is 'a little strength,' reproach will be suffered for the Name. It will be confessed and honored accorded the chiefest place, even in the midst. Unto that name shall the gathering of the people be. Where there is 'a little strength,' and the Word kept, and the Name confessed, the fragrance of that Name will go forth like spices on the breezes. Amen; so be it, Lord. Though but a 'little flock' with only a '�''little strength,'1 we would seek, during the 'little while.'1 to keep Thy Word. and not to deny Thy Name.� Times of Refreshing.
