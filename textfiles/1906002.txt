HOW MUCH WILL REMAIN? Agnes E. Newton. How much will be left when all of self Shall be washed from the soul away? How much will remain when nature's dross With the gold may no longer stay? How much will be left of ripened grain When the tares no longer have place? Shall we gather sheaves of golden wheat Or life's field be a barren waste? When the master comes expecting fruit From the vine he has pruned with care Shall we be able of perfect growth To present an offering fair? How much will remain and stand the test When the true from the false shall part? When the light of God shall clearly shine And illume with its rays each heart? What we have valued as priceless gems And have classed with our jewels rare; When the Lord shall come to claim his own Will they count with the treasures there? Ah! well may we ask in earnest prayer That enough pure gold may remain; When the furnace tries and melts the dross To inscribe with the Father's name. Canterbury, N. H.
