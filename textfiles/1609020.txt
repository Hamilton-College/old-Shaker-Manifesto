Sanitary. GOOD BREAD. To the Editor ;�I notice articles upon Graham bread in the American Agriculturist and other papers. Perhaps our experience at the North family, Mt. Lebanon, may be of some interest and service to the public. For many years wn have used bread made from wheat of our own raising. We wash the �wheat thoroughly, kiln dry, grind it ourselves coarsely, use it unbolted, and bake it in a soap-stone oven. No leaven in it. It is good wheaten bread, and we are certain that it is pure and unadulterated as we are that no deception is possible in the production of spiritual phenomena got up among ourselves arid especially for our own delectation and edification. I doubt whether really good men and women�Christians�can be raised upon poor bread, made of adulterated materials and chemically corrupted by leaven. If a clean thing cannot be brought out of an unclean, then how can a good thing be made out of bad materials? Have not a loaf to spare, (unless to feed the hungry,) a bushel of wheat, nor a barrel of flour to sell at any price. F. W. Evans. LIME WATER. The housekeeper should never be without a bottle of lime water in the house. To have it always ready and in good order, with little expense, place in a tall quart bottle of any kind a gill or so of good lime just slacked with water. Then fill the bottle with rain or other pure water, and allow it to stand quietly, well corked. The lime will settle, leaving clear lime water at the top. Pour this off gently, as wanted, adding more water as needed. Lime water, even when closely corked, often deteriorates; the carbonic acid in the air unites with the lime and settles as an insoluble carbonate on the sides of the bottle, which is nearly impossible to remove. This will spoil the bottle for any other use. Therefore select one from the store room which is not valued, but which has a good, tight cover. A wide mouthed bottle is preferable. The lime should be removed and fresh put in once a year or so, unless kept very tightly corked. A pint of cold water dissolves less than ten grains of lime, and warm water still less. The uses to which lime water may be put, are innumerable. If good milk disagrees with a child or a grown person, three or four tablespoonfuls of lime water added to a pint of it will usually help digestion and prevent flatulence; it also counteracts pain from wind in the stomach caused by eating acid fruits. Over-eating of candies and other sweets will sometimes cause acidity, for which this is a sovereign remedy. A tablespoonful for a child two years old to a gill or more for an adult is an ordinary dose, while considerable will have no bad results ; in fact, it is a simple anti-acid and slightly tonic. A small quantity put into a mug with the water for cleaning the teeth wilL harden the gums and prevent soft decay, which is a serious evil which many desire to avert. For burns and scalds, to two parts of linseed oil add one part of lime water, and apply with soft linen. American Cultivator. LOOK UP, NOT DOWN. Life to some is full of sorrow, Half is real half they borrow, Full of rocks and full of ledges, Corners sharp and cutting edges, Though the joy-bells may be ringing, Not a song you'll bear them singing, Seeing never makes them wise, Looking out from downcast eyes. All in vain the sun is shining, Waters sparkling, blossoms twining, They but see, through those same sorrows, Sad to-days and worse to-morrows, See the clouds that must pass over, See the weeds among the clover, Everything and anything, But the gold the sunbeams bring. Drinking from the bitter fountain, Lo ! your mole-hill seems a mountain, Drops of dew and drops of rain, Swell into the mighty main. All in vain the blessings shower, And the mercies fall with power, Gathering chaff, ye tread the wheat, Rich and royal, 'neath your feet. Let it not be so my neighbor, Look up, as you love and labor, Not for one alone, woe's vials, Every one has cares and trials, Joy and pain are^ linked together, Like the fair and cloudy weathei&gt; May we have, oh let us pray, Faith and patience for to-day.
