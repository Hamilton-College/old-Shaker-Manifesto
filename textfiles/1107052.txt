HORNLESS CATTLE A farmer who owns forty-seven head of hornless cattle gives in the Western Rural his reasons for preferring them. He says: ' First they are about as harmless as a flock of sheep ; second, sheep, colts and horses can run in the same pasture or yard, and drink out of the same tank, with perfect safety; third, it is sometimes necessary to milk in a storm, and I have only to open the cow-stable door and twelve cows will not take more room than three pairs of horns ; fourth, a straw rick two rods long and twenty feet wide will make a first-rate shelter for thirty head of young mulley stock; for they will soon have the rick shelved all around, lie down like so many hogs, and be comfortable under the edges of the stack, while six pairs of horns could hardly be accommodated on the same territory. I never have had my horses wounded, or colts, sheep, calves, children, women, or men tossed upon mulley-bull's horns. My stock are descendants of the old English red mulley breed.'
