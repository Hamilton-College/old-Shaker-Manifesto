East Canterbury, N. H Weather Record, for Dec. 1891. Highest Temp, during the mo. 50. Lowest ' ' ' ' 4. Mean ' ' ' ' 21.1 Total Precipitation ' ' 3.60 in. N. A. Bkiggs. On Dec. 1st. we entertained a visitor in the person of Cyrus R. Teed, M. D. of Chicago. Dr. Teed is the Publisher of the 'Flaming Sword' and the spiritual head of 'The Koreshan System' which has its headquarters in the city of Chicago, 111. As a spiritual guide he is known only as 'Cyrus the Messenger,' and 'comes at the end of this dispensation as the embodiment of the wisdom principle in its scientific degree.' Those who had the privilege of conversing with the Dr. during his brief visit, were much interested to learn of his system of religious experience. With kindest of wishes we bid adieu to our new friend. Since our last writing we have also had other visitors. Elder Hiram Baker of Enfield, N. H., who called on us Dec. 1st. and although brief, the visit was quite pleasant. Dec. 29, Elder Joseph Holden of Mount Lebanon, arrived at our home and remained till Jan. 5th. Jan. 4, Br. William Wilson of Enfield, N. H., made us a short call. While in our Village, Br. William is always at home and among friends. Jan. 14, Sr. Caroline Whitcher of Enfield, N. H., is with us. After a ride of twelve miles in.this cold, winter weather, I have no doubt she was right glad to reach a home as humble as our own. Sister Caroline is a mother in Israel, and although enjoying a beautiful home in Enfield, by rightful, consecrated inheritance, she is no less at home in the hearts of her gospel Delation who dwell in Canterbury. If 'short visits make long friends,' we may be assured that our friendship will still hold good, and in this we extend the kindest of welcome for others to call. *
