Beloved Elder Frederick : Your card and document came yesterday. I kindly thank you for your good wishes. I desire you may be blessed in body, soul and spirit; and that the tribulation, resting on a Gathering Family, may bear good fruit in many souls. Your visit to Vermont was in season to meet R. D. Owen, and to form another strong link in connection with those, outside, who are being prepared for an advance movement. The Spiritual forces seem to be waiting the proper moment to strike conviction — to touch the heart and awaken the conscience. Wise are the Virgins, who have laid in a store for their lamps — who are baptized with the light of the coming degree — who have honestly confessed and put away all violations of Mosaic, as well as of Divine Law. They may rejoice and be exceedingly glad. Happy the Virgins who have thrown away tobacco, drugs, superfine flour, saleratus, and the murdering of animals for food. Men and women, living the Divine Life, need none of those things, nor do they desire them. Leave them to such as seek low enjoyments—whose aspirations reach not above the animal plane. Yourself, Elders, Burden-Bearers, Brethren and Sisters, accept our Love, and pray for us. Daniel Fraser, Shirley, Mass., Jan. 5, '75
