This Number EDITORIAL NOTES. Of The Manifesto contains some very excellent thoughts by our excellent contributors. One feature â€” that of the correspondent department, is worthy of special notice. We would also call attention to the gentle sympathy of gospel friends for one who recently lost a dear sister by the hand of the great leveler, death : and to the realization of how the harshness of the circumstance is stolen away, almost unawares. Our music is unfortunately omitted by reason of an accident unpremeditated, and by us sorrowed. It will not occur again, we intend. Once more: we ask the kindly, good sense to our appeal to 'friends and neighbors.'
