Beloved Elder: We are not thinking of a letter... Beloved Elder :ï¿½We are now thinking of a letter received from you, which contained so many good things as to make one's heart thankful for our brotherly, gospel relationship. Accepting as we do all the burdens that are at this date falling so heavily upon every community of Believers, there is at the same time a great many blessings for which we may be superlatively thankful. No other class of people have the opportunity of making for themselves so beautiful a home. Certainly, peace and contentment do abound. We have yet to hear of a family of Shakers that are destitute of food or that suffer for the want of sufficient clothing to make them comfortable. Some are abundantly supplied with all these good gifts. All are privileged to reside in comfortable dwellings, and a few in mansions of earthly beauty. At any rate in the externals it would seem that we are wonderfully blessed, and then the fellowship which is shared by the whole household, has in it elements of love and joy and confidence enough to make a Kingdom of God upon the earth. It is well that we appreciate all the good gifts of the Kingdom from day to day and take pleasure in the comforting assurance that it shall be well with the righteous. Of these things, so near and dear to our own hearts, we suppose we shall write till time is no more. Now a few words on the past. The spiritualism from 1837 to 1847 among the Shakers and the present spiritualism of the world have many things in common which we can enjoy with much satisfaction. We have always with very great pleasure placed our name among the spiritualists, and that name to us lias a significance that far transcends all the dreams and visions that fall to common humanity. The best spiritualism .that can manifest itself in an assemblage of Shakers must be that testimony which is the outgrowth of a pure heart. Visions which allow us to see ourselves are preeminently visions of God, and the exhortations of righteousness coming from a consecrated life are far better than any angel messages from a foreign sphere, so far as the prosperity of our Church is dependent upon them. When a man is well fed and well clothed he may be a ghost-seer with a great deal of satisfaction, but when hunger pinches or adversity stands at the door, then these illusions become of a very different character. If these mind visions were the outgrowth of a pure heart, we might almost trust our salvation to their keeping : but when we know that it is only the development of a natural faculty, the same as singing or speaking, we assign it to its legitimate place. Some of the most unprincipled men and women among Believers were equally gifted with the better class, and as these same gifts are now abroad in the world, let us see how they come. One of the leading spiritualists, a man in whom Believers have placed a great deal of confidence, has said that many of the best mediums were loose and licentious. In fact, these low estates made them more susceptible to influences, and of course better able to accept impressions from good or evil spirits. We do think that while there is much that is sweet and choice in what we have shared as spiritual gifts, there has also immense harm reached us from the same mediums. The pioneers of our gospel work were gifted in visions but they were at the same time indefatigable workers on the earth. They left their cozy homes and went into the world and preached and prayed and held their meetings from day to day and from week to week and compelled men to believe. John Meacham, Benj. Youngs and Issachar Bates did no less than this on their visit to Ohio. Issachar had visions which comforted him but he also had the confidence that he was a servant of God : and this man could walk from Mt. Lebanon to Ohio and on to Ky. and preach a sermon in every log cabin on the way. Eastern Shakers did no less in the day when the Church stood in its glory for zeal and earnest work for God. In those days of which you speak the dreamers in some cases, astonished the officers of Society, and some persons actually thought, that there could be no advance taken that would be permanent. They even said that the Believers were not good enough and must wait at home and grow better. What has been the result, East, west, north, and soutli so far as our order is concerned? Believers hardly know what it is best to do, and like star gazers are wondering what will come next. Now, in all this confusion of thoughts and feelings ; in all this anxiety of dreaming and ghost seeing which is among the Believers in every Society and family, we are not surprised, that they are seeking beyond our own order for a shadowy satisfaction, and they will be fortunate if they get even a shadowAnother generation will not know the spiritualism that was with us from 1837 to 1847The good they cannot know, to appreciate' and much of it would require an able, relig_ ious interpreter or it could not be under stood. But Believers must and will have spiritual, ism among themselves in some form. If they neglect to cultivate it at home, they will seek for it abroad, and in all probability where we now spend one day in Endor consulting the spirits, a coming generation will spend a week. It is astonishing to see how zealous some of the good, substantial and faithful believers in the doctrines have become in following after the deceptions of necromancers and magicians that are covering the land as thoroughly as the frogs covered Egypt. Father Joseph could walk the floor in agony of soul at the thought of introducing even an educated physician into the Society, but we can introduce and bow down to almost anything in human shape. We consult sleeping mediums, that can look into the patients and see the heart, lungs, liver or anything else, and some think that is just nice. We consult those that cure by the laying on of hands, and those ignorant and repellent old men and women, who have lived among the Indians, so they say, and they perform wonderful cures. He might well groan over our one hundred years' experience. As Believers grow lukewarm and lose their hold on the various forms of spiritualism which belongs to their own order, they will go out into the world to find them ; and so long as the world lasts the magicians will work at their trade. Tippings, rappings and planehette have gone by but materialization has come and this is the last bewitching phase. To become converted to the truth of this, one would be obliged to see more to convince him than has the writer. Chittendon was for many years the strong hold for putting the spirits into bodies of flesh and blood and making them talk and dance. The best mediums for this work congregated there and yet some of them were not especially neat and chaste. Now, Dear Elder, why do we need to wait for the coming years for an inspiration from on high? Is not the revelation of the work of God a growing revelation that shall make us what we profess to be, sons and daughters of a living God? Truly, and this spiritual health, prosperity and happiness is in our own hands.
