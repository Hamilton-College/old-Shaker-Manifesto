TESTIMONY OF RACHEL SPENCER. As I have found the gospel of Christ's second appearing to be the greatest treasure I can enjoy in this world, and as I was among the first in this country who received this precious treasure from Mother Ann Lee, and became personally acquainted with her, I feel it my privilege to maintain her testimony and bear witness of her character and ministry. I lived iu New Lebanon at the time of the great revival of 1779, when religion seemed to call the attention of almost all classes of people. I was then fifteen years of age ; and though I sometimes attended their meetings, and was not without serious impressions; yet I made no profession of religion. I considered it no trifling matter to profess to be a Christian and not be one in reality. I could not consider myself one ; because I knew I did not follow Christ. Nor could I see among all the professors, any one that I thought did -follow him as I believed a Christian ought to do. When I heard of Mother Ann and her companions, and was told of their faith aud testimony, and the manner of life they lived, I felt a serious impression on my mind that they were the people of God, and I had a desire to see them. I soon found that the reports which had made such an impression on my feelings, had produced a very different effect upon my parents, and filled their minds with prejudice against the people and their religion. Though the opinion of my parents did not alter my feelings ; yet as I was young, I thought it best for me to keep still and say nothing till I could see them and judge for myself. It was not long before I had an opportunity to visit them at Watervliet, in company with other young people from New Lebanon ; and was soon convinced that they were, indeed, the true followers of Christ. 'We spent the Sabbath and attended their worship ; saw the power of God among them, and heard their testimony, which made a solemn impression upon all of us. Many of our company had been very light and carnal while on our way ; but they returned with very different feelings. On our way home, all were solemn, silent and thoughtful; scarcely a word was spoken by any of the company. None doubted of its being the work of God; nor did they hesitate long in making their choice. I embraced the testimony with full confidence, and confessed my sins. I was then sixteen years of age, and have ever found cause to be thankful from that day to this. By faithful obedience to the precepts of Mother Ann, I have been saved from sin, and have been enabled to walk in the straight and narrow way, of selfdenial and the cross which Christ and his apostles taught. In this way have I walked, and this cross have I borne for nearly forty-six years, and maintained my faith with an unshaken mind. It has proved to me a treasure more valuable than mountains of gold : nor would I exchange the name of a Shaker, and the heavenly treasure I possess with it, for all the kingdoms of this world. With regard to Mother Ann, who was so much abused and persecuted while living, and whose character has been so scandalized by the wicked, I can truly say, I bless God that I ever found such a Mother. I can testify before all people, that I ever found her remarkable in all piety and godliness, and a swift witness against every propensity, and every thing that pertained to the depravity of nature. She was faithful in strengthening and confirming the feeble, relieving Ilia buffeted, comforting the afflicted, cheerk-g the sorrowful, building tip the good, and purging out the evil. In her common deportment she was meek, modest, reserved and thoughtful; yet free and open in conversation when occasion required, and her words were words of wisdom. I really loved and feared her more than any person I ever saw. I loved her testimony and the blessed power of God which attended it; for it was life to my soul; yet that which was ungodly in me would often tremble at her presence. I then believed her to be a woman chosen and anointed of God, and endowed with the spirit and power of Christ. By the increasing light and understanding I have received, and the continual support I have felt from the same heavenly and Divine Spirit, I have been constantly confirmed in my first faith, without a doubt. As to Mother Ann's religious character and conduct, I never felt under any necessity of going to her enemies for information, nor of listening to the tales of slanderers, 'who know not what they say, nor whereof they affirm ;' because I have had sufficient opportunity of knowing for myself. I have heard, seen and felt the true and genuine spirit of righteousness which she displayed in all her words and actions. I have seen her undaunted and composed even in times of the bitterest persecution, and saw her meet her en- raged persecutors with a calm and unruffled countenance. I was a witness of the cruel persecution which took place in New Lebanon, wheu Mother and the Elders were so shamefully and cruelly abused. I was at George Darrow's when that riotous mob assembled and surrounded the house. Mother and the Elders had been some days in the neighborhood, visiting the Believers from house to house. They had been to Jabez Spencer's in IStephentown, and on their return, accompanied by many of the Believers, they called and visited several families on the road, where they were detained, and spent their time in singing and serving God till a very late hour. When they arrived at the house of George Darrow we all arose and thankfully received them. We had a joyful and happy meeting. Mother was very bright and cheerful, and her soul seemed to be filled with divine power and love. She displayed nothing but godliness in any of her conduct or conversation. After much exercise, the night being far spent, Mother retired to a small room on the lower floor, and the Elders up stairs. I was very early in the morning employed in the kitchen, with a number of the Sisters, in preparing breakfast and putting the house in order ; and we had nearly finished our work when the mob came. The house was at that time neat and clean and all was still and quiet, when suddenly we were beset on every side by unprincipled men in mob array. The rooms below were nearly filled with the Brethren and Sisters, who endeavored to keep the mob out; but regardless of remonstrances or entreaties, they rushed in like furious tigers. A number of them burst into the kitchen and furiously assaulted the Sisters who were collected there. We strove with all our strength to keep the mob back, but in vain. They seized and hurled us out of doors, one after another, with the utmost violence. I was thrown out and beaten severely. Many others of the Brethren and Sisters shared the same fate. Several doors were broken to pieces ; the ceiled partition of the little room where Mother had retired, was torn down; and she was hauled out and thrown into the carriage without ceremony. Two of the young Sisters followed her. The mob then drove furiously to Eleazer Grant's abusing all who attempted to follow her. Mother Ann was cruelly and shamefully treated. Indeed the inhuman conduct of this mob was such, that I should really think any persons of character would shudder at the thought of having their names exposed to the public, as being concerned in such wicked transactions. The appearance and behavior of the mob was indeed, more like intoxicated madmeu than like sober, rational beings. When they left the house it looked shockingly. Mother Ann's deportment was perfectly upright; and as a passive sufferer in the hands of a cruel mob, no person could justly accuse her of the least impropriety. It is true she did not fear the mob ; nor could they compel her to yield to any of their unjust requirements. Knowing her own innocence, and conscious that she was doing the will of God, and feeling confident of his divine protection, she could not fear the wicked ; although she expected to suffer abuse from their hands. Had she been guilty of the base things charged against her by her enemies, they would have had no occasion to continue their accusations down to this day ; for both she and the Society which she planted would have been sunk in oblivion many years ago. 'The tree is known by its fruit; and a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit.' This testimony of the gospel which Mother Ann planted in the midst of so much opposition, has weathered the storms of persecuting malice, and I am thankful that I am able to bear witness of it: I know it will forever stand, ' and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.ï¿½1826.
