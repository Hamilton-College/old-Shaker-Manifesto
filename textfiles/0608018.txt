OUR UNITY The majority of the people called Shakers, had an earlier education without the domains of Shakerism. While bone and marrow were composing, physically, ideas were making, apparently, eternal impressions. There is nothing strange in the fact, that upon theological niceties we are not agreed. And moreover, let none hope nor imagine that this can be so in this life. All mere theological discussion for argument's sake, is next to wasted breath — whether ' Paul,' and else — but know all people, that we are a unit in belief, in a pure, virgin life, with all it can signify ; in a brotherhood of common property; in that peace which comes from all denials to selfish lusts, whether of the flesh, or personal superiority ; and in a freedom from worldly associations that would in any manner impede a spiritual advancement. Accept, all people, the true theory of our religious liberality, as expressed by our best living, theological exponent — Elder F. W. Evans:—'Believe, just what you please, theologically, but Live the life of Christ.' Now, let every Shaker permit this kind of a life to regulate his theology ; and keep all old, anti-christian theology out of the discussion of those who would be saints, and we are a unit and will have peace.
