Man can have a proprietary right... Man can have a proprietary right only in that which he either creates, i. e., makes, or causes to be by his own power; or in what he purchases or receives in a gift through direct anu legitimate channels from the first or real owner. Man, therefore, has a legitimate right to the private and sole ownership of houses, furniture, ships, clothing, &amp;c, in short, every manufactured article; but earth, water, and air, are the creations of God only, and no man is able to show charter or deed of gift or purchase from God of a single acre of land, mile of ocean, lake or river, nor a cubic inch of the air we breathe. Use and wont can never sanctify wrong, and our present private ownership of land is just as equitable and no more so than the old British tax upon daylight. John Finlay
