TOBACCO MANIA. The New York Evening Post says: 'The case of M. O. C.�who was taken to the almshouse a day or two ago, is a sad one. He is only twenty-eight years old. When he came to this country he was the owner of property to the value of some ten thousand dollars, which had been left him as his share of his father's estate. He became an habitual and inveterate smoker, and his nervous system became so affected that his brain was injured, and insanity followed. Physicians warned him of the danger of smoking so much; but he failed to give up the habit. He was sent to an Asylum, and there, deprived of the means of gratifying his appetite, improved, and was discharged as cured. But, once out, he again resorted to narcotic stimulants, and again became insane. This is the second time he has been sent to the almshouse. The bulk of his property, it is said, is gone. '' And yet, ' says the Congregationalist,� ' a great many professing Christians, even ministers of the gospel, use tobacco, with no seeming regard as to its effects on their own bodies or the influence of their example in the world.' Dr. Burroughs, of Iowa, says in his Journal:�' It is authentically stated that there is a young man in Battle Creek, Michigan, that is suffering with delirium tremens from the use of tobacco This is not the first case of the kind that came under our observation ; a mau died with this terrible disease in Monee, Illinois, a few years ago, who was never known to use any kind Of liquor, but was an inveterate user of tobacco. We should be temperate in all things. ' �From the Christian.
