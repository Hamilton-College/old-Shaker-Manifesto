Sabbathday Lake. Sept. 1893. Another month has dawned upon us and the days are swiftly passing. The harvest is in progress and all are engaged gathering in our winter store. The harvester has visited us in another sense and taken a Sister that we loved, to the evergreen shores. Our dear Sister, Elmira Douglas left us quite suddenly at the last, although her health has been failing for some time. She was a good Sister and will be greatly missed in our home circle. Her kind heart and willing hands and ministries of good, will long be remembered by all. She has been a member of this Society about thirty-one years. Elegant carriages and spans continue to pass our dwellings every day and will for some time yet. The Poland Spring Hotels are well filled with the gay throng who delight to receive the lovely flowers which are blooming for them in our gardens and which we are pleased to bestow upon them for a small equivalent. We are this year blest with a fine crop of potatoes superior to those of a number of years past. From one piece of three acres the Brethren harvested 470 bu. and they were large and smooth. A few acres in other places yielded well, and the crops generally are coming in fair. Ada S. Cummings.
