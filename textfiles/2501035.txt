THE COLUMBIA DESK CALENDER. Fok ten years the desk calendar issued by the Pope Manufacturing Company has held a unique place among business helpers. Each daily leaf during that time has taught its quiet lesson of the value of better roads and outdoor exercise, and especially the benefits of bicycling. The calendar for 1895, which is just issued, is even brighter than its predecessors in appearance, as clever artists have added dainty silhouette and sketch to the usual wise and witty contributions that have heretofore given this popular calendar its charm. It can be had for five 2-cent stamps from the Pope Manufacturing Company, Hartford, Conn., or from any Columbia bicycle agency.
