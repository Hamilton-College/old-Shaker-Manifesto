'HE CONQUERS, WHO OVERCOMES HIMSELF.' Sarah F. Bodine. How few there are in this great world who honestly strive for victory over themselves ; our principal and greatest foes are the evils of our own lives which rise up against us and destroy our peace. Contention in the small affairs of life seems to be quite easy, and altogether too frequent among us; but there is no virtue in it nor any worthy gain; but to contend against, and gain victory over habits and vices that bring pain and trouble to others, as well as ourselves, will secure immortal glory ; this I consider to be a good and a necessary work, and I will strive earnestly, strengthened by power from above, to subdue the errors of my life as fast as they appear to me. We cannot reach perfection in a month nor a year, but if we patiently bear the cross, we shall surely win the crown and realize the reward of our labors. It is said, that 'He that conquereth his own spirit, is greater than he that taketh a city.' Too many fail to realize this, and seek to obtain fame and honor on the battle field, at the sacrifice of Christian virtue, and at the expense of many human lives; such, worship the god of war, but the laurels gained in this way will perish before the true God. Let me 'turn the battle to the gate' as the Scriptures say, and do the true conqueror's work, win the Christian's victory, and bear the palm of righteousness. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
