PERFECT PEOPLE. Perhaps no one of our friends is exactly as we would like to have him. He has his good qualities and strong points which attract and win us: at the same time he has defects of character to which we can not be blind. We have gone far, however, in cultivating the art of friendship when we take our friends as they are, and recognize that what we deem their faults are often closely connected with their excellencies. You can readily imagine a man more attractive to you in some elements of character than Jones, but if Jones were exactly the kind of man you would like to have him, he would not be Jones at all. A friend of ours was in search of a horse that was an excellent roadster, full of spirit, and yet safe for his little girl to drive. He soon discovered that while there are many excellent roadsters and also many horses that children can drive, yet there are not many horses that have spirit and at the same time are perfectly safe in the hands of a child. This combination of qualities is pretty hard to get in horses. And there are combinations of qualities that it is pretty hard to find in men. We say that we love and respect Jones; that, in truth, he is one of our best friends but we wish that he were different in this or that respect. Ah, yes, but the qualities that he has you do not often find in men who have the qualities that he lacks. A man with push and energy if endowed with the gentler qualities which make up the character of his neighbor, would not be himself, with outstanding characteristics which give him an identity, but simply a mediocre,a faint resemblance to himself and a shadowy likeness of his neighbor. If we could make over Jones to please our idea of what he should be, he might not be as good a specimen of the race as he now is, and yet we can very clearly point out the improvement he might make in his character. Let us remember that we, too, have our deficiencies and excesses and be charitable to our friends and trust that time, and intercourse with noble and intelligent minds will yet add to their character the sterner traits which they lack, mayhap, or adorn them with those graces, which will mark them as followers of the meek and lowly Nazarene. Perfect men are not very common, and furthermore, the kind of man that we should deem perfect, because of his relation to our own qualities might not be perfect by any means. What most of us mean by a perfect parson, is one whose qualities harmonize with or supplement our own. ï¿½Selected.
