Esteemed Friend; It has been sometime... If. Milton, Umatilla Co., Oregon. June 24, 1885. A. Gr. HOLLISTER- - -Esteemed Friend ;ï¿½It has been sometime since I received the last copy of the Manifesto, which I received from you while I resided in Monroe Co., Ohio. I moved here with my family in December 1883 and have often thought of sending for the Manifesto, which I like very much. You will find enclosed the subscription price. If you have an old copy with woodcut of Union Village on it I would be glad if you would send it to me. I find several in this country who are in favor of community life, having all things in common, but as they have never heard of the Shaker Society they know nothing about it. I am an out and out Shaker Spiritualist, but from what I know of your life in Shakerdom, we are far in the rear of you. I often wish I was m a situation to live a purer life, then pure spirits would attend me and then I would be a happier man. My spirit begins to reach out for a purer atmosphere, where there is not so much selfishness and where can I find it. Not where every man is striving to accumulate wealth and riches of a material character and where impurity reigns supreme. When Spiritualists come to understand the true object of Spiritualism we will find it demands of us to live a purer life, and adopt the communistic. Yours is imitative of angelic life and when you commune with spirits, you are sure of obtaining reliable communications which we often fail to get, because we do not live pure lives as the nobler class of spirits do. I feel moved to say to you all. Be ye encouraged, for your light will eventually enlighten humanity. Brethren and Sisters (for such I feel privileged to hail you) do not forget that your manner of life is the happiest on this earth, for the sorrows and perplexities of a base selfish life are unknown to you. Yours Fraternally, W. W. Billmire. P. S. Manifesto advertises a book from the pen of H. L. Eads have you said book on hand.
