Removal For the full information of all our dear friends far and near, we would say,That taking all circumstances into consideration, the distance the Groveland people are from all other Believers, we have concluded to have them remove to the North Family at Watervliet, N. Y., the removal to take place the last of the present month and first of next. By the prayers and interest of all good Believers extended for them, we hope and trust a blessing may attend the movement. Ministry, Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Oct. 10, 1892.
