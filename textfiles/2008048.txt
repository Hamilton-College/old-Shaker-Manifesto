ARE WOMEN CARELESS OF MONEY? No woman, at least in America, has any such talent as a man has for spending money. She spends for what she believes to be beauty�for raiment, books, jewels, decoration, furniture, pictures, marbles� rarely for what does her serious harm. He spends most for his vices, for the things that hurt him greatly. He is apt to gamble, to speculate, to bring evil to others from his love of pleasure or of gain. He will get rid of more money in a month than she would in years. She would, however ignorant of it be appalled by the sums he dissipates. She is constitutionally conservative; big statements of any sort a.re likely to alarm her. Unless desperate or frenzied, she invariably stops short of extremes. She trembles and turns pale where he, in the flush of egotism, moves undisturbed. Nearly all the talk of woman's carelessness of money is really idle. The opinion cannot be sustained. It is mainly the echo of misapprehension. Where she is even partially enlightened on the subject, she is prone to be very cautious in its use. Her temperamental tendency is to the opposite of carelessness.� Junius Henri Browne, in Ladies' Home Journal.
