Enfield, N. H. Sept. 1899. It was with heartfelt sorrow we read the notice of the intended suspension of our Manifesto, whose pages for many years have helped to cheer us along life's way. Our Society as a whole has had an extra fine trade in Fancy Goods this season. The Sisters of both families who attended fairs and went to hotels to sell their articles, have put into the family purses sums of money, pleasing to the eyes of all. During the past month the writer with Eldress Eosetta Cummings and six Sisters, of the Church order, spent two days at the Lake Sunapee Spiritualist's Camp Meeting. There we met an old-time friend Dr. J. M. Peebles, of Battle Creek, Mich., who delivered a lecture upon his travel and experiences in India. His kindly remembrances of Elder Frederick Evans and recital of their doings while in England, were very pleasing. On Sabbath evening, nothing would do but we must occupy the platform and sing and speak in their conference meeting. At time of writing, we are entertaining Elder Abraham Perkins of East Canterbury. THE MANIFESTO. 159 We see that time has laid no severe hand upon him. We can say as we think of his 92 years of lifeVirtue pays those who prefer soul-elevating influences and pleasures to those that debase and degrade. Even blessed are those whose lives have ebbed away many years below the life-mark Elder Abraham has attained, having given their all to the work of human advancement. Consoling is the knowledge, 'Not all earth's denizensthe human race To sensual life their noblest pow'rs have given On history's page this glowing truth we trace, That souls for high and glorious aims have striven.' George H. Baxter.
