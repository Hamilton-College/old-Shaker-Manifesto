OUR MOTHER IN DEITY. Sophia Wayne. A Mother in Deity! beautiful faith That to all true Believers is given; Our hope in this life, our comfort in death Is the thought of a Mother in heaven. When Jesus the righteous, of heaven-born mind Came to tell us of glories above, His words to the penitent always were kind, He was taught by our Mother of love. Oh kind loving Mother, to whom we oft pray, And trust in Her power of forgiving. Such thoughts are a blessing, our comfort and stay, And will guide us along on our heavenly way, For we know our petitions by night or by day Will be heard by our Mother in heaven. Balston Spa, N. Y.
