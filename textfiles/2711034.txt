The Moral Aspects of the Higher Criticism The Moral Aspects of the Higher Criticism by H. L. Hastings. The writer of this little work says,'one of the settled conclusions of the leading Higher Critics of our day is, that the Scriptures of the old and new Covenant are not Scriptures of J Truth.' Mr. Hastings does not accept this statement but in expressing his own mind goes onlo say,'Much of the higherCi itieism of the present (hiy .shows the inac :uraey of the critics and their very supei liciai aequainttanee with the books they comment upon. The fact is a plain man who read* nnd understands his English Bible is likely to !) better informed on many points than a scholar with a head full of Hebrew roots, who neglects an.I discredits the writings which he processes to study and expound.' II. L. Hastings, No. 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
