East Canterbury N. H. Jan. 1893. In hushed tones the New Year's gleetings past from lip to lip in our saddened household, for the last moments of 1898 bade us lay to rest our beloved Eldress Joanna J. Kaime. At the funeral service held in the afternoon of the 31st ult. Eldress Eosetta Cummings and Sister Nancy A. Morse were present in behalf of the Society at Enfield; and grateful tributes, written and unexpressed, rose from the hearts of all. But the current of true appreciation for the beloved Mothers called from our midst, runs deep in the hearts of their people, who hest understand the solemn burden of the withdrawal; yet we feel the pulse of our Zion in sympathy and kinship. The old year passes on, its foot-prints lie deep in our memories, yet we clasp hands with the New Year, realizing that whatever the grief or burden, 'underneath are the everlasting arms.' ******* 30 THE MANIFESTO. The storm of Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 covered the line of demarkation between the old and the new years, hut the newly printed calendars put everything right; and by the 3rd inst. the ice harvest optned in cold earnest with m irking and ploughing. Within the three days devoted to the bus- j iness, a January thaw and a snow-storm crowded themselves in, but at the close of the 5th an ample bulk of ice, tho not of A No. 1 quality, was in place of storage. With the mercury slipping down to 10 deg. below zero, we do not feel the immediate need of King Winter's bounties, but by Independence Day we can tell better whether we are really dependent or not upon these wise provisions of nature. It is well that this is not the visiting season, for even the horses turn a 'cold shoulder' to us. School closed on the 11th inst., the winter term of sixteen weeks having drawn to a successful close. Jessie Evans.
