Treatise on the horse and his diseases R. J. Kendall, M. D This is a .small, but comprehensive work upon what its title appertains. It is full of information, giving numerous illustrations of the horse's appearance in various kinds of sickness, lameness ; and showing by the teeth, an infallible rule in finding the age of the animal; also giving twenty pages of valuable receipts for cures, 'and a complete glossary describing the medicines recommended. We have the opinion of Chauncy Copley, our best authority on the horse, that 'the book is a valuable one, well worth the money.' Its price ^s within the reach of the poorest farmer, and is worth the consideration and reference of those in better circumstances. Copies will be sent, in paper, for Twenty Five Cents ; in cloth for Fifty Cents, by addressing The Shaker Manifesto, Shakers, N. Y.
