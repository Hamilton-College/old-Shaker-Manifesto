Reason BT ABRAHAM PERKINS Faith is the effect of evidence, the assent of the mind, proceeding from light, and standing in close connection with the attributes of God, perfectly uncontrollable by any human power. Proportionate with knowledge of scientific truth, faith is made perfect. Therefore, when founded on just and eternal principles, principles nourished and lived, man is made better; while on the other hand, faith based on that which is perishable and false, he is relatively made worse, however sincere he may be, or however true to its support. Hence the importance of a knowledge of genuine godliness; and hence the necessity of an education that develops the understanding, enlarges the mind, and capacitates it for the reception of the seed of divine truth, in which is embraced a power to unfold the principles of all science, revealing a law in every creation and handiwork of God. We are therefore compelled to understand that all we see, hear and feel is the effect of cause; and however mysterious and incomprehensible to man, yet it is the result and operation of law, understood by a higher intelligence. God is a rational Being, and as order is His first law, His works must necessarily be in comformity to order and law. As a consequence, with God there is no miracle. Man being finite, is incapable of comprehending the infinite beyond that which is necessary for the profitableness and happiness of himself, and the acknowledgment of miracles would be the admission of other means of creation than by divine law, an incongruity in universal law, and a detraction of wisdom from the character of the Almighty, which is heretical to true faith, an offense against Christianity, and a doctrine untenable.
