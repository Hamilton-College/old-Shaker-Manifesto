'West Pittsfield, Mass. Sept. 1893. The tidy monthly 'Messenger' as a medium of intercommunion with kindred Societies, and a publisher of truth and righteousness, has to us become invaluable. The Editorial in Sept. number is especially significant and claims our closest attention. Another important item in June no. by Sister Amelia Calver, in which she notes the exhortation by Elder Daniel Offord regarding the care of our premises, is of moment. Were such wise counsels heeded by all, what a wealth of beauty might be added to our Zion homes. Br. Ira Lawson continues his efforts to make improvements. Is laying a line of ten inch earthen pipes a distance of over four hundred feet, to conduct water from the laundry and machine shop, to another shop. Has also placed two hydrants along the line to be used in case of accident by fire, and will attach two garden hydrants. A motor, the (Maelstrom), is to be placed in the dairy for churning purposes. The ancient method of hand churning will soon be a thing of the past with us, as it has long been with most of our Communities, , Two shops and two barns have received a new dressing of paint. Our hay crop, owing to the drought w;is light and of inferior quality. Oats yielded well, potatoes are proving fairly good, apples and pears not superabundant but may be sufficient for home consumption. Small fruits are scarce. To-day began cutting and drying sweet corn, but as a portion was destroyed and but sixteen acres remain the job will soon be despatched. A short time ago Sister Amelia Calver conducted a party of fifteen young Sisters from Mount Lebanon to our home for a day's outing. Arrangements were made for an open air entertainment, but the ground being damp the banquet was prepared in our large dining room and that, with the whole day's pastime, we trust was to all a mutual enjoyment.
