Home Work SARAH L. SAWYER Good breeding is something we may have without money and without price, by a little attention and a careful regarc of others' feelings ; by an intuitive feeling of delicacy, with 'Do to others as we would that they should do to us' the golden of all rules. O, that we might inculcate into our hearts a proper regard for others. We are sowing seed for eternity. It will be our sorrow if we do not improve the opportunity. God grant we may believe in season, before it is too late. Repent of our sins with a heart-felt sorrow, or we may be left to exclaim, in the bitterness of our souls, 'The summer is past, the harvest is ended, and my soul is no saved.' Let us subdue our vile pas sions, which bring death to the soul anc sorrow to grieved hearts ; making shad ows instead of sunshine. May we make beautiful, heavenly sunshine wherever we go. If we think we cannot do any good, may we do no harm ; and if we hink we cannot bring sunlight to darkened souls, may we be sure to bring no shadows. We need to search the gardens of our own hearts, weeding out he noxious weeds which choke the growth of the soul, and which will keep is out of the kingdom. Enfield, Conn.
