HOW TO SPLIT A SHEET OF PAPER The following is from the British and Colonial Printer and Stationer: It is one of the most remarkable properties of that wonderful product, paper, that it can be split into two or even three parts, however thin the sheet. We have seen a leaf of the Illustrated News thus divided into three parts or three thin leaves. One consisted of the surface on which the engravings are printed; another was the side containing the letter-press, and a perfectly blank piece on each side was the paper that lay between. Many people who have not seen this done might think it impossible ; but it is not only possible, but extremely easy, as we shall show. Get a piece of plate glass and place it on a sheet of paper: then let the latter be thoroughly soaked. With care and a little dexterity the sheet can be split by the top surface being removed. But the best plan is to paste a piece of cloth or strong paper to each side of the sheet to be split. When dry, violently and without hesitation pull the two pieces asunder, when part of the sheet will be found to have adhered to one and part :o the other. Soften the paste in water, and the pieces can be easily removed from the cloth. The process is generally demonstrated as a matter of curiosity, yet it can be utiized in various ways. If we want to paste in a scrap-book a newspaper article printed on both sides of the paper, and possess only one copy, it is very convenient to know how to detach the one side from the other. The &gt;aper when split, as may be imagined, is more transparent than it was before being subjected to the operation, and the printing nk is somewhat duller; otherwise the two rieces present the appearance of the original if again brought together. Some time ago the information of how to do this splitting was advertised to be sold for a considerable um, We now impart it to all our readers gratuitously.
