CONSOLATION A lark and a linnet sat on a limb That hung o'er the old mill-pond. Said linnet to lark as she smiled at him, 'You've heard of the Audubon? ' The lark lifted his foot and stretched his wing And poised his wise little head- - This wearing of birds is a cruel thing And killing us all,' she said. And therefore I'm glad, ' said linnet quite gay ' That steps are taking, though late, To break the mandates of fashion's sway And save us from such sad fate. ' The Audubon ' asks that birds shall be free In their haunts and wild wood home, From the sportsman's shot and the fiendish glee, Of the boy with his sling and stone. ' That our nests shall be safe from spoiler's hands, Our fledglings watched over too, And the use of our eggs for science's demands Be given to only a few.' 'Then joy notes of song o'er the world shall be heard Spite the decree of Queen Mab. And dear silly girls in lieu of the bird Can wear lobster, cuttle, or crab. ' Thus consoling each other the little birds sat On the tree by the old mill-pond- - As they whistled good-bye to the fashionable hat, And good luck to the Audubon.- -E. B. in The Bird Call.
