TRUST. Trust in God is the proof of faith ir. his wisdom and power. With faith in God we will trust Him fully for all that we need. Jesus said, 'If ye love me keep my commandments' and it should be a pleasure to us to study his life that we may know what he re- quires of us. With God for our shield we may gain the victory over error and wrong for He has promised 'never to leave nor forsake them that put their trust; in Him ' King Solomon has given us many wNe proverbs which might be of great service to us should we take a deep sense of their meaning and strive to live thereby. He counsels u.to 'trust in God with all our heart and lean not unto thine own understanding;' and again, 'Every word of God is pure, He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him.' Knowing that we are not strong enough of ourselves to resist evil, what a beautiful thought it is that we have a merciful, loving Father who will, if we humbly apply to Him. hear our prayer and assist us to do right. God has made many beautiful promsies to t;hose who love and obey Him, and if we have faith and trust in his power we shall become more like our Great Exemplar. Hancock, Mass. Henrietta Morgan.
