Cheap Food for the Starving Here is a suggestion for the starving poor of our large cities. The Boston journals furnish it gratuitously for the great number of destitute people in New York. Oat-meal is, of all foods, the cheapest and most nutritious. It is stated that three cents worth of oat-meal, milk costing the same sum, and sugar enough to sweeten it, will give a hearty meal to six persons for twelve cents. This, it will be remembered, is the price for milk in the East. Properly prepared, oat-meal possesses more bone and muscle-making material than any other food that can be purchased for the same money, and, though but little appreciated in this country, forms the staple food of a brawny race, remarkable for their devotion to athletic amusementâ€” the Scotch. The fact that oat-meal possesses a large amount of nutriment has long been pro- claimed by scientific men, and has long been prescribed by physicians as a diet for invalids. The suggestion of its use as food by the destitute people of the great cities is timely, and will doubtless be heeded.
