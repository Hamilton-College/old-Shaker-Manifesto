SANITARY LIGHT IN THE SICK-ROOM. It is the unqualified result of all my experience with the sick, that second only to their need of fresh air is their need of light; that, after a close room, what hurts them most is a dark room, and that it is not only light but direct sunlight they want. You had better carry your patient about after the sun, according to the aspect of rooms, if circumstances permit, than let him linger in a room when the sun is off. People think that the effect is upon the spirits only. This is by no means the case. Who has not observed the purifying effects of light, and especially of direct sunlight, upon the air of a room? Here is an observation within everybody's experience. Go into a room where the shutters are always shut (in a sick-room there should never be shutters shut,) and though the room be uninhabited, though the air has never been polluted by the breathing of human beings, you will observe a close, musty smell of corrupt air�of air unpurifiedby the effect of the sun's rays. The mustiness of dark rooms and corners, indeed, is proverbial. The cheerfulness of a room the usefulness of light in treating disease, is all-important. It is a curious thing to observe how almost all patients lie with their faces turned to the light, exactly as plants always make their way towards the light.�Florence Nightingale's Notes of Nursing:. HalVs Journal of Health. THE CURE OF WARTS. Warts are caused by an abnormal growth of certain elements or constituents of the skin. They are more apt to appear in childhood and old age, because at these periods of life the nutrition of the skin is as a rule at its lowest ebb, most inefficient, and is therefore liable to abnormal manifestations. Strictly speaking, they are the result of the excessive growth or hypertrophy of a small group of papilla; of the skin, accompanied by greatly increased production of the cuti- cle, forming an integumentary prominence. They may be of various kinds, as flat, with but slight prominence, and looking more like a dirty blotch on the skin than anything else, or they may have a prominence of a quarter of an inch or even more on some portions of the body. Being caused by perverted nutrition and abnormal growth, the best remedies tor direct cure include such proper constitutional treatment as shall increase the vigor and healthy development of the whole body through improved nutrition. In addition to this, local treatment can be given to remove or dissolve the abnormal growth and stimulate the sub-adjacent parts to healthy nutritive activity. Applications of acetic or nitric acid or a saturated solution of caustic potash carefully made by means of minute pencils or sponges, are among the best methods of treatment.�Laws of Life. To Prevent Felons.�The following directions, carefully observed, will prevent those cuticular and osseous abominations known as felons. As soon as the disease is felt, put directly over the spot a fly blister, about the size of your thumb nail, and let it remain for six hours, at the expiration of which time, directly under the surface of the blister, may be seen the felon, which can instantly be taken out with the point of a needle or lancet.
