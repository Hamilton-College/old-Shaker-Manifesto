THE CURE OF WARTS. Warts are caused by an abnormal growth of certain elements or constituents of the skin. They are more apt to appear in childhood and old age, because at these periods of life the nutrition of the skin is as a rule at its lowest ebb, most inefficient, and is therefore liable to abnormal manifestations. Strictly speaking, they are the result of the excessive growth or hypertrophy of a small group of papilla; of the skin, accompanied by greatly increased production of the cuti- cle, forming an integumentary prominence. They may be of various kinds, as flat, with but slight prominence, and looking more like a dirty blotch on the skin than anything else, or they may have a prominence of a quarter of an inch or even more on some portions of the body. Being caused by perverted nutrition and abnormal growth, the best remedies tor direct cure include such proper constitutional treatment as shall increase the vigor and healthy development of the whole body through improved nutrition. In addition to this, local treatment can be given to remove or dissolve the abnormal growth and stimulate the sub-adjacent parts to healthy nutritive activity. Applications of acetic or nitric acid or a saturated solution of caustic potash carefully made by means of minute pencils or sponges, are among the best methods of treatment.�Laws of Life.

As soon as the disease is felt, put directly over the spot a fly blister, about the size of your thumb nail, and let it remain for six hours, at the expiration of which time, directly under the surface of the blister, may be seen the felon, which can instantly be taken out with the point of a needle or lancet.
