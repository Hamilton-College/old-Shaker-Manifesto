HOME OF PEACE Home, home, home I There's beauty rife on every side, At golden morn and even-tide ; Home, sweet home I And music in the tranquil air, That floats around thy borders fair, Home, sweet home ! The world has lost its charms for me, For purer joy I find in thee, -*----*â€”. O, home, sweet home ! Joy which the world can never know, In thee from sacred love doth flow, O, home, sweet home ! A holy peace unmarred by sin, Is graven on thy walls within ; And sacred orders guard thee round, And safely shield on hallowed ground, Home, sweet home !
