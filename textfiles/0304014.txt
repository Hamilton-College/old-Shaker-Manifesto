THE SNOW STORM (Mary Whitcher.) What kindness of our Father, To spread a mantle o'er All dark and ugly features, Which face of nature bore! All draped in lily whiteness, The rocks and mountains' side; Alike the vales and hill-tops :— Thus would our Maker hide Our darkest wrongs with whiteness, Our weakness and our sin, If we beneath the covering Of Mercy would come in. This is the Lord's pavilion ; It covers all below; As doth the rain and sunshine, So doth the mantling snow. O when shall we consider What God for us hath done; And in that loving kindness Deal kindly with each o»e ? Canterbury, N. H.
