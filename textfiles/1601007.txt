Translation of the Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah RICHARD MCNEMAR ' Whoso hath confidently embraced our testimony, and in whom the seed of Jehovah hath produced a change, he shall shoot forth as a young twig before him, and as a root out of dry ground no form to him, no liberty to go about and be seen,and no appearance that he should be lusted after. Despised and totally neglected of personalities, a person of the appearance of a conjurer, feeling (or causing to feel) the most exquisite pain and as concealing his aspect from us, he is despised and esteemed as nothing, surely he hath borne with our weakness, and been burdened with our evil spirits! and at present we esteem him, in this manner, in contact with God and humbling himself but he was pierced with our transgressions and humbled by our acting upon him. To teach us, the way of peace is laid on him, and by joining to him health, and soundness is restored to us. We all like sheep have gone astray, Each one has turned to his own way; On him Jehovah caused to light, The only gift to set as right. ' Union Village, Ohio.
