Shakers, N. Y. April, 1899. We would render thanks to Sister Jessie Evans for the excellent article from her pen in the April Manifesto. While perusing it we thought what a blessing it would be to those who were struggling for the light, and yearning for that food which would strengthen their spiritual life, if such gifts of the spirit could he sown broadcast with a liberal hand; be placed where they could reach the myriads of lives that are now groping in darkness. It is a grand and inspiring thought that we have the immortal life with us now. That notwithstanding all the environments of a repressive nature that surround multitudes of life's pilgrims, the desire to attain unto life's higher levels can not be wholly suppressed, though for a time it may slumber, the individual not being conscious of its existence. We are glad to see that our Manifesto is doing far better than even that, son of Erin who said he 'started in life with nothing and had held his own.' We hope it will be sustained. It is a medium through which the testimony of the everlasting gospel can be sent forth to those who are hungering and thirsting for the bread and waters of life; and regardless of what external appearance may indicate the conclusion that we have drawn from reading and correspondence is that the principles of the higher life are being unfolded in human life as never before, its necessity is being made apparent to the lives of a large body of thinkers interested in human progress. We were one of a delegation who at- 76 THE MANIFESTO. tended a lecture by Rev. C. IT. Mead, at Lothridge hall, Verdoy, N. Y. on March 14th. 'The Mills that Grind,' was the subject of the speaker. It was a powerful incitement of the curse entailed upon society by the liquor traffic. The literarystyle was excellent, but overshadowing all else was the tremendous earnestness of the speaker, his utterances fell like sledgehammer blows upon that accursed system. We give our hand of fellowship to all such laborers. Hamilton DeGraw.
