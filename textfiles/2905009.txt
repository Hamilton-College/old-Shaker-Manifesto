It has been full of bluster, snow and sleet. Less than half of the days have been warm enough to force the mercury above freezing point. Tracing back several years T fail to find a March that equals the present one in sterility, inclemency, and unhealthfulness; especially the last. Very few if any have escaped being prostrated by sonic epidemic. The entire year of 1899 thus far has been a sickly one. Sleigh-bells have played their signal music the entire length of the month. Snow-banks are still spread over the landscape from 3 feet deep down to now and then bare ground. By appearance it will be the middle of April before the fanners begin to plough, sow and plant, if not later. We have finished sawing, splitting and piling our year's stock of fire-wood. As unpropitious as the season appears we are religiously and conscientiously told: 'The seasons tell us that God is Love, for he gave us the seasons,Spring with its fresh green leaves and buds, Summer with its flowers and berries, Autumn with its grains and fruits, and Winter, with its frost and snow, that cleanse the air and prepare the ground to be more fruitful.' Calvin G. Heed. South Family. April, 1899. Hick's weather predominates, and April with its showers of rain and housecleaning has come to stay for thirty days. The summer birds are returning singing songs of the resurrection of life, fore-runners of the good time coming, when snow-banks and snow-shovels will be seen no more, when frost and slush will disappear, when the orchards will blossom, the gardens and fields rejoice in a newness of life, and the frozen streams renew their onward march oceanward. We have read with delight the biographical sketch of Eldress Eliza Babbitt, published in the Phrenological Journal for January, and The Manifesto for February. For ninety-two years the world has been benefitted spiritually, morally, intellectually, socially and scientifically by this THE MANIFESTO. 75 much gifted woman. The Autobiography of Sister Mary Hazard was also read with interest. She too was one of God's noble women and better has grown the world for her eighty-seven years of unselfish service rendered in the cause of human elevation. We are busy making and repairing garments, attending to the various household duties and preparing for the annual house renovation. The chair enterprise continues, and demands the beautiful 'Shaker Chairs.' We find plenty of work for hands and mind; no time for idleness, which is a great blessing on our journey heavenward. We recently received a 'Souvenir of Rochester' published by James Vick's Sons, of Rochester, N. Y. The fine scenery of the famous Genesee Valley was pleasingly familiar. The 'Flower City,' as Rochester is often termed, is one of the grandest in western New York. The Genesee Valley is noted for its healthful climate and fine natural scenery; it represents one form of God's handiwork, and the Berkshire hills another. Geueoieve DeGraiv. North Family. April, 1899. A slow March indeed! and to many a funeral march. But be of good cheer. Soon the snow will be gone, for already the voice of the bluebird and of the robin is heard in the land. Another sound not so cheering is also heard; that of the beating of carpets and adjusting of closets prophetic of the grand house-cleaning so trying to the souls of the unregenerate and unclean,the white woman's burden! In the meantime the frisky calves and lambs ought to be making pastoral poems of our hill-sides; but alas! who cares to write or act pastoral poems in sheets of snow? Not the calves and lambs surely. It is the poetry of action that is most appreciated now and the beacons are flashing their signal fires from peak to peak, calling us to the battle; and of all people we should be first and foremost in this war waged against the wrongs of humanity. Let us keep the cobwebs swept from our brain and our soul as well as from our rooms. Less protesting against evil and more practice at putting this evil down and out; fewer words, among us, and more works. G. Ada Brown. Shakers, N. Y. April, 1899. We would render thanks to Sister Jessie Evans for the excellent article from her pen in the April Manifesto. While perusing it we thought what a blessing it would be to those who were struggling for the light, and yearning for that food which would strengthen their spiritual life, if such gifts of the spirit could he sown broadcast with a liberal hand; be placed where they could reach the myriads of lives that are now groping in darkness. It is a grand and inspiring thought that we have the immortal life with us now. That notwithstanding all the environments of a repressive nature that surround multitudes of life's pilgrims, the desire to attain unto life's higher levels can not be wholly suppressed, though for a time it may slumber, the individual not being conscious of its existence. We are glad to see that our Manifesto is doing far better than even that, son of Erin who said he 'started in life with nothing and had held his own.' We hope it will be sustained. It is a medium through which the testimony of the everlasting gospel can be sent forth to those who are hungering and thirsting for the bread and waters of life; and regardless of what external appearance may indicate the conclusion that we have drawn from reading and correspondence is that the principles of the higher life are being unfolded in human life as never before, its necessity is being made apparent to the lives of a large body of thinkers interested in human progress. We were one of a delegation who at- 76 THE MANIFESTO. tended a lecture by Rev. C. IT. Mead, at Lothridge hall, Verdoy, N. Y. on March 14th. 'The Mills that Grind,' was the subject of the speaker. It was a powerful incitement of the curse entailed upon society by the liquor traffic. The literarystyle was excellent, but overshadowing all else was the tremendous earnestness of the speaker, his utterances fell like sledgehammer blows upon that accursed system. We give our hand of fellowship to all such laborers. Hamilton DeGraw.
