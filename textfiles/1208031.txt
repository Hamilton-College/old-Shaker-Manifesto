Juvenile MY LITTLE BED. Written with, and for the, little girls Written with, and for the, little girls. LUCY S. BOWK US. (Continued from last number.) My blankets come from the meadows green. Where the blue-eyed grasses blow, And daises bloom, and hedges shade, And the dancing waters flow. It may seem strange but 'tis even true, As the lambs might all declare ; They live on the verdant sod, and thrive By the shepherd's kindly care. And the fleece of wool that covers them, Protects when the sky is cold; When the winds and show of the frosty days, Blow over the gentle fold. But as soon as the ices melt away, And the balmy June appears ; With submissive will it is sacrificed, To the workman's clipping shears. Then with spindles and loom, and warp and woof, The blankets are quickly made. What would we do, but for sheep and lambs, Through the chill of the mighty shade ! My pillow is made of the softest down, Though not from the icy shores, Where the Eider-duck builds her distant nest, But from poultry round our doors. The feathers feel good to the aching head; Or when sleep the eyelids close : And my coverlet is as fresh and clean, As the whitest thing that grows. What a goodly thing is my little bed; What a place for blessed dreams Of the far away hills, and meadow lands, Where the sun in its brightness beams. My mind is filled with the thought each day, Of the many who have no bed; Of how even the Saviour had naught on earth, Where upon to lay his head. And at even-tide when I go to rest, I will offer this humble prayer, That a thankful heart may be ever mine, For the blessings I daily share. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. A very smart boy returning from school attempted'to prove that two were equal to three. Pointing to a roasted chicken on the table, he said. Is not that, one? Then pointing to another,— Is not that two,—and do not one and two make three? Whereupon the father said, I will take one ; your mother may take one and our boy can have the third for his dinner.
