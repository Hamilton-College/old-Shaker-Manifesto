POET AND PROPHET By Cora C. Vinneo Oh mighty prophetâ€”soul of love and song: Thou rapt interpreter of truth divine, What other heart could echo songs like thine? Thy words struck vengeance, for their might was strong Against oppression in its court of wrong. Like wintry starlight o'er the groves of pine. Thine eyes beheld the light of freedom shine O'er ranks of slavery's sin-beclouded throng. And when thy magic fingers touched the keys Of Time's great organ, lo, the concert chord Struck the true note to life's grand symphonies, And rolled the finished anthem to the Lord. And with thy knees upon Faith's altar stair Thy gentle soul communed with God through prayer. SONG. O Prophets and immortal Sages Who have passed to spheres above, Left for us on fiery pages Eecords of your priceless love. The members then read shoi-t selections from Bryant's poems.
