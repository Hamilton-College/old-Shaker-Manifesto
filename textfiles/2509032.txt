HE WAS AN EDITOR. A haggard, pale and wretched man Once I met, Which from that day to this I can Ne'er forget; Clothed in garb of sundry dyes, Cut in every shape and size Low and plaintive were his cries Shunning everybody. 'Friend,' said I, 'pray tell to me All thy woes! Surely I would comfort thee At life's close.' 'Ah,' said he, 'the die is cast All my cheerful hopes are past; Now I must giv up at last Pleasing everybody. 'When I first began my labors,' Said the man, 'Then to try and please my neighbors I began; But I've led a scrry race Owning now no resting-place, Save the short six feet of space Due to everybody. 'If you try to please mankind As you go, Plenty of labor you wil find Here below. First a hit and then a miss, Sometimes No and sometimes Yes Pleasing everybody. 'Should the world declare you wrong, Never heed; If your cause is true and strong, Sow your seed. On life's stage act wel your part, Serve your God with honest heart; But giv over, from the start, Pleasing everybody.' ï¿½Selected.
