Current Events Current Events, the new magazine printed at Rockville, Conn., gives a complete review of the important news of the world every month, with timely illustrations, for 30 cents a year. It tells of the progress of the world in an accurate, interesting way, and it is therefore used by many teachers as a supplementary reader for school use. The publishers send sample copies free on receipt of postal. A feature of the April number is an up-to-date review of the China-.]apan war.
