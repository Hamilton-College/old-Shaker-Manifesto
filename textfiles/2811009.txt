Enfield, N. H. Oct. 1898. The articles in the Oct. Manifesto referring to our Florida society, bring to mind the saying,Life is exalted by the action of its varied elements. In the case of our 'Olive Branch' kindred, the elements of industry, intelligence and virtue consecrated to faith and life works like that of their Northern kindred, have wrought good results to their honor, and to the honor of Zion at large. May the fruits of their labors yield, not only a large harvest of the fruits of the earth, but an abundance of the joy of the spirit, for the laborious work so nobly and cheerfully done. Our home is environed with nature's most radiant gifts of autumnal colors, making a picture, beautiful to behold, and reminding us that by 'the action of its varied elements,' the earth never faileth to perform her mission well. Her products giving a silent sermon of loyalty and exaltation to the Creator of all good. We miss the merry songsters, the fields of ripened grain, and the well stockt vegetable gardens, but later on we shall enjoy the harvesting of field and garden, when snow and bleak winds take the place of the present genial atmosphere and beauteous scenery. We are pleased to record a short, but pleasant visit with Brother Arthur Bruce of East Canterbury, and subsequently one with Sister Eliza A. Stratton of the same place. The past month, our townsman Mr. C. Rich, kindly favored us with a fine program of phonographic selections, making an enjoyable evening. Sisters have prepared 218 gallons of varied fruit sauces, and are to add more are also engaged on fancy goods for next year's sales the past season being an exceptionally profitable one. We hope, with Brother Hamilton De Graw, that before long the nation with nation will cease to war, and their 'spiritual sensibilities' by 'the action of its varied elements' clasp them in bonds of eternal peace. George II. Baxter.
