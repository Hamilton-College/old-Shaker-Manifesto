THE LORD'S PRAYER. Printed by Tyndale in 1534. O oure father which arte in heven, halowed be thy name. Let thy kyngdome come. Thy wyll be fulfilled, as well in erth, as it ys in heven. Geve vs this daye our dayly breede. And forgeve vs oure treaspases, even as we forgeve oure trespacers. And leade vs not into temptaeion : but delyver vs from evell. For thyne is the kyngdome and the power, and the glorye for ever, Amen. Worcester's Dictionary.
