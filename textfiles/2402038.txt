'BLEST.' By Marion Bernstein. Blest be the tongue that speaks no ill, Whose words are always true, That keeps 'the law of kindness' still, Whatever others do. Blest be the ears that will not hear Detraction's envious tale; ' 'Tis only through the list'ning ear That falsehood can prevail. Blest be the heart that knows no guile, That feels no wish unkind, Forgetting provocation, while Good deeds are kept in mind. Blest be the hands that toil to aid The great world's ceaseless need� The hands that never are afraid To do a kindly deed. Blest be the thoughtful brain that schemes A beautiful ideal: Mankind grows great thro' noble dreams, And time will make them real. Do good in thought. Some future day 'Twill ripen into speech; And words are seeds that grow to deeds: None know how far they reach. Like thistle-down upon the breeze, Swift scattered here and there, So words will travel far, and these A fruitful harvest bear. Where goodness dwells in heart and mind Both words and deeds will be Like cords that closer draw mankind, In peace and charity. �Woman's Work.
