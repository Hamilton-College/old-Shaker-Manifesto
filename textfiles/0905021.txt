Notice: Summer Boarders In the limits of Harvard Society, situated one mile from Ayer, Mass., is Rural Home, which, considering its contiguity to the Society of Shakers proper, is not only the best opportunity to study the customs of our people, but is, withal, a quiet retreat and delightful resort for rest, or rural pleasures, at very reasonable rates. The people at Harvard and Shirley are models of Shaker polity and high principles. We know from experience, and we recommend Rural Home, for many good reasons, to summer boarders. The editor inserted a short advertisement in April number, which some have misconstrued as intended to imply that the Societies were to become the resort for boarders. We only intended the adv. to raise an honest dollar or two for The Manifesto, and we make this explanation ; and while paying Harvard and Shirley a part of the tribute of which they are worthy, also to say, toe forgive those sensation-loving parties who have so disturbed our valued publisher, if they will make their peace with him. The Societies proper are too commonly overburdened with transient visitors, and we mean all of this, to think of making application for either Summer Boarders or Winter Shakers.
