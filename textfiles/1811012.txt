Religion is the highest attribute in man's nature... Religion is the highest attribute in man's nature. It lies at the apex of cerebral consciousness, the grand acme of thought and feeling, the supersensuous element that links his soul to Divinity. It is that undefinable outreaching spirit, that ever seeks something above and beyond itself, and those material substances which tether it to the earthly plane of existence. From it, springs hope of immortality and eternal happiness. M. J. A.
