A HINT TO BOYS A philosopher has said that the true education for boys is to teach them what they ought to know when they become men. What is it they ought to know, then ? 1. To be true ; to be genuine. No education will be worth any thing that does not include this. A man had better not know how to read —¦ he had better never learn a letter in the alphabet, and be true and genuine in intention and action, rather than being learned in all sciences and in all languages, to be at the same time false at heart and also counterfeit in life. Above all things teach the boys that truth is more than riches, more than culture, more than earthly power or position. 2. To be true in thought, language and life — pure in mind and in body. An impure man, young or old, poisons the society where he moves with smutty stories and impure example, is a moral ulcer, a plague spot, a leper, who ought to be treated as were the lepers of old, who were banished from society and compelled to cry ' Unclean,' as a warning to save others from the pestilence. 3. To be unselfish. To care for the feelings and comforts of others. To be polite. To be just in all dealings with others. To be generous, noble and manly. This will include a genuine reverence for the aged and things sacred. 4. To be self-reliant and self-helpful even from childhood. To be industrious always and self-supporting at the earliest proper age. Teach them that all honest work is honorable, and that an idle, useless life of dependence on others is disgraceful. When a boy has learned these things; when he has made these ideas part of his being, however young he may be, however poor, or however rich, he has learned some of the important things he ought to know when he becomes a man. With these four properly mastered, it will be easy to find all the rest.
