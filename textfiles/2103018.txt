Hancock, Mass. Feb. 1891. Dbah, welcome, Gospel Messenger, Inspiring are thy truth-; As like a Godly counselor, They chasten, teach and soothe. Thy pages teem with richest thought, By able talent given; And wisely is each soul there taught, How best to live for Heaven. Not much news from the home circle at the present time. The winter which is nearly past, has on the whole, been very good. Snow and ice are plentiful and there has been a sufficiency of cold weather to make the climate healthful. Sickness, we are happy to say, has been almost a stranger. A few only, have suffered from heavy colds. The Company who are working the iron-ore mine have sunk their new shaft to the depth of a hundred and thirty feet, finding ore in abundance and of good quality. The foreman of the Company has erected for himself and family a new dwelling, and has at present in his employ some seventy or eighty workmen. J. L. S.
