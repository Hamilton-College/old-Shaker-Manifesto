TEACH ME THY WILL Prudie A. Stickney Teach me to live, each day, O Lord, As though it were the last; Improving every moment given More wisely than the past. Teach me to seek Thy ways divine, To know and do Thy will, Amid the tempest and the storm To trust and love Thee still. Teach me to act the better part, Though foes my path assail; And give me wisdom, strength of heart And courage, lest I fail. Teach me the way that leads to light, Away from doubts and fears; And bless me with a contrite heart While in this vale of tears. O give me faith to understand My work and calling too; Be firm and loyal in the strife Though volunteers are few. Tea, teach me Lord, that I may gain That blissful realm of peace, And drink from fountains pure and clean Where strife and discord cease. Teach me to live each day, O Lord, Improve the time that's given, With gentle deeds and acts of love Thus fit my soul for heaven. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
