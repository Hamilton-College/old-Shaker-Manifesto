Bbiggs. April, 1893. I can not begin these Notes without referring in thankfulness to God for his ï¿½wonderful workings in the hearts of his people, which are abundantly manifested in our hours of worship. The sharp and powerfully inspired testimonies of consecrated souls must be of a cleansing character for the holy, living temple of God, whose temple we are. The world looking for something it can not find, must yet come to Zion to hear the living word of the Lord. As Brethren and Sisters in Clmst, O let us all be fully alert to duty's call and to our active possibilities, that we may be able, when souls flock to our open windows, to have suitable abodes of righteousness, where we can receive and successfully care for them. The little leaven possessed by the small band of Believers on earth is to be the redeeming substance of lost humanity. The pearl of great price has been entrusted to our keeping; let us make a wise disposition of its benefits. As the seasons revolve bringing us the anxious seedtime, let us as expert sowers, give due attention to the thorny and stony places as well as to the good ground, and we can come again with rejoicing from a plentiful harvest bringing our sheaves with us. Although we are emphatically told to put our hands to work, it is not in the faithful performance of the daily duties alone, but when that is supplemented by giving our hearts to God, then we secure the full results of our mission. Our dairy supply of milk, cream and butter has maintained a uniformly superior showing, all through the late severe winter, thanks to unusually good stock management. The dooryard is at present the scene of some degree of activity in sawing, splitting and housing about six hundred cords of fire wood, the work being done by the Brethren, with the help of several hired men. Spring being backward with us, ploughing will not commence for some time yet. Our water supply naturally gave us considerable anxiety during the intense cold weather of the past winter; but trouble was altogether averted by the adoption of timely preventive expedients. The water THE MANIFESTO. 123 used in all of our houses and barns is forced to a distance of fifty rods and a height of one hundred and ten feet by a six inch cylinder and twelve inch stroke, Douglas force pump, run by a ten foot overshot water wheel with a continuous speed night and day of fourteen strokes a minute. This supplies us with about thirty barrels an hour, which is deemed insufficient for our present needs. We contemplate making improvements in the near future. Albert Evans.
