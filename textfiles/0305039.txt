OUR JOY AND HOPE When Christian faith and love abound, No threat'ning clouds arise ; When grace within the heart is found, All starlit are the skies. Life comes not then in dreary shape, But beauteous, bright, and fair ; The golden sands, as they escape, Most worthy record bear, Safe in our Parents' home of bliss, What glory we shall feel, When deeds of Christian holiness Shall be our spirits' seal. May our account be full and bright, Perfected through Christ's love ; And we be crown'd with holy light, To reign with him above. Julia Johnson, Hancock, Mass.
