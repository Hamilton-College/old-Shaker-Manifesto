Dear children: Take care of the.... Enfield, Oct. 188G. Dear Children :ï¿½' Take care of the minutes and the hours will take care of themselves.' Your time is flying, Oh so fast! Let each hour and moment in virtuous work be passed. So live that you can look upon a record in the use of time that will be pleasing and consoling. Spare moments wisely improved will bring durable riches. It is what you have in your hearts that makes you rich. Every hour has its wealth, and wise are you if you can gain it ere the hour is lost. Each moment of time is valuable. Each moment lost cannot be regained. Nothing can compensate for time misspent. To-day can never return, and tomorrow cannot hold the opportunities gone forever. 'To-day is God's time to-morrow is the adversary's. ' Time present is the only time for you. ' You have a little moment, it's given you just now, to do the work before you, the best that you know how. ' The past is gone. The present is here ; its duties and opportunities are yours now. By fulfilling the duties of this moment while you have it, you will be ready for the duty of the next moment when it comes. Do and be as near right as possible now, and strive for higher wisdom and achievement. Minute after minute hour after hour, your lives are being built up. Build on truth and virtue and you are safe. Your brother. Daniel Orcutt.
