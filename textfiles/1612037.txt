Books and Papers. Short Stories from the Dictionary The Christian Herald of Health Phrenological journal and science of health Hall's Journal of Health Short Stories from the Dictionary. By Arthur Gilman. Boston : The Interstate Publishing Company. Price 60 cents. Large books are not always the most instructive, however entertaining they may be, and a small work with a special purpose is often worth a shelf full of ordinary volumes. That fact is true of Mr. Arthur Gilman's Short Stories, which have a double valne, that of simple interest, and that of teaching readers to think. Although they were prepared forj'oung readers, there are very few who will not find in them much that is of genuine profit. The titles of some of the chapters will suggest some of the details of the boob�� 'Names of Countries,' 'Parts of the Body,' 'Names of Noises,' 'Handy Words,' and 'Dwellings and Other Places.' Although not prepared for school use, Stories from the Djctionary would make an admirable book for supplementary reading or study in our grammar schools. Among the many papers that go out from month to month on the mission of ' good news and glad tidings,' will be found ' The Christian, ' an illustrated Religious, Temperance, family paper. It contains four papers of 4 pages, each. The Christian, Safeguard, Armory and Common People, and all are filled with interesting and instructive reading. It is a good thing to be able to present a paper for the acceptance of all, old and young, with the assurance in your own mind that nothing will be read of which you need to be ashamed. II. L.
