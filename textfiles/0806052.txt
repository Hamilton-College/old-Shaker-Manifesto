FACING ITS POSITIONS The New Jerusalem Messenger says : In a recent address made by Mr. Macrae, one of the Scotch 'heretics,' he uttered bold and radical expressions. Such men in the Old Church will certainly bring it face to face with its untenable positions. This Scotch man, and others like him, must break up the spiritual soil of mankind for new truth and new life. The following are Mr. Macrae's words : 'The real heretic is the Westminster Confession. It misrepresents the character of God, and a false view of the position and destiny of man naturally follows. Carried to its issue, it robs God of his goodness, his mercy, and his justice. It robs him even of his sovereignty 'The first necessity, in the present state of things, is that the present policy of evasion and concealment should be reversed, and the Church's real convictions be made known. The second is that her Confession should be squared with her actual faith. The third is that this should be done on grounds that would make her new creed a help and not a hindrance, and allow her henceforth to advance freely, as God shall guide, to the full knowledge, and proclamation, and practice of the truth.'
