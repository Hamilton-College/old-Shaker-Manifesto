The company seated together, the Angel excepted, join in singing:� ' Merrily, O merrily we'll sing, sing, sing The hours glide so happily we'll sing, sing, siug Merrily, O .nerrily we'll sing, sing, sing. ' E. Well, sisters, are we all ready for the entertainment this evening? H. I am. Oar last was so pleasant, I even dreamed of it when I slept. E. So did I, and such a funny dream I had. I thought I was dancing and could not stop ; my feet seemed to be moved as by magic. I was weary enough, as you may fancy, and glad to awaken. F. I dreamed of gathering flowers, and I thought as fast as I touched them, they seemed to wither and fall in pieces. M. And I, sisters, had a vision that I cannot forget. I saw a fountain in the midst of a beautiful land. Sweet flowers grew on its brink, a.;d rainbows spanned it. Many bright beings were bathing in the clear waters, and I saw that when they came out their faces were radiant with beauty, and they seemed to be filled with exceeding joy and peace. 1 longed to bathe in the same fountain, but just as I was about to plunge into it, I felt a hand resting lightly upon my shoulder, and turning saw a beautiful angel standing near me, but a mournful look was in her eyes as she said, 'Not now, not now.' Just then, I awoke. O sisters, 1 am going to seek that fountain that I may bathe in its waters and find peace. I am weary of the frivolous dance and the gay song. This life of worldly pleasure has no rest. Who will go with me? F. Not I indeed, I am not weary yet of pleasure. //. Nor I, let us leave such a pilgrimage to others less young and happy. E. There is no such fountain, it was only a dream. M. Nay, sisters it was a vision from Heaven, I must go to seek that fountain. H. And leave us ? M. O, will you not go too? Angels will guide us and we shall find peace and rest. Others have sought and found it and why not we? Will you leave me to go alone ? F. You cannot mean to leave all of life's joys for an uncertainty. ( ?) E. and H. We are very sorry to part with you, but we are bound for pleasure. The three sing, ' Would you know where our barque is going O'er life's sunny sea, Down the tide gaily, freely flowing, Will you go with me ? The temple of pleasure pure, O'er life's sunny sea, How its shining gates allure, Why not come with me ? ' Scene II. M. alone. M. I am weary of my life of selfish pleasure. I would seek the Fountain of Peace. Spirit of my dream, O appear to me once mere and conduct me to those blessed waters. Enter Angel. M. Angel of my dream, lead me to the Fountain of Peace that I may find rest. L. The way is straight and narrow, can'st thou walk therein? M. Yea, O blessed Angel, if thou wilt direct my steps. L. But thou must be tempted first and tried and if thou wilt endure to the end, I will return and lead thee to the Fountain ; but the way often proves a weary one, a path of tears. Dost thou not shrink ? M. Not if angels guide me, not if it is a path leading to peace and rest. L. And wilt thou turn from the wild joys of thy youth, from the vain pleasures of the dance, from the flashing of gems and of gold ? Can'st thou leave thy gay young companions behind? M. Yea, blessed Angel, I turn from all these and pray for peace. But will it take years of trial? L. Trust me, my child, thou art yet untried, thy young happy life is now free from blight; be wise and on thy guard, for the tempter will come in many dazzling forms of beauty, wealth, worldly ambition and all that would lead astray thy young heart. Wilt thou bear the testing and leave all of earth's fairest and brightest treasures, and geek only those gifts that will enrich thy soul toward God? M. Bright Angel, I have counted the cost: now J pray, ' Lead me, lead me, angels, lead me To the fountain pever dry, Heed me, heed me, angels, heed me, Do my thirsty soul supply. ' L. And thou shalt find peace if thou wilt seek it aright ; thou shalt bathe in the fountain, but not now.�-not now. Scene III. M. alone. M. Peace, sweet peace, thou shalt be mine. When wilt thou come dear Angel, to lead me to the Fountain? Enter Spirit of Beauty. //. 'Dear child, I am come, To lead thy steps aright, I'll give thy spirit peace And bathe thy path with light, From Beauty, goddess fair, Commissioned now I come To lead thee, precious child To dwell within our home. Tsro sorrow e'er shall come And darkly brood o'er thee Thy life in peace shall flow, If thou'lt but come with me. ' M. Bright spirit! wilt thou. lead me to the Fountain of Peace ? H. Yea, dear child, I will lead thee to the only Fountain of Peace ; it is that of Beauty. Bathe in these waters and thy heart shall never know sorrow. 'Your path is thorny, rough and rude, And mine is broad and plain; My road is paved with flowers ard dews, And yours with tears and pain. ' M. And the path that leads thither ; is it straight and narrow ? //. O nay ! it is broad and beautiful, flowers, singing birds and bright waters are on every side. Come, walk therein with me. M. (turning away.) Nay, bright one, the path wherein I would walk is straight and narrow, but it leads to the Fountain of everlasting peace. O tempt me not, for� ' I will not give you my hand at all, And I will not walk with you ; Your way is the way to endless death. Your words are all untrue. ' Scene IV. M. alone. M. ' Vainly has the siren tongue, Of alluring Beauty Tried to turn my steps away From the path of duty. Onward now, with joy I press To the fount of blessedness.' Enter Spirit of Wealth, saying E. ' My child, come thou with me, Where gems are gleaming, Flashing hack the sun's gay beaming, Jewels bright shall crown thy brow, ' M. Who art thou, bright spirit? E. I am the spirit of Wealth, come to lead thee to the path of perfect bliss. Come and no care shall ever be thine, no sorrow shall come near thee, and thy life shall pass like a joyous dream. M. And is peace thine to give ? Can'st thou lead me to its Fountain ? E. O yea, fair mortal, my way lies through gorgeous palaces, where the sunlight falls through silken curtains, where the air is loaded with costly perfumes, where gold and gems gleam on every side, where statues and paintings charm the eye, and rich music lulls away all care. ' My path, you see, is a broad fair one. My gate is high and wide There is room enough for you and me To travel side by side. ' M. (turning away.} Bright tempter! I am dazzled with thy w?ords. O leave me, for it is a lowly path where I would tread, a path of purity and tears, a straight and narrow way. E. 'I will change your dress fora costlier one, I will give you pearls to wear, beautiful satins and shining silks Diamonds rich and rare. ' M. O tempt me not again ! E. Are you aware that 1, the spirit of Wealth, can furnish you with means to travel, to cross the broad ocan, to visit the fairest portions of this wide earth? I can take you to foreign lands, where art aud nature combined form one grand panorama of beauty. M. (covers her eyes as if in meditation.} E. It is well to take time to meditate. M. I need no time to meditate, my life purpose is fixed ! Our Savior did not yield to the tempter when all the kingdoms of the world were offered him. E. Such offers as I extend to you do not come everyday. I pave the way to the highest circles where you. shall mingle with those who will offer you lasting friendship and fill your cup with perfect happiness. M. And through all this, can I preserve a stainless character? E. Be not troubled about that, for where I lead, why fear? My power will shield from all apparent blight or stain. Dost thou now refuse to follow me? M. O spirit of Wealth, I know thy glitter is spread but to decoy. The fruits of thy life are bitter, they yield no lasting joy. Begone from my presence. Wealth retires. Scene V. M. alone. M. 'Better far than shining gold, And rich earthly treasures Sweeter far than beauty's voice And the smile of pleasure, Is the fountain of the blest, Where my weary heart would rest.' Spirit of Fame appears. F. O, weary mortal, listen to me ! I am earthly Fame, follow me and thou shalt earn a laurel wreath. Dost thou not know that mine is the only path toperfect happiness. M. Were I mre, O spirit of Fame that thou could^t give me peace and happiness, gladly, gladly wTould I follow thee. F. Tell me, wrouldst thou not have thy name written among the stars to glowforever in fadeless beauty? If s ) come with m3. M. I cannot follow thee, f r ? I want my name written In letters of fi le gold, Among the pure in spirit Wit'i the Lamb of God enrolled.' F. But how can you satisfy your tastes and develop the genius which mayhap you possess for some great and noble pursuit in that lowly narrow path. Come with me and mingle with my famous disciples. You may become a Bonheur, a Cushman, a Livermore, or a Bernhardt, but if you persist in the course you have chosen, you will not likely be known outside of your own household or neighborhood. Come ! if you will but trust my guidance, I will win for you a wreath of honor, fame and renown. Your name shall be enrolled among the brilliant and learned of the age, the proud ones of earth. M. ' Almost thou persuadest me. '� but stay� ' Though laurel wreaths should deck my brow, And costly gems upon me shine, Of what avail? O tell me how Will they adorn the immortal mind.' F. Why talk of the immortal? Thou art too easily troubled. Leave these delusive phantoms, follow me and win the more tangible treasures which I have in store for thee. M. Would not the laurel wreath of which you speak weigh heavily upon my brow? It is rest that I seek; does thy path lead to the Fountain of Peace ? F. O nay ! There is no rest with me, my votaries seek not for rest, but for activity and for the praises of the world. M. But if I succeed in reaching the Fountain, shall I not find as great characters there, whose lives are glorified by deeds of love, charity, and unselfishness ? That lovely throng I saw by the Fountain in my dream, must have done something great to have won such happiness. F. I never heard of that Fountain, I never heard of such characters. Their names are not recorded on the annals of Fame, but my path leads to earthly glory. Come with me and bask forever in its dazzling light. M. Leave me, thou wily tempter ; I have chosen a better part, I know the path wherein I must walk is straight and narrow, but the end thereof is perfect peace. Angels will guide me there, and the light of their presence will cheer me on. Dearer to bask in the smile of an Angel than in a flood of earthly glory. F. And die unknown. M. Go ! you shall not take from me my spotless name, for, ' Though I stand with the wealth of the ages, Encircled with fame and renown; Though my name upon historic pages, With worldly applause may go down, ' I am sure that the glories of the kingdom of heaven will never be mine, ' Unless as a child I receive, In humiliation of spirit, God's word to obey and believe.' F. What! reject this golden opportunity? Fame, honor, renown and vast research�All this shall be thine. M. Depart! depart! Tempt me no longer, lest judgment come upon you, for He hath given his angels charge concerning those who would seek that Fountain. Fame retires. Scene VI. M. alone. M. Tempted, but not forsaken, tested, but still I choose the path that leads to the Fountain of everlasting Peace. Sweet Angel of my dream, come, I need thy holy presence. (Angel enters.^) Blessed Angel! wilt thou now lead me to the Fountain of Peace, that I may bathe in its waters and be forever at rest? L. My child, thou hast borne thy trial bravely. I have watched ove thee with jealous care ; thou hast in- deed been sorely tried and tempted during thy short experience; yea, thou hast been permitted to realize in a meas lire the severe tests incident to a long life in Christian self-denial,�but hast not yielded ! Lo, now I will lead thee to the Fountain of full and perfect Peace, and place upon thy head the well-earned crown of everlasting life ;�and now for thy consolation, let me tell thee that these spirits who have appeared to thee in the guise of tempters are really guardian angels from my own bright spirit band, and were, at my bidding, sent to test the sincerity of thy faith. They will appear to thee as they really are, and now they come to accompany thee to the home of the blessed and welcome thee to the beautiful Fountain of everlasting Peace. They enter, singing. ' Beautiful ! Beautiful! Can ye not see Bright angels coming, Clothed in purity? Hear ye not the voices Of the heavenly choir, Inviting you heavenward, 'Come up higher.' ' Canterbury, N. H.
