OUT OF THE BELLY OF HELL 'Out of the belly of Hell, cried I, O Lord, and thou heardst my voice.'—Jonah. On the subject of religion, men think alike less than they feel alike, although on one point sensible men may be found to think substantially the same. That the mass of humans grovel, pursuing things beneath their dignity, needs no argument ; the painful fact is patent. The religious element, in our make up, is the lever whereby the powers above us, can lift us to higher planes of being. In this cardinal, philosophic truth, sensible people agree. To enable a soul to cry unto the Lord, out of the belly of Hell, 'tis not needful to be swal- lowed by a whale. When, by the Divine Afflatus, the religious element in us is stirred — when our souls reach out to grasp the purity of angels — when the strong current of lower law influence sweeps us back only to the things we abhor — when we feel our want of power to be what we seem to be — when, for lack of moral stamina, we do the things we would not — then out of the belly of hell we may, and will, cry unto the Lord, and our voice will be heard. When we say, Lord, what shall I do to be saved from the things I detest — things beneath my proper dignity ? When reverently we bow to our holiest, aspiration, by hand unseen will we be led in a way we know not; and when our integrity has been tested, we will hear a voice from the interior, saying, flg§T This is the way, walk ye in it. And now comes the tug of war, the test of manhood and womanhood.
