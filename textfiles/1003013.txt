Lafayette We present in this number, some of the curious observations of Lafayette in earth life, among the Shakers. Since his departure to the Spirit land, every society of the Shakers has heen frequently visited and happily noticed by this exalted and noble soul, in the most unmistakable manner. Very many anecdotes of the foremost men of our nation, past and present, and their happy association with the Shakers, might be collated and profitably presented to the public. Unworthy of notice and esteem, as many worldloving, flesh-seeking, pleasure-hunting, so-called Christians, think the Shakers are, it is a valuable thought to us, that the noblest men and women, of past and our own times, and of our own and other countries, have considered it no condescension to seek and merit our esteem, and they missing no opportunity to repay the favors.
