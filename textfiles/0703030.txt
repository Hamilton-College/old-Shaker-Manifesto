OUR RECIPE NOOK. Graham gems. â€”One quart milk and two even cups of Graham flour. Beat together so us to be smooth, and free of lumps; then turn in well-buttered and very hot 'gem irons,' and bake in a quick oven. Made in this way, they are very light, tender and sweet, needing no soda nor salt. If made any stiifer, they will not be light.
