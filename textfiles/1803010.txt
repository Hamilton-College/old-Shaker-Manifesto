SPRING. Watson Andrews. There's life in every lovely flower, There's life in every breeze. There's life among the verdure bright That glitters on the trees. There's sunny light in golden waves And balmy fragrant air, That clothes the Spring in loveliness, Most beautiful and fair. Then how delightful now to think On that celestial sphere, Where ceaseless sunshines ever glow In one eternal year. [ripe, Where flowers are bright and fruits are And birds forever sing; Where all is joy and love and life In one eternal Spring. North Union, Ohio.
