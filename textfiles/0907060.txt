Sulphur a Remedy for the Striped Bugs I have read of various remedies for this pest. The best remedy I have ever tried is sulphur. I have used it with success for the last three years. Dust the plants well with it. The best time is when the dew is on the young plants. No one need be afraid to put it on, for it will not injure the plants. It is also a good remedy to prevent insects from injuring young cabbage plants.â€”A Farmer, Vermillion Co., hid.
