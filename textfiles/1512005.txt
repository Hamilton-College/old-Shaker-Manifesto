DECEMBER. The snow has come at last, The Winter sign is seen,� Ere this, the cold and blast, But now the solemn sheen ! All nature lies shut in,� Bright Autumn's clay is o'er, Too late, here to begin To lay our Winter's store, But if our garner's full We have no cause to fear, With us it standeth well At close as dawn of year. Each season claims its place, And man has but to learn In nature, as in grace, His needed bread to earn. M. W. Canterbury, N. H.
