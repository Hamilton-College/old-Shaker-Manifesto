ABSTEMIOUS MEN The most successful thinkers are usually frugal in their habits of eating and drinking, yet this is not always true, as in the cases of Dickens and Bayard Taylor ; but these men died long before their time. Careful living would, without doubt, have enabled them to extend their lives many years, and to give much riper productions to the world. Sir Isaac Newton was a close student, and lived to be more than four-score years of age. He used to say that he could not think clearly until more than five hours had elapsed after a meal. The most eminent men of our time are very careful livers. A. T. Stewart, the merchant prince of America, lived frugally, and Jay Gould, the richest man on the continent to-day, is said to be the most abstemious. Commodore Vanderbilt was exemplary in this respect, as were Horace Greeley, Abraham Lincoln, Solon P. Chase, Edward Everett and John C. Calhoun. It is said that when Henry Ward Beecher expects to make an unusual effort in public, he postpones a meal, if it comes near the hour for his lecture, and waits until he is rested afterward before he eats any thing; and he has every prospect of being a hale old man. We might mention Ralph Waldo Emerson and Bronson Alcott, who are among the wisest men of their time, and whose wisdom takes in the very best sense. People cannot eat their loaf and keep it at the same time. They cannot squander their vital force in high living and continue to give their best effort to the world. A man ought to be able to write his best after he is seventy, for then he has had experience enough to show him how to begin to live. When we think of such men as Humboldt, Longfellow, and Whittier doing their best work in the evening of their lives, we feel conscious of a lack in the abridged existence of Dickens, Poe and Byron. We feel satisfied when men die of old age ; but mourning memory lingers long at the grave of genius, cut down by dissipation before its time. Walter's Health Journal.
