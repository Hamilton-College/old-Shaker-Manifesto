Autumn AUTUMN. Gently the autumn leaves are falling, And seem to retiring summer calling, Your time of blooming now is done ; You've acted nobly and pleased every one ; Even the little birds think it time To fly to some more pleasant clime ; The flowers droop and hang their head, And silently retire to their earthly bed ; And in quietness they dormant lay Till warm April showers seem to say, Awake ! robe yourself as soon as you can, And melt the frozen heart of man. As the birds homeward flying go It reminds us that we'll soon have snow ; Then only the snow birds fly around In search of food on the frozen ground. Autumn winds with their rude caresses, Disrobe summer of its verdant tresses : As its time in life is passing away, And soon it will leave it bare and. gray. Autumn seems to carelessly forget its vows, As it rustles the leaves from the boughs, Yet how thoughtful, for the winter's storm, Will not break its limbs, and be kept warm, Its feet, by the leaves profusely strewed, With their bright variegated colors hued. Soon we will have a destroying frost, Yet in nature's economy nothing is lost; Nature, as well as man, needs some rest; In spring it will burst forthwith vigor blest. The flowers will return, the birds all sing, And smiles of happiness to man it will bring. While the leaves are falling, remember, all, The future is prepared by the pleasant fall. Reflector.
