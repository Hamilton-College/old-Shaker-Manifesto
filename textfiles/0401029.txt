The following nine propositions constitute its platform, which would be simply absurd, or worse, for any Unitarian or Universalist to pretend to accept: â€” '1. The divine inspiration, authority, and suffi- ciency of the Holy Scriptures. ' 2. The right and duty of private judgment in the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures. ' 3. The unity of the Godhead and the trinity of the persons therein. ' 4. The utter depravity of human nature in consequence of the fall. '5. The incarnation of the Son of God, his work of atonement for the sins of mankind, and his mediatorial intercession and reign. '6. The justification of the sinner by faith alone. ' 7. The work of the Holy Spirit in the conversion and sanctification of the sinner. '8. The immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the body, the judgment of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, with the eternal blessedness of the righteous, and the eternal punishment of the wicked. '9. The divine institution of the Christian ministry, and the obligation and perpetuity of the ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper. There was a quiet little election in the town of Bushnell, 111., a few days ago, to obtain an expression of the wishes of the citizens for or against licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquor, and the Judges decided that as it was desirable to obtain the general sentiment, they would receive the votes of the women also. This being made known, 125 ladies assembled at the Methodist Episcopal Church, and thence marched to the polls and deposited their ballots unanimously against license. The vote of the town was strong the same way.
