INVITATION. Daniel Orcutt. Jesus said, 'Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Come away from the strife and sin of a worldly life and be at rest forever. It is a present rest. How soothing is the sentiment, the true cross-bearer finds soul rest. Not only is the self-denying way pleasant and safe, but there axe heavenly guides to cheer and direct our footsteps. 'Come unto me.' What a heavenly call to the sin-sick soul that is groping in darkness, seeking rest and finding none. In a sinful life there is continual unrest. The immortal soul can be satisfied with nothing short of the forgiveness, protection and love of God. 'All ye that labor.' The invitation is unqualified. For the erring, the sin-burdenedï¿½all who will may partake of the waters of life freely. In the world there is tribulation, no shield from trouble and sin, but in Christ there is peace and rest. How blessed to be at rest in Him. Sheltered in his peaceful fold we are safe for time, safe for eternity. The Manifesto grows in value from month to month. We wish its visits were weekly.
