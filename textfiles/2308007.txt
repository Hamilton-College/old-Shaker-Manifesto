TO-DAY. Lura A. Boies. [Contributed by S. Barker.] In the great world's ceaseless striving, In the jarring din and strife, Shall we call to-day a trifle? Is it not our all of life? Ah! we may not look beyond it. Yesterday we know is past, We may never see to-morrow, This to-day may be our last. Only time for earnest action, Only time to watch and pray, O what meaning, vast, eternal, Centers in the word, to-day! Every deed to-day shall witness, Every holy deed of love Borne by God's recording angel To the dazzling throne above� Every word the lips shall utter, Be it ill or be it well, Solemnly or lightly spoken, On the endless years shall tell. Ye who spurn the crown of glory, Turning from the higher birth; Bartering the great immortal For the shining dust of earth� Wake to earnest life and duty, Dream no more the hours away; Endless joy or endless wailing Hang upon the vast to-day. O whene'er the blessed sunlight Ushers in the holy morn; When the yesterday is buried, And the new to-day is born, Let us work anew for heaven, Let us wait and watch and pray, Knowing that we meet hereafter Every thing we do to-day. Then the veil shall be uplifted From the vision faint and dim, And the song of time shall mingle With the grand eternal hymn. Yea, our life shall be an anthem Swelling up the shining way, And eternity the finale Of the glorious to-day. �Selected.
