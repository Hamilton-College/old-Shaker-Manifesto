Shakers, N. Y. Nov. 1895. We have lately been much interested in the perusal of 'Emerson's Essays.' The thoughts given and the style of expression prove him to be an illuminated soul, a true prophet that had already caught a 280 TERMS. THE MANIFESTO. 28 L glimpse of the dawning day. His essays would make interesting and instructive reading for lyceums and self-improvement societies for the coming winter. The past season witli all its drawbacks has been generally a prosperous one. The crop of apples was fair but not as large as the previous season. Hay very light crop, but potatoes the best for several years; corn good. So we can with grateful hearts render thanksgiving for the blessing we are under and to remember the poor and needy. We have an occasional visit from the 'Little Sisters of the Poor,' a charitable institution located in Albany; their work is commendable as it is given free depending upon contributions for support. Of the new varieties of sweet corn that we have tested the past season, we have not found one that equaled' in quality the 'Country Gentlemen,' a variety introduced the past season. It is a late variety and for a family garden can not be surpassed. The Burpee's Dwarf Lima Bean still proves a valuable acquisition, being a true Lima, enormously productive and of excellent flavor. We are at present enjoying beautiful autumn weather very desirable for the completion of fall work, but are needing rain. At present date Nov. 3rd we have had but one slight flurry of snow.
