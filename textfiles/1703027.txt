'REVELATION.' BY EVA A. H. BARNES . Tis being written day by day - - Its sacred mystic pages Shall gleam athwart life's darkened way And bless the future ages- - Wherever hearts flame out anew With Truth's most perfect splendor, And tongue and pen leap strong and true To bear the message tender : Wherever soul speaks unto soul The word that satisfies, Revealing Life a mighty Whole Reaching beyond the skies, There we may find 'God's Word' divine Revealing in wondrous measure, There find upon a holy shrine The soul's most perfect treasure. The Past has had its prophets, seers ; The Present greets the morning Foretold by them ; and now appears New Light the heights adorning. Then let us read the magic scroll With thankful, reverent feeling, Accepting as Truth's mighty whole The Word' of wondrous healing. From The World's Advance Thought.
