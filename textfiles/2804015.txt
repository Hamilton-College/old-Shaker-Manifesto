RECEIPT FOR A LADY'S DRESS. [Contributed by Eldress Anna E. Charles.] In looking over some old papers I found in a copy of the 'Weekly Register,' publisht Wednesday, July 31, 1816 a receipt for a lady's dress, and thinking the fashion would be just as charming to-day as eighty years ago, I venture to send it to your very interesting pamphlet. 'Let your earrings be attention, encircled by the pearls of refinement, the diamonds of your necklace be truth, and the chain Christianity; your breastpin charity,, ornamented with the pearls of gentleness; 61 62 THE MANIFESTO. your finger rings be affection, surrounded with diamonds of industry; your girdle be simplicity, with tassels of good humor; let your thickest garb be virtue, and your drapery politeness; let your shoes be wisdom, secured by the buckles of perseverance.' It seems such a dainty conceit that I thought the readers of your pages might enjoy it too. ï¿½Selected.
