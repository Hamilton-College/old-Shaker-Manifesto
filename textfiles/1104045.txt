LUCRETIA MOTT A radical and thorough advocate of the peace cause — a mother to her people — has departed to her home in the better land. Her struggles for peace will be better appreciated in af't»r years. Her fame as a reformer will spread with increasing luster. She dedicated herself to the cause of righteousness in the early dawn of womanhood, and her whole life bloomed with heavenly fragrance. The fruits thereof made the world rich with its blessings. Hope, faith and labor made her precious life a perfect melody. No matter how steep the ascent, she went up into the mountain and blessed the multitude. She was born January 3d, 1793, and quietly closed her mortal career on the 11th of November, 1880. Among her sayings we record the following : ' We must not admit that war is right under any circumstances. We must take higher grounds than this. Bible authority in favor of war should not blind us. In the Bible we have accounts of Israel's God beingwarlike. We have divine tuitions and a higher standard than this. It is not in man's higher nature to fight. Long before Jesus there were advocates of peace. Even Buddh ists are surprised to find what a warring people we are. Moral power is found to be all-sufficient to go/era children. It is wrongto bring up boys of the Girard College as soldiers.' Thefe admonitions were always spoken by her in tenderness and decision. May her wise teachings be long remembered, and may more of her sex lift their voices for Christian love, purity and peace. Amen.
