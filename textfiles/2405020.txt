Pleasant Hill, Ky. April, 1894. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½Please accept thanks for the books; we shall read and endeavor to profit thereby. We had a disastrous frost which destroyed our early vegetables, oats, and the fruit, except strawberries and raspberries. The wheat is uninjured, corn and potatoes also unhurt. We had peas almost ready to blossom, but we are glad it is no worse. On Feb. 12, we had a wind storm which blew down fences and tore a portion of the tin roof from the Office, but we were fortunate to escape with so small a loss. Accept with this our best love and our repeated thanks for your kindness. James W- Shelton.
