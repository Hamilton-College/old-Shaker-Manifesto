NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Although in the home notes for New Lebanon in the Sept. No. 'enough' was the unanimous verdict rendered on the rain question, we have since found that there was 'more to follow.' September rivaled its weeping predecessors ; but the heaviest rainfall since September 1869 in cur locality, was between the 15th. and 18th. of the month. The earth could hold no more and the water seemed to flow in sheets over the surface. We on the mountain side with a succession of ponds and reservoirs above us had some cause for alarm, until after much exertion, at just the right moment the floodgates were opened. But what relieved us, added to the misery of the inhabitants of the valley below, and we could look with commiseration on the spreading water in the valley, while the people there were equally sympathizing with us as they saw the muddy torrents pouring over our hillsides. The under-ground drains became so filled with driftwood, (and even fish) that they refused to secrete the troubled waters, and sent them broadcast almost to our doors; and for a time on the morning of the 17th. we were unable to ford the current by the street fence without rubber boots; and we watched with anxiety as it crept closer to our doors. But arduous and steady labor on the part of the Brethren, at last narrowed the floods to their proper bounds, and we rejoiced that our well-made dams and reservoirs had so nobly proved themselves. It will yet be some time probably before the wash-outs will all be filled in as smoothly as before, for on surveying the premises the next day we could but repeat the poet's words : 'A morning-glory o'er a ruin The blue sky seems to-day So worn and storm-clad is the earth, So prematurely gray.' A. J. C. Center Family. Oct. 11, 1890. Dear Elder Henry :�We have succeeded in securing our apple crop in good condition; picked between three and four hundred bushels for winter supply and have gathered Squashes, Beets and Beans. Cabbages are bursting open badly, partially in consequence of excessive moisture and partly in being transplanted too early in the season. Our people are much pleased with the appearance of the tile flooring in kitchen department. Our Ministry returned here from Watervliet on the 8th. inst., Elder Daniel somewhat improved in health; Elder Giles not so well. Sisters in usual health. \ Your Brother, T. Eatson. Sontli Family. Oct. 3, 1890. Dear Editor:�It is said 'there is a time for everything.' We sometimes think there is, but not much time for writing. We are enjoying these beautiful autumnal days and only wish they would tarry a long time, before the snow comes and our picturesque scenery must go. We will make the best of the coming winter, hoping that Oct. 1891 will find us all better and wiser. We are cutting and drying sweet corn. It is very nice. Brother Henry is securing some good winter apples ; not a full crop by any means. Last Sabbath day we met at the meeting-house again. We have not missed once this season, there has been more speaking than ever. If every one could preach as Elder Frederic Evans did last Sabbath, evil would not long be in existence. Our Saturday evening meetings for prayer are very necessary, but not as substantial as our Society meetings are. S. A. C. Hancock, Mass. Oct. 13. The farm crops are nearly all secured, and we are moving along in 'the even tenor of our way,' preparing for the approaching winter. The fine crop of potatoes of which we made mention in our notes for Sept. are decaying. Then too, the almost perfect weather which we lauded so highly, took its departure immediately, and we have been blest with few pleasant days since. Yesterday was a day of rare beauty. In- spired by the glories that autumn unfolds, and the soft breezes that were borne on the wings of the sweet scented air, we embraced the opportunity to enjoy a ride to the celebrated town of Lenox. It was formerly the Shire-town of our county, and is famed for being the home of several renowned authors. It is also distinguished for being the summer resort of the lovers of the beautiful in nature ; and for people who, weary and worn with the friction, bustle and din of city life, seek retirement and health restoring tonics, that this grand old town, with its salubrious air, glorious scenery and romantic beauty affords. As we wended our way thitherward, over hill and dale, past field and forest, journeying now by the side of a murmuring rill, again passing near a sheet of clear water, formed perhaps by the Omnipotent Creator; then another which may have been artificially formed by man, we were forcibly impressed with the truth, that all things possessing life, whether of the animal or vegetable kingdom, have their seasons to live, grow and decay, while the human being alone holds in its animate form an immortal spirit, which must and will exist eternally. The leaves, which a few weeks ago wore a bright green, have taken on gorgeous hue?, as though in anticipation of a return to mother earth, and the golden rays of the sun beaming upon everything, greatly enhanced their beauty. We do not wonder that the people of densely populated cities are attracted to this romantic town. The Co. who are working our ore-mine think the prospect for obtaining large quantities of iron is bright, as a mountain of the best quality of ore lies below the surface. They have made a new building and will sink another shaft, thus increasing their facilities for more extensive operations. We have in our family an enterprising German boy eleven years of age, who has the past season trapped nineteen woodchucks, and it needs but one more to round up the score, two pole-cats added make good the number. Jack Frost has made us several visits, impressing us thoroughly with a knowledge of his presence on two occasions, by his rude behavior. To close our notes, will state that we are being wonderfully blest with health in our little circle, as there is not at present a name on the sick list. Hoping we may be able to appreciate our manifold blessings we close; wishing you abundant success and prosperity. J. L. S. Enfield, Conn. What more happy thought can we have on leaving this world than that we are better for having lived in it. The only thing for us is to do the present duty, no matter how insignificant it may seem, and trust in God unquestioningly. Let us cherish a high ideal, and try to live up to it; but forget not the little things of every day life and need. Little by little great things are accomplished. The little things are frequently the important ones. Lots of little things can be done now that may save many dollars in the ne r future, when other and more important matters need looking after. The accepted time is now. Swift the flying seasons pass, time is on the wing. It is the constant care exercised over every part of the household, and constant endeavor to improve and apply our be.-t powers to our work, that alone gives peace, happiness and prosperity. Our six thousand strawberry plants Iook vigorous and give promise of a large crop next season. Top onions yielded well. Our dooryard is improved by new fence and plank walk. We may visit farm after farm, and see stables, cattle-sheds and stalls all erected on the most improved style, but not the least provision made for the poor neglected hen, and yet she will pay well if only treated like other stock. Properly managed compared to almost any other business, the returns would be substantial. 'Pratt's Poultry Food' is a good egg-producer. All kinds of grain are best for hens when cooked with other food. D. Orcutt. Harvard, Mass. Oct. 4, 1890. Dear Editor ;�October finds us pushing hard at the autumn work. We have finished filling our silo for the second time. Our first ensilage was not entirely fed out before we turnod the cattle out to grass. This yviir vre shall commence the first of Nov. Our onion crop turned out splendidly, very near 100 bushels. We lud almost two acres of* peas and beans which would have been No. 1, had nut the late rains continued so long while curing them. Our yellow field corn is the best we ever raised. Our herb crop which we depend upon to fill the Purse has been good. The herbs are all harvested and dried. This sums up the temporalities. Our Society for the last six weeks has been scourged more or less with the plague. God promised to take sickness away from his people, and by the powerful remedies of God's sunshine and a cheerful spirit guided by a clear conscience we are driving the plague back into Egypt where it is said to have its origin. Elder John Whiteley was greeted with a welcome from his old friends on Tuesday the 2nd inst. He seems to have stood the journey far better than our expectations fancied. Sunday the 31st of August we attended meeting at the south family :�something that had not happened before in Harvard for many years, and truly it was a meeting of heavenly refreshment and good things. Friday the 5th, a company of gospel friends from Alfred, Me., made us a short visit, viz. Br. Henry Green, Strs. Fanny Casey, Mary Ella Douglas and Letta Pinder. They are children of the resurrection order. They bear the fruits gained by a life of selfdenial. When it comes to my lot to be associated with such souls I cannot restrain the prayer that goes out from the deepest recesses of my soul. O that our ranks may again be filled with such examples of God's boundless love and charity. 'Let me wear out in the service. Let me never disgrace one narrow spot of God's beautiful earth by wearing beneath its fresh, growing turf a winding sheet of rust.' A. Barrett. Canterbury, N. H. Oct. 18, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�We left home notes when you began with the meeting in the Oct. number. Wishing to hear from each Society, we would not send you too much at one time. However, as good things, friendly calls, visits and precious associations of Gospel kindred, do not lose flavor by keeping, we will note an enjoyable season of call and visit in one unbroken chain of satisfaction which came to us, Sept. 11, and finally closed Sept. 26.�Brother Samuel Kendrick, accompanied by four loving Sisters from Gloucester, Me. [The length of this tarry may puzzle some who do not understand the efficacy of rain at such seasons; but visitors, or 'visited' can readily explain.] Brother Samuel lived in Canterbury from boyhood to middle age, when, being one whom the Lord and his Brethren and Sisters loved, hence chastened, he was asked to give his services in other parts of the vineyard. The good Brother is a host in himself, and is thus able to inspire from his wellsecured treasures of love and wisdom. He cast no shadow, but comfort and peace followed him, proving that a consecrated Christian life may be fraught with rays of mirthfulness which often add pleasure to the passing day. His companions stirred afresh our love for all Gospel friends. Such loyal daughters are above price as virtuous women�standard-bearers in Zion ! A call from Br. Daniel Orcutt and two Sisters from Enfield, Conn., pleased us much, as well as Brethren and Sisters from other Societies. We have been not only pleased, but crowned with blessing by these messengers of peace, who have been more in number than for several years past. Come again, good friends. Do not forget us during the winter months. We shall have sunshine ever in our hearts. Br. Daniel, the 'children's friend,' was especially welcomed by our youthful class, who have for so long a time treasured the gems of counsel, so regularly contributed to the Manifesto. Continue to write, good Brother. With our friends and neighbors we have harvested medium crops of apples, pears and potatoes, and have surprised ourselves in gathering about eighty bushels of peaches. At one period there were fears of potatoes suffering from rust and rot, but with a change of weather, hope and potatoes have revived. Our herdsman in lis care for the food of the milch cows during the winter has harvested 100 bu. of carrots, 100 bu. of Gate Post beets, and 200 bu. of Jumbo beets, and the Dairy tells the benefits. We have made more extended repairs in several buildings than we anticipated in early spring and rejoice to-day in many added conveniences, among which are several canopies over outside doors. General Good Health is with our Society and we engage him for the winter. Our Brethren and Sisters of the North Family conclude to meet with us for worship every fair Sabbath during the winter, also contribute to our evening schocls. Don't fail. Enfield, N. H. Oct. 5. We are of the same heart and mind as our sister, who said in the last issue, 'The Home Notes Corner' filled out a niche that nothing else could, as pleasantly and profitably. It is really comforting to learn that our patron Society has 'well-kept lawns, orderly surroundings' which without doubt say to the passer by 'Come;' and although we know 'Misery likes company' as a rule, there must be exceptions, for if we cannot with propriety, say this of our home, wo joy that others are nearer the mark. Our homes should be the best on earth, homes for both body and soul, not expensively decorated but neat and orderly, hence attractive. If the consecrated earnings of 'The faithful' did not have to be doled out to hirelings, enough might be in the Lord's treasury, to supply all Godly wants. Our Autumn term of schot&gt;l opened Oct. 6th, later than usual, on account of repairing being done by outside parties, who now own the house. A larger supply of apples than was anticipated, but very few for cider, about three hundred bushels, where we sometimes have ten, this will please the temperance people, though I believe ours is mostly boiled for the famous cider sauce, or made into vinegar for pickles. Potatoes enough, if used judiciously. We have no righteous cause for complaint, only that we who are called to practically illustrate the possibilities of our Order, are not better able to fulfill our mission, and that no more are led to a knowledge of its value. This we have faith to believe, is in 'The good time coming.' E. B.
