Enfield, N. H. Oct. 5. We are of the same heart and mind as our sister, who said in the last issue, 'The Home Notes Corner' filled out a niche that nothing else could, as pleasantly and profitably. It is really comforting to learn that our patron Society has 'well-kept lawns, orderly surroundings' which without doubt say to the passer by 'Come;' and although we know 'Misery likes company' as a rule, there must be exceptions, for if we cannot with propriety, say this of our home, wo joy that others are nearer the mark. Our homes should be the best on earth, homes for both body and soul, not expensively decorated but neat and orderly, hence attractive. If the consecrated earnings of 'The faithful' did not have to be doled out to hirelings, enough might be in the Lord's treasury, to supply all Godly wants. Our Autumn term of schot&gt;l opened Oct. 6th, later than usual, on account of repairing being done by outside parties, who now own the house. A larger supply of apples than was anticipated, but very few for cider, about three hundred bushels, where we sometimes have ten, this will please the temperance people, though I believe ours is mostly boiled for the famous cider sauce, or made into vinegar for pickles. Potatoes enough, if used judiciously. We have no righteous cause for complaint, only that we who are called to practically illustrate the possibilities of our Order, are not better able to fulfill our mission, and that no more are led to a knowledge of its value. This we have faith to believe, is in 'The good time coming.' E. B.
