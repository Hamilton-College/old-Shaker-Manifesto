WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE POOR. Silver spoons are used to scrape kettles. Coffee, tea, pepper, and spices are left to stand open, and lose their strength. Potatoes in the cellar grow, and sprouts are not removed until the potatoes become worthless. Brooms are never hung up, and are soon spoiled. Nice handled knives are thrown into hot water. The flour is sifted in a wasteful manner, and the bread-pan is left with the dough stick-! object is to give a complete 'review of what ing to it. Clothes are left on the line to whip to pieces in the wind. Tubs and barrels are left in the sun to dry and fall apart. Dried fruits are not taken care of in season, and become wormy. Rags, string, and paper are thrown into the fire. Bits of meat, vegetables, bread, and cold puddings are thrown away when they might be warmed, steamed, and served as good as new. Milwaukee Globe
