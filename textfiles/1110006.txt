PRENTISSIANA 'Great men are not always wise.' Many mighty ones have essayed to give the biography and whereabouts of deity. 'I also will show mine opinion.' To the inquiry, ' Where shall I find God?' a fair damsel, brought up in Shakerdom, responded: ' 'Tis not for me to say where you shall find God. 1 find God in all the works of creation, in mountains and valleys, in oceans, rivers and rills, in birds, squirrels and wild flowers. I find God in my brother and sisters, but most important of all, I find God in my own soul, a law to direct my every action, word and thought.' ' Mine opinion is, the Shaker damsel was not so wide of the mark.'
