Editorial. OUR DUTY. We may not have so much to do with the opponents of religion, with those who delight in unrighteousness, and glory in their own shame, as we have with those who already name the name of Christ, as well as with those who have accepted a few degrees in morality and are moving along toward the place where man shall regard his fellow man. The good prophet found those at his own home who had ears but would not hear and who had eyes but would not see. Does not this experience accord wonderfully well with our own? The truth, however, should be proclaimed by every consecrated messenger of our Father and Motherï¿½God ; and in doing this duty we should not fail to put on the whole armor of a pure Christian, lest in our zeal for others we carelessly expose ourselves to the wiles of the adversary. There has been a time when the conversion of souls was made on heroic principles. They were felled to the ground ! They were dragooned to the baptizmal fouut at the poin t of the bayonet ! ! Men had forgotten that in an earlier age of the world it had been said in the name of the Lord, 'Come now and let us reason together. ' No better form for the good of humanity could be advocated at the present time. Strong and even harsh words often fall quite short of their mark and the intended shock spends itself on the air. There is a satisfaction in appealing to the better qualities of the mind, and for this the beatitudes are a beautiful example. 'Blessed are the peace-makers for for they shall be called the children of God. ' A relationship which we all covet and for which we devoutly pray. ' Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, ' as they have the promise of full fruition in this inestimable blessing. It can have but slight impression upon the true disciple to find that he has been denominated an ascetic, as unnatural or as being over religious. It has been the same story from age to age when referring to those who had forsaken the elements of the world and had accepted the cross of Christ. Let us 'stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.' Those who are able to walk in the glorious light of God's love are confident of the strength they possess. They entertain no fear of the frowns that may arise from personal prejudice, nor are they elated at the smiles of approbation. If to be a Christian is to be a direct follower of the Christ, then we have only to make a careful, analytical investigation and ascertain the points of resemblance and then the points of diversity. Christians of every hue and shade are TERMS. not backward in asserting the advantages of the plan of salvation which they have accepted. Their cross is the cross of their Christ, and their worship the worship of their God. All disputations on the subject, however, are indicative of dominant rights and are quite sure to end in confirmed self-righteousness, by both parties. A war of words is but a slight remove from a war of weapons. This seems to differ from the heavenly Spirit that so kindly recognized the baptized Jesus and which has said to us, 'Hear ye him,' and in turn Jesus has said as plainly and as kindly, 'Follow me,' 'where I am there ye may be also.' There may be those who take the liberty to assert that our Christian form of life is unnatural, but they must at the same moment admit that the gospel of Jesus teaches a corresponding form to his followers. Jesus and his disciples thoroughly forsook the order of the worldly life and then organized one based on communistic principles. Everything passed from the selfish into the more open and free system of brotherly love. Houses and lands were sold and the proceeds placed in the treasury of the little, consecrated church of Christ where it could be used for the universal good. It may seem to us to be a large sacrifice to part with our fraction of selfish interest, as it was, undoubtedly, to Peter when he left his boat and fishing net to follow the divine Teacher. His repining at a later dak would give us the impression that he considered his sacrifice of some magnitude, as he takes the liberty to remind Jesus of this fact. ' Behold we have forsaken all and followed thee, what shall we have therefore?' Jesus very kindly enumerates the many temporal and spiritual blessings that would be certain to follow in accordance with the promise. Peter may not have realized at this time the advantages to be derived from the united efforts of the Brethren. A longer experience, no doubt, afforded him all the information on this subject that could have been wished. And as with Peter so with all others who seek to become disciples of the Lord. Let them say, ' Behold we have forsaken all and followed thee,' and the time will not be very far distant before they will begin to realize the Lord's promise. They need not be afraid of the lo here and lo there as the manifestation of the spirit must be within one's own heart. What our duty should be in this case bears no mystical form and the wise admonition of the apostle may have a salutary effect upon our daily life. 'Ye are the children of light. Therefore let us not sleep, but let us who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breast plate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.'
