Shirley, Mass Feb. 1897. Good health prevails. Are enjoying a call from Elder George Wilcox, of Enfield, Conn., who notwithstanding recent losses by fire, is bright and cheerful as usual; reports all well at his home. Tho tempest tost and sadly shorn, Our barque in safety shall be borne, And we to peaceful rest, shall come Mid shouts of Glory! Glory! Home. John Whiteley.
