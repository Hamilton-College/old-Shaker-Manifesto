Manifestos were duly received... East Fletcher, Vermont. My Dear Friend, Hannah Wilson. The Manifestos were duly received. I was glad to see them and have read them all. I enjoy the pure Christian teachings they contain. I cannot see just as you do in some points yet I bid you God speed and truly feel that we are one in Christ. F. M. Blaisdell.
