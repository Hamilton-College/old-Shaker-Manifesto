THE SILVER LINING. There's never a day so sunny But a little cloud appears ; There's never a life so happy But has its time of tears; Yet the sun shines out the brighter Whenever the tempest clears. There's never a garden growing With roses in every plot; There's never a heart so hardened But it has one tender spot; We have only to prune the border To find the forget-me-not. There's never a sun that rises But we know 'twill set at night; The tints that gleam in the morning At evening are just as bright, And the hour that is the sweetest Is between the dark and light. There's never a dream so happy But the waking makes us sad; There's never a dream of sorrow But the waking makes us glad; We shall look some day with wonder At the troubles we have had. Selected.
