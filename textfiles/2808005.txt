A VISION. By Martha J. Anderson. In the seclusion of a lovely spot, Where bloomed the laurel and forget-me-not, Where the dark cypressall in shadows plumed Waved in deep sadness o'er the earth entombed; I saw there, carved in alabaster white A fountain, glistening in the morning light, Whose seeming spray with silvery whiteness shone, Whose crystal basin was a gleaming zone, Encircled with a wreath of ivy leaves, As perfect as the type of nature weaves, Design so delicate, so chaste and fair, Wrought by the Sculptor's hand with skill and care ! I gazed upon that peerless work of art, And pondered o'er its meaning in my heart. O living spring! upwelling pure and free, True emblem of man's immortality, No death can dry the fountain of the soul; No change can check the stream that on shall roll, No blight of time, or withering frost can sear, The wreath that twines the soul's perpetual year. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
