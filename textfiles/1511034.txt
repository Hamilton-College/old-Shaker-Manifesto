TRIUMPH Canterbury, N. H. 1. God's love is at the helm! We shall outride the storm; 2. And since we know the strength Of light and love in God, Whose life is in the light, Can fear no earthly harm. Shall we be found at length As those who doubt his word? The passage may be long Ere Truth o'er Error rise; Nay, truth our path shall fill And bring a cloudless sky; But they are always strong Who make no compromise. We'll trust and do his will Thus all our foes defy.
