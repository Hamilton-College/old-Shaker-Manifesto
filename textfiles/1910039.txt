The Bible Class. THE WATERS OF LIFE. Elsie B. York. I to! every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and Tie that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price Isa lv., 1 What a beautiful invitation is extended to every one who hungers and thirsts after righteousness. Not to a few favored ones is it given, but to every one that thirsteth. The waters that spring up into everlasting life cannot be purchased with the wealth of this world. Rich and poor, alike, may drink the living waters, and herein lies the difference between the bounteous love of God and the partial selfishness of man. Does some one discover a mineral spring of curative properties? It is no sooner known than it is converted into a fashionable resort, where those may gather who are able to pay for the privilege of drinking its medicinal waters. Thus, the blessings that should be free to all, are reserved for the few. How different the waters to which the inspired prophet so generously invites us! What a welcome sound to every spiritually thirsty soul, a::d how passing strange that so few find their way to the fountain? Why is it? Ah, there is a price to pay, n't of money, not of earthly treasures, but of something far dearer to the natural heart, the sacrifice of the carnal life. The same price for all. Yet how mean the price in comparison with the treasure gained. What sublimity in the words of Jesus to the woman at the well of Jacob. 'Whosoever shall drink of this water shall thirst again : but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst: but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.' John, iv., 13, 14. Then if we thirst for these waters will they not be given us? For we have the promise, 'Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find.' Matt., vii., 7. Canterbury, N. H.
