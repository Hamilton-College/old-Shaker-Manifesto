A GROWING EVIL Among the growing evils of our time is that of disobedience to parents. Not only is it a growing evil, but one that leads to untold misery and threatens to sap the foundation of the family, of the church, and of our nation, however strong it may be. Young America is becoming too independent and too smart to have any regard for the parental command ! At the age of five the self-sufficient youth may frequently be heard to say, ' I won't do it, ' in reply to the command of his loving mother. A little mismanagement on her part and a little resolution on his, and the son is his own master. This accomplished, he is ready to travel rapidly on the downward road to ruin. Swearing must be begun at once ; lying must follow as a matter of course, so as to conceal other wicked deeds ; smoking and chewing will make the boy more like a man in his own opinion. But this will not suffice to admit him in the society of ' the boys, ' and since he does as he pleases, drinking comes next. Now he can associate with ' anybody,' but his perverted passions and wicked desires drive him with accelerated speed to destruction of body and ruin of the soul. What a fearful calamity ! A young man ruined himself and perhaps irretrievably influenced many companions. What a wide and deep chasm between such a sinful life and a life of usefulness and devotion to the cause of truth ! Where did it all begin? Certainly not in the middle of the chain of wrong doing, but at the beginning of itï¿½disobedience to parents. No doubt some boys are ruined because the fault is entirely their own ; but in the majority of instances the parent is to blame for the first dangerous step taken by the child. A. R. Selected.
