MIND and MAN ALFRED E. DOYLE In looking o'er this world so wide— A seeming maze without a plan— We e'er should seek the brighter side, To help the mind and bless the man. Though Satan's hosts may oft engage us, Combined in passions war-ike clan ; And fiercer though the conflict rages, These nerve the mind to make the man. And in this life whate'er our chances, Our fellows' joys or ills to scan ; Remember 'tis oft the circumstances, That mould the mind and rule the man. So may we all at calls of need, Da what so e'er we find we can, By kindly looks or words or deed, To aid the mind—in blessing man. And in conclusion—let all reflect Since life is but a simple span, What e'er the lot—we should respect, The noble mind of an honest man. Watervliet, O.
