IN MEMORIAM. SISTER RUTH BROWN. Oliver C. Hampton. Once more in the annals of time A Sister has taken her flight, And risen to regions sublime, To glories eternally bright: Devoted for eighty long years To piety, puritj', peace, She shakes hands with Earth and its cares, And basks in a blessed release. The peace-maker's precious reward Our Sister most faithfully gained, And blessing and love from her Lord Throughout her long life she retained. Her patience and mercy and love All envy and slander forbade, And what greater gift from above; From Heaven's rich store can be had. Of industry, prudence and care No one could possess greater store, No self-sacrifice did she spare To aid Zion's cause evermore, O could we such zeal emulate Who still in mortality grope, How happy would be our estate, Huw bright the fruitions of Hope. Time presses with tireless wing Toward solemn Eternity's shore, But Death is deprived of his sting, And the grave is in victory no more. With those who in good works and faith, And self-abnegation will walk, And shun every self-seeking path, And keep with the good Shepherd's flock. O Brethren and Sisters attend To comfort each other prepare, As steadily friend after friend In sorrow we're fated to spare. Be tender of those who have borne The burden and heat of the day, Their kindness and zeal to return, And brighten their fugitive stay. We'll harvest the treasures of time Whatever may stand us instead, When ready to soar to a holier clime And sealed with the quick and the dead. Improve in all virtue and love, In charity always abound, Professions by practice to prove, As the wheels of existence go round. O then shall the dayspring appear, The Heralds descend from on High, The needy in Zion to cheer And brighten our spiritual sky. O Angels of Heaven draw near Ye Heavenly Harvesters come, Our Spirits for Heaven prepare, And lead us triumphantly Home. Union Village, Ohio.
