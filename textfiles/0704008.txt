Every Child of God Saved! We are always glad to add admiration to any churchal declaration; and we find so little to object to in the following, from the Christian LeaderÂ¦, (universalist,) we copy, asking how many genuine universalists there are ? Every child of God being herein provided for, what of the ' lost sheep,' according to the universalist creed? ' 'A man's mere belief that God will finally save all souls, does not, in itself, make him a universalist. His life will give some evidence of his creed. He will be mei'ciful and loving. Humanity will shine in his countenance, and wax eloquent in his speech. His sympathies will be enlisted in behalf of every true charity and reform. He will not be ashamed to confess his faith before men. He will be proud and glad to declare ' I am a believer in the ultimate salvation of every child of God.''
