Evidences of Christ's Second Appearing. No. 1. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. The changes which have come over the world within the last one hundred years makes it evident that some great event has taken place, or is about to take place ; but what that event is remains to be proved by the event itself, or by the testimony of living witnesses. There was no stronger evidence of Christ's first appearing than the testimony of his own disciples, who were personally acquainted with him, and were daily his companions, and were ear and eye witnesses of the purity of his life, and the miracles he wrought, and especially, the four evangelists, viz., Matthew Mark, Luke and John, and these were rejected at first, but now have gained almost universal credence throughout Christendom, which is but little better than Christian in name, but Pagan in practice, hence the necessity of Christ's Second Appearing not in a man, but in a woman. Let the earth rejoice! In 1827, a book was published at Albany, N. Y., of 178 pages, containing testimonies of the witnesses of Christ's Second Appearing, twenty one Brethren and ten Sisters, in all thirty one, who were men and women of truth and veracity, whose moral characters were above reproach; whose words were 'fitly spoken,' like 'apples of gold in pictures of silver.' We know ' that no testimony is of any force while the testator liveth.' Why? Because his personal presence or verbal testimony supersedes the necessity of anything written, until after his death, aad then his written testimony becomes a force. These witnesses all died, in positive knowledge of Christ's Second Appearing. Let us examine their testimonies already published in the August, October and November numbers of the Manifesto, 1885. 'We speak, that � we do know, and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness. ' John, III., 11. 'And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yields her fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. ' Rev. xxii., 1, 2. This is figurative language. Let us apply it as we go along for we are living in the days of the fulfillment of this prophecy. And the world know it not. But we knoAv whereof we affirm. What were the leaves of the tree of life? Evidently, they were the testimonies of the witnesses of the gospel of Christ's first and second appearing. And if they were true at the time these events took place, at different periods of the world, they are true now, and will forever remain true, and time and evolution can never altsr facts nor change the truth of God into a lie. What were the twelve manner of fruits that were yielded every month ? Evidently, they are the different articles written by Believers of Christ's second appearing, so different, that no two of them are alike-�more than twelve manner of fruits, which makes a rich and beautiful variety of fruits of the tree of life, which yields her fruit every month, because they are published in a monthly journal, devoted to prove the affirmative side of Christ's second appearing, by tangible evidences. ' What advantage then, hath Believers over the world r'� Why ! �' much every way ! chiefly, because unto us are committed the oracles. ' What oracles ? The oracles of Christ's second appearing which all true Believers hold sacred, and which are now being published to the world in a reliable form. In all our civil courts of law, where justice is expected to be done, witnesses are examined on both sides of the question at issue, before a just verdict can be rendered. And if this be so, in earthly and worldly institutions, how much more important it is, that things of a heavenly, and of an eternal duration should have a candid and an impartial investigation. When this is done to the satisfaction of an enlightened public opinion, (not malicious persecutors,) on which side of the great scales of God's justice, truth, and love, will the greatest amount of evidence fall ? Let the world itself, be the jury, let them bring in their verdict; and Avhat will that verdict be? Will it not be in favor of Christ's second appearing, in a woman, a representative of the attribute of an eternal 'Mother' in the God-head. See, Rom. i., 20. Born in Manchester in England, in 1736, received the revelation of Christ, 1770, came over to America in 1774,- -proclaimed her mission to the world 1780 and from that time to the day of her death, about four years she did not cease her labors, day nor night to proclaim Christ's second appearing wherever she went, in all the country towns and other places, through which she passed, in going to New England. Being saved from sin herself, she had the power of salvation and ministered that power. [See testimony of her witnesses on this subject, published in The Manifesto.] Having finished her work in New England and other places, she returned to her home at Watervliet, near Albany, N. Y. where she departed this life, on the 8th. of Sept. 1784, in the 40th year of her age. I cannot feel to close this article, although long enough for our journal, without quoting as further evidence, a Hymn, said to be sung by Mother Ann, before she left England, when led down into a valley, to be stoned to death, by her persecutors. '' Touch not mine anointed nor do my chosen harm ; I the Lord Jehovah will shield them with my arm. I am a God&gt;f mercy, of justice and truth; [earth; My work of love and power shall yet o'er spread the I dwell not in a mansion that's far far away; Nor do I inhabit a tenement of clay; Beyond the starry regions I do not fix my throne; But in my church on earth I am in spirit known.' Here is evidence sufficient to convince the most profound skeptics whose minds are not prejudiced against the Lord's Anointed. The wicked failed in their designs, to take her life ; her work was not done. She had a work to do in America, which was subsequently accomplished by the over-ruling providence of God, and the protection of his holy angels. She possessing her soul in patience- while her enemies ' were like the troubled sea, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.' 'There is no peace to the wicked, saith my God. ' North Union. Ohio.
