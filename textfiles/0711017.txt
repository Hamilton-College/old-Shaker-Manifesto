EDITORIAL NOTES WAR, NOT CHRISTIAN, BUT BARBAROUS We ought to learn an important lesson by the present European war; and this: That war is all brutal, the antipode of Christianity. On which side is the greater brutality manifested? We cannot decide. Both are as brutal as they well can be. Standing aloof from this quarrel, so-called Christian America should view with a holy horror any attachment of the name of Christian to any war whatever. We think it is far more honorable to be a heathen Mohammedan in this fight, than to fight worse than a Turkâ€”be a greater brute, while wearing a very, very peaceable name ! Wars, of households or of nations, are without the pale of Christianity ; and any nation keeping a standing army, or a national guard of militia, has not even the smell of Christianity about it; but has much of the odors of the hells ! Jesus was Prince of Peace ; all wars are of the devil.
