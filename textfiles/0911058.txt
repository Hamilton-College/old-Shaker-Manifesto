Remedy for Warts Warts are very troublesome and disfiguring. The following is a perfect cure, even of the largest, without leaving any scar. It is a Frenchman's prescription, and has been tested by the writer: Take a small piece of raw beef, steep it all night in vinegar, cut as much from it as will cover the wart, and tie on it, if the excrescence is on the forehead, fasten it on with strips of sticking plaster. It may be removed in the day and put on every night in one fortnight the wart will die and peel off. The same prescription will cure corn.
