TURNER PUBLIC LIBRARY Randolph Mass. Nov., 1885. Editor of the Manifesto, Dear Sir :—Permit me to officially recognize your favor, and thank you heartily for your kindness in placing at our disposal your very neat and estimable publication, 'The Manifesto.' Its pages are bright with good words and Christian cheer. The MANIFESTO—so characteristic of the Shaker world and ways—is ever welcome, always read and carefully preserved. Yours very truly Charles C. Farnham, Librarian
