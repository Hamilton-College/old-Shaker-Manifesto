Canterbury, N. H. Jan. 16 1890. Dear Editor :�It is our opinion that 'Notes about Home,' may add much that is profitable and pleasant to the pages of the Manifesto and thus fondly hope they are 'to be continued.' As often as we read the local names even, with their accompanying reports, we are reminded of a very beautiful custom practiced by the Alpine Shepherds on their native summits. It is stated that they send friendly greetings daily from one Alpine home to another, both at sunrise and sundown, either by the voice or through the Alpine horn, which seems to be their only available means of communication. The question naturally arises: Should we not send mutual greetings of good-will and gospel fellowship from one Society to another as from so many moral heights, as often as opportunity offers? We might substitute the Manifesto for the Alpine horn perchance. At present date, Canterbury thus reports herself: Health with the majority, good. Infirmary vacated�undergoing limited repairs�every member actively useful �no strikes�no feuds�crops harvested in season, now being enjoyed�buildings ready for Winter in good season�Winter, gone West. Latest arrival�'January 1890;' which comes to us mantled, (not vith snow,) but with good resolutions, from whence new energies are being evolved, and new spiritual gains sought, judging from what we realized in our New Year's morning service, after listening to various speakers. The leading sentiment to be cherished was to rule out of memory, the worthless by-gones of the past, with the old 'frog-in-the-well' method of progress, spiritually considered, and substitute therefor, a cheerful, active Christianity, the sincerity of which, no one can doubt. Let us note a very pleasant item from Harvard. On Christmas day, Elder Elijah was able to be with his people for an hour or more. Did not the visit of the good Brethren act as a healing balm? God bless the Union I Many of our friends who have visited Canterbury may recall a visit to the Worsted Church, so-called from the fact that the texts, mottoes and flowers upon its walls were wrought out of worsted. Said Church needing repairs, a literary entertainment was held and a little friendly aid asked from Shaker friends. Accordingly we responded with musical exercises and readings, such as are usually given in our family School. Good men and women as neighbors are a blessing which we can well appreciate. On Jan. 9th inst., Funeral Services were observed in memory of our Mother in IsraelSister Mary Whitcher, age 74 years. Our long-loved, noble Sister; noble we say, because unselfish in every phase of life. The season was a very impressive one, as �'Where the heart feels most, the lips move least.' Appropriate pieces were sung, and affectionate tributes written for the occasion were read, as in her presence, for no one could think of her, as absent. In the peculiar inspiration of the hour, we were comforted with the assurance that our mother, our Christian comforter, our nurse for the afflicted or feeble, was with us in spirit and in truth as of yore. We view her as a fair representative woman of the 'Friend who never fails.' May we, her survivors be so duly impressed by her life and example, that we may 'go and do likewise,' is our prayer.
