Shakers, N. Y. North Family. Feb. 1896. When the anouncement came to us that our Manifesto would discontinue its publication for the present, we were depressed at the visible lowering of the banner that had so long waved, upholding the testimony of the higher life. But when the report came that it would continue its monthly mission, the reaction was great, and we felt like shouting Glory! long live The Manifesto. The feeling here at the North family is unanimous for its prosperity and continuance. Our winter to present date lias been an average winter. Not as much snow as the preceeding one, but enough to make fair sledding, which has been improved in hauling logs and fire wood. We are looking anxiously to the opening of the season in which begins active operations on the garden and farm and earnestly hope that the tillers of the soil may have a fruitful year and enjoy a bountiful harvest. From your Brother who continues to work for the success of the cause. Hamilton DeGraiv.
