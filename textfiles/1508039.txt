THE FOOL AND THE RIVER 'I have at last resolved to break off my evil habits, ' said a friend whom I had often advised to change his manner of life but in vain. ' And when, ' replied I, 'do you intend to carry into effect this determination?' ' Next week I shall certainly do so, ' said he. ' But why not to-day; why not do so this very hour? Why incur the risk of failure by delay ?'' ' Oh ! I cannot all at once break the links of so strong a chain; I must have a good opportunityï¿½a reasonable excuse for such a step; some opportunity will doubtless arise in a few days, and then be assured, I shall avail myself of it. ' As we walked and conversed thus, we arrived at a river, on the bank of which sat a man with his eyes intently fixed upon the water as it rolled along. My friend was anxious to know the reason of this, and he asked the man the reason why he looked so attentively at the river. 'I wish, ' replied he, ' to pass to the other side of the stream; and as there is no bridge or boat, I am waiting until the water ceases to flow, and the bed of the river becomes dried up. ' Turning to my companion, I said, ' My friend, in this foolish man you see a picture of yourself. You lose in forming fine intentions the most precious of your days, and in waiting for some future time, at which if you arrive, your task will probably be still more difficult than it is now; you wish to pass over the stream; cast yourself in at once, and swim vigorously for the opposite shore. To wait is folly. The river flows on, and will flow on forever. ' -The Catholic.
