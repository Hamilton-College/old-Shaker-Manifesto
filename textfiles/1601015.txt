TALE-BEARER The words that can never be recalled. A penitent to a holy father went; Confession of her sins was her intent, And so her misdemeanors, great and small, She faithfully rehearsed them all; And chief in her catalogue of sin, She owned that she a tale-bearer had heen And borne a bit of scandal up and down To all the long-tongued gossips in the town. The holy father for her other sins, Granted the absolution asked of him; But while for all the rest he pardon gave, He told her this offence was very grave, And that to do lit penance she must go Out by the wayside, where the thistles grow, And gathering the largest, ripest one, Scatter its seeds, and that when this was done, She must come back again another day To tell him; his commands she must obey.---Feeling right glad she had escaped feo well, She went next day but one, the priest to tell; The priest sat still, and heard her story through, Then said, there's something still for you to do; Those little thistle seeds which you have sown, I bid you to re-gather every one. The woman said, ' But father, it would be in vain To try to gather up these seeds again; The winds have scattered them both far and wide; O'er the meadowed vale and mountain side, ' The father answered; ' May I hope from this, The lesson I have taught you will not miss ? You cannot gather back the scattered seeds, Which far and wide will grow to noxious weeds, Nor can the mischief once by scandal sown, By any penance be again undone. ' Selected
