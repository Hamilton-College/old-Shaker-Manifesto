A PARAPHRASE ON TAKING OFFENCE. Written in the sixteenth century. It is often much less the particular instance which is obnoxious to us than the proof it carries with it of the general tenor and disposition of the mind from which it sprang. And true as this is in other lives it is peculiarly true in the matter of one's readiness to take offence. There is perhaps nothing that shows the true measure of a person's character more than his sensitiveness to supposed slights. By this he betrays the qualities of his mind and heart, and his measure of absorption in himself. That is: the more he is self-absorbed, the more he is filled with ideas of his own importance, wisdom and worth, the more his vision is narrowed by the contracted horizon of self, the more apt he will be to take offence, to interpret that which is said and done by those about him, as having a direct reference to himself, especially if it be of an unpleasant nature. And on the other hand, the more comprehensive is a man's mind, the more he is occupied with the subjects that expand and increase, as the gaze sweeps the grand circle of life, within which, his own person is but a point in space the less is the possibility of his being easily effronted. Self presents too small a surface to be hit by every random dart. It is too unimportant a subject to demand serious attention even when it happens to be hit. There are too many more important things to be thought of by others, to admit of your often being their center of interest or an object of comment. It is not only charity therefore, but wisdom also, to think no evil and to be not easily provoked. ï¿½Selected. Anonymous.
