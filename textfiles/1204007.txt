TEACH ME TO TRUST ANNIE STEPHENS Time's golden sands are flowing One by one, Our life its course below Will soon have run. Then whither wilt thou' go O soul divine? Where are the realms of day In which thou'lt shine? What subtle power controls Thy destiny? Why wrap thy future life In mystery? Enough to know is given, A voice replies, Prepare thy soul for heaven The spirit cries! Then trusting, I will wait, And hopeful be, For I know the angel's love Rests over me. And though my path may lead Up mountains steep, The hand that guards all life, Will guide my feet. And I shall learn through faith, That hand is just; O blessed light of heaven, Teach me to trust!
