MY FATHER. Prudie A. Stickney. On the stilly air of nightfall, Floats music sweet, From the gleaming sunset land With joy replete. And amid the anthems ringing One voice I greet: H: is calling, and I hasten With willing feet. For I know the time is hearing, I soon shall fad.'; I shall go to meet my father Through shine and shade. Just beyond, the sunset gate-way Is left ajar; And amid those gleaming portal!* Sin cannot mar. In that land there is no darkness But perfect day; There I long to join my loved ones, And live alway. Ope the pearly gate still wider Ye shining One; I am weary, and would enter When day is done. Thou hast been my stay, my comfort, My guide and friend ; And I know that thou wilt greet me, When life shall end. Thou wilt light me through the valley Of doubts and fears ; Thou wilt keep my heart from sorrows My eyes from tears. How I miss thy smile of gladness When all is well; And thy words so true and tender None can excel. How I miss thy words of wisdom And counsel sweet, For I always found beside thee A safe retreat. In thy deep and true affection My soul confides; Through the storm as in the sunshine Thy love abides. Soon I'll leave this vale of sorrow And go to thee, O'er the waters deep and rolling Father, lead me. Just above the starry brightness Lights the dark way; Just beyond, there is a dawningï¿½ Eternal day. West Gloucester, Me.
