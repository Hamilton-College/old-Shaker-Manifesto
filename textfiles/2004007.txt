THE REWARD OF A DEDICATED LIFE. To Sister, Rhoda R. Hollister. Cecelia De Vere. Is not the hour of pain the hour of balm? When love's sweet solace drops upon the soul, When conies the unction of sustaining calm, Tho' tidal waves of sorrow swell and roll. The drift-wood and the sea-weed cast aside, The pearls thy spirit won from life's great deep Will gleam in beauty that shall e'er abide. For they are treasures which thy soul can keep. Proud was thy spirit when it rose and smiled, Intent to reach its own ambitious height; The voice Maternal, bade thee be a child; Was not the Heavenly Mother's mandate right? Thy heart of faith hath e'er proclaimed, 'It was;' Thro' cross and trial, steady was thy aim, Thy soul's devotion centered to Her Cause, And to Her love confidingly laid claim. Her peorle were thy kindred, in their hearts Thy home of homes was found and made secure, The Blocking enemy sent poisoned darts, But thou wert shielded by an armor pure. Not through the lenses of to-day we view The worth which we have counted year by year, Not in the tearful time when flowers we strew, Do we first learn to prize and hold thee dear. Could gold of Ophir buy thy loving toil Or prompt the hand so ready to bestow'? Could station give the balsam and the oil That thro' the soul's affections had their flow? Half o'er a century the field extends Whereon broadcast thy glorious deeds were wrought, Where sainted, hallowed souls became thy friends, And blest thee with the love thy spirit sought. Then what to thee was all the world's false show? Its aspirations were the tempest's breath; When once thy feet had found the valley low The road to glory was the path to death. Thy faith had tests severe, when kith and kin And comrades loved and cherished in the way Turned from the fold to devious wiles of sin, Thy choice was heavenward, where Oh where are they? Immortal life is thine ; thy soul is strong To bear the changes of the transient state; Thou hast a trust, a triumph and a song, With which to enter at the Morning Gate. The flowers of earth to thee were more than fair, They were the gifts of God so freely given In answer to the world's sick, yearning prayer, When mortals craved some token�boon from heaven. There in that land where all the bloom is sweet, Beyond the loveliness of which we dreamed, Shall Zion's faithful ones united meet. And by her laws refining be redeemed. The opaque pebble-crust from souls removed, The diamonds polished by the life divine, Shall blend their lustre with the hosts beloved� God's living jewels�evermore to shine. Such is the end of faith to us revealed, However much to do or long to wait; Through labor are the promises unsealed That bear the glory of the holy state. There is one baptism, above, below, One way, divided by a mountain cloud, We climb the steep up which thy feet must go, While only silvery screening mists enshroud. But, we shall miss thee from external sight, Our outward senses oft will feel a void, Yet from earth's shadow to eternal light The bond of union cannot be destroyed. We give thee thanks for the unmeasured good Which in thy consecration had its root; We give thee blessing, that will ever brood Upon a life that bore unselfish fruit. The ministrations coming from the gift Bring fortitude and courage to us all; Dear angel-hands the burdens help to lift, And angels' soothing accents gently fall. These spirit friends that now our numbers swell, Are from our Zion home that is above; We dare not emphasize the word, Farewell, But we have clothed and crowned thee with our love. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
