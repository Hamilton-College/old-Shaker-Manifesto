Enfield, N. H. We have had some cold weather since the advent of March, and just now it looks as if 'Winter might linger in the lap of Spring,' yet there is no 'accounting' for weather in these days of change, any more than there is for 'tastes,' which trite saying, we know to be a fact. Parties from abroad, have been shipping ice from Lake Mascoma north of our village, yet the water will close over the space, and roll as majestically as ever, just as the world will continue to move when the atoms of humanity now forming its motive power have ceased their striving for the things of this world, leaving'only their influence, for good or ill, as a legacy. Our Society have tapped about 3,*775 maple trees, and now it remains to be seen how kind the fates will be in giving us the flow of sap necessary for the sugar making. Next month we may give you some estimate of our success or failure in this line. We are pleased that so able a writer as the author of the lines entitled 'Encouragement' in Mar. Manifesto, has unearthed her God-given talent, so greatly needed and appreciated. We have long wished it might be revived, and welcome this angel messenger as a foretaste of good gifts yet to come. We hope so. E. B.
