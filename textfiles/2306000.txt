SIX HOURS IN HEAVEN. A journey to the Land of Canaan. Benjamin Gates. Having been many times kindly invited to visit the little band of Canaanites, I determined to set aside the duties that had heretofore prevented me and go to them. April 2nd, 1893, was selected as being the best time to make said visit; accordingly at nine o'clock on Sabbath morning I left Mt. Lebanon Church Office for that purpose. After a short drive of about three miles I arrived at the home of our dear friends, feeling quite weary and sore from the jolting over rough roads, that were filled in many places with drifts of snow and cakes of ice. As I approached their dwelling I heard beautiful singing. The family had just commenced their Sabbath morning meeting, and the whole house and door-yard sounded and resounded with the strains of their heavenly songs such as I have seldom or never heard before. After a short rest in the reception room, Br. George Clark conducted me into the meeting room. There my eyes beheld thirty-four angels in mortal formï¿½lovely consecrated souls who had congregated for the purpose of worshiping God, also an innumerable company of angel visitors from the immortal laud. Br. Jonathan Wood, Edward Fowler, Daniel Sizer and many others were recognized by the spiritual visionists. During the meeting heaven's best gifts descended freely, and each member had something to offer to add to the edification and blessing of all assembled. An intermission followed in which we enjoyed an abundant and wholesome repast, together with a short introduction to each Sister and Brother. Again we gathered in the Chapel for a social visit. One hour and a half was most agreeably spent in listening to the reading of original articles, hearing the lovely songs of Zion and in pleasant conversation. We were delighted with the children's recitations which were not only interesting but very instructive. Even the smallest children had committed to memory an amusing anecdote or an item of history all calculated to* add cheer and pleasantry to each moment. I realized what it was to sit in heavenly places and to feel the joy of heaven. What more could any soul desire ? 180 THE MANIFESTO. It was with reluctanc? thtit I parted with those dear Brethren and Sisters : important duties called me in another direction and I was compelli d to obey, but often, yea often I have remembered that heavenly meeting. It was indeed one of the loveliest and greenest spots upon which I have ever rested in all my journey through life. - Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
