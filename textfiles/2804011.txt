Narcoossee, Fla. March, 1898. Among the things which are of special value to the Southern states may be mentioned the Japan persimmon, of which we have several trees that will come into bearing this year. When ripe the fruit is of a scarlet red color and extremely luscious. It can be depended on as an every year crop, fully equal in bearing to any of our Northern apple trees. In the way of diversity we think the fig comes next in value. This is a little more sensitive to the change of weather when young, but when fully matured it will stand the temperature below freezing. We have quite a number growing on our place. With these we can number six grape fruit, twelve orange, six pear, six apricot, with three hundred peach trees. This with two thousand pine-apple plants sums up the number of fruit-growing trees on our place. Sweet potatoes all through the South have become the poor man's as well as the rich man's luxury, while Irish potatoes are as yet somewhat of a rarity and but very little grown on account of the small yield to the acre. We have on our place ninety-two head of cattle both old and young stock of our own. One hundred and ninety-six head of our neighbors, which we take to pasture. For over a week past we have enjoyed the presence of the Lebanon Ministry accompanied by Sister Emma J. Neal; also Brother Francis Pennybaker, of Pleasant Hill, Ky. They have been like angel visits to us. Tho far away our friends still remember us, and we them. Andrew Barrett.
