COMMUNE WITH NATURE Alone within the forest. Fair nature's balmy bowers, I hold commune with angels, Expanding hidden powers. Through birds and beauteous blossoms, Am lifted far above, To the elysian cities Of God's eternal love. I walk his golden temples And glorious gardens fair, Drink in at living fountains, And eat of fruitage rare. I list the holy anthems Of souls redeemed from sin, The radiant band of heroes, Who fought, the race to win. I see their whitened raiment, The diadem and crown, And in their foreheads written, True victors of renown. Who Jesus' cross have carried, For love of truth and right, And now with him are seated In mansions of delight. And then a precious healing Calms every inner strife, And all my heart is strengthened To cope again with life. Then soft and gentle whispers Come stealing on the air, And back my soul is bidden To time, and toil, and care. I take the heavy burden And lay it next my heart, With pledges unto heaven To act the Christian's part. With faith in God's rich promise, That in his own good time, He'll crown me with these glories In fairer worlds sublime. Julia Johnson, W. Pittsfield, Mass.
