THE CHURCH MILITANT IN AFRICA. The good English people who have contributed to the cause of the African missions may be made somewhat uneasy when they learn of the methods to which the missionaries resort to maintain their foothold and push tin ir propaganda, but it appears to have come to be a question of life or death with the mission stations, and few persons would go so far, probably, as to blame them for employing carnal weapons to defend their helpless charges against their slave-hunting adversaries. It does seem a little strange, at first, to read that the missionaries at Lake Tanganyika have built a fort and surrounded it with thorn-bushes and barbed wire, and scattered broken bottles on the ground to make things interesting for hostile savages. That certainly was not one of the objects specified when the funds were raised to send the missionaries to the Dark Continent. But it should be remembered that the missionaries have no one to protect them. England and Germany are too busy just at present trying to outdo each other in trade and politics to give much attention to such impracticable persons. The indignation of the missionaries at finding that the Arab slavecatchers are armed with guns of English manufacture is safely pardonable. This English practice of putting weapons into the hands of the enemy is somewhat akin to the habit our frontier traders had some years ago of furnishing Indian warriors with the latest things out in the way of repeating rities,�these rifles frequently figuring thereafter in raids and skirmishes to the discomfiture of the soldiers of the Federal army.� Boston Daily Journal.
