TRUST Whatever we may store up, we should learn this one lesson—that of trust. If we commit ourselves to the heavenly Father, and then follow His leading all through life, knowing that we are safe in the arms of the Lord so that we can bid good-by to every anxiety, then we shall find this old saying come true, 'As thy days, so shall thy strength be.' If you are in trouble, remember the day is over at sundown, and remember the promise, 'As thy day is, so shall thy strength be.' God will not give you grace for to-morrow until it comes. He will take care of you today, and you will know the sweetness of that hymn by Cardinal Newman : 'Lead kindly light, amid the encircling gloom, Lead thou me on; The night is dark, and I am far from home, Lead thou me on; Keep thou my feet, I do not ask to see The distant scene—one step enough for me. '1 was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou Should'st lead me on; I loved to choose and see my path, but now Lead thou me on. I loved the garish day, and spite of fears, Pride ruled my will; remember not past years. 'So long thy power hath blessed me—sure it still Will lead me on, O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till The night is gone, And with the morn, those angel faces smile Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.' The Lord add His blessing to the preaching of His Word. Selccted
