A New Saint Among the deceased men and women, good, bad and indifferent, canonized by the present ' venerable prisoner ' of the Vatican, and set forth for the prayers of the faithful as intercessors with God, is Peter Arbaes. Being Inquisitor General of the Spanish Inquisi- tion, he won golden opinions by the zeal, selfdenial and faithfulness with which he burned heretical men, women and babies. The Ninth Pius seems as unlucky in his saints as in his dogmas. But tastes always have differed, and Peter Arbaes is not the first red-handed wretch who has been canonized. ''In the prosecution of the examinations,'we are told in the Acta Sanctorum, 'no groans nor cries could move him; in the execution of the dreadful sentence he was turned aside neither by prayers nor tears.' It was in the age when Columbus was preparing to reveal anew world, and when knowledge was already teaching humanity to kings and nobles, that our modern saint was sentencing women and feeble children to the flames, and was filling happy households with intolerable dread ; was searching for his victims with barbarous assiduity, and stood among his fellow-citizens dripping with gore. Hated no doubt like Torquemada, who liever went unarmed —feared with more than mortal dread —the Chief Inquisitor pursued his career of bloodshed unchecked for several years, and deserved the highest approval of his ruthless church. At last came his martyrdom, or rather the inadequate punishment for his enormous crimes. He was assassinated in the church of Saragossa by two young men, the father of one of whom had been imprisoned, and the sister of the other burned at the stake. 'Such is a Roman Catholic saint and martyr! The murderer of the innocent is held up to his clergy by Pius IX as an example worthy of imitation, and the most horrible form of blind fanaticism receives the sanction of the infallible Pope.' C. I.
