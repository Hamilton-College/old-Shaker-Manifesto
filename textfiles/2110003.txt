LORD, INCREASE MY FAITH. Annie R. Stephens. Lord, increase my faith, That its power may be A light to shine 'mid darkness, A guiding star to me. Though ebon clouds hang o'er me, All lesser lights grow pale, But faith's unfailing glory No storm-clouds can assail. Lord, increase my faith; My heavenly guide 'twill be, To lead o'er trackless watersï¿½ Life's foaming, wave-tossed sea. Oh! what am I without it? A wreck upon the strand: My faith, my sure deliverer, Guides with unfaltering hand. Lord, increase my faith; May it gleam a beacon ray; Pierce through the midnight shadows And cheer life's stormy way. When fierce the tempest rages, And high the billows roll, This fadeless light from heaven Reveals the shining goal. Lord, increase my faith; Its power is strong to save, It fills my heart with courage To walk upon the wave. My star, my guide, my comfort, I'll follow evermore; Through it I'll brave all danger And reach the sunlit shore. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
