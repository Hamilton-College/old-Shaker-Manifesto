ZION'S SOUL COMMUNION. Cecelia De Vere. If I may kneel beside the waves of prayer, And kiss the shore; In spirit, kneel, for Mother's gift is there,� I ask no more. That gift hath all my life shall ever need, 'For Mother's love Will downward to the Jordan waters lead, Where broods the Dove. What if the waves roll high, and I must swim, I will not quiver. The land beyond, so bright, no storms can dim, I'll brave that Biver. Prayer and repentance still are crested waves That hold the light. Their union buoys the soul, inspires and saves; They know not night. 0 kindix-d, blessed, yearning, toiling souls, My heart bows low. 1 feel the mighty river as it rolls In holy flow. Here on its banks, the 'tree of Life' is found. Its fruits we share. Across its depths, transparent and profound, 'Tis yet more fair. The call to waverers is, 'Be not sad, Nor pause to doubt; But seek the stream that makes the city glad. Woe is without.' Is there one child that Mother's love would win, That will not hear? Is there one heait that would decide to sin Through lust or fear? The voice of many waters answers,�Nay! Each guileless one, Turning in simple grace to learn to pray,� 'Thy will be done,' Shall, through the crystal current, see the world� Its awful state, When Eden's enemy in roses curled, For prey doth wait. Then shall sweet lessons on the spirit crowd, By faith illumed. Then it shall cry, 'If I am longer proud, Oh! I am doomed! ' 'Dear gospel kindred, now I know } our worth, Help me to win The life transcendant, far away from earth� I hate all sin.' So ran the meditation of the hour, When saints unite To seek the increase of the spirit power, And error's flight. To pray for every heart, in every need, From age to youth. And that the earth make ready for the seed Of virgin truth. O when I felt the perfume rising up From each pure shrine, There was a joy within my spirit's cup, Which seemed like wine. That I might bring frankincense and sweet myrrh With Mother's few. And make the sacrifice sought out by her, Was blessing true. To have with them a humble place and name From sin removed, Was more than gorgeous gifts of wealth and fame, Such gladness proved. Dear ancients of the city, lingering pray Through twilight time, Help Zion to accept the seven-fold day Of light sublime. To be established in the truth revealed That strikes earth dumb.
