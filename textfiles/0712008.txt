CHRISTIAN LIGHT MARIA WITHAM There is a light which beams from heaven, On life's short, evil day; It cheers the pathway of the just, And guides us on our way. How it illuminates the soul With joy, and peace, and love! Disperses every glooin3r doubt, Dire3ts our thoughts above! And who enjoys this glorious boon Which shineth from on high? The christia:i soldier of the cross, Who does not fear to die.
