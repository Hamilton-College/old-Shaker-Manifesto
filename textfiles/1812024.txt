We learn, through The Christian Union, that a case has just been decided by the Supreme Court of Kansas bearing on the extent of the rights of church members. The suit was brought by Jacob T. Hackney, of Winfield, against the trustees of the Christian Church of that city, to enjoin them from playing an organ in the church during the service. It was claimed on behalf of Mr. Hackney that at the time the church organization was perfected there was no organ or other instrument of music permitted to be used by the congregation in its worship, and that this was never permitted until after an organ had been forced into the church ; that he believes that the introduction and use of the organ in the worship of the congregation is contrary to the Word of God, and sinful, and that he and about forty others of the congregation have always been conscientiously opposed to the introduction of an organ in their worship; that in February, 1888, J. M. Vawter was employed by the congregation as a preacher, and that at the very first opening of divine service held by him an organ was swung into position, an organist took her place, and the exercises were opened by instrumental music: this against the wishes and protests of Hackney and other members of the congregation. The opinion was written by Justice Johnson, who holds that the church cannot legally keep an organ.
