Oh, Enfield! â€”The New York Sun is responsible for the statement that the Shakers of Enfield, Conn., are losing some of their primitive simplicity. It says: 'Their new buildings, equipped with almost every convenience, show that one by one the luxuries of social life are getting a foothold. Books, newspapers, instruments of music, carpets, cushioned chairs, and steam for heating, washing and cooking are in their habitations.' To which the courteous Am. Socialist make rejoinder: 'Well, why shouldn't the saints enjoy the good things of this life as well as the sinners ? Can that luminary which ' shines for all' tell us.'
