'Generation of Vipers.' To the Editor of ' The Shaker :'â€”I observe in the March issue of ' The Shaker ' an adimadversion upon the use of the above words in the article in the same number upon ' Eternal Damnation,' in which article Jesus is represented to make use of the unchristian expression in question. As the argument of that article greatly depends upon the fact that Jesus sometimes spoke under the influence of a spirit inferior to that which is now looked upon as so peculiarly his own, even after he had received the first ministration of the Christ Spirit, that article would be grossly presumptuous unless Jesus did use those words. It is not, however, a personal question, but one of historic truth in which are involved some of the gravest spiritual issues. I there fore, in all meekness, beg to place before you the fact that the expression, as used by Jesus, will be found in Matthew xii, 34, in accordance with the reference in the early part of the article. Again, in Matthew xxiii, 33, Jesus said, ' Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?' Thomas I. Stroud
