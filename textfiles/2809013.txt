Narcoossee, Fla. August, 1898. Notwithstanding the cold weather, the dry weather and the wet weather there is plenty of life left in the old land of Florida. From nearly all sections of the state comes the cheering news that the orange crop will be good. There was a large summer bloom this year and the late crop will be quite large. Our work through the month of .July has been long and arduous. It consisted of fencing a five hundred acre lot on the south side of our lake, to be rented as pasture. The rounding up of our cattle called for a week of hard labor on horseback. The remainder of the month between showers has been filled by planting our crop of sweet potatoes, which is done by resetting the vines or tops which are cut from 12 to 14 inches long. Our cattle, which have been free to roam over our vast acreage, have stood the drouth far better than we expected. The fires that were constant and almost over every part of our plantation destroyed large amounts of feed and this caused the cattle to narrow down on the feeding grounds. Even the muck, the best part of the farming land, took fire and in some places burned for months^ causing quite a sensation among the farmers as to their pasturage, but since the winter rains have commenced and the fires have gone, the farmers begin to have a little hope that the hard times are past, and the indications of returning prosperity are here. It is true, the people here have but little money, but they are at work, and the crops of peas, potatoes, hay and velvet beans are exceedingly large. Added to these the sale of cattle which is now opened with Cuba, looks to be the salvation of the country, which is a thing now hoped for. 'As thrashing separates the corn from the chaff, so does affliction purify virtue,'' a well-applied motto to the Florida pioneer from the first day to the present time. It has been a thrashing work, and we have; realized very little wheat from our labor. True! physically we are resurrected from the every winter sore throat and all other lung diseases, with the exception of our good Sister Nancy Dow, who has been troubled all her life, more or less with inflammatory rheumatism and believed she could find the elixir of life by removing to Florida. It has, however, been a sad mistake, Florida climate can never cure rheumatic people, and she now lies patiently waiting the call of the Boatman topass over to the other side where she can enjoy a fulness of health.
