SOWING. Ada S. Cummings. Sowing seeds in the vineyard fair, And tenderly each day, Watching their growth with eager care, Lest they should wither away. Sowing seeds in the morning dew, Fresh from the hand of God; The sower goes with vigor new, And scatters them abroad. Sowing seeds in the noonday heat, A cloudless sky o'er head; Casting on waters, grains of wheat Our staff, our daily bread. Sowing seeds in the soft twilight, The hour so calm and still; Praying the harvest may be bright And love, our garners fill. Sowing seeds that bringeth joy, As the moments speed along; Giving to God our best employ, For He hath made us strong. Sowing on through the toiling hours 'Worthless seeds may fall; And grow among the fairest flowers Making the fruitage small. 0 let us care for what we sow, Lest we reap a field of pain And hear the Lord of the Vineyard say, 'Where is the ripened grain? Naught but tares and weeds I see, Thy sowing was in vain; 1 find naught which belongs to me, No sheaves of golden grain. For all unwatered, through neglect, You left the plants to die, No tender hand you gave to them; The weeds grew rank and high. And now in sadness and in tears You've naught to bring to me. For whatsoe'er thy sowing was, So should thy reaping be. ' West Gloucester, Me.
