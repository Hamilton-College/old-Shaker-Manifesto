Sanitary CAUSES OF DYSPEPSIA. BY DR. J. H. HANAFORD. Dyspepsia, or indigestion, is the special disease-curse of our nation, having causes hero which are not equally active in any other parts of the civilized world. Indeed, our physical state in this regard is by no means creditable to our Christian civilization. The good Father has given us digestive powers amply able to so change our food, mysteriously, into the elements from which health and strength may be secured,�an amount to enable us to serve Him acceptably, and to be useful, the design of our introduction into this world of probation. No one can doubt this who intelligently examines the intricate mechanism by which this digestive process is effected; the lavish expenditure of the digestive solvents, almost miraculously extracted from the blood just when they are needed, always adapted to present emergencies, if the system is allowed to remain in its normal condition. It is natural, therefore, to have our food fully digested, to be strengthened by it, and would always be so, our stomach, liver, all of our digestive organs serving us faithfully, at all times, aside from the many violations of the laws of our being, which are the laws of God as certainly as the laws of the spiritual nature. It becomes us, therefore, to learn how far we may innocently disregard any of God's laws thus abridging our usefulness, by making ourselves a nation of dyspeptics. How far may we innocently array ourselves against any of the laws of God, whether in the realm of ma' terial nature, or in that of thought and spirit ? Prominent among the causes of dyspepsia� for all of which we must be regarded as responsible�is our great haste in taking our meals, rarely, if ever, taking the necessary time, making this a special business, not to be disturbed by other matters. If it is important to eat, not as a mere animal gratification, but as we are commanded, all for the 'glory of God, ' it is a duty to eat as 'a means to an end, ' that we so promote our health as to be able to do the greatest amount of good in the world, glorifying our Creator. In this regard, we may safely follow the example of the higher orders of the brute creation, the ruminants&gt; patiently 'chewing the cud, ' without drinks, so carefully and faithfully combining it with *he saliva, in addition to its thorough division, that it is fully digested, as the Creator graciously intended. To do otherwise, to ' bolt' our food, as do some of the lower orders, with far stronger digestive powers than ours, is to violate God's laws, enduring the penalty of indigestion, in the direct line of physical transgressions. If it is true that the digestive powers will correspond with the vigor of the body as a whole, generally, it is reasonable to infer that, if we hurry to our meals, exhausted by labor, the blood and vital force diverted from the stomach to the brain or limbs, they cannot be present with the digestive organs, at the time when particularly needed, from which fact the digestion must become correspondingly imperfect. The same must be true, if at the close of the meal, even if properly eaten, we return to our toils, instead of attempting to so modify our labors as to have more comparative ease just before and after the meals. One hour is usually given to the employed for their meals, in which time it is possible to secure a little rest devoting more than the usual time to chewing food, eating with decency. It is certain, however, that, just to the extent that we hurry in taking our meals, not half chewing and insalivating our food, or just to the extent that we waste digestive power by violent effort just before and after them, we must suffer the penalties of the violated digestive laws.

The idea is well expressed by the inscription on an old tomb-stcne : ' I was well; I wished to be better; I took physic, and here I am! ' The intelligent physician does not profess to cure disease through the direct agency of the remedies he prescribes ; these are given to remove obstructions that interfere with the recuperative efforts of nature. If there are no obstructions to remove, the effect of drugs is to interfere with the natural and healthful movements of the machinery of life. Health is maintained by ' good living, '�a term that comprehends a great deal. It consists in having good food, properly cooked, at every meal; clothing appropriate to the changing seasons ; and moderation in all things. Such a person might require no medicine during a long life. I must admit, however, that such an instance would be exceptional, even to one making the effort to live in that way. We cannot always procure well-cooked foods, nor can we always predict sudden changes of the weather }n time to protect ourselves against them. But we can aid nature in throwing off disease, by abstinence and such other prudential means as would occur to any thoughtful person, instead of eating heartily and trusting in drugs to overcome our ailments. Who ever saw an habitual medicine-taker who enjoyed reasonably good health? All medicines debilitate, and that drawback must be duly considered before taking them. Think of the quantities of pills that are used. Most of these are taken to relieve constipation. Unfortunately the relief is only temporary, and the doses must be repeated often, thus weakening the stomach and incapacitating it or its natural work. If medicine is used for Jie relief of constipation it is better to employ jt in suppositories, but a better plan than either is to cure the trouble by means of a proper diet and regular and active exercise or work in the open air. Thousands of drunkards, with their legacies of sorrow and crime and broken heart?, are made through dramdrinking, commenced at first for the relief of dyspepsia or colic, and continued through excuses and subterfuge-! that a depraved appetite strives to make plausible. The little household remedies have their uses, and they have also their abuses. There are occasions when such remedies as camphor, brandy, paregoric, laudanum, ginger, and pills and powders, may be of great service. The important point is to know when to use them; that would be perhaps once where they are ordinarily employed ten times. The best of all remedies�and every person should have a little constantly on hand�is common sense. If one experiences inconvenience in eating, nature will bring relief sooner and more effectively if left to herself, than by efforts to aid her witli liquors and tinctures that benumb the stomach and retard healthy action. Rest, warmth and abstinence are the proper remedies for all ordinary ailments. Wholesome and nutritious food, the comfort of a good home, vigorous and regular exercise, seasonable clothing, fresh air constantly, and eight hours of sound sleep out of every twenty four, and you may ' throw physic to the dogs.'
