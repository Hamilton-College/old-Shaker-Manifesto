TAKING MUDICINES. Mischief is often done by the indiscriminate use of medicines. The idea is well expressed by the inscription on an old tomb-stcne : ' I was well; I wished to be better; I took physic, and here I am! ' The intelligent physician does not profess to cure disease through the direct agency of the remedies he prescribes ; these are given to remove obstructions that interfere with the recuperative efforts of nature. If there are no obstructions to remove, the effect of drugs is to interfere with the natural and healthful movements of the machinery of life. Health is maintained by ' good living, '�a term that comprehends a great deal. It consists in having good food, properly cooked, at every meal; clothing appropriate to the changing seasons ; and moderation in all things. Such a person might require no medicine during a long life. I must admit, however, that such an instance would be exceptional, even to one making the effort to live in that way. We cannot always procure well-cooked foods, nor can we always predict sudden changes of the weather }n time to protect ourselves against them. But we can aid nature in throwing off disease, by abstinence and such other prudential means as would occur to any thoughtful person, instead of eating heartily and trusting in drugs to overcome our ailments. Who ever saw an habitual medicine-taker who enjoyed reasonably good health? All medicines debilitate, and that drawback must be duly considered before taking them. Think of the quantities of pills that are used. Most of these are taken to relieve constipation. Unfortunately the relief is only temporary, and the doses must be repeated often, thus weakening the stomach and incapacitating it or its natural work. If medicine is used for Jie relief of constipation it is better to employ jt in suppositories, but a better plan than either is to cure the trouble by means of a proper diet and regular and active exercise or work in the open air. Thousands of drunkards, with their legacies of sorrow and crime and broken heart?, are made through dramdrinking, commenced at first for the relief of dyspepsia or colic, and continued through excuses and subterfuge-! that a depraved appetite strives to make plausible. The little household remedies have their uses, and they have also their abuses. There are occasions when such remedies as camphor, brandy, paregoric, laudanum, ginger, and pills and powders, may be of great service. The important point is to know when to use them; that would be perhaps once where they are ordinarily employed ten times. The best of all remedies�and every person should have a little constantly on hand�is common sense. If one experiences inconvenience in eating, nature will bring relief sooner and more effectively if left to herself, than by efforts to aid her witli liquors and tinctures that benumb the stomach and retard healthy action. Rest, warmth and abstinence are the proper remedies for all ordinary ailments. Wholesome and nutritious food, the comfort of a good home, vigorous and regular exercise, seasonable clothing, fresh air constantly, and eight hours of sound sleep out of every twenty four, and you may ' throw physic to the dogs.'
