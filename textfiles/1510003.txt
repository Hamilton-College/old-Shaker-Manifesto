CHRISTIAN COMMUNISTS. Dear and Respected Friends :�I have been impressed for a considerable time that I should address you upon a subject of most vital importance to you, as Spiritualists�to us as a people, and to the human family at large. You cannot be ignorant of the fact that the various phases and features of the so-called spiritual phenomena had their beginning and origin among us as a people, and yet you date the commencement with the Foxes at Hydesville, N. Y., which is not the true facts in the case. Our instruments and mediums prophesied and declared again and again, that the work would cease with us, and that it would soon break forth in the outside world, and in accordance to which, it started at the above named place. If you need correct information touching the matter in hand, I would refer you to our books, in which is recorded all that I have here stated ; and for you to date the Anniversary of the New dispensation, as you call it, at Hydesville, N. Y., is far from doing justice to the cause ; you are really only the second edition of the work, and are our children, and should so represent yourselves to the world of mankind. Until this is done, you will fail to fulfill the true object and design of your mission as given from the Spirit world, to prepare souls for the kingdom of heaven on earth, in which is embraced the Evangel, life and teachings of the great founder of practical Christianity. Jesus, our elder Brother, also constituting a true brotherhood of interests, both temporally and spiritually, with a strictly pure and virgin life, with all its selfdenial, self-sacrifice and self-abnegation. From our standpoint, we find you still occupying the selfish Adamic plane, with all the so-called Christian churches of the day, who openly violate in their lives all the conditions of discipleship to the one they profess to follow. The time has now come, dear brethren, when their mask of hypocrisy and deceit will be removed with all their inconsistency, and they will stand in their true colors before an astonished world. Our friends, the Spiritualists, have had far greater and superior light, hence their obligations and responsibility are proportionally increased for them to assume their true attitude and position in the line of reform and progress with us, with all the attendant sacrifices on their part; if they, as pioneers and leaders, fail to heed the present call, as I have endeavored to present it in love and unbounded sympathy, the same will go forth throughout all their ranks. Think not that I am an enthusiast and a religious monomaniac ; not so. The foregoing sentiments are not mine alone, but those of the whole body of people, of which I have been a member nearly forty years, and known to all intents and purposes, whereof I write. The case of A. J. Davis is only a sample of hundreds and thousands, that will soon follow his steps, by rejecting the light that will soon burst upon you. Had he obeyed his light and call as touching the cause we have espoused, years ago, he would now have been a redeemed and happy man. The question of organization has been more or less agitated among Spiritualists for years ; the elements of discord have evidently forbidden it. Let me assure them in all kindness, that it will never be accomplished, having no authority from the spirit spheres for such a measure. A communication similar to this will be forwarded to all the editors of the spiritual papers, so-called, throughout the country. Should they not deem it worthy their notice and attention, we shall select other channels through which the foregoing can be brought before the public; the issues dependent upon it call for immediate action. We are the only people on the globe that do practically demonstrate by a daily life, before all men, the heavenborn principles embodied in the beautiful Evangel of Jesus, having done so for one hundred years ; yet the Spiritualists never allude to us in their writings no more than if we did not exist and justice had departed from the earth. Oh! consistency, thou art a jewel! With assurances of esteem and respect, I remain, very truly, your friend, Charles Clapp. Warren Co., Ohio, March, 1885.
