Jesus gave the disciples a remarkable lesson in practical righteousness when he instructed them how to use their gospel light. Whatever they may have been before this date, they were now exhorted to let their light shine before all men. These disciples, in all probability, even in their new calling, manifested no great anxiety to have their order of life either seen or known. Possibly they preferred to take their nets and still follow their occupation of fishing. At the same time they were anxious to be the disciples of so good a Teacher, who held forth the promise of an hundred fold reward in this world, and with this the assurance of eternal life. Poor people are always interested in the multiplication of the treasures of this world, and the sudden accumulation of an hundred fold, must have seemed very inviting to their unspiritual minds. It was a gospel preached to the poor, and by them it was received into thankful hearts. They had not learned that by accepting the words of Jesus, they were to become evangelists and preachers of the word of God ; but having given to them th�' light that came down from heaven, he was anxious that they should use it. It had raised them from an earthly order into a better element, and was well calculated to remould their lives, and to make them men of God. ' Let your light so shine,' said he, ' that others may see your good works. '. The presentation of bad works had been sufficiently prominent to be a characteristic feature among men and hence the demand for a radical change. It was to be manifested in their lives, rather than in their words. Any Pharisee could boast of his good works, in fasting twice each week, and in giving liberally to the poor, but the exhibition of a practical righteousness was what the Pharisee had never learned. To impress the importance of this new life more clearly upon the minds of the disciples, Jesus brought forward this simple illustration. ' No man when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.' Luke, viii., 83. The light was to be an object of attraction, people wanted to see it; to ascertain if it was better than what they were using. They would make inquiries about it, to learn to whom it belonged and from whom it was obtained. Jesus would impress their minds with the fact that this light was the gospel testimony and that it was intended for the salvation of the family of man, THE TERMS. They mast use it tor the good of others, as they had received it,�Freely, liberally and charitably. A miserly use of gospel treasures is equally as inconsistent as a miserly use of the blessings that fall to our lot in this world. It is not giving as God gives. It is not seeking diligently to find that which has gqne astray, that it may be brought home to God. The followers of Christ to be consistent with their own doctrine must have respect to the manifestations of his spiritual life. And this life was righteousness as measured by the testimony which he gave, as one test of discipleship ;�'Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.' A few such vital evidences of Christian fellowship which become in the soul like 'awell of water springing up into everlasting life,' stands far in advance of any churchal system of forms and ceremonies that men may have devised.
