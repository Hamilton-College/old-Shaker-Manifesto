AFFECTIONATE THOUGHT 'Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord,' is a time-honored saying, familiar to us all, and equally blest are those still living, who believe in the continued existence, interest and love of those who have arisen from our sight and are 'waiting and watching' for friends left behind, even so, do I realize the position of our friend and father who has so recently left us. We have known him here, only as an able teacher and minister of truth, light and love, and as he ascends to a sphere of greater light, and more perfect knowledge of truth, as his people, may we not trustingly look for a continual ministration from his parental spirit? genuine to principle, and just in his dealings here, will he not still work with us, and for us? his life has been a living demonstration of the truth, that 'an honest man is the noblest work of God,' majestic in his bearing, simple and gentle in his mien, reverence, mingled with filial love was the spontaneous outgrowth from the souls of those unto whom he was chosen to minister, a man of no ordinary talent, any position he might have been called to occupy would have been honored by his noble life, and executive ability. Long will he live in the hearts and memories of his people. Enfieid. N. H. Caroline Whitcher.
