THE FOOLISH BEE The Brethren's Advocate has this to say about . Last week we spoke in praise of the little bee, commending its good sense and industrious habits, but like people who may have many good qualities and yet have one weak point, the bee has its failings, too. Of course not everbody does wrong in the same way, neither do all bees do as foolishly as did the one we have in the fable. One bright summer morning, according to the story, two bees flew away from the hive in quest of homes. For some time they flitted around among the flowers without finding much to award their search. At last they came to a wide-mouthed bottle half full of honey, which hung from a limb of an old peach tree. Here was a chance. ' What is the use,' said one, 'for us to fly around all day to gather a little honey when we can go down in this bottle, eat all we want and get an abundant supply to carry home to the hive? '' The other was more cautious, and warned his little friend against the danger, but he was too headstrong to listen, and plunged right in and commenced eating like a glutton ; but the wise one flew away, gatheringlittle by little, bit by bit, from the delicate buds and open flowers, spending the day in delightful labor, and at evening on his way home, with all his little limbs could carry, he thought of his friend, and called to see if he was ready to return ; but oh, to his sorrow lie found him ' reveling in sweets which he was as unable to leave as to enjoy.' It is better to labor patiently and long than with hope of becoming rich in an hour, plunge into that which may prove our ruin.
