NOAH'S ARK WOOD. Within a radius of sixty miles of Nashville, Tenn., there is said to be found a tree that is said to be the shittim wood of ark fame. Celebrated botanists from all over the country have examined the trees and agree that they grow nowhere else on the globe. They have decided that it is the shittim wood of which Noah's ark was constructed, mention of which is made several times in the Bible. The tree is medium size, with very dark,smooth bark, and the wood is of a bright gold color. In early spring the trees are laden with long, white blossoms, closely resembling great ostrich plumes. There seems to be no doubt about the identity of the trees, and it is remarkable that they are found only in this small area and so few at that. Scientific American.
