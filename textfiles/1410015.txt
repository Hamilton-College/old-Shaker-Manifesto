KNOWLEDGE. FLORA WILLIAMS. 'Then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord. ' Hosea, vi., 8. Whether we consider these words as an encouragement addressed by the godly to each other, or to their own souls, they remind us of an important aim ; a necessary duty ; and an assured privilege. The aim is, to ' know the Lord, ' for the soul to be without knowledge it is not good. All the operations of the Spirit are begun and carried on in the renewing of the mind. ' Nothing can be perfectly spiritual or religious in our dispositions or our actions that is not ftnmded in knowledge ; because it must be destitute of principle and motive; and the Lord looketh at the heart. Real repentance must arise form correct knowledge of the evil of sin in connection with the cross of Christ. Even faith is impossible without knowledge. ' For how can they believe in Him of whom they have not heard r' But what says the Savior? 'This is life eternal, that they know Thee, the only true God ; and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. ' This declaration not only decides the importance of this knowledge, but also the nature of it. It is not a philosophical knowledge of God as an Almighty being,ï¿½the Creator of all things ; or even a knowledge of Him as holy in all his ways, and righteous in all His works. Such views of Him, on the mind of a sinner must engender dread and aversion. The saving grace in the restoration of the wayward is to know that He is willing, even now, to become a friend and Savior to the needy, and has already given undeniable proof that he is waiting to help us if we but call upon Him. Connected with this there is a necessary duty, it is to 'follow on to know the Lord.' This takes in the practice of what we already know. To what purpose would it be for God to afford light to be neglected? It would only increase the sin and condemnation. ' Whensoever hath, to him shall be given and he shall have more abundantly, but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath, ' and we see this constantly exemplified. When men do not choose to retain God in their knowledge; it is their interest to see things less clearly; and so they part with one truth after another until they are left as it were without God in the world; while those who do his will know of the doctrine, and by patient continuance in well-doing seek for ' glory, honor and immortality.' The privilege is as sure as the word of God, history and experience can make it. And if a probability of success will actuate a man to engage in an enterprise, and continue in a series of exertions and sacrifices, how much more should actual certainty ! Let therefore this full assurance influence us to seek after him who giveth to all men liberally, then shall our path be as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. According to the promise our perplexities shall be solved, our doubts removed. Crooked things shall be made straight and the rough places smooth, then shall the 'wilderness bloom and the barren desert smile,' and he will have become k' our strength and portion forever.
