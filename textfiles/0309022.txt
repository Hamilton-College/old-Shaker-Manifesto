FREEDOM It is a time-honor'd custom with the American nation, to celebrate the anniversary day, when her people were declared to be free and independent. Upon such occasions, the booming of canons, the ringing of bells, and almost every conceivable noise is heard from city, town, and hamlet, to show forth the great joy of the inhabitants that America is a free land —free to the home-born, and to the stranger. Great enthusiasm usually prevails at such times, and a majority of the people, from hoary age to lisping infancy, seem to partake of it, and feel that it is such a glorious thing to be free. Would it not be well to pause amid the rapturous, and often times tumultuous shout of Liberty, and ask the question, Are we really free f The little maxim reads, ' Let no man call himself free, who is enslaved by any passion.' Where shall we find a man, woman, or child, who is not bound to some bad habit, or fast becoming so—habits ruinous to body or mind, or both ? True liberty is found in the truth. Those whom ' truth makes free, are free indeed.' Not free from physical tyranny and servitude merely, but free to become elevated in mind and feeling, released from injurious customs, redeemed from bad habits, and free to rise into a moral and spiritual atmosphere. Then we may rejoice, and sing of the blessings of true Freedom, as do the Angels in heaven. Emma J. Neal, Mount Lebanon
