Word and Works Word and Works for April makes its Forecast for the month with all the assurance of a well directed mind. There will be no anxious waiting this time as the Editor says, 'a regular storm period is central on the 2nd day of the month, and that April will bring an unusual amount of rain and some violent Venus storms.' If there is not, on that day, a regular blizzard in our town, we shall make arrangements to enquire of the man in the Moon. April is to bring us storms of rain and hail and thunder, but the Editor says.�'Let no one be foolishly alarmed, as though we predicted unknown calamity, but let all calmly watch and provide against nature's regular visitations.' The articles on Temperance have a leading value for the paper, and the writers are the manifested friends of humanity. In the Department of 'The Word,' are to be found some very pleasant and timely religious remarks that must have been written by thoughtful minds. Word and Works Pub. Co. 2201 Locust St. St. Louis, Mo.
