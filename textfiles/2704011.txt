Enfield, N. H. March, 1897. As long as our glorious Republic exists, the memory of George Washington will be feted with due homage. In commemoration of his natal day, we gathered in our Hall which was decorated with flags, hatchets and other emblems of Washingtonian integrity, and enjoyed a pleasant and instructive entertainment. The principal feature was the rendering of a dialog by thirteen Sisters, the subject, 'Ye Hatchet Partie.' Representing presidents from George Washington to Millard Fillmore. The hatchets were designed to cut down the huge tree of intemperance, the speakers giving information how the cause of temperance took root on American soil and of its branches which have borne such prolific fruit of reformed souls from the deadly sap of inebriation. A thorough knowledge of the great event, when the Golden Rod of American Independence burst in its rich glory, being necessary to the education of the children of to-day, so is a full knowledge of the history of the founder of our own Church, necessary to us, that we may be able to give an intelligent reason for living as we do. The last Sabbath service in February, was markt with appropriate songs and testimonials adapted to the memory of Ann Lee, of whose life mission we can not have too much knowledge, as the principles she advocated form the basis of our Church and afford a sanctifying power which liberates the soul from error and the bondage to sin. So long as wrong exists the true spirit of peace can not bear sway; there will be a contending for right till the cause of wrong is removed. So let us continue to hope that our country will soon pass from the school of independence, into the university of universal brotherhood, where nation will walk hand in hand with nation, manifesting a broad international relation fashioned in mutual love and toleration, and regard all implements of war as relics of a barbarous age. George II. Baxter.
