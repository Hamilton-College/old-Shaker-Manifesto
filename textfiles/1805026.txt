Sanitary Drooping Shoulders �This is a serious evil. It compromises both appearance and vitality. A stooping figure is not only a familiar expression of weakness or old age, but is, when caused by careless habits, a direct cause of contracted chest and defective breathing. Unless you rid yourself of this crook while at school, you will probably go bent to the grave. There is one good way to cure it. Shoulder-braces will not help. One needs, not an artificial substitute, but some means to develop the muscles whose duty it is to hold the head and shoulders erect. I know of but one bull's eye shut. It is to carry a weight on the head. A sheep-skin or other strong bag filled with twenty or more pounds of sand is a good weight. When engaged in your morning studies, either before or after breakfast, put this bag of sand on the head, hold your head erect, draw your chin close to your neck, and walk slowly about the room, coming back, if you please, every minute or two to your book, or carrying the book as you walk. The muscles, whose duty it is to hold head and shoulders erect are hit, not with scattering shot, but with a rifle ball. The bones of the spine and intervertebral substance will soon accommodate themselves to the new attitude. One year of daily practice with the bag, half an hour morning and evening, will give you a noble carriage, without interfering a moment with your studies. It would be very difficult to put into a paragraph more important instructions than this. Your respiration, voice and strength of spine, to say nothing of your appearance, will find a new departure in this cure of drooping shoulders.Dr. Dio Lewis, in Halls Journal of Health. PRESERVATION OF HEALTH. It is impossible to lay down any rules for health which may be followed safely by all persons. Health depends largely upon the diet Some people cannot eat newly baked bread: others cannot eat it when stale. Much fresh meat, with some constitutions, induces fulness of the head and a feverish state of the system, because it makes blood too fast. It should therefore be discarded, and a litrtle salt meat or fish, if the appetite craves it, with fresh fruit and vegetables, will be found, probably, to be just what the system requires. In truth, with health, as in many other things, each person must be a law unto himself. In acute or intricate cases, physicians are necessary, but in many minor matters they cannot decide. It is true that what is 'one man's meat may be another's poison,' and a little poisoning, now and then, seems indispensable to teach us our individual physical, as well as mental idiosyncrasies. Experience thus gained, if not carried to such an excess as to prove too severe a schoolmaster, will be of more value through life than all the doctors in Christendom� with all respect be it spoken�besides saving many a long bill at the drug store. Children should be taught at an early period in life to avoid the use of condiments. Their food should be plentiful, but simple. Many a mother will give her very young children rich food�pastry, cake and sauces and condiments of the most indigestible or fiery kind�and tell you her children are healthy, and nothing hurts them. Perhaps the injury is not apparent at first, but it will not be long before headaches, indigestion of the most serious character, dyspepsia, fixed for life, disproves the truth of her opinions. Hall's Journal of Health. Beds and Bed Clothing. The covering of a bed ought to be light as well as warm. Woolen blankets are far more healthful than are heavy comforters which admit of no ventilation, but, instead, absorb and retain the exhalation from the body. Beds and bed clothing should be aired frequently. Many housewives consider the airing of the sleeping room all sufficient, but this is a mistake. Not only should mattresses be turned and aired at least three times each week, but pillows and bolsters ought to be beaten, shaken and exposed to the sun every two or three days. If beds and their furnishings are not carefully cared for, the bedding soon comes to have a stuffy, disagreeable odor, and that odor means sleepless nights, for perfect rest is gained only in a bed that is fresh and clean Journal of Hygeio- Therapy.
