THE DIGNITY OF HUMANITY ANDREW BARRETT Is there any joy greater than that experienced by any one when they unselfishly help another? There are some men so low down in the scale of humanity that it is said they would not have the smell of their clover go into the high-way, for fear that othe*s will get something that they own without paying for it. Others it is said envy the bees the honey they find in the flowers, grown on their land and take without leaving some pay. But we may call this imaginary. A man whose heart does not respond to any act of kindness of his neighbor is no longer a man. He has passed the line of manhood. And we must give him a place at the stall with others of his kind. True dignity of character and manliness through all the vicissitudes and trials of life, are very different things than a generous nobility at the hour of death. Let me see the man who takes life's burdens upon his shoulders early in the morning, and travels with them until nature calls for rest; without a frown upon his countenance, nor a murmuring word from his lips, working merely from the sense of duty. Don't we respect that man ? Don't we look with hope, to see him fill some important station in the drama of life ? Though his coat may be patched, and his trowsers made of two kinds of material, what of that! We see the mind, and that speaks louder than broadcloth, velvet or satin. It must and will have a place. Out of the humble stations of the blacksmith, the tailor, and the shoe maker what have we seen rise up ? We have seen minds who have governed the destinies of nations ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
