THAT CROW QUESTION In Aug. No. of Shaker, we defended our course in regard to the Crow — its extermination from gardens and cornfields, etc. Using Cowper's rule, we believe still, that it and our course were tenable and correct. But as there is too little kindness in the world, and we had all better suffer more wrong than do any, we extract from a private letter, the following from Elder F. W. Evans, which he undoubtedly wrote with many dry smiles : * * * « Think you wrong on the Crow question I A more thorough knowledge of that bird, his habits, food, etc., would make you his friend. The author of the ' Vestiges of Creation,' places the crow, as the bird of greatest variety and capacity — a typical bird. There is not much that passes for food among the birds and beasts, that the crow will not eat. Is capable of high culture — can talk in case of necessity, like a parrot — can steal like a man! But on principle, the crow is the farmers' friend. Plenty of crows, no mice, no snakes, no vermin, no potato bugs. Crows are better than Paris-green. This is fit only for antichristians' use. Let the crow live and your own life will be more secure. We shoot no birds to save our seeds and cherries. They eat the insects and worms out of such productions, thus saving them.'
