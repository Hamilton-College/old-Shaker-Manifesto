SORTING BEANS A farmer's wife was busy Sorting beans. The good seemed hardly any, For the harvest time was rainy. Bad for beans. The poor ones were so many, She was vexed and tired by picking Out bad beans. For it took her many hours, And it tired her patience powers, Till she wished there were no showers To spoil beans. Suddenly she stopped, and thinking Of the beans Now finished, said with smiling : ' What a fool to let the riling Come, the pleasant hours beguiling, For bad beans. ' When I come to have another Sorting beans, I will save me half the trouble, And my pleasure will be double, While I burst the hideous bubble Of bad beans. ' For instead of always looking For bad beans, I will leave them, while with pleasure I will gather out and treasure, Till I fill my little measure With good beans.' There's a lesson from this story — Sorting beans. Life is full of smiles and madness, Many griefs, and sometimes gladness, Much of joy and more of Sadness — Like poor beans — And our work in life is sorting, As with beans. We can go through life and end it, Leaving the best things, that lend it Charms, and only spend it With bad beans. But there is a way that's better Sorting beans. Choose the good, and when life closes There will be less thorns than roses, For the garnered good disposes Of poor beans.
