WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO. IN THE ROCKING CHAIR. I sit, and I rock in the old easy chair, My heart full of longing, my head full of care, So sorely depressing, So keenly distressing, I try to rock hope out of brooding despair. I fancy I see a black cloud overhead; A blank lonely silence reign9, as with the dead; Oh hours so dreary! Oh spirit so weary Look out from beneath the deep shadows of dread!, Faint not in thy weakness, thou tried heart of mine Nor murmur, tho' dark days of tempest be thine; Thy trials and crosses, Thy burdens and losses, Are only the chastenings of God's love divine. Rise not in defiance, but bow at His throne, And say, ' Ah my Father Thy will be mine own, ' And then in His blessing Thou'lt find sweet redressing, And joy, that the depth of His mercy be known. I know, my young heart, that thou canst not see Why it is that that sad Angel visiteth thee. Why 'tis that she chides thee, Yet trusting confides thee, And I rock as I wait for an answer to thee. It is this; that a lesson both needful, severe, She has brought for thy keeping, in love, not in fear, Wheresoever thou goest, Whatsoever tho a so west, The same thou shalt reap when the harvest is here. Oh sink thou not down 'neath this chiding so sweet, It is for thy repentance; go, lay at His feet, The gifts in thy keeping, The fruits of thy reaping, The golden bound sheaves as an offering meet. Then awake to the music of Hope, Oh my heart, Stand not back in thy doubting, but render thy part, The Love-angel lingers, Her fairy-like fingers Sweep over the strings f her beautiful harp. And so I have rocked off' my sorrow and care, Have rocked a sweet hope out of bitter despair, In lieu of cold sadness, A heart full of gladness, Thank God for my peace in the old rocking chair.
