THE WORLD IS WHAT WE MAKE IT Helen A. Manville I've seen some people in this life Who always are repining, Who never, never yet could see The storm-cloud's silver lining, There always something is amiss, From sunrise to its setting; That God's hand made their map of life, They seem the while forgetting. And I have seen a blessed sight To sin-beclouded vision, Some people who, where'er they be, Make earth seem an Elysian. They always see the brightest side — The direful shadows never — And keep the flower of hope in bloom Within their hearts forever. The one can make the sunniest day Seem wondrous sad and dreary ; The other smiles the clouds away, And makes a dark day cheery. This life of ours is, after all, About as we shall make it. If we can vanquish grief and care, Let's haste to undertake it. —
