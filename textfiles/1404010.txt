PIONEERS OF THE WESTERN RESERVE. NO.3. [Notes referring to the Shakers of North Union, Ohio, as published by Harvey Rice in a work entitled, Pioneers of the Western Reserve. Some explanatory remarks are added by J. S. Presoott, a member of the Society of North Union.] Though sneeringly called Shakers by the outside world, it is evident they have become a great moral power, as well as numerous. From their original number seven they have increased in this country to seven thousand, * established eighteen prosperous communities, * This far exceeds the number of Shakers in the United States. and accumulated a property worth from twelve to fifteen millions of dollars. In achieving all this they have kept the faith. Though childless, they have children, most of whom are waifs received from the outside world into the bosom of their communities, where they are kindly treated, and brought up in the nurture and admonition ot Ann Lee,| and trained to habits of industry and a life of moral purity, and are thus saved from a career of vice and moral degradation. It cannot be a bad religion that is devoted to a work so benevolent and humane in its character. But if all mankind were to become Shakers, and should prove true to their faith, it would not require a prophet to predict the speedy and final extinction of the human family. It is said there are more than one thousand different religions in the world, and a priesthood so numerous that they cannot be counted. All claim to be right, yet all condemn each other as wrong. When docters differ, whether medical or divine, who shall decide?ï¿½And yet in every age new creeds are generated, and new revelations follow revelations. ' t The reason why the doctrines of Ann Lee have ' survived her, and never die,' is because she revealed the eternal Mother in the Deity. To many, it is still unknown although self-existent. Its power and influence is beginning to bo felt and manifest in the world. Ann Lee's mission took place about one hundred years ago. It was the commencement of a new era in the world's history- -the, changes wrought and the revolutions which have taken place since that time, let the world itself bear witness. Two orders of people are now established on the earth, and are required to be governed by two distinct laws. The first is the rudimental, the law of propagation, i. e. to have no sexual intercourse only for offspring. The second is to keep the higher law, i. e. the law of Christ. Ann Lee could not have fulfilled her mission without advocating virgin celibacy for the higher development of our race. The time had fully come for these two orders to be established. And we need not expect that the calamities will cease, until these two laws are obeyed, if it takes a thousand years. Earth is not heaven, and heaven is not earth. Heaven is a state, or condition of the mind, the effects of ' righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.' The End.
