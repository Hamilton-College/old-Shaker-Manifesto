ORAL CONFESSION The excitement of the English churches over the proposed introduction of oral confession, as a sacrament, into the demands of the Episcopal persuasion, does not die away yet. Why should it? By what authority did the originators of that church do away with the confession of sin? 'Confess your sins, one to another!' The Baptists 'baptize ;' but they neglect the weightier matter of ' confessing their sins.' It may be Roman Catholic to confess orally, but it is none the less Christian for that. In our opinion, while acknowledging the prostitution of power by the priests, and much dead cere|mony of the Roman church, yet the Episcopal must progress very much before they can present as many Christian features as the Romans. Let them progress into oral confessionâ€”make priestesses of women, and let each sex confess and be ministered to by its own sex. This will excel the Romans !
