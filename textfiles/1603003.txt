TRUE LOVE. MARIAN JOHNSON. ' By this shall all men knoiv that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another. ' A love that will show in our actions, As the fruit of a cross-bearing life ; A love that will overcome evil, All jealousy, envy and strife. A love that will shine all the brighter, Though clouds may encompass around; And the heaviest burdens grow lighter, Where this heaven born love does abound. A love that will lift up the fallen, And aid them to struggle from loss ; And teach them the way of salvation,ï¿½ The beautiful way of the cross. This love is our watchword and motto, Our banner of light to the lost; An anchor of hope to the weary, On life's troubled sea tempest tossed. Canterbury, N. H.
