N. A. Briggs, publisherâ€”Dear Sir: Please find sixty cents inclosed for The Shaker, for 1877. Have you last year's numbers for sale, and at what price? The Lord bless your paper and the good work it is doing. May the Lord use it as an instrument to bring souls to Christ; that they may take the waters of life freely, and be thereby saved from their sins, is the prayer of your brother in Christ. L. A. Burns Leominster, Mass.
