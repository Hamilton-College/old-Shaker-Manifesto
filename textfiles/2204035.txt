Ladies' Home Journal A Sort of Digital Depression. Did you ever notice, when a man smites his thumb with a hammer, while putting down a carpet under wifely supervision and criticism, how quickly he thrusts the bruised and throbbing member into his ready mouth? writes Robert J. Burdette in the March Ladies' Home Journal. People think it is because the application is soothing. But no: it is an involuntary movement, same as winking. The man cannot help it. Nature knows what the man would be apt to say under the circumstances, and so she has provided him with a stopper, and has ordained that whenever he hits his thumb hard enough to hurtand it doesn't take very much to nearly kill a man when he is doing something he doesn't want toby a sort of interlocking system the thumb flies into his mouth and stops him up, so that he can't say anything. Some men whom you and I know should be provided with an extra thumb which they might carry about in their hand all the time it wasn't in active use. It would be a great thing, wouldn't it?
