PRAY WITHOUT CEASING, By Fidella Estabrook. Pray with a spirit firm and true, Pray with a resolute will; Pray for a hope, a love divine That will your being thrill. Pray for a heart made lree from sin, Pray for a spirit pure; 108 THE MANIFESTO. Pray for the strength and aid of God That ever will endure. Pray to thy God in the hours of need ; Pray on through sun or rain ; Pray to Him for a hope secure And you that hope will gain. Pray when fierce doubts do you assail, And darkened seems your day; He will an answer give to you In his own better way. 4'Ask, and ye shall receive' of Him, 'Knock,' and the gates are ajar ; 'Seek, and ye shall find him' then, If true and sincere you are. God is a refuge and strength to us; A guide and a shield for all; He ever has a listening ear To hear his children call. To Him in prayer we render thanks, And they ascend above To echo through the golden streets The story of his love. Hancock, Mass.
