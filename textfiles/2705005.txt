WATCHMAN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT? By Hamilton DeGraw. 'I see a light,�a light on the distant horizon, Its rays illumine the path of the pure And betoken the coming morning.' HOW many anxious souls have askt,�'Watchman, what of the night?' and have heard the answer, but through human weakness impatiently inquire, When will the morning dawn? An editorial on the labor question in a metropolitan journal commenting on the fact of there being over one hundred thousand idle men in that city who were looking for work; willing to do whatever they could to earn an honest dollar to support those dependent upon them asks, 'is there not something wrong in our civilization when it is possible for such conditions to exist?' and questions 'where is the remedy?' It is not difficult to see that something is wrong for like a ghostly shadow it haunts human society by day and is in their visions at night. But the remedy! Ah! like a mathematical problem it is easy enough after the solu- tion, but at present the bare suggestion of starting a movement winch would be expected to change existing conditions is sufficient to brand the originator with the epithet 'anarchist,�enemy of society,�let us crucify him.' Selfishness is the foundation of this condition. We quote from an agricultural journal. 'The prospects for the American farmer are brightening.' How? 'Failure of crops in Europe and famine in India.' There must be something wrong when Christianity for two thousand years have been seeking to incorporate the Divine principle of the brotherhood of man into the life of the races that claim to represent that faith ; and they rejoice in the affliction of their fellow-beings if it replenishes their own coffers. By a false interpretation of that doctrine it has been made to represent and sanction a system of life that is at variance with its precepts. This arises from the undevelopt state of the soul; but as it advances and comes to a more perfect understanding of its true destiny and realizes that the law of reaction is such that if one portion of the human family suffers the rest through sympathy must also suffer no thought but the desire to help those in need will urge them to action. Whittier has truly voiced the sentiment of every one who believes in human progress,�'We only know that God is just and every wrong shall die.' Fear oppresses society with the thought of the conditions that may possibly exist in the ti'ansition from the present social order to the new, and it acts as a barrier to prevent the inauguration of a reform movement. That fear should be groundless, for with an honest desire to remove the conditions now existing would come the knowledge by which it could best be accomplisht. The presentation of ideas to those who can not accept them and intelligently realize their obligations is casting pearls whera they will be trodden under foot. President Lincoln when urged to issue his emancipation proclamation said, 'not yet, the people do not understand and will not accept it at present.' Those who have received that spiritual unfolding which places them in the vanguard as the true leaders of the people ; while realizing the necessity of educational labors are cautious to know that the soil is prepared before the seed is sown. The adage to 'strike when the iron is hot,' is applicable to the present. When conditions are properly adjusted and the soul has been enlightened to that degree that it can understand advanced truths, then will the light break upon the world. The unification of thought in religion and politics that is actively engaging the attention of advanced thinkers, while it may not be possible on the lines they have drawn, to remove the barriers which produce the political distinctions of the world, yet unity can and will be accomplisht and the comprehension of the divine ideal toward which human life is traveling will be realized; but in the details there will be harmony in diversity. Observed from different positions the goal appears to each school of thought on the direct line of their vision, all others varying in different degrees from that; but as they advance, the diverging lines become less and all will reach the same goal. The growing interest in arbitration for settling international difficulties is proof that one more ray of light has penetrated the darkness and is announcing that day 'when the war drum throbs no longer, and the battle flags aie furled.' The terrific forces that the human mind is developing to carry on offensive and defensive warfare may be a factor in the accomplishment of this result. Racial distinctions which are produced by climatic conditions will remain, a permanent factor ; but those barriers which are the product of man's inability lo grasp the truth of the brotherhood of man will, through divine evolution be removed as he grows to a more perfect understanding of the higher law.
