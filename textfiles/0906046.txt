A Singular Experiment Our sight is not always to be depended upon ; and a very odd experiment, illustrative of the fact, may be performed by any one in possession of two hands and a sheet of paper. Take the paper — stiff writing-paper will answer best — and roll it so as to form a tube about an inch in diameter. Apply the tube to the right eye, and look steadily through it at any convenient object ; at the same time keep the left eye open. Now, place the left hand, with the palm toward you and the fingers pointing upward, by the side of the paper tube and near its lower end. The strange sight will be seen of a hole — a clearly defined hole — through the palm of the left hand. The illusion is a strange one, and a good example of the things we are liable to have played us by our two-eyed vision.
