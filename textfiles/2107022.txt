Sabbathday Lake, Me. June 9, 1891. Beloved Elder Henkt:ï¿½I was just a little too late for the last Manifesto, so you see I am trying to be more prompt for this month. The planting is done. We purchased a National Keversible Sulkey Plow, and one young man sixteen years old avIio had never turned a furrow before did all of our ploAving except about eight acres, which was done last fall. The Brethren have worked thirty acres of ground this Spring with no help from hired men and they feel greatly rejoiced with their success and the prosperity which has thus far attended their labor. The unsightly fences are being removed and new ones put in their places as fast as possible. The second pasture for the hens has been made, containing about a square acre which will prevent them from destroying garden crops. Meanwhile, the Sisters have not been idle. We are busy with our flower-gardens. Have set out aster and pansy plants Marguerite pinks, and verbenas that were started early under glass. Eoses, geraniums and Carnation pinks were conveyed to the garden in season to receive slight touches from Jack Frost, from which they have bravely recovered. The sweet peas are growing finely. We hope to supply the guests of the Poland Spring Hotels with all the flowers they will want this summer. Our success depends upon the blessings of sunshine and rain which we trust our Heavenly Father will send in the future as He ever has in the past. A. S. C.
