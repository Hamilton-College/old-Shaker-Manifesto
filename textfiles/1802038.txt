Elder Alexander:- Permit me to congratulate Editor and Publisher... Alfred, Me. Dec. 1887. Elder Alexander :ï¿½Permit me to congratulate Editor and Publisher for the ability displayed in our little Manifesto. May it long continue to spread the glad tidings of great joy, that all may obtain a full and free salvation from a perverted and sinful nature by accepting the life and death of Christ, which according to the apostle Paul's definition is ' Living to God, ' and ' dying to sin. ' Your friend, J. B. Vance.
