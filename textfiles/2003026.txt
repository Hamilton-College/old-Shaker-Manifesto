Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1890. Beloved Elder H :ï¿½We like the idea of each Society being represented in the Manifesto, indeed, it is one of the pleasant means of knowing more of the home life of our gospel friends. We should be better satisfied, however, if we could be favored with a real visit from the dear friends, and share a union of the spirit that would assist both parties to feel better able to continue in the good way of peace and righteousness. In our morning service on the Sabbath we were invited to speak of the good in each other, and of our many blessings, so that when the beloved Ministry visit us, you may find that we are on the right road to the kingdom of our God. The cutting of the supply of fire wood for next winter is nearly finished, and from our estimate, we think it is consumed faster than it grows. The ice harvest for this season was early and satisfactory, and the houses have been filled with a good article from the Mascoma Lake, fifteen inches thick. Kindly, Ella Briggs. North Family. All are hurrying to make the most of the good sleighing. Some of the teams are hauling logs from the woods, which may be fifty feet long. The butchering of animals for food is still continued and attended to promptly. Several hands are at work in the factory, and are making some very nice pails and tubs. As yet the influenza wave has not disturbed us.
