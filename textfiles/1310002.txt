RESIGNATION. ANNA ERVIN. Blest resignation, lend to me thy charms, That I unmoved may hear the worJd's alarms, May learn to bear the ills I cannot mend, And suffer sooner than my God offend. When duty points the course I ought to steer, And threatening clouds around my path apThy power I need to bear nvy spirit up, [pear, And pour a cordial in ray bitter cup. Wisdom may point me to the safer way; Danger may threaten if from it I stray; Hope may allure me in that course to run; But resignation breathes, Thy will be done. Enfield, Conn.
