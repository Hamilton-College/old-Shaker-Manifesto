It is instructive and encouraging, and is one of the best productions that has ever graced the columns of 'The Manifesto.' It is free from theory and theology, a historical sermon, instructive alike to old and young. Indeed, it is the fruit of a well ordered life of unfeigned' religion, wrought out in works, resulting in happy reflections and cheering prospects. How beautiful is the thought, 'My reward is with me; I have not all my life, been building air castles, neither have I built upon the sand. Nay, I have secured my treasure in heaven, and the garments wrought here in earth life, will be mine to wear in the land of souls.' What a passport is such a consciousness of right doing! 'My reward is with me.' No waiting, no uncertain trusting. Leaving 'this beautiful world, another sphere is mine to inhabit.' This is true philosophy. 'Heaven here and now.' I wish that we had a modern Bible, made .of such chapters. Would it not be an improvement on all others? Please accept gospeL blessing and many thanks. Elijah Myrick.
