EDITORIAL NOTES STEADY PROGRESS Mother Ann Lee once prophesied, during a period of some doubt among her followers, that 'souls will flock to your doors by hundreds and by thousands, like doves to their cots!' Regardless of the charge upon us of adulatory adoration for our founder, take a look at her belief and teachings one hundred, and more years ago, and compare them with the present religious growth of the people : 1. She taught Jesus as an exampler, not as an Atonement. How long will it be before Beecher, and 'the rest of mankind' will so believe ? What multitudes have since her day 'flocked' to this idea ! 2. She taught the Resurrection, as a soul work, in, as well as out of the body, in opposition to the mere physical resurrection. What millions have already 'flocked' to this door of escape from error! 3. She taught and practiced, as have her followers ever since, intercommunication between this and the spiritual world ! Since 1848, the number so believing, have 'flocked' to this truth from a few thousands to more than hvelve millions ! 4. Concerning Hell and Heaven, Ann Lee even testified they were conditions, that merited similar associations, here and hereafter ; and was ever pronounced in the truth of a state of probation hereafterâ€”to an unlimited extent. But having stated this much, and viewing the millions now 'flocking to this door,' we will stop for the present, with the re- mark, that we have more 'doors' for more millions 'to flock to,' and the end is not yet!
