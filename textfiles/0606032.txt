Epitome of Spiritualism, Etc. : Herein we have an octavo pamphlet of about 100 pages written in a fair, pleasing and excellent manner; full of anecdotes, good advice and sound philosophy, concerning this age of spiritualistic phenomena. Some of the anecdotes we are perfectly surprised at, if they can be true. The method and philosophy of dealing with mediums, re-incarnation, materializations, etc., we are happy to indorse. Though the author's name is withheld, we suppose it to be Rev. W. I\ Evans. Colby &amp; Rich, Publishers, Boston, Mass. Am. Phren. Journal: Among our exchanges, we single this as superlative among the monthlies. Since the death of the lamented Wells, it seems to have lost none of its enterprise ; but to add to its former celebrity, a determined spirit to be ' Excelsior ' in reality. The May number is the best ever issued. The spirit of S. R. W. must look down with genuine pride and satisfaction upon the conductors of the A. P. J. and Science of Health. We salute them. The Laws of Life : Published at Dansville, N. Y., has no superior in its line. It has taken its stand on a very firm basis; and while its arguments are sound, their practical results of cure to the curable evidenced at ' Our Home on the Hillside,'' are fruits which are undeniable by any. Poisonous drugs are abominated. 'Ceasing to live evil and learning to live well,' seems to be the medicine prescribed by The Laws, and the practice of those who publish it, with the patients who come under their influences. We know whereof we speak, when we say the ' The Laws of Life ' is a most valuable paper, and ' Our Home ' a very pleasant place to live, either sick or well. We have had sent us a sample of Noyes' Hand Werder, a triangular tool with handle. We have seen the claw weeder, but this is worth a dozen claws at about the same price. We advise our people to send 25 cents and get a sample â€” there will be no regrets. Albert Noyes, Bangor, Me.
