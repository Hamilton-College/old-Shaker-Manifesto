TRUTH FRANCIS S. SMITH If you have a truth to say, Say it always, come what may. Say it firmly—do not fear— Error flies, when truth is near. When vile slander stalks abroad, Backed by trickery and fraud, He who fears to speak his mind, Is no friend to human kind. Speak the truth whate'er betide, Though your enemies deride, They will have a feeling strong That you are right, and they are wrong But do not purchase sure remorse By using language blunt and coarse— Truth rages not—she shows her might In words both simple and polite. Speak the truth and take the risk— Truth is real, not a myth. It is certain that a lie Will expire—truth cannot die. Oh! 'tis pitiful to see The sickly shade of misery That marks the dastard liar's face When truth has published his disgrace. Speak the truth, and then you can Undaunted face your fellow-man. Truth seeks no hiding-place, for she Is honest, fearless, frank, and free. Truth had her birth where angels dwell, While the first liar was born in hell. Then, honor, virtue, reason, say, Which of the two should man obey? N. Y. Weekly.
