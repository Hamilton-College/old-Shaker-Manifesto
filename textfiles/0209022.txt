Society Record Hancock, Mass. Passing through Hancock recently, we were pleasantly surprised at her improved appearance. Always neat, she now looks beautiful. Meeting-house modernized ; the antiquated, elevated aqueduct by the roadside is no more; beautiful stone fences, with posts and boards above; large permanent gates, painted red, and fastened by spring padlocksâ€”all looked rejuvenating. Very likely her people are being illustrated as those consecrated souls who ' put their hands to work, and give their hearts to God.' Festus Miller Died, at Hancock, June 26, Festus Miller , aged 70.
