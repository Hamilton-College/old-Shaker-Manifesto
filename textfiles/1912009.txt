Religion is founded upon love to God... Religion is founded upon love to God. God's love for us, is proved daily. He seeks to impress us w ith his spirit of love and tenderness, which also leads us to love one another tveu as he has loved us. This love is selfsacrificing, forbearing, merciful and forgiving. It sanctifies the whole life, and extends its influence over those around us. M. Patrick.
