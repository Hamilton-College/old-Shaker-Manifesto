Ladies' Home Journal In an historical article recalling the destruction of our National capital by the British forces in 1814, Clifford Howard in the July Ladies' Home Journal will show that Dolly Madison, the most beloved and popular woman of her day, was courageous and fearless in the face of grave danger. In the mad stampede from Washington, that preceded the invasion by the British troops, Dolly Madison was the last to seek safety in flight, and her final act before quitting the White House, as the enemy advanced, was to seize the Declaration of Independence and carry it to a place of safety. As the White House was immediately afterward looted and burned by the British, Mr. Howard declares that but for brave Dolly Madison the priceless parchment would have been destroyed.
