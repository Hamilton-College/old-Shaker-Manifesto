OUR FAITH. Chancy Dibble. It is our faith that all the revelations from the heavenly world to mankind have been given for the special purpose of redeeming the race. That the allwise Parent has purposed to establish, on earth, a home for his people. This home cannot exist without the combined efforts of both ordeis of humanity, man and woman. The holy spirit of truth the comforter of which Jesus spake, whom the world could not receive, signified the Second appearing of Christ in and through the female order, constituting the mother spirit in the work of redemption. As woman was instrumental in causing sin and sorrow, so should inspiration operate through her to restore innocence and happiness. This faith has come through authentic revelation approved by our highest intellect. It is a componant part of our faith which has grown stronger with our growth as a people. We should be lost in doubt, in regard to our future destiny, should we lose sight of the merciful attribute of Mother in Deity. The plan of redemption would be imperfect without a clear manifestation through her spirit. We are aware that this view has to contend with old established theology. The idea that woman.
