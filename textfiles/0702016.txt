Resignation MARIAN PATRICK I would be meek of heart, of humble mind, Not anxious, but to all things here resigned; Seek the straight path, and follow heaven's Lord, Measure my motives by his sacred word. Be pure in spirit, and of low estate, Those truly serve who only stand and wait. With charity, I'll spy my neighbor's sin, And when I judge, I'll turn an eye within. Indwelling pride shall not God's temple taint, Inspired with strength, not in the right to faint, Nor murmur at my lot, whate'er befall, I'll summon patience, and so bear it all. I would not be discouraged when sorely tried, By tribulations here I must be purified. Only a little season can they last,â€” I'll think of glory when these scenes are past.
