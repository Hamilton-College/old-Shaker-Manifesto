LOVE'S ENDURANCE MARIA L. SCHULTZ Trial makes us brave and strong, Suffering makes us stronger; Faith endures the trial long, Love the suffering longer. Ills which 'tis our lot to share, Faith will kindly help us bear, But the ills we cannot cure, Love will help us to endure. Death hath agonies its own, Life hath sorrows greater ; Miseries which sin alone Is the chief creator. We can bear them, if we will Faith will kindly help us still; But the pains we cannot cure, Love will help us to endure. Human hearts go down the way, Pausing, but to borrow Wisdom from their grief to-day, Comfort for their sorrow. Disappointment, trouble, care, Faith hath kindly helped them bear, But the griefs they could1 not cure, Love hath helped them to endure. Be for worthiness — our prayer — Of such sweet assurance ; God be praised for faith to bear, Praised for love's endurance. God forbid that doubt of heart Ever should bid faith depart ; Thus the ills which have no cure, Love will help us to endure. Canaan, N. Y.
