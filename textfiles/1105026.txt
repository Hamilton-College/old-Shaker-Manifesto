NEVER KILLED A BIRD 'Thanks that I can say that I have never killed a bird. I would not crush the meanest insect that crawls upon the ground. They have the same right to life that I have ; they received it from the same Father, and I will not mar the works of God by wanton cruelty. 'I can remember an incident in my childhood which has given a turn to my whole life and character. I found a nest of birds in my father's field, which held four young ones. They had no down when I first discovered them. They opened their little mouths as if they were hungry, and I gave them some crumbs which were innrv pocket. Every day I returned to feed them. As soon as school was done, I would run home for some bread, and sit by the nest to see them eat, for an hour at a time. They were now feathered and almost ready to fly. When I came one morning I found them all cut up into quarters. The grass round the nest was red with blood. Their little limbs were raw and bloody. The mother was on a tree,and the father on the wall, mourning for their young. I cried myself, for I was a child, I thought, too, that the parents looked on me as the author of their miseries, and this made me still more unhappy. I wanted to undeceive them, I wanted to sympathize with and comfort them. When Heft the field they followed me with their eyes and with mournful reproaches. I was too young and too sincere in my grief to make any apostrophies. But I can never forget my feelings. The impression will never be worn away, nor can I ever cease to abhor every species of inhumanity toward inferior animals.'â€” Memoirs of Ghanning. And Cowper beautifully chimes in here : '' Let us love mercy, And teach our sons to love it, too ; Remembering, that he who shows none, Being ripe in years, and conscious Of the outrage he commits, Shall seek it, and not find it In his turn.' And again ; ' Mei'cy to him who shows it, Is the rule and righteous limitation Of its act, by which heaven moves In pardoning guilty man !'
