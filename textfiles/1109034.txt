Wash for Fruit-trees A correspondent of the Rural Messenger has had good results from the application of lime, woodashes, and old iron put around the roots of fruit-trees that were not doing well, thus restoring the trees to a healthy condition and improving the quality of the fruit. As a wash for mossy trees he gives the following: Heat an ounce of sal-soda to redness in an iron pot and dissolve it in one gallon of water, and while warm apply it to the trunk. After one application the moss and old bark will drop off and the trunk will be quite smooth. All soils are improved by mixing. The physical properties of the soil have an important influence upon its average fertility. The admixture of pure sand with clay soil produces an alteration which is often beneficial, and which is almost wholly mechanical. The sand opens the pores of the clay and makes it more permeable to the air.
