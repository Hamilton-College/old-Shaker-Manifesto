IMMORTALITY. [The following is claimed to be the oldest poem in existence, with the exception of the book of Job. Translated from the Sanscrit by Dean Wilman.] [Contributed by Geneveve De Graw.] Ne'er was the time when I was not, Nor thou nor yonder kings of earth. Hereafter ne'er shall be the time When one of us shall cease to be. The soul within its mortal frame Glides on through childhood, youth And age. Then in another form renewed, Renews to stated course again. All indestructible is He tliat spread The living universe; And who is lie that shall destroy The work of the Indestructible. Corruptible these bodies are T That wrap the everlasting soul, The eternal, unimaginable soul. Whence on to battle Bharata? For lie that thinks to slay the soul Or he that thinks the soul is slain, Are fondly both alike deceived. It is not slain, it slayetli not; It is not form, it doth not die; Past, present, future knows it not; Ancient, eternal and unchanged It dies not with the dying frame. Who knows it incorruptible, And everlasting and unborn. What heeds lie whether lie may slay Or fall himself in battle slain? As their old garments men cast off Anon new raiment to assume, So casts the soul its worn-out frame And takes at once another form. The weapon cannot pierce it through Nor wastes it the consuming fire; The liquid waters melt it not, Nor dries it up the parching wind. Impenetrable and unburned; Impermeable and undried; Perpetual; ever wandering, Firm, indissoluble, permanent, Invisible, unspeakable. Selected.
