Narcoossa, Florida July 28, 1896. A rainy season commenced with the first of May and continued until the second week in July. From Feb. 28, until April 28, there was no rain, but two or three light showers. We again desire rain Our watermelons have amply supplied us; peach trees have put forth three, four and five branches, two feet and over in length, with an overstock of latterals we took off, and all these since Dec. 25th. The blossoming pine with its great bayonet green leaves reaching to your shoulder is a marvel of beauty when the thick scarlet bud begins to peep into the light and spread out the strong leaves like a vase. There are about fifty apples, and one hundred and fifty young plants; these plants are worth thirty cents apiece. Before this greets you the increase will be five fold. Let me seepotatoes, peaches, melons, pineapples, rice, milk, and eggs are already a success under our care and by the blessing of God. Climate is perfect, and our health in a general way corresponds with our courage and hope. We are all, in a sense, exiles and feel the sepaiation from associations that were dear and pleasant, but on the whole, this land is a 'Promised Land' and no mistake. One other, and the greatest blessing we have, is a knowledge of the Gospel of Christ. Andrew Barrett.
