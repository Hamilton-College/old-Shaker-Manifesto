THE WORK OF TO-DAY. [Contributed by M. Witham.] To shun the world's allurements, To bear my cross therein; To turn from all temptation, To conquer ev'ry sin. To linger calm and patient, Where Duty bids me stay; To go where God may lead me, This is my work to-day. I think not of to-morrow, Its trials, or its tasks, But still with child-like spirit For present mercies ask. With each returning morning I cast old things, away; Life's journey lies before me, My prayer is for 'to-day.' Selected.
