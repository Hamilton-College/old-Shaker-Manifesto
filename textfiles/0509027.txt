PEACE Pause, gentle angel, o'er us now, And spread thy wings divine, Let every heart in reverence bow Before thy sacred shrine. We'll bless thee ever, angel Peace, With us, make thy abode, To thee our love will never cease, For thou art born of God. Oft do we come to thee, fair one, To seek thy heavenly aid ; Thy pearly gates to us unfold, And glories that ne'er fade. We'll praise thee ever, angel Peace, For works, both great and good, O may thy mission never cease, Thou loved one of our God. We grasp the wealth that will endure, Such crowns as angels wear; Immortal treasures, that are pure, And joys the ransomed share. We'll honor thee while here below We tread this earthly sod ; All hail! sweet Peace —blest messenger — Thou angel sent of God. The angry waves upon life's sea, At thy command are still; The fiercest storms that there may be, Are silenced by thy will. O, heavenly Peace forever reign, Thy influence spread abroad; Till earth shall from thy spirit gain The love a«d power of God. Genevera De Graw, Sonyea, N. Y.
