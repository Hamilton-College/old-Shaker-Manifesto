TRUST A BOY During the session of the late Episcopal convention in Boston, the Bishop of Louisiana, in crossing the Common, met a boy, whose face he fancied, and, calling to him, asked him if he had any thing to do just then, to which he said no. ' Are you a good boy 1' The little fellow scratched his head and replied : ' I am not a very good boy. T cuss a little sometimes.' That candid answer inspired the bishop with confidence, and he then said, after giving his name and address: 'I want you to go to a certain place and get a bundle for me and bring it to my hotel.' There will be a charge of eight dollars. Here is the money to pay it, and half a dollar which you will keep for doing the errand.' On his return to the hotel, the bishop's friends laughed at him for his credulity, telling him that he would never see the boy or the bundle or the money again ; but in half an hour the young chap returned, bringing the bundle and a receipted bill for eight dollars and a-half, the bishop having made a slight mistake as to the amount that was due. ' How did you manage to pay the extra half dollar?' he inquired. ' I took the money you gave me for the job. I knew that you would make it all right.' And ' all right ' it was made, and I have no doubt that the confidence that was reposed in that boy, because of his truthfulness, will do him good as long as he lives.â€”Bishop Glarlc.
