Dear children:--pray without ceasing... Shaker Station, Conn., March, 1893. Dear Children:�'Pray without ceasing.' To pray without ceasing is to constantly cherish a heartfelt desire to be led in the paths of purity and truth. The power and strength of habit is often not realized. By cultivation or indulgence all habits are strengthe ed. If you cultivate only pure thoughts, sinful desires can never find a place in your hearts. Bad deeds can be developed only from bad thoughts. Fast and strong bad habits grow, swift they lead to grief and woe. By yielding to sin you may sell your birthright. Spiritual death awaits you in a life of sin. You must pay in suffering for every departure from right. A temptation resisted gives added strength to resist the next one. Be on the watch when the tempter assails. ' 'Praying always with all prayer.'' How can you pray always? By ever cultivating a humble, prayerful spirit. Humility and watchfulness yield peaceful fruits of righteousness. Oh the comfort, the blessedness of prayer. Heartfelt prayer is alone acceptable. Prayer and watching will bring cheerfulness of heart and restf ulness of spirit. 'Prayer in all things�great and small things.' To act with a pure intention, and with reference to the will of God, is the best of all prayers. Practicing that which i's pure makes you so in daily life. Build on virtue and you Avill be strong, watch and pray and overcome wrong. Die to sin. Make sure of heaven. Strive for the crown unfading. Improve what each hour brings to you of duty and of privilege. Duties not performed cause loss of happiness. The path of duty is plain. Walk therein. Your Brother, D. ORCUTT.
