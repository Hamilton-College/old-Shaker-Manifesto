Brave Words from a State Official Dear Editor: It was with extreme pleasure that I read in a late number of The Shaker, an article from the pen of Elizabeth H. Webster, setting forth the true elements of Christianity in 'The Fruitfulness of the Divine Life.' I testify her words to be correct; it is fruits of Christianity that we want—a love that worketh no evil to a neighbor. However many graces Ave may have, without the possession of Christian love all will be of no avail. But how little do we find of it among even the representatives of religion in our city—ministers, who preach and pray eloquently, but of whose effects I am led to exclaim, 'Who will show us any good? ' My soul is starving for something pure and good, that is not tinctured with egotism, or with a 12 THE SHAKER,. love of popularity. The churches in this city are, as a general thing, places of fashionable resort; from which every lover of truth and of sound theology turns away. * * * I have lived to see three-score years, and I can of a truth say, I never have found true peace and joy in any nor all sensual practices. * * * I wish I could set forth to you the beauty I found in that article of Sister Elizabeth's. It is full of truth and encouragement to those who are seeking for a higher life and a happiness above this world's possessions. * * I have been acquainted with the Shakers for many years, and have spent the happiest hours of my life in their company. I was very much blest in your article on ' Would you be a Shaker?' It was so much to the point, explaining in a plain and logical manner the true merits of Shaker life, and the good reasons for embracing the same. * * I have been for thirty years a State officer in Massachusetts, and am happy to subscribe myself as a reader of your invaluable paper—The Shaker. Go on, dear brother. D. S. Boston, Jan. 12, 1877
