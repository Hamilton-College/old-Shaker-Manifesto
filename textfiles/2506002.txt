GOD IS EVERYWHERE. By Lucy S. Bowers. Beneath the sod what wondrous treasures lie! What substances of beauty and delight! And how man seeks them with his mind and might. Deep beds of gems, so pleasing to the eye ; Diamonds whose brilliance no glitter can outvie, And rubies glowing with a crimson light; Emeralds dipped in spring's new verdure bright, And sapphires decked with drapery of the sky, The topaz blazoned with the golden gleam ; And like the blushes of the morning beam Behold the purple amethyst so fair, Who tinctured this deep hidden dust? who wrought The lucid drop? 'Twas God. His power and thought Are truly manifested everywhere. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
