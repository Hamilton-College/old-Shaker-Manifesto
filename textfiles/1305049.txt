MR. HEAPHY'S GHOST In compliance with the emphatic recommendation of Hon. L. C. Draper, of Wisconsin and a numerous list of correspondents, we have issued in pamphlet form, the remarkable account of spirit visitation published in last week's Journal under the title of Mr. Heaphy's Ghost. It is now printed on heavy tinted paper, making a neat tract for general distribution and preservation; and will be sent to any address at 5 cents for a single copy, ten copies for 25 cents, twenty-five copies for 50 cents. It is a splendid thing to scatter among your friends.
