Center Family Dec. 1893. Winter has begun. We are not as fully prepared for it as desirable, still can not complain seeing much has been accomplished. Our farmer deacon has made quite an alteration in the corn barn which we think will prove to be a substantial improvement. The change consists in having stanchions that swing around giving the animals greater liberty of movement of the heads. They are also supplied with pure, fresh water while in the stall. This being Sabbath day we of the Center family attended meeting at the Church and had an interesting season. Several speakers gave voice to sentiments that were profitable and instructive and many if not all present felt it good to be there. 18 THE MANIFESTO. Our religious gatherings should always be of an uplifting nature to those assembled. 'Gather my saints together they that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.' We make sacrifices with the idea of leaving the inferior and ignoble for the superior and noble, the lower for the higher; hence, we leave the world with its selfishness and wrong-doing for a right manner of life, and to all who wish for a better condition of things than obtains in t!;e world we say, 'Come, and let him that heareth say come, and whosoever will let him partake of the waters of life freely.'
