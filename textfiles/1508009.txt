LONG LIVE THE MANIFESTO. S. Good morning, little Manifesto ! How do you prosper ? M. Pretty well, I thank you, still I am feeling somewhat sad now in anticipation of my future destiny. S. Your future destiny child? It seems to me that you are too young to talk of destiny. Why, if I mistake not, you are only fourteen years of age, and consequently very immature. Pray, why are you so depressed ? M. I am young, indeed, but I have reason to fear that I shall not survive long, if the various rumors concerning me prove realities. You are aware that tliere have been attempts all through my checkered life to dwarf my growth, and it is very evident that I am not popular with the world. Some persons even recommend premature death to me as emblematical of early piety, quoting that, ' Whom the gods love, die young.' Some frankly state that the mission fund is low and that my expenses already form quite an item on the money record. Others claim that few persons abroad read the unique doctrines that I am trying to disseminate. I am painfully aware that I am scornfully treated by the majority of unpro- gressed minds, am often thrown into some dark corner where dust, soot and tobacco smoke 'do congregate.' am imprisoned for months with that objectionable literature called, 'yellow covered, ' and my only solace is that I am not of them though dwelling so near. Happily at most Societies of Believers I receive marked attention. My pages are read and my theories discussed to profit. At some special localities, however, I find it hard to get the amount of mental stimuli that I need though I can find a good lodging anywhere. If what one modern writer states is true, then I need not wonder it is thought that I shall die young ; just read ;ï¿½'Literature of a higher order is universally neglected in this age. The most profound treatises upon scientific, moral and religious subjects are allowed to grow dusty on the shelves of libraries and book-stores, while the details of criminal courts, incidents of prize fights, baseball games, etc., are read with avidity. ' This statement does not console me, in the least, but if I die it may be in a good cause. S. Poor little Innocent. You have our warmest sympathy and we assure you that there is a better time coining. Why, you may well be termed our modern David who with the little missiles of truth will yet be able to slay the giants of selfishness, animalism and sordid Ignorance. The quotation, 'Whom the gods love die young' is a mythical one in value and therefore unworthy your thought, for your God is the God of the living, you being his agent, should never die. Did you never hear the parable in the New Testament, of the woman, who put a little leaven into three measures ot meal and the whole was leavened? And of the mustard seed which is the smallest of all seeds, and which grew to the proportions of a tree ? Just so we predict your mission will increase and expand in usefulness though you resemble the mustard seed in diminutiveness. Young though you are, you represent the moral and spiritual status of more than a dozen hoary headed Communities that have survived the storms of a hundred Winters and the intense heat of as many Summer suns without disintegration or decay. It is from these sources that you must continue to draw your life. You are destined to become one of the most active Teachers of our youth who are to perpetuate the Testimony. To teach them that theirs is to be more than a mere muscular Christianity, only exercising the muscles in doing good, but that with you and for your special mission the brain, the organ that acts for the living soul must be equally tasked by reading, thinking, writing, talking and acting agreeably to the high profession which it is your duty to promulge. Take our suggestions, if you please and remember that our sympathies are enlisted in your behalf. Kindly ever, Asenath C. Stickney. Canterbury N. H. Apr. 1885.
