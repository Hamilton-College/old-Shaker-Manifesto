Moth Preventive .â€”A correspondent of the Furniture Gazette commends the following remedy for exterminating moths in carpets and furniture. After some years of experience with the troublesome pests, says the writer, I found a sure preventive of moths in pitch paper, the same as roofers use. The moth will live and grow on cayenne pepper and tobacco, while I could never see that the use of these articles kept the moth miller out The plan for the furniture dealer or housewife is to cut the paper in slips and place about the room, under and behind sofas, chairs etc. This should be done as early as the middle of April, and in warm climates earli. er. If the dealer wishes to make parlor suits moth proof he should place on the inside of backs of chairs and seats small strips of the pitch paper, and rest assured that the miller will not select these places to deposit eggs. It is the miller that is the foundation of all the mischief.
