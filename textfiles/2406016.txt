Beloved Elder Henry;�It is such a busy time I thought you would accept the Home Notes this time from a little girl twelve years old: and besides we have taken note of some things of interest we would like to tell you about, which perhaps older people would overlook. Having so early a spring, we thought we would write the date of the arrival of the birds as they came, that next year we might compare dates and see if the early coming of the birds denotes an early spring and then we shall know what to expect. Bluebirds were first heard the sixth of March, robins the eleventh, song sparrows the fifteenth. A pretty little brown singing bird which I have not yet learned the name of, came the second of April, phaebe birds the fourth, the hair bird or chipping sparrow the tenth, and the martins the nineteenth. The beautiful oriole came yesterday, the sixth, but the swallows, yellow birds, mocking birds and many others are yet to come. We picked the first little yellow coltsfoot flower on the eighth of April, and dandelions peeped out from among the green grass in sunny places the third week of April. Cherry trees were in blossom on the thirtieth of April and now the plum, pear, peach and even apple trees are in bloom and it is but the seventh of May; earlier, people say, than since the year 1878. On the tenth of April we had a pleasant flowery entertainment. Our family dwelling being heated by steam, plants can be kept in any of our windows without freezing, so there are flowers in the sunny windows all winter. This spring some one thought it would be pleasant to gather them together before putting them into the ground for the summer, so that all could enjoy their beauty. The young Sisters arranged them in the form 'of a bank eight feet high, nine feet wide and seven feet through. There were callas, six kinds of roses, fifteen kinds of geraniums, fuchias, oxalis, begonias, Zanzibar balsam, feverfew, ageratum, besides several foliage plants. In the evening the Brethren and Sisters gathered into the well lighted chapel where they were, and many said it seemed like heaven. We had singing, reading, and speaking of sentiments suitable for the occasion. Katie Wells. TERMS. THE MA NIFES TO. 141 North Family. May, 1894. Ix the multiplicity of cares and burdens incident to the season Brethren sometimes fail to appear with their most excellent themes in the department of 'Home Notes' as was the case last month. There is something wholesome and cheery in the intercommunication thus established between our Societies, it serves as a mental visit 'around east' and 'out west;' and in our growing relation and acquaintance, it seems suggestive of a more thoughtful and helpful means of stimulating one another to higher aims and nobler purposes along the lines of mental, moral and spiritual culture. It is so natural for us to settle down in our own cozy homes, content in the performance of our daily duties and the acquisition of creature comforts. What of our efforts in the missionary line? What of our social and ethical improvement and the giving of our minds to study the principles and doctrines of the Church to which we profess membership? Are we reaching out in prayerful aspiration, to help souls who are seeking to know and practice the truth? and are we prepared to minister to such, the power of salvation, and give them sure guidance in paths of purity and virtue? Coming in contact with the world we should let our light so shine that they may see our good works, and be convinced that we are closely following the Master, instead of being influenced by the elements that savor of the generative life. Souls are awaking to a knowledge of the benefits of association on the plane of altruistic love and purity. It is interesting to learn of the movements on the Pacific coast, in Australia and in other places which tend toward the gathering of the saints together, those who are willing to make a covenant with God and with each other, by the sacrifice of all selfish desires and worldly gains for mutual benefit and growth in the divine life. It is the religious element in human nature combined with enlightened reason, that builds up and sustains the communistic home, where equality, justice and peace are maintained. It is according to Elder Frederic's prophecy, that the next movement and awakening of the spirit would not result so much in the accession of members to the older Societies, as it would lead to the forming of new associations, with the same basic principles as a sure foundation on which to build, but with the increase and progress belonging to our own day and time. Yet when there is 'a call or cry from Macedonia, come and help us,' shall we send two or more disciples to prepare the way and make straight paths for their feet to walk in? It hardly seems probable at present, that the labors of a hundred years will be sacrificed for any great exodus of the faithful to foreign lands, or even to far off coasts of our own beloved continent, as is frequently suggested. We have only the fruits of our hard earned labors, as no funds are poured in our coffers with which to build 'The New Jerusalem,' or any other impossible venture, and above all let us not run in debt, for aught we have, or aught we attempt to do. We are interested in all that tends to ameliorate wrong conditions among mankind. In the Peace Movement we recognize a quiet but potent influence surely working for the abolition of war. In Hygienic Reform, a testimony against disease and animalism, which is sure to benefit and uplift the race. In the Land Agitation, the solution of human rights and a just settlement in the future of the claims of humanity. In the Temperance Cause, the abolition of one of earth's direst curses. In the Social Purity and White Cross associations, one of the most important leadings toward a better moral state. The 'Self-Improvement Society' in our home, has prepared papers on most of these subjects, which have given them food for mental exercise; some of them have appeared in different periodicals. 142 THE MANIFES TO. As it is an age of reading, and we want the highest toned and best literature, we can recommend as a monthly magazine, 'The Arena,' B. 0. Flower, Ed. As a spiritual paper, none can excel Lucy Mallory's 'Advance Thought.' 'Food Home and Garden,' Henry Clubb Ed. an earnest advocate of food reform. Many excellent papers come to our home, more than we have time to read, considering our busy life. Mount Lebanon is in its height of beauty and lov eliness; no drawbacks as yet, to the unusually early spring. The new pear and plum orchard has been set out and seems to be doing well; currant and raspberry slips also. The apple orchards are in fine condition, the trees having all been trimmed; they promise a fine show of bloom. Sweet cherry trees in bloom the last of April; dwarf sour cherry trees look like drifts of new fallen snow. It is marvelous what a change has been wrought, iu field, garden and door-yard in the space of three weeks; surely God's blessing attends the labor of consecrated hands. The Sisters have plenty of shirt work at present; sewing is interspersed with housecleaning. It is announced that Public meeting will be opened next Sabbath; we continue the exercises that have been a peculiar feature of Believers' religious services in times past. With renewed zeal and interest for our Zion cause, we extend loving greetings to gospel friends. Martha J. Anderson. Watervliet, N. Y. North Family. May, 1894. The history of South Union that has been published in serial articles in The Manifesto, is quite a social treat for which we are duly thankful. It enables one to niore fully understand the trying times that our dear Brethren and Sisters in the South passed through; but fortunately now can be recorded as history. The saying that the 'Lord helps those �who help themselves,' is fully proven in ;he labors of the little family at the North who, since their removal to this Society have been anxiously, and with a prayerful spirit laboring to bring order out of the seeming necessary confusion incident to moving. Thanks to willing hands and loyal souls the consummation of their desires has been largely realized. While feeling some tribulation in moving from the old home, we fully believe that there was a spiritual gift in the move, and that the closer communion of Believers will result in a fuller and deeper spiritual ministration that will go forth to those who are honestly and earnestly seeking the higher life. Labor on the farm and garden is progressing as fast as the season permits. April giving us a taste of March weather, but in the latter part of the month some real April showers that caused the pastures and meadows to put on their garments of green. We are enjoying at present a season of good health. Spiritually, we are laboring to keep alive the gifts of the Spirit, to be placing a treasure where the destructive elements of earth life can not affect them. Hamilton DeGraw. Shaker Station, Conn. May, 1894. 'Let the peace of God rule in your hearts and be ye thankful.' The peace of God, which true crossbearing brings, gives joy, even in tribulation and the deepest affliction. 'Peace like a river.' We should be thankful for virtuous companions; for the comforts of a gospel home and social life, and for religious privileges and spiritual blessings that can not be measured. Offering thanks is acceptable to God. It is befitting that we join unitedly in special thanksgiving for the blessings of peace and salvation. Wisdom's path is peaceful and safe. Let us walk therein, and we shall be free from the reigning blight of sin. 'If we do ill, the joy fades, not the '1 HE MANIFES TO. 143 pains; if well, the pain doth fade, the joy remains.' No crown without the cross. ******* The limit of the capacity of the earth is 5,203,000,000 souls, says a Scientist, and this number will be reached in less than one hundred and eighty-seven years.' 'Glass in oven doors is a new contrivance, it enables cooks to watch the food without opening the doors.' 'Various attempts have been made to measure the rate at wliich electricity travels, and observers with delicate instruments have affirmed that it was not less than 114,000 miles per second.' The Brahma is a favorite breed of fowls with some poultry men, but not so profitable when thorough-bred as it is when crossed, that is, when the raising of chickens is an object in view. A profitable cross has been found between the Brahma and Leghorn. Daniel Orcutt. East Canterbury N. H. Weather Record for March, 1804.

Agreeably to promise, seed time has come, and the gardeners and farmers have been busily employed in the work of sowing and planting. The vegetable garden is receiving all due attention from the interested laborers, and we may well look forward with hope for the blessings that the earth will send forth. Already many varieties of plants are representing themselves above ground, very much to the pleasure of the gardeners. At the North family we saw, a few days since, a bed of beautiful strawberry plants and learned that some of the varieties were as early in fruitage as are those that grow in the fields. Elder Nicholas Briggs has also a nicely arranged trellis for grape vines, and has been very successful in obtaining many beautifully large and well ripened clusters in former seasons. An extended bed of onions attracted our attention, as their tops had reached an inch or more above the ground. This was specially interesting, as in former years so much labor has been expended unsuccessfully in the cultivation of this valuable plant. The panacea has come at last, in the liberal application of tar water, and with this the onion thrives beautifully, as all its ills and enemies are wholly destroyed. That nice lot of potatoes that wei-e taken into a warm room quite early in March, have sent out sprouts from one fourth to one inch in length, and to preserve these from harm, while being cut and planted, has required the utmost care. Now if the Weather Bureau looks upon them favorably for a few weeks, a bountiful crop may be anticipated so sure as day follows day. The Post Master at this Village, (Eldv r Nicholas Briggs,) has very kindly arranged with the officers of the Weather Bureau, so that we are now furnished with daily reports giving us reliable information of what the weather may be for the forthcoming day. This is one of the wonders of the age, and the knowledge becomes of great practical value, especially to those who till the land. This scientific statement which is brought to us every day, places the 'Old Farmers' Almanac' at quite a discount, as it does a multitude of self-styled weather prophets. Our pear, plum and cherry trees are now in full bloom and this wonderful outburst of blossoms is a beautiful sight. Even the flowers in the garden are asserting their rights at this early date and rivaling in beauty the tinting of the rainbow. The great and good Creator of the beautiful flowers, evidently saw from the beginning the great pleasure which the blending of these lovely colors, would give to the mind of man. God bless the flowers! H.
