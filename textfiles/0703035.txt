Dr. Hollock, in a late convention in New York... Dr. Hallock, in a late convention in New York, criticised the soundness of the doctrines which give to a dead hundred-millionaire a seat by the white throne, side by side with Jesus, whose life was spent in a diametrically opposite manner; and, measured by the standard in vogue with us, was no success, while the hundred-millionaire's was completely such. The truth is, that spiritualism and the life of Jesus are so simple, they become a stumbling-block to the Jews of to-day as they did to those of old, and there was no appositeness in the dying millionaire proclaiming, 'I can never lose my faith in fe~ sus.' Christianity only became corrupt when it became rich.
