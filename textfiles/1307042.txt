A BUSY BROKER'S BATTLE WITH LUNCH For quick eating go down into the Wall street neighborhood, is the advice of the experienced scribe of the Pittsburg Commercial-Gazette. The busy brokers don't waste minutes over their mid-day bites That was why an exception excited my interest. I saw an unusually hurried stock gambler in Delmonico's down town restaurant. He sat at a small table on which were a mutton chop, fried potatoes, bread and butter and a glass of ale, altogether making a meal of moderate size. His watch lay beside his plate with the case open, and he glanced at its face between mouthfuls, and yet, instead of hurrying he was eating with unusual deliberation, though his anxious regard for the flight of time was plain to be seen. 'I am not trying to eat fast,' he explained, stopping and leaning back. 'I am trying to do it slowly. My best record for a lunch of this size is six minutes. I was proud of it. I could pop out of my office, fill up, and be back at my desk inside of a quarter of an hour; but just as I got my system trained down to that point my doctor said I had got to throw away the profits of my skill or get measured for my coffin. You see this hurried why of eating brought on indigestion, and he ordered me to spend half an hour every day over my lunch. I sat down here at 12.20 and I musn't get up until 12.50. A great waste of time, isn't it? But it is a choice for me between time and eternity, and I am not ready for the latter yet.'
