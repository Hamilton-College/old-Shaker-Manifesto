Union Village, O. Feb. 3, 1893. We had quite a bleak cold winter for Southern Ohio, up to about the 2(&gt;th of January. Since then the regulation 'January thaw' has been on, and now the weather is about at the usual standard for our section of Country. The mercury reached 14 degrees below zero in our Village and 20 degrees below in Lebanon four miles distant. We are thankful to say we are in good general health. We are passing along quietly through the usual routine of duties common to a Union Village winterï¿½(viz.) feeding stock, sawing wood, hauling out manure, preparing medicines and running the school. I want to thank all the dear Eastern Brethi'en and Sisters who signed their full names to their contributions in the very interesting number of the Manifesto for February. It seemed to warm up the articles with a nearer feeling of love, friendship and good neighborhood. Now Elder Henry, let me ask in all solemnity and sincerity, what Society or even individual family of Believers is going to pioneer us into the Promised land of a more rational plan of eating and drinking, a land flowing with, not the luxury of animal food and foreign narcotic poisons, but the milk and honey of intellectual and spiritual enjoyment? It is a solemn fact, that the expense of living on animal food over that of food at first hand (fruits, cereals, vegetables) is in the surprising ratio of 40 tol! Just think of it! Howl wish 72 THE MANIFESTO. some enterprising family or Society would resolve to cease making grave-yards of their stomachs and undertake the sublime etherializing experiment of Daniel and his three Colleagues in Babylon. I should want to belong to that band of reformers if there should be but three of them. I don't mean that such should merely cease eating flesh, fish or fowl, but I mean that they should take all their diet at first hand and abjure the use of flesh, fish, fowl, milk, cream, eggs, butter, tea, coffee, whiskey, wine and tobacco; allowing however unfermented or sweet cider and the unfermented juice of any fruits or berries if desired. We should not only save the direct expense of the old kinds of food but the indirect expense of the wear and tear of the human machine in producing it, and the still greater one of Doctors' bills and the waste of time and toil of both nurses and sick patients. 'Hands at work and hearts to God' is a most excellent precept and its benefits cannot be too highly estimated. But my common sense teaches me that Mother never meant by that, that any man, much less any woman should be employed in physical drudgery from nine to sixteen hours a day and even at that never catch any nearer up with his or her work after all. This state of .things however we have brought upon ourselves. We are almost perfectly absorbed, engulfed, swamped so to speak, in temporal subjects and interests, to the exclusion of intellectual and spiritual thoughts, conversation and elevation of mind into the higher and holier regions of spiritual existence. Any one attempting to converse freely on these higher themes, is supposed to be 'getting good too fast' or going crazy. Why not, as you proposed years ago, all meet together somewhere and talk about these matters and see if some better status of physical, mental and above all, spiritual progress cannot be developed? For my part I am tired of wallowing around in a luxurious, almost voluptuous sink of expensive and hurtful 'riotous living,' with its attendant sickness, blasting and spiritual death. Now I guess I'll stop after that explosion of my true inwardness, and try to think about something more cheering. Oliver C. Hampton.
