MENTOR'S MAXIMS. [Contributed by Ernest Pick.] 'Moke love.' Take the apple for your symbol. Consider the time it takes, from the planting of the seed, to ripen the perfect fruit; and then it is only an apple, perishable in the same season, whereas the growth of the soul is eternal. When growing, or half grown, do not attempt to hasten maturity by throwing stones and sticks at the promising fruit. Education is for the child painful effort, hard work, conflict and suffering. Make happier him whom you would make better. Be yourself what you wish the child to be. Do not expect visible progress every single day, but remember the symbol and put yourself in the child's place. In Christ is hidden the wisdom to deal rightly with the stubborn, the impertinent, the lazy and the silly. Do not attempt to drive, but lead always. Never give a command, without seeing that it is performed in the proper manner. Let firmness be the border, wisdom the direction of your education, love be the means and end. Let not one offence pass unnoticed. Treat one with forbearance, another with kindness, some with wit and humor, others with cunning, firmness, reproof; others with fire and sword, but one and all with wisdomwithout passion. 'More love.'
