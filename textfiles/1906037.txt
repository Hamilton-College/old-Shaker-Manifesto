THE TONGUE. 'The boneless tongue, so small and weak, Can crush and kill,' declared the Greek. 'The tongue destroys a greater horde,' The Turk asserts, 'than does the sword.' The Persian proverb wisely saith 'A lengthy tongueï¿½an early death.' Or sometimes takes this form instead, 'Don't let your tongue cut off your head.' 'The tongue can speak a word whose speed, Says the Chinese, 'outstrips the steed.' While Arab sages this impart, 'The tongue's great storehouse is the heart. From Hebrew writ the maxim sprung, 'Though feet should slip ne'er let the tongue. The sacred writer crowns the whole, 'Who keeps his tongue doth keep his soul.' Selected.
