Harvard, Mass. July, 1895. When the mind is filled with good and pure thoughts, and the hands with pleasant work, time flies so unconsciously that we do not realize its flight till it is past. We live in a busy world, but whether good or bad depends on how we make it. Good lives show that we have found the happy side of this world, and speak the loudest in favor of a Christian life. We have been abundantly blessed with rain, and now if kind Nature will give us two or three weeks of sunshine we shall be doubly grateful. We had a good fulfillment of the promised seed-time; have had green peas, and other vegetables since the 20th of June. The drought injured our potatoes so they are unusually late this season. Now harvest time is at hand; our hay crop is better than we anticipated, though not equal to that of last year. We have not as large a crop of herbs as usual owing to the failure of the seed to germinate. We are raising no fruit at present. We ever strive to keep our hearts attuned with gratitude and prajer, and in obedience to tl;e commands of the apostle John, be like little children in loving one another. March, M. Hal lard.
