Union Village, O, Nov. 1897. After a long and painful drouth, which dried up our pastures and threatened to destroy all our wheat and barley prospects on the 1st of Nov. it began to rain moderately and about three inches of water have fallen, very much to our advantage � and comfort. On the 25th of Nov. we shall be able to render due thanks to our Heavenly Father for his mercy and kindness in this as in all other matters in which he has kindly noticed us during the present year. The greatest by far, of all these blessings, is the Gospel which enables us to walk in innocence and purity, as good Elder Matthew used to phrase it. I suppose that none are so unfortunate and unhappy, as those who having been blest with this unspeakable treasure have turned once more to the beggarly elements of the world. Let us hope that through this crucible of misery, they may eventually be restored to a better estate. Well�we are trying to carry the Institution along as nearly according to the principles of godliness as the conditions will allow, giving no license to anything we think would compromise these principles. Through joy or sorrow, what better can we do? We are repairing some, burning hedgebrush and trimming trees, and the young people have been on two or three expeditions into the woods for nuts. It is raining again this morning and our fall pastures will do nicely and our wheat and barley 'take root downward and bear truit upward,' with the blessing of the good Father and Mother of all upon it. So we are under heavy obligations to our Heavenly Parents, for so much blessing and let us not forget that he that is unthankful, is unholy. We have had no cholera among our stock so far this season, and it is all in fine condition. What a heavenly thing it is to forgive. No wonder our Savior insisted on it so strongly. When we forgive an injury it can give us no more pain, and will give the offending party a great deal of pleasure, besides exciting him to a radical reformation. It is such a blessed thing to forgive that I never need any apology for injuries;�I can always forgive without any such apology so far as I am concerned. 'Mercy is seasonable in times of affliction, as showers of rain in times of drouth.' What an invaluable blessing it is to be improving every moment of life in getting more and more imbued with charity and purity. I never felt so clear of the lower proclivities of our common nature in my life as now, still I must progress and persevere forever. If I should cease to grow my existence would become an unbearable stagnation and monotony. Mother Ann said,�'If I could, I would make all the world full of peace and happiness.' I feel just so myself. May The Manifesto float the glad tidings of Salvation to a rudimental and a needy world. Oliver C. Hampton.
