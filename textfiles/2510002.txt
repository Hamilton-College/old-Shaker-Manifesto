SELF CULTURE. By Lucy S. Bowers. Strive well for every fair, adorning grace, For healthful growth of body, soul and mind, For love, in which all beauty is combined. In true self-culture sin we may not trace, In lovely lives it has no part nor place. Who is so nicely molded soon will find His heart a source of good, rich and refined Revealed in brightness of his kindly face. Our heavenward walk another's steps may lead, In our sweet thoughts, another's peace is found, Our purity may guide another's deed, Our courtesies, in good to all abound. Self-culture is not selfish, 'tis sinless greed; Light in ourselves, sheds radiance around. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
