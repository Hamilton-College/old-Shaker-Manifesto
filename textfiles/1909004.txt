FROM PERRY'S PEAK, Louis Basting. There are few incidents of Scripture story so sadly impressive as that of Moses, the servant of God, standing on Nebo's lonely mountain and beholding the Promised Land before his eyes, doubly beautiful bv the vivid contrast of the barren desert behind him, yet not permitted to set his foot upon it, but called upon to die in the solitude of the hills, unaided by human sympathy and kindly offices in his last extremity. This was the reflection in the writer's mind as he stood upon Perry's Peak, one of the many prominent elevations in the Berkshire hills. It rises but a few miles to the west of Shaker Village ; the ascent is not very difficult and the outlook from the summit is graadly beautiful. When fortune has favored one with a bright day and a clear atmosphere, and you are provided with a good telescope and a substantial lunchbasket, you can spend the better part of the day there, looking, thinking, dreaming, rejoicing in the simple fact of living with a satisfaction long to be remembered. Perry's Peak rises to the height of 2400 feet above sea level, receiving its name from one of the early settlers of the last century ; it w.as also one of the stations of the U. S. Geodetic survey, the evidence of whose labors remains i 1 a tall signal staff. The partly wooded slopes of the mountain do not prevent an unimpeded view of the valley below. At our feet cluster the buildings of Hancock Shaker Village, the most striking among which is the Round Stone Barn, which in its solid massiveness as it rises from a rocky eminence, remindy one of grim Castle William in New York harbor; but no frowning guns look out from its embrasures and a peaceful weather-vane (which points the major part of the year to the northwest) takes the place of the proud stars and stripes. The smoke, that busily crowds up from a tall chimney in the grounds of the East Family, marks the location of an iron-ore mine, the product of which is shipped to the furnace at Chatham, N. Y., 20 miles away. Close by are the neat buildings of Shaker Station on the Boston and Albany R. R., one of the finest roads in the country, double tracked and kept in first-class condition. A short distance to the east looms up Shaker Mills, situated on a large tributary of the Housatonic river, which furnishes a powerful and unfailing water power. Here Brother Ira Lawson, the popular and energetic trustee of the Society, does a large business ; his monthly freight-bill for grain amounts to over $2000. Pittsfield, a village of 18000 inhabitants, occupies almost the center of the valley; around it cluster many manufacturing hamlets, which utilize every water-course, supplementing it by steampower. The range of vision is limited by the Hoosac mountains, here pierced by the world-famed tunnel, five miles long ; from their midst rises Mt. Greylock, 3500 feet high. Turning our gaze southward we behold the Blue Catskill mountains, the identical region of the immortal Rip Van Winkle's exploits. Through a gap in the hills we see a stretch of the noble Hudson river, and even as we look, a mighty tug-boat heaves in sight, towing a whole fleet of canal boats towards the great metropolis by the se^. Almost beneath our feet glisten the waters of Queechy lake, and upon one of the hills which cast their shadow into its bosom is a quaint group of pink-colored buildings, constituting Canaan, an outpost of Lebanon, where Brother Clark and Mldress Miriam are gallantly holding the fort. Broadly sweeping toward the west and north opens Lebanon valley, dotted with many villages and farm houses till it is lost among the lofty mountains of Vermont. But where is Mt. Lebanon, the parentSociety of all Zion ? We shift our point of observation somewhat to the north, and then on a broad shelf on the hillside we behold the five families of Lebanon. God bless Mt. Lebanon ! Beautiful for si'uation, spoken of throughout the world as a center of spiritual activity, may it long continue to be a true Jerusalem to every good Believer, and a city of refuge for many a sin-sick soul! The ground we have so rapidly sketched over is historic in the annals of America, and in the history of Believers. Over yonder road traveled in hot haste Parson Allen and the Pittsfield militia in 1778 to the help of their comrades at Bennington, which lies 25 miles away at the foot of that blue mountain. The chronicler records how on that memorable day the parson, true to his calling advanced alone to the fortifications which sheltered many tories whom he personally knew, and how he exhorted them not to fight against their country and their brethren, to become loyal citizens, etc. But his words were thrown away; for when they recognized him they cried, 'Let's pop the parson !' and fired upon him. Then the preacher's wrath waxed hot within him and he answered with the same sort of an argument, firing the first shot on the American side. That many storied hotel marks the site of Lebanon Springs, where Washington, Lafayette, and many other famous ones tarried for health and rest. This old-fashioned mansion is the birth-place of Samuel J. Tilden, Governor and almost President; his tomb is among the cypresses on yonder hill. Stockbridge, Lenox, Barrington, hidden away in deep valleys, bring to mind the names of Bryant, Holmes, Hawthorne, Sedgewick, Edwards, Warner, Field,�names known the world over. How grand this view, bounded by the Green mountains, the Hoosac, the Catskills, the Helderbergs, the Adirondack.? ! How beautiful the shimmering lakes, Pontoosuc, Onota, Richmond, Queechy, Mackiuac! How lovely in this smiling month of June this expanse of hill and valley, town and hamlet, lake and field, forest and meadow, all in green ! No wonder they come from the cities and pitch their tents in the valleys and build costly mansions upon the hilltops. But wandering over these Berkshire mountains one often comes across the ruins of former habitations, overgrown orchards, gaping wells, broken-down walls, and, most pathetic of all, perhaps some rudely sculptured marble slabs that mark the resting place of decaying mortality. Where formerly many thrifty fields and pastures supported a large population the land is now left to grow up to woods. There is as much good land to-day unoccupied in Massachusetts as is included in Oklahoma; and it can be had very cheap too. When the waste lands of the' west are once taken up and the restless spirits are compelled to settle down, the now-despised hill-sides of Berkshire will be sought out again to be forsaken no more. Meanwhile the land rests. And what a grand domain of fruitful land is in psssession of Believers ! As that sweet singer of Israel, Benjamin Moorehouse, who now sings tenor in the celestial choir, has it : 'And yet to many thousands more We such a home could give, If they would leave a carnal world, And learn for Christ to live.' But that is what they do not want to do. A tramp to whom every tree affords shelter and almost every house food, infinitely prefers his independence to the abundance and comfort of a Christian household where steady labor and orderly lives are required; and well-to-do people, not-with-standing all the vexation and cares they are complaining about, prefer them to the true liberty which is in Christ. How thankful we ought to be ! Blest a hundred-fold with houses and lands and faithful Brethren and Sisters, with exceeding great care ought we to preserve that precious gospel under whose life-giving influences Zion has grown and become beautiful. Lord Beacons- field sail that true progress consisted in returning to first principles. When the first order : 'Believers must not run in debt to the world,' was religiously kept, their temporal prosperity was very great: and when the chief principle�a virgin life in a Christian community� was rigorously and without compromise carried out, spiritual progress and growth in numbers were commensurate. The stream cannot rise higher than its source ; the disciple is not wiser than the Master. Never were people situated so favorably to practically realize the idea of the kingdom of heaven on earth. With a glorious heritage in a fruitful laud, where mosquitos are not and malaria is unknown ; with healthgiving breezes aud sparkling water from the hills ; where the choicest of apples and the sweetest corn, the most perfect potatoes and the most delicious strawberries, raspberries and currants, the toothsome bean and the fragrant onion, all unitedly testify of kind nature's abundance ; with the invaluable experience of more than a century to guide and direct ; with a free government in a free country ; with no one to molest or make afraid, having only ourselves and our still unregenerated natures to contend with ; having the cause of God for our own, and having heaven's daily blessing upon our-labors, how can we fail to carry to a successful termination the work so nobly begun ! The eyes of the world are upon us, and God will surely require his people to give an account of what use they have made of their privileges. Let us be helpful to each other; don't pull one against another. If the shell has grown too tight for comfort, learn of the clam, 0 fellow pilgrim ! and kick it off, and the Lord God will give thee another one more suitable for the present time. Go up on the mountains aud you will find that the higher you climb, the more the horizon widens. Hook on to some star aud sweep through the heavens, i.nd when you get back you will be better fitted and more willing to serve your brother and your sister. Don't stay in the old worn-out shell ; expand with your day and time ; adapt yourself to new conditions ; study to be able to meet the arguments of unbelievers and of worldly-minded people with enlightened reasoning ; let non-essentials go by the board ; but hold fast, 1 charge thee, forever and forever to those eternal principles of righteousness which must ever and always distinguish the .vutis and Daughters of Light from the children of this world.
