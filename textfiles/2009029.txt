NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. . JS'ortli If&amp;mily. 'O what beauty there is in thee Ziou, lovely Zion; May thy strength and honor be Of an untold weight from heaven.' Our visiting company are all at home, having enjoyed a very profitable season with gospel kindred in seven different Societies. We could but notice that in every Society and family they had something different from every other. A peculiar manifestation of the beautiful spirit of love; a special spiritual gift and ministration; and when these meet together in the spirit and testimony of Mother's gospel we have the music of the spheres. One feature of our journey was specially interesting to me; and that was the graveyards ; they show real progress of spirit, and a gradual growth of understanding. This may not have come about from our designing, but it has come. The disposing of the mortal remains of our loved ones, has in times past, and is now, calling forth a good deal of exercise of mind. In passing by our burying places, and also many which did not belong to our order, I felt as though we might make the institution called death very interesting and profitable to the living. Instead of costly attire, expensive caskets and monuments of stone ; or wooden marks and tall weeds and briers, neither of which have a savory effect upon the living or upon the departed loved ones, 1 would like to set apart a room in which to place the shadow of the person who has just passed through the vail, with name and age, when they came among Believers, and any points of their history that would be of interest to the rising generations. Take, for instance, the aged saint, Elder Timothy Eandlett, sitting in his chair, patiently waiting the boatman's call; his countenance full of goodness and love; what pleasant thoughts and feelings it would excite to go into a room adorned with such shadows. A grave-yard is to me a place of sadness, and if the graves were opened, it would be a place of horror and disgust. Bury the body decently and in a place where it will do good and no harm, level the ground and keep a record and plan of the same, but do not put up costly marble slabs, or anything else. The angels set us an example in the disposing of the body of Jesus. Let us follow it. The hay and grain harvest about completed which has been very good. We have cut over 300 tons of hay, and some 50 acres of grain. Rye and wheat were excellent; oats generally light. If our machines and tools are all put away in good order, it will save time and vexation when we need to use them again Potatoes very nice; and though there are some things rather scarce, we have enough to fill every reasonable heart with gratitude and thankfulness, and to exercise ourselves in kindly Christian love towards everybody. D. Offord. Soutli ITa/mily. Dear Editor :�Not long since we told how many potatoes we had planted; now we must tell how wonderfully they have yielded. We do not find any nicer ones in market. We got fifteen very large ones in one hill, and if other crops have failed us, the potatoes have not. I think we have gathered two bushels of blueberries while we usually have three times two bushels. We will be twice glad to resort to the New Hampsnire syrup this year as that was not a failure. Since our last shower we have not been too warm. Those who have trouble with table salt should try putting in one cup of corn starch, in eight cups of salt. The people of Mt. Lebanon have proved it and like the way as the moisture is done away with. We have not been obliged to stay at home one Sabbath day this season on account of the rain. We are quite fortunate, as all meetings are together one day in seven which seems like the proper thing to do, some of the speaking and singing is excellent as it tends to union; 'we must dwell together in unity.' S. A. C. Hancock, Mass. August 12, 1890. We always hail with gladness the arrival of the precious messenger, which comes to us usually so punctually, and so neatly appareled. Mentally we exclaim, God bless its able Editor and worthy contributors. Long may it live to herald God's truths. We think each successive number of the Manifesto surpasses in excellence the preceding one. The Editorials in each number are most valuable and instructive. The August No. contains several most interesting articles. Letter from Dr. Carl, Instrumental Music, and the beautiful sentences in 'Our Lord's Prayer' so ably treated, are, in our opinion, super-excellent. Notes about home we find very pleasant reading and always turn with avidity to them, for we are anxious to know how the dear friends in other portions of God's vineyard are prospering. Observing the absence of notes from our beautiful home in June and July numbers, and knowing that vacations were in order in these days of excessive heat we fancied that our note-collector might be enjoying a vacation. But lo! on receiving Aug. No. we were agreeably surprised to fiivl that one writer at least, still remained at home. Produce from our vegetable garden is abundant. Green peas and new Irish potatoes headed the list of esculents that covered our dinner table on the first ot July; which is something unusual in this section of country. Elder Louis must have t ngagt-d tli.� services of tact, skill and perseverance to have been so successful. He was wonderfully prospered in raising a large fluck of chickens until they became quite sizable, when a large number of them disappeared, having been destroyed by some rapacious anim.il. Most kinds of fruit are unpromising this season. Pears are a total failure. Apples lew. Plum trees altogether fruith.-s. Small fruits not plenty excepting the blackberry which seems to yield well. Looking from our window we can see busy hands engaged in gathering this variety of berry from a nice little briar patch that was planted two years ago last spring by our venerable father, Elder Albert, and has been mostly cared for by him since. Should he live until the coining October he will have been eighty years an inhabitant of this earth sphere. He is a model of industry, frugality and temperance and is, in the true sense of the word, a Christian. A colony of busy workers have quietly come, as it seems, with the intention of making a permanent settlement. They belong to the class that a son of Erin once described as having a hot fut, (foot.) At present they appear inoffensive and if left undisturbed, will, we trust, remain quite peaceable. They have reared quite a structure for themselves and we think are well satisfied with their location. They may have emigrated from Norway as they have selected a Norway Spruce in which to build their residence. Is this an omen, and if so, is it for good or ill? can you tell us? Before closing our note we must tell you how displeased we are with your change of position, for we greatly fear that duty will not call you in the direction of our home as frequently as heretofore, and we well know that home duties will not be neglected by you for pleasure seeking. We all sincerely wish that you might give us a call, we think you would find that Old Berkshire maintained well her reputation for beautiful scenery and healthful climate. J. L. Sweet. Enfield, Conn. 'To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heavens,' so the Bible tells us'. We cannot find a niore truthful saying, yet there are many people who live as though they believed it not, and never find out how true it is,. Still, it takes most of us a good many years to learn the 'time to every purpose,' and the 'season for everything.' The sooner we learn to apply this God-given principle in our daily lives, and make it our rule to be systematic in our daily occupations, the better it will be fcr all concerned. Our crop of hay is large and of good quality. Ensilage corn is doing well. Japanese buckwheat looks strong and vigorous. Jumbo strawberries were large and good, vines healthy. Tobacco dust when used liberally in hen's nests will free them from vermin. Nests that are mo'veable are convenient and quickly cleaned. Nothing is better ;for moulting fowls than ground oats, meat and bran mixed with milk. Wheat is excellent and helps to form muscle, something needed during the weakening process. Cool shade is essential while hens are moulting. It costs more to keep a poor old hen than a good young one, while the profits from the latter are three times those of the former. D. Orcutt. Elder John Whiteley of Harvard, Mass., and Elder Robert Aitken of Enfield, Conn., sailed on the 8th of August, for England, and will be absent about two months.
