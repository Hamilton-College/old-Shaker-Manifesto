Enfield, Conn. 'To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heavens,' so the Bible tells us'. We cannot find a niore truthful saying, yet there are many people who live as though they believed it not, and never find out how true it is,. Still, it takes most of us a good many years to learn the 'time to every purpose,' and the 'season for everything.' The sooner we learn to apply this God-given principle in our daily lives, and make it our rule to be systematic in our daily occupations, the better it will be fcr all concerned. Our crop of hay is large and of good quality. Ensilage corn is doing well. Japanese buckwheat looks strong and vigorous. Jumbo strawberries were large and good, vines healthy. Tobacco dust when used liberally in hen's nests will free them from vermin. Nests that are mo'veable are convenient and quickly cleaned. Nothing is better ;for moulting fowls than ground oats, meat and bran mixed with milk. Wheat is excellent and helps to form muscle, something needed during the weakening process. Cool shade is essential while hens are moulting. It costs more to keep a poor old hen than a good young one, while the profits from the latter are three times those of the former. D. Orcutt. Elder John Whiteley of Harvard, Mass., and Elder Robert Aitken of Enfield, Conn., sailed on the 8th of August, for England, and will be absent about two months.
