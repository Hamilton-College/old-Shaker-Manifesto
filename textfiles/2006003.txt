God bless the Mount of Lebanon, We say with one accord; Though mountains high divide us, We are one in the Lord. And while our souls with praise are filled, Our hearts with love replete; We ask the benediction,� God bless thee, Watervliet. Thou fair and smiling, valley, Where first our Mother came, And in her loving-kindness, called The blind, the halt and lame; Inviting all to come and share This consecrated ground, Where, by true self-denial; Salvation could be found. Unto this chosen spot she came, And with her little band; Through trying scenes she often passed, , Yet firmly did she stand. And with her little, faithful few, She did in sorrow toil; The gospel pure, that she might plant Upon this gospel soil. We see her stand beside the stream, In agony of soul, And in her bitter grief exclaim,� W nile tears of sorrow roll; 0, that the fowls of the air, The fishes of the sea; Yea, all things that have life and breath, Would pray to God for me. Blest Mother! may thy children, all, Within thy valley home; Give thanks to thee, unceasingly, Nor from thy precepts roam. But strive for universal love, And with unselfish prayer; Pray, God may bless and prosper, Fair Zion, everywhere. Watervliet, N. Y.
