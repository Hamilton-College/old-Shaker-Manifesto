A Tribute of Love. Anothee bright star has been taken from our mortal vision,: to join the redeemed on the other side of the river. Our good father has been a living example of what the gospel of Christ can, and will do for souls who make a full sacrifice and obey its principles. Having lived in the Society from early youth to extreme old age, he has been a Leader for many years, and as a Leader, was fearless in perf fining his duty and what he knew to be right. While he always bore a swift and sharp testimony against evil in every form, even to the last of his administration, yet his charity for the erring of the flock was unbounded. It was not only by precept he taught, but by example as well. Able pens may write eulogies to the departed, monuments may be reared to his memory, but to such as our good father, the greatest tribute will be the affectionate remembrance of his love and charity, by the flock he has left. As he often expressed it, the love of his Brethren and Sisters was more to him than anything the world could give. He was ever an honest and upright Shaker. He made a full sacrifice of time, talents and all he possessed that he might have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ. We trust he may be able, with those faithful souls who have passed over the river, to help us in this day of need. As a Minister, much of his time was spent at Watervliet, and he has many friends at the Valley who mourn his loss. We know he had a deep affection for the people at this place; but while we miss , his presence, we know our loss is his gain as his physical strength was failing under the weight of years. We can add, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.' Anon.
