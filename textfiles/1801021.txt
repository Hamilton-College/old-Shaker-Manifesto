Waupaca, Wis., Sept. 1887 Henry C. Blinn, Sir:â€”In an article in the Oct. No. of the Manifesto, I find the Elder has said that his ' theology did not recognize the Bible as the word of God, that Jesus was not the Christ, and that the God of Israel was not the God of the Universe.' I had read aloud to a dear friend, all the articles in the Manifesto, thus far, which she liked much, until I came to the above mentioned words, when she said she could not accept that, and seemed quite shocked. I have often thought that radical men, and women too, sometimes make very unqualified remarks even when they are trying to do good. If the Elder had explained why he believed so, it would probably have been all right, for I think he is a noble man, and a staunch Christian, although I have never had the pleasure of meeting him. Perhaps you could explain his meaning in a few words in the next Manifesto, and oblige your friend and well wisher, H. N. M.
