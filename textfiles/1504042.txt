A THOUGHT. MARY WHITCHER. Why should I care For any earthly ill,-- When God permits,-- And holds my keeping still. I've seen the darkest clouds All swept away,-- And after darkness, dawn The brightest day. Still not inclined to trust O feeble heart! Must dust return to dust Ere thou wilt act thy part? Heaven forbid, in earth We would consign Our thought and will,-- E'er trusting the Divine. Canterbury, N. H.
