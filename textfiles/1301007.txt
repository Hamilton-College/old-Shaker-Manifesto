WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR? A traveler, journeying long ago Down from Jerusalem to Jericho, Fell among thieves, who wounded him and fled Leaving him stripped of raiment and half dead. By chance tliere came a certain priest that way Who looked on him but left him where he lay. Likewise a Lcvite, walking in his pride, With eyes turned heavenward, passed oti the other side. But a Samaritan, while journeying, drew Near to the place where lay the wounded Jew, Who had compassion, and witli pious toil Botmd up his wounds and poured in wine and oil. Nor ever from his tender labor ceased Till he had borne him on his own good beast Unto the quiet shelter of an inn, And on the nun-row, faring forth again, (Careless alike of trouble or of cost) Took out two pence and gave them to the host, Saying, ''Take care of him; another day, Whate'er thou spendest more, I will repay.' Whom thinkest thou, was neighbor to the man, The priest, the Levite, or Samaritan? He that-showed pity? Go, and do likewise! God loveth mercy more than sacrifice! Joseph A.
