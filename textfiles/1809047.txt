A word about the ethics of writing for the press... [Contributed by Compositors.] A word about the ethics of writing for the press. There is certainly some consideration due compositors. They are nut overpaid and every piece of poor manuscript makes a difference. An article written so villainously as to take twice as long to set it up as it ought to take, just doubles the work or divides the earnings. If this is not stark robbery, it is a form of imposition which touches it very closely. Write plainly, and use paper freely. Northwestern Christian Advocate.
