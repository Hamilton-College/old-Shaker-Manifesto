LIBERAL LEAGUE An account, too short however, of the doings of the Liberal League Convention, from the pen of Elder F. W. Evans, will be read with a curious pleasure. As we followed the proceedings, in type, we could not well help thinking of a menagerie of noble, wild animals. Each had his or her roar, and nearly every tout' and color was presented. We are glad to learn, there was one chorus, which they all had learned sufficiently well to sing together—Distinction of Chwch and Slide Governments—and may thai chorus and its reverberations never be hushed!
