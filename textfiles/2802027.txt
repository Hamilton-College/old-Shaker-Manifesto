HOPE. By J. V. [Contributed by Eldress Harriet Goodwin.] Oh! do not trail your banners, But raise them up on high; Shout! shout the glad hosannas, Immortals never die. With God above, who loves you, Almighty to defend, Mind not the storms which prove you, He is your faithful friend. Tho on life's stream your voyage May be fierce and wild and long, Or gentle as a Summer's day With little seeming wrong; Still, let us take it as it comes, Shun lethargy and hate For 'many mansions,' many homes, For those who trust, await. Seek good and true companions, Be pure in thought and speech, And let the light of reason E'er guide on sea and beach. This world is but a training school, We can but go through college; Up yonder's our post-graduate, To seek eternal knowledge. ï¿½Selected.
