A DREAM. Jessie Evans. Beneath the veil of sleep, one lovely night, I was conducted to the realms of light By one whose voice was music to the ear, Whose raiment was like angels', white and clear. A beauteous circle met my wondering eyes, But soon a sound, far distant, seemed to rise, And ere I knew, I heard a deep-toned bell, And loudly, clearly, did its message swell. One word it spoke�but one�yet awful, sweet! The heavenly courts intoned its import deep. 'Watch,' chimed the bell, the message seemed for me 'Watch,' for ye know not when thy time will be. It was the heavenly time-piece, I was told, Striking the hour of one, with tongue of gold, I hid the solemn watchword in my heart, And pledged to God it never should depart. Time passed away, and soon an hour rolled by, Then from the bell-tower, O so tenderly, The Savior's words, a couplet precious, came, 'Twas 'Follow Me! ' it rang in measures plain. Once more the message of the bell I heard, Once more my soul by loving music stirred; This time, the hour of three was softly chimed, And from it came the words of old, sublime : 'Faith, Hope, Charity,'it seemed to say, And angel voices echoed far away, 'But greatest, and the hest of all the three,� The fair and lovely grace of Charity.' The d- earn has gone!�but ah! those tones remain, In memory's golden casket graven plain, Those lessons three, are traced with 'finest gold,' In deeds of righteousness their worth unfold. Had I remained until the close of day, I might have learned what more the bell would say, 'Sufficient for the day,' the lessons three, And pure the Gospel truth they brought to me. To 'Watch' with eyes made pure by truth and love, To 'Follow Christ' in righteou.-ness above; The lesson of true Charity to learn, Shall be henceforth my first, my great concern. Canterbury, N. H.
