Respected friend, Adin Ballou: Your kind favor... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., May 18, 1863. Respected Friend, Adin BalLOD :�Yrour kind favor of May f)th came duly to hand, and I cau with pleasure appreciate the spirit in which it was penned. Formerly the manner of treatiug such subjects as we have broached, was dogmatic and controversial, the parties assuming an antagonistic attitude, the main effort being to stultify one another. The more becoming attitude in the present state of spiritual and physical knowledge, is to make a statement of facts with their collaterals, as seen from the individual's stand-point, seasoning the whole with the feeling, that we are but the mediums for an influx and reflux of truth and good. With regard to your first position ; the order and harmony visible in the creation of physical things, forbids any other conclusion than, that, it is the mind and will of the Creator, that man should constitute a happy and harmonic order of Society. As regards the second, under these harmonial conditions, nuui could have brought forth his likeness in justification. Your third rests on the second, therefore, the above covers the ground. But if man has lost his harmonial relationship, everything lie does, whether propagating his species, or anything else must be out of joint, wrong, sinful. Your efforts to bring man back to harmonial relationships and your personal toils and triais (though never seen with my natural eyes) are before me, and induced me to present you with an analysis of the forces which has brought forth the Adamic, and Angelic orders of Society. If Society is to be reconstructed on the Adamic plane, the forces of that plane alone can operate. If on the Angelic, the forces alone of that plane can operate. They cannot be mixed. And an examination of evidence primafacie and analytic ; scriptural and philosophic on the subject, will lead to the conclusion, that matrimony is of the world ; that the children of this world marry anu are given in marriage ; and that those who account themselves worthy of a higher life, ' neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels arc in heaven. ' By accepting Jesus as a celibate from principle, I find his life logical throughout. If circumstantially only, [ do not find him so. Had it been his mission to have regulated the race on the procreative plane, and leave them there, He and his followers to be full and perfect patterns, ought to have married, that they and their families might have been examples of a true, natural, and harmonic life. But neither Jesus, the Apostles, nor the Pentecostal Church, set such an example. The memorable saying of the Apostle '�'the younger widows refuse, for vvh?n they have begun to wax wauton against Christ, they are willing to marry, having cast off their first faith'�the faith once delivered to the saints by Jesus, sets the matter at rest on that point scripturally. You inquire 'if our order of Society is designed or expected to become universal here on earth?' Strait is the gate that leadeth unto the higher life, and few there be that find it at present. But if it should become universal, the race would become extinct. On that subject we have no doctrine to present, nor dogma to assert. Believing that, 'that which is natural is first, and afterwards, that which is spiritual.' The order of the world exists here, and in the spirit land. The order of Christ's kingdom exists here and also in the spirit land ; its universality does not lie with us either here, or in the laud of souls, and so we leave that matter. The voice on earth is ' whosoever will, let him come' the voice in the laud of souls is the sataCi If it i� the design of God to bring the 1'ace to an etld, I presume you will think with Us, that it would comport more with mercy and love, to have it brought to ah end, by the free choice of the race to ascend into a higher life, and so he harvested spiritually, than to have the earth peopled to its utmost capacity, and then suddenly atid painfully exterminate all its inhabitants. Years ago, our friends of the order of the world, were in some trouble, because we held to the non resurrection of the body ; by perseverance public opinion has changed on the point; hence we find some room to hope, that the bugbear 'running the world out' will also drop off. Outside of our order, the subject of matrimony is beginning to be understood as we understand it; and bye and bye, well informed persons of the world will see as clearly as we do, that the matrimonial order of Society, and the angelic, are organically distinct; or to use a chemical phrase, atom-ically incompatible, that is, the forces that inhere in the one, cannot coalesce with those, which inhere in the other, or form an organic whole. The order and beauty of the atomic arrangement of the primary particles of matter, and tl e forces thereof, which compose our planet, when measurably known, will I have reason to believe, throw light on spiritual matters not clearly seen at present ; and will form a physical foundation to an understanding, of the now invisible things of God; which, bye and bye, will be clearly seen by the things that are made. Agaiii, \yjth regard to the extinction of the race ; netting aside the geological and astronomical considerations of the subject ; how long man may be able to sustain himself physiologically on the earth, can only be a subject of conjecture. 1 have some suspicion that the whites, cannot endure as long as the blacks, and that the latter will exist a long and lengthened period after the former has disappeared. And with me it is an open question, whether it would Hot be well for all the other races, to have the white gathered home to God in the line of Shaker Communities and taught to bear faithfully the cross of Christ against their warring enslaving, greedy, grasping, and cruel dispositions ; lust-gratifying, and disease begetting doings, than to have them go on as they have been doing for these centuries past. But this perhaps desirable consummation cannot be effected at present, because my worthy friend whom I have the happiness to address, and others of his standing, are not yet gathered home to the fold of Christ, to be taught of his spirit, fitting them to be indeed subjects of his kingdom, and fitting them at the same time to be kings and priests unto God and to the Lamb, an1, to their poor white brethren who need redemption from sin, and that, that induces thereto. Yours with much respect. Daniel Fraser. To Adin Ballon, Hopedale, Mass.
