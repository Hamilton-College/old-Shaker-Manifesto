TOO GOOD TO BE LOST. When the Shakers organized their Soci ety in Kentucky it was then one of the slave states. Men and women were hel as chattels, which seriously conflicted wit the anti-slavery views of the Shakers tha came from the free states. They could not harmonize the gospel of Jesus Christ which brought freedom of soul and body with the southern Christian view of mak ing merchandise of the souls of men. In some instances these views of the Shakers proved to be a very objectionable feature. It seems that one of the good Deacons or Trustees had taken the liberty to express his mind a little too freely on the subject, to suit one of the slave holders and was informed very decidedly,�'Mr. Shaker, I am your enemy, and if I should meet you alone, and away from your home I would kill you.' Nearly two years had past before the anticipated time came. The Deacon had been from home on business. One day on entering a piece of woods while on his return home, he saw in the distance his avowed enemy coming toward him. When within a short distance of each other, the Deacon sprang from his horse and threw the lines over a small tree. Off went his coat and rolling up his shirt sleeves, he hailed his enemy,� 'My friend, this is the place the Lord ' has appointed for you and me to meet. Now we will see who is on the Lord's side.' Not a word was spoken by the slave holder, but by the use of his- spurs, the horse and his rider were suddenly out of sight and the good Deacon remounting his horse rode pleasantly to his home and never afterward was troubled by his enemy.
