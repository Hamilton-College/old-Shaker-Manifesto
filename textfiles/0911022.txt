HOW MUCH CHRISTIAN ARE YOU ? In our public service, recently, Eldress Polly Eeed delivered, among many good expressions to us all, the following advice and Christian Charity : ' Some may think they cannot live the true, Christian life, and perhaps this may be so ; it only remains for such to come as near to it as they can, and let their lives resemble Christ's as completely as they are able, etc.' This brings up plainly and pointedly to view, and to the test, both the duty and ability of those who have made and do make the Christian profession. ' Let him or her who is able to receive it do so.'
