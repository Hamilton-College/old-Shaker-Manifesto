East Canterbury N. H. Feb. 1898. If a blizzard can add any beauty to the winter season, then we are having a beautiful season. On the last day of January some ten inches of snow fell somewhere. During the storm of snow came the storm of wind and all day and all night the snow fell and the wind howled. The elements brought about a wonderful work, and in some places the snow was piled into huge drifts, and all of one day but few persons attempted to walk out, and for two days the roads were so blockt with snow that no carriages could be used and consequently we had no mail. Directly in front of our dwelling we had a beautiful drift of not less than five feet deep, wholly covering the path where the people wisht to walk. Such are the beauties of winter. The ice is being harvested and is reported to be fifteen inches thick. 46 THE MANIFESTO. 1700 cakes 22x22 are expected to be taken from the water. Eighty-five gallons of milk are reported at the dairy per day. With a separator and a churn most of it is soon converted into butter, and all that can be spared is sent to market. A few orders for Sweaters demand active work in that department for several days. We are thankful for all blessings, temporal and spiritual. Henry C. Blinn.
