More persons are destroyed by eating too much than by drinking too much. Gluttony kills more than drunkenness in civilized society. The best gymnasium is a wood yard, a clearing, a corn field. A hearty laugh is known the world over to be a health promoter; it elevates the spirits, enlivens the circulation, and is marvelously contagious in a good sense. Bodily activity and bodily health are inseparable. If the bowels are loose, lie down in bed, remain there and eat nothing till you are well. The best medicines in the world are, warmth, abstinence, and repose.
