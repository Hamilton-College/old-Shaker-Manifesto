Cultivate frogs, toads, and lizards... Cultivate frogs, toads, and lizards. Put them in your gardens, and as the evening approaches they will hop from their hidingplaces and snuggle down in some convenient spot near the gutter, or where fhey know their food will come plenty. The ants, roaches, mosquitoes, etc., they consume in a night is marvelous, and thus they keep down the insect pest.
