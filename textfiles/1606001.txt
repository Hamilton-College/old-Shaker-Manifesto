SHAKER SPIRITUALISM. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. Natural things typify spiritual things. In Christ, the offspring of God, is both Bridegroom and Bride. Jesus manifested the Bridegroom. The second in order, is the manifestation of the Bride. In a discourse delivered Christmas eve, before the Parker spiritualist fraternity in N. Y. City, after referring to the birth of a certain male child eighteen hundred and eighty-five years ago, the speaker remarked parenthetically, 'What a pity to the race that it was not a female child, so that, the influence of its name might have increased the lustrous kindness and patient gentleness of that portion of the race which best exemplify those loving qualities which render religion essential.' This reference to woman and her implied capacity is an encouraging sign of the present growth of intelligence and liberal opinion. How brief the period, since her brothers or sisters have been willing to accept woman as a religious teacher, except for childhood. And how many even now, feel a lack in this line which their male teachers cannot supply to their heart's content? One sufficient reason why the heaven anointed woman could not appear eighteen hundred years ago and make her impress on the ages following, was the darkness and blindness of the human race, which required a man's strength and lion like boldness, aided by the superior advantage of position which education and custom accorded the male teacher, to open the wayï¿½by creating an atmosphere, or moral element and sentiment, in which woman's higher mental and spiritual faculties could find activity, and unfold her capacity. This having been accomplished through the anointed Jesus and his disciples, and the revolution of the ages, on the twenty ninth of February, A. D. seventeen hundred and thirty six, the woman child was born, who, after she had grown to maturity and was baptized with the Holy Spirit, freed herselt from all earthly bonds, became a religious teacher and leader out of sin, (thus reversing the example of the first woman we read of,) dispensed apostolic gifts, opened the way to the tree of life, revealed in her own character the Motherhood of Deity as Jesus revealed the Fatherhood, and became that example to all the Daughters of God who seek the highest excellence, that Jesus is to the Sons. Through her labors, suffering, and self-sacrifice for the good of others, the daughters are now able to stand on equal footing with the sons. She testified 'The fullness of the Godhead dwells in womanhood bodily. ' She said of herself 'I am Ann the Word.' 'No man is my head but Christ Jesus, he is my head and Lord. ' Ann means grace, or a gift. The first appearing of Christ beginning in a man, it was necessary that the second appearing should begin in a woman, to make man and woman equal on the Christ plane of life. Ann testified that she saw a thousand in the world of spirits, to every one she saw in the body. She frequently testified of seeing spirits rise from the dead, (spirits dead to the Divine life and ignorant of the things of God,) and come into the resurrection which is in Christ. Her immediate companions and supporters were gifted with seership in like manner, and all testified that the gospel of the kingdom of God was and is preached to spirits x&gt;ut of the body; 'That they may be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit. ' Also that spirits receive and obey the gospel, and travel to that degree of purity as to be clothed in white robes. Ann finished her work in the body in Sept. seventeen hundred and eighty four, over one hundred years ago. Ann, her brother William, James Whittaker, John Hocknell and others, preached the gospel to spirits, and frequently made serious labors with them to teach them the right way. Others of our faith have done the same. These people were ' put to death in the flesh,' death to the natural, rudimental life which binds to earth, and were 'made alive in spirit,' as Peter says of Jesus, 'in which also he went and preached to spirits in prison, who aforetime were disobedient, when the long suffering of God waited iu the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing. ' 1 Peter, iii., 19. This prison is a state. Any one that is a slave to appetite, or passion, or to any evil habit, is a prisoner spiritually, in that state and degree to which he is enslaved. If he is ignorant too, of his own higher powers, and of the means of escape, he needs somebody, or a wise intelligence distinct from himself, to aid him. To open the prison doors and give the needed aid, to set the example and spread the light of a higher life, and also to minister the life to those willing to receive it, is the mission of Ami Lee and her disciples. She testified that she saw Jesus Christ and conversed with him daily face to face, as one friend converses with another, and I never heard of any one who knew her intimately, feeling disposed to question her testimony. She testified to having seen the Apostles and Prophets, and her disciples, of all ages from infancy to gray hairs, including preachers and many heads of families, and some of collegiate education, believed her message, and renounced the honors, riches, pleasures, rewards and ambitions of the world, to practice her teaching through life. I recently saw a question that was asked and answered at the Banner of Light free circle, as to what became of the body of Jesus, after it was entombed. The same question being asked of Ann Lee, she answered that it was dissolved, and each part went to its own element. It is evident from the New Testament record that great spirit power was manifested in those days, sufficient to accomplish anything necessary to convince honest inquirers, same as there is now. About a year after the opening of her testimony in America, she reproved some for their hardness and unbelief, and referred to the unbelieving Jews in Christ's first appearing. Said 'Even his own disciples after he rose from the dead, though he had often told them he should rise the third day, believed it not. They would not believe that he had risen because he appeared first to a woman ! So great Avas their unbelief that the words of Mary seemed to them like idle tales ! His appearing first to a woman, showed that his second coming would be in a woman. ' She often said '' I feel the blood of Christ running through my soul and body, washing me ; Him do I acknowledge as my head and Lord. ' Christ, observe, is spirit, and his body is not dead but living. 'The blood is the life thereof.' (To be Continued )
