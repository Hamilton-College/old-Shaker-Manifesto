Pleasant Hill, Ky. Jan. 13. 1890. The past four or five weeks we have had regular Spring weather (almost Summer.) Wheat, six inches high. The rose leaves are coming out and the japonicas are in bloom. The grass has assumed its verdant robes and the birds are singing the sweetest in their efforts to make believe it is Spring. The thermometer has during this time ranged from 60 to 70 degrees above zero. To-day it is considerably cooler. If a cold snap should come, our fruit for next season will be in great danger of being damaged. M. J.
