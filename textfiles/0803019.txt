In for the blessing, and out at the slander Can there be a better ire, or out, than this? We think not, and must congratulate everyone ripon his wise choice, who joins us in the happy resolution. We are all creatures of action, and incline daily to find outings and innings of some kind. How brave and wise that we always seek these needed changes by true and noble principles. It is more than meat and drink to live an earnest, free and happy life; but only such can enjoy this boon, who are in for the blessing, and out at the slander. Canterbury, N. H.
