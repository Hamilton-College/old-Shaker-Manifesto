To the Memory of our Angel Mother ANN BUCKINGHAM. Anotiiek beautiful, well-tried soul, has passed on, full of years, to join the purified throng on the shores of immortality. Peacefully her loving spirit crossed the dark river. She had spent a long life, in full consecration to the principles of the gospel, counting no sacrifice too great that would enable her to gain full and final victory over all sin. Possessing a kind and charitable disposition toward all, we loved and cherished her many noble Christian traits of character. She was a fearless champion of the cause of gospel purity, as she understood its teachings, and was never afraid to denounce as error, all that was not in strict accordance with its holy precepts. Those of us who were privileged to know our beloved Mother, will wer remember with filial affection, the many ministrations of spiritual strength and encouragement received from her during the last thirty years. A safe counselor, always firm and decided, ever looking on the bright side; a pattern of true godliness by precept and example. She was a believer t:;at our spirit friends have power to return and hold communion with those in earth life. We shall miss her presence, as we pursue our daily duties, but while the mortal is hidden from our sight, we have a full as- THE MANIFESTO. 67; surance that the separation is not eternal; that often from those love-crowned mansions of the higher life, her presence, like an angel benediction may visit us to cheer and comfort, amid the trials and temptations of time. May we all so bravely battle for the principles of truth and virtue, that when our life-work is ended, we may hear the welcome song, 'Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'
