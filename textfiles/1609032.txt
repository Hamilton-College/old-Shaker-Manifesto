COAL. Coal is quarried in the mine and drawn up by horses; these poor animals many times are obliged to stay in these mines all their lives and never see the light. But once the coal we burn were beautiful forests; and these forests sunk down into the earth. These trees broke up in pieces and thus formed the chunks of solid black coal which people burn in winter. Florence.
