JUNE. By Martha J. Anderson. Oh, now will the queen of summer reign Embowered in bloom of the roses fair, Whose delicate fragrance and shadings rare Will not to our senses plead in vain : She calleth the dews and gentle rain, And, waving the wand of her kindly care Rich beauty blossometh everywhere. O'er meadow and hill, and field of grain, What magical changes unfold to view; The grasses plume and the seed cups fill, And the woodland copse so lone and still Expands in richness of foliage new. 'Tis blessed to trust that the seasons will Each in their turn God's love fulfill. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
