SOCRATES' FAITH This grand man had abiding faith in immortality. In a conversation shortly before his death he said : ' Then Cebes, beyond question, the soul is immortal and imperishable and our souls will truly exist in another world ? (Plato : Phcedo, 106.) Other expressions of Socrates mainly from the same conversation, are not less emphatic and significant : * * * When death attacks a man the mortal portion of him may be supposed to die, but the immortal goes out of the way of death and is preserved safe and sound. (Plato: Phcedo, 107.) * * * But then, O my friends, if the soul is really immortal, what care should be taken of her, not only in respect of the portion of time which is called life, but of eternity! (Plato: Phcedo, 107.) And can we suppose that the soul being invisible and on her way to a place like herself invisible and pure, a world worthy indeed the name of the Unseen, there to dwell with the good and wise God â€” whether, if God please, my soul must soon go * * * will, when released from the body, be instantly scattered to the wind and destroyed, as the mass of men assert 1' (Plato: Phoedo, 81.) If, upon her release, the soul be found pure and free from all that appertains to the body * * * she goes to the world which is invisible like herself ; to the world divine and immortal and full of thought; there set free from error, folly, fears and the fierce passions and other evils of humanity, her lot is a happy one indeed * * * but if, 204 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. on her release, she be found unclean and polluted by her intercourse with the body * * * do you think that a soul in this condition will be found pure and uncontaminated when she is set free? ' (Phcedo, 81.)
