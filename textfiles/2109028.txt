Sabbathday Lake, Me. Aug. 13, 1891. The monthly messenger comes to us laden with that Word which never grows old, never decays. No other literature can fill its place. The last number was a mental feast of strawberries, almost all the Societies spoke of them. Some had cherries in abundance. We are sorry to say we had none. But we have had all needful blessings except rain. Our fields and pastures are quite dry and our wells are nearly exhausted. The cry now in the State of Maine is 'Rain, more rain.' Many thanks to Sr. Agnes E. Newton for the 'Prayer for Manifesto.' We echo the same. Three hundred people registered in our Office during the month of July, among them, Geri. B. F. Butler, Gen.- O. O. Howard and family, Cadet Butler Ames, U. S. Military Academy, Annie Louise Gary Raymond, the sweet singer of Maine, also the millionaire,- N, Q. Pope, of Brooklyn N. Y., who has, within five miles of this place stables of valuable imported horses and dogs. It is very interesting to visit his premises. The hotel at Raymond Springs two miles west of us is completed and filled with guests, who come often to visit this strange people. They admire and purchase our beautiful flowers and thus we are rewarded for the pains we take in growing them. A. S. C.
