WHAT A WORLD. 'The best general statistical work is Daniel's Lehrbuch der Geographie. Of this the G4th edition has recently appeared, which contains some interesting statements and figures. According to these the inhabitants of the world are about 1,435,000,000. There are 3,C64 distinct dialects known. There are about 1,100 different religions. There does not exist a single people which is without a religion of some kind. Even the lowest on the social scale have some religious idea, however crude. Christianity has 432,000,000 adherents. The Roman Catholic Church numbers 208,000,000, the Greek, or Oriental Orthodox Church, 83,000,000; the Protestant Church, 123,000,000. Besides these, there are about 100 sects or smaller divisions claiming to be Christians, with 8,000,000 adherents. Of the non-Christians, 8,000,000 are Jews, 120,000,000 are Mohammedans. These adherents of Islam are divided into three sects, the Sunites, the Shiites, and Wappabites, while there are about seventy smaller Mohammedan sects. All other human beings are non-monotheistic or heathen, and embrace 875,000,000 souls. Among the heathen religions Brahminism is the most widely spread, and embraces about 138,000,000 adherents, and its younger offshoot, Buddhism, embraces 503,000,000. Other religions embrace 135, 000,000 adherents. There are thus yet one thousand millions of souls who are not Christians. And what is Christendom doing about it ? Well, Boston has in five years 1883�87 sent over 3,500,000 gallons of liquor to Africa to debauch, degrade, and d . . . the natives ; has prosecuted and fined about a dozen men for preaching the gospel on Boston Common� has locked up three preachers in Charles street jail for the same crime ; one of whom was sent there for a year, another of whom writes these lines. Is it not time for Christians to arise and shine! Good Way.
