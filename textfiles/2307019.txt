Shaker Station, Conn. June, 1893. 'Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, and be ye thankful,' says the Apostle. This is an absolute command; therefore we must not despair of peace as if it were unattainable when the command is to let it rule in our hearts. If we follow Christ we shall be partakers of his peace which He gives unto those who walk in his footsteps. Peace reigns with the pure in heart. How many there are who seek in worldly pleasure for that peace which they never find. Denying self brings true peace within. Youth is a fit time for the reception of truth, purity and peace. May the sunshine of peace and honest endeavor brighten all our days. One half of the year is forever gone, let us wisely improve the remainder. Pure air to breathe and pure water to drink, are certainly worth much time and thought, and there is nothing like making an effort to obtain them. Weeds give us an endless fight and the chance is often against us. ****** Rogers and Hubbard's pure ground bone in sacks is just the thing for fowls, it helps to form shell, bone and muscle.
