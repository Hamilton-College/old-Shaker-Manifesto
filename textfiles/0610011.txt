Rio Vista, Cal., September 2,1876 Bro. D. Fraser : Allow me to thank you most sincerely for your articles in The Shaker, especially those entitled, 'Chemical Forces of Plants and Animals.' To use a miner's phrase, 'they go to the bed-rock;' and are such a clear exposition of dietary truth, that I cannot refrain from expressing my admiration of them. If you had the millions of an Astor or a Stewart to bestow upon the people, they would not do so much good as your articles are calculated to effect. Truly yours, E. Y.
