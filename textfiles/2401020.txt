North Family Dec. 1893. In bidding the past year adieu and welcoming the new, we waft a new petition for divine blessing upon our fellow men and our household of faith. 'Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.' True it is that the joys and trials of the past year have proved necessary, developing powers to adjust life aright, and as long as we dwell in the light of God, which casts no shadow, weariness will not unsettle our faith nor obscure from our sight the divine staff of God's supporting love. The December number of our Manifesto, we consider an excellent one to end the 1893 volume. Especially was the Editorial inspiring; inciting the mind to think more of the vital interests of Zion's welfare, in place of valueless forms or methods which savor of 'antiquated dogmas.' Eepresenting one of the branches of God's stupendous tree of spiritual life, THE MANIFESTO. 21 possessing the sap of vitalizing truth and a few dead leaves of error, may we as a Church be more zealous to use the pruning knife of consistency and cut off all that is useless as well as extirpate from within, traits of character offensive to God and our associates. As we do, we shall enlarge our individuality in all that is good and pure as well as in the possibility of God's work of soul salvation. In this we may help to bring about our long desired hope of establishing the kingdom of heaven within. George H. Baxter
