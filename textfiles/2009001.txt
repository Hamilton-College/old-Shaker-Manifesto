RESURRECTION. F. W. Evans. Of late, I have thought much of the resurrection order and sphere of humanity. Darwin speaks of rudiments that indicate faculties once existing, no longer needed, they being supplanted by higher powers and faculties, developed under the law of evolution. Is it not thus when the soul rises from the generative order into the resurrection? 'I am the resurrection.' What an expression to be made by a man two thousand years ago ! Is it a wonder that it is said of him, 'He trod the wine-press alone, and of the people there was not one with him?' Any physical faculty or limb disused diminishes in power, be it an arm, or leg, or muscle ; is it not the same with the mental and spiritual powers? The hidden, wonderful power that enables a human being to die to the generative life of the natural man or woman, is a 'mystery of godliness' that is made known only by revelation. The mere natural, animal man or woman�even when intellectually unfolded�discerneth not the resurrection, it is foolishness to them. The gift of faith alone revealeth it. The prophets and prophetesses, and Bibles of all races and peoples continually refer to a resurrection state, as being attainable, possible ; but they do it only 'in part,' aud as 'through a glass, darkly;' yet it is there. All men, consciously, or unconsciously, are pressing�growing�towards the resurrection order. The generative is a rudimentary phase on the journey, through which all men and women will pa�s on their way to the Christ Heavens�the Heaven of Heavens. I am under the impression, from my knowledge of history, that there are single nations aud races who have passed through all the degrees of progress, which, now, the whole humt&gt;n race�all nations, races, kindreds, tongues, and peoples�are making a united and tremendous effort to attain unto. Jesus, as an individual, became, as a unit, a resurrected man. As such, he was a pattern of what other men could ' attain unto. 'Follow me. Be of good courage, for I have overcome the world' �the lust of generation, the lust of private property possession; and the pride of rule, with the ambition of seeing who should be the greatest. The Son of Man comes to minister, not to be ministered unto, to serve, not to be served by others; to work for the Brotherhood and Sisterhood; to love God supremely, and the Society more than self, lie taught, disciplined, rebuked, and'loved his twelve disciples ; taught them to be as he was, resurrected souls. And we have no record of any one of them, not even Judas, ever having been drawn down to earth by the tail of the dragon, the lust of generation ; they all put their feet upon that head of the serpent of sensuality�lust. Again, the twelve were to the primitive chu-ch what Jesus was to them�a pattern. The principle was expanded. For three hundred years, the primitive Christian church labored to be a resurrected church, in the midst of a corrupt Roman war government, find its social system. Everything, within aud without, worked against the high standard of purity that the church was striving to maintain. . The civil government looked upon it as inimical to its own power and existence. Its celibacy would destroy population ; its non-resistance wrould make Rome the prey of any petty nation practicing the war power, aud as Rome had taken the sword against all nations, uniess she defended herself by the sword, the least of them would come and take away her place and pow er. True Christianity, then, as exhibited in Jesus, who did not render evil for evil, and his disciples, whom Jesus told to put up their swords, otherwise they would perish in using them, and in the primitive church, which, not being of this world, would not marry nor fight, was regarded by the Romans as destructive of all civil government by extermination of the population. And by the testimony of Jesus against war, and they treated it accordingly. It was assailed by outward persecution, martyrdom, and by inward temptations, false doctrines aud corrupt leaders, until the fifteenth bishop of Jerusalem was a Gentile and a married man. It was this corrupted, perverted, adulterated Christianity that spread over the great Roman empire. The emperor, Coustantine, became a Gentile Christian. He introduced both marriage and war into the Gentile Christian churches, and there they remain to this day. Great churches, hundreds of sects, hate- ful and hating one another, but all giving their power and adhesion to church and state religion, that includes marriage, private property and war. They aiv all k'turned to blood.' They begin with the blood of Jesus, as being God, and enr! with war and the inquisition, with becoming drunk with the blood of . aints and martyrs, and being authors of all the blood shed upon earth. Anti-Christianity, Babylon the Great, the mother of harlot denominations, is a cruel, bloody system that destroys the earth and deforms the heavens. '�Let the saints of the Most High render unto her double ; according as she has lived deliciously and comforted herself, so much sorrow and torment give her,'�the pen and tongue are mightkr than swords. When the powers of evil were concentrated upon Jesus, to his physical destruction, with vehement personal hatred crying ''Crucify him, crucify him,' it excited in Jesus a clear hatred and keen indignation, not against the persons, but against the principle of war. 'Do not I hate them that hate thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred�with a hatred free from personality ; that is a. perfect hatred.' Hence, in the Christ spirit, Jesus could denounce the evil, and pray to his Father in heaven, to forgive them personally, as not understanding what they were doing. When the whole race of mankind come into the new earth and the new heavens�the Millennium�the resurrection, 'war will cease to the ends of the earth,' and men will cease to do evil and learn to do well, as natural men and women, and Christians�Shakers� will say, 'I am the resurrection and the life.' The generative life and power of physical procreation will be resurrected into a spiritual sexual relation, above the animal, propagative plane. The back brain will go up into the intellectual, and the intellectual will go up into the spiritual brain region. Private property acquisitiveness will be raised into pure communion, where each one can seek anothers wealth and not their own, without becoming a 'prey' to a wolfish pack of self-seekers. And the war force and power will be 'turned, as the battle to the gate' against war itself, on the selfish plane ; where all are hateful and hating one another. It will be resurrected into a 'war in heaven, where Michael and his angels fought and the dragon and his angels, until no place was found for them.' As Jesus said, 'The prince of this world cometh and hath no part in me,' no personality. Hating the flesh, was a perfect hatred, that killed and made alive, and the reproved becomes the friend of whoso punishes the evil and spares the individual, as a mau spareth his own son, he saves him by correcting him. Thus, 'whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth whomsoever he receiveth,' making even his enemies to be at peace with him and to eventually become his friends. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
