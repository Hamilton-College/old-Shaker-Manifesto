Colds Many colds, and extremely bad coughs, originate from so bundling the throat that a perspiration is created, opening the pores, which come in contact with the cold air. Better leave the throat only covered by a loose collar, excepting when going out in the wind or cold; then be particular not to dress the throat so warmly as to perspire. Be fully as particular, about not warming up too quickly after being very cold, as about wrapping up when ready to go out in the cold. Avoid excessive use of grease, and keep the bowels regular.
