THE BRIGHT HOPE STAR. Maria Shults. Canaan, N. Y. 1 Heavenly guid thro' the pilgrimage here, So long is the journey and dreary, 2. Heavenly Pilot, far out on the sea, The billows are surging forever, 3. Heavenly Captain, the contest of life Is raging in terror around me, I cannot walk thro' the valley alone, O give me thy staff lest I weary! Launch my frail bark on the waters for me, And give me the oar of endeavor; Give me thy faith lest I fail in the strife, And strength lest the tumult confound me; And when the shadows of life close around, And coldly the night winds are blowing, Struggling alone 'mid the darkness and gloom, All vainly I'm seemingly driven, I would not fail in the battle today, Nor suffer my foes to defeat me, If I can see the bright hope-star above, All cheerfully I will be going. But I will look to the light-house beyond, That shines from the harbor of heaven. But in thy strength I will struggle and pray, That mine might be triumph and vic'try.
