TREES. [The following article was copied from a blackboard ^i one of our district schools. It was dictated by as many pupils as it has sentences, and written upon the board by one of the teachers. It was a very pleasant and commendable exercise.] Thehe are several kinds of trees. Trees are valuable for lumber and some for fruits. The mountain ash has little red berries. They grow in clusters. There is another which is called the aspen tree. The leaves are always in motion. The evergreen stays green all the year round. The red maple has red blossoms. There are three kinds of maple. The red maple, the rock maple and the white maple. Maple trees are very useful. We get sap from the maple tree, and boil it down to sugar. Without trees our home M'ould not be as beautiful as it is now.
