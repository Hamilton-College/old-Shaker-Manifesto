BREATHE THBOUGH THE NOSE. Dr. Wakd, physician to the Metropolitan Throat hospital, in an article on singers throat troubles, in the Musical Critic, treats of the causes of catarrhal troubles experiencec by public singers, and repeats the well-known fact that the nose is the only channel through which air should pass during ordinary acts of wreathing, the mouth being intended only as in accessory breathing agent when, on certain occasions�as, for instance, running�the lungs demand a rapid supply. Air, in passng through the nostrils, is warmed and sifted of its harmful ingredients, and thus prepared for its reception into the delicate structures below. If it passes directly into the mouth without the above preparation, it will frequently cause irritation and inflammation of the mucous membrane, lining the mouth and throat, by being, in the first place, too cold, and, in the second place, by containing irritating particles of dust and other matter.
