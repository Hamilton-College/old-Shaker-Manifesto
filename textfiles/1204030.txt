Our Dear L ; Mary Whitcher Our Dear L ;â€”Your nice letter was very acceptable, and you may be quite sure that I do love to have somebody write to me, and especially the little folks, that I may see how well they write, and Jearn what they love and what they are going to be. It seems you love flowers, and love the snow, and love to be good. All these things are very pretty and pure ; and now I judge you are to make a good woman. If you are good you will be pretty and always happy. My love and thanks to you, and my love to all your little mates. Affectionately,
