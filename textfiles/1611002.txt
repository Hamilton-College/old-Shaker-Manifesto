THE CONSECRATION. A Sermon Delivered by Elder H. L. Eads, of the Shaker Community, at South Union. Ky., Aug. 1. Text�Therefore glorify God in the body and spirit which are God's and not our �own�1 Cor., vii., 20. It has been so often asserted by both the professing Christian and Infidel� the former to justify themselves in mere belief without works, the latter to show the ignorance of the great Teacher� that I have concluded to-day to take their most important questions, with the answers given, and set them before you, in which, also, the consecration to God will be considered, and the possibility shown that it can be made and lived by mortals here below. Querist�'Mr. Eads, I understand you to affirm the possibility and man's capability of practically obeying and following Christ. If so, I would be pleased to have you explain and reconcile some of the commands of the Savior. ' Christ says : ' Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, and then commands us to clothe the naked and feed the hungry.' 'I would ask you to tell me^how I can obey the last without disobeying the first, by laying up treasures to enable me to do it? ' Answer�The community to which I belong have been obeying both for more than a hundred years. Christ's command is: 'Lay not up treasures for yourselves;' this we do not. Querist�'Have you not been laying up treasures for yourselves for more than a hundred years? If not to whom belong all those tine buildings and rich. wide-spreading farm and gardens if not to yourselves ? ' Answer�All you see here is a branch of God's kingdom on earth, all of which belongs to Him, and all who dwell here are his usufructuaries, and have only the use of them ; and it is free to all who will obey and follow Christ in their practical lives. Querist�' Christ further says : 'Take no thought for the body what ye shall eat, drink, or wear.' Do you obey this?' Answer�Most surely we do; all persons who are consecrated to God have no need to trouble themselves about any of these things, and I may say, in this fold, I have never known what I was going to eat until God called me to it, and no matter what I found (and in early days it was very little,) I always knelt before it, asking God's blessing, and the same after partaking, giving thanks, then rise from my knees, and retire, never doubting but that God would call me again when necessary, and never to this day have I been disappointed. All that God demands of any one is to put his or her hands to work where He, by his order, has called them; by faithfully doing this they need take no thought for the morrow, for all things needful will be given them. Querist�'' Christ says : ' If a man take your coat, give him your cloak also.' To obey this may we not have to go naked ? ' Answer�This must have been spoken to those who owned coats and cloaks. No consecrated person in the community owns either. God has given us the care aud the use of thes3 things, and we can neither *rive nor sell them with- out his permission, and through his order. Querist�'I now understand you; but you certaiuly have feet and limbs of your own, and Christ says: 'If I compel you to go with me one mile, you must go 'two.' Will you do so? I now demand its fulfillment. ' Answer�I can not do it, because the feet and limbs are in the same condition of the coat; they do not belong to me ; they arejiicluded in the consecration ; they are mine only to care for and use ; they are to take me nowhere only as God in his order directs. Any other use of them would lead me into by and forbidden paths. I dare not use them only in God'ts service ; therefore, if I desired, I cannot go with you. The consecration spoken of in the text includes the body and all the faculties pertaining to it, together with the soul, mind, will, and judgment. It is as the Apostle says : 'They are God's, and not our own;' and further, ' We are bought with a price, and are not the servants of men. ' 1 Cor., vi., 23. The order itself must do the same as an example to others. In serving God we are freest of the free, because ' we are delivered from the bondage of corruption (under which the world groans) into tht glorious liberty of the children of God. ' Romans, viii., 21. This is liberty worth having; it is the freedom of angels, and no other kind is worthy of the name. The good Apostle seemed to comprehend the depth of the consecration better than most people do now. Some think a partial consecration will answer the purpose. One keeps his will, another his judgment, another his tongue, another his lust, and then asks, '�What did God give us these things for if we are not to use them?' Answer�He gave them to be used, controlled or subdued in accordance with his will, not to be let loose and driven by passion, where 'every step takes hold on hell ' God, though all merciful, makes no compromise with disobedience. The full consecration exempts nothing; we are to see, hear, feel, taste, speak, handle, and do nothing for mere pleasure and no profit. But as the Apostle saith : '' Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. ' 1 Cor. x., 31. Yea, as the text says, 'glorify God in the body and spirit, for they are God's and not our owu.' It is not difficult to determine, in the use of God-given faculties, whether it is for mere pleasure or profit. Christ said He always did the things that pleased the Father; He was consecrated to God ; so are we, and what He did we should do, all to the glory of God. Hence we should not go to see base ball, horse races, dog fights, nor obscene pictures to merely gratify the lust of the eye ; nor use the ear to hear filthy stories, nor slanders, nor fife, nor drum, nor cannon's roar. We should have no tongue to speak anything but truth. Oh, how much this faculty needs to be guarded ; it is, as the good apostle says, ' a fire, a world of iniquity ; it is set on fire of hell. ' The same of will, taste and judgment; all must be given to God's service, for ' we are His servants and not the servants of men. ' All, all the Lord's with nothing reserved ; a full compliance with this will bring to the soul the sweetest bliss wrhich is possible to the highest Archangel. But I return to the colloquy. Querist�' Mr. Eads, you astonish me to expect this much of weak, fallen man. How much easier it is to be saved by faith. Now please allow me to come to some home questions. I do not think it strange that Catholic monks and nuns, with their prison walls, bolts and bars and forced separation of the sexes, with no mingling sociality, are able to live the celibate life ; but this is not following Christ. Excuse me, I am slow to believe in its possibility with those who, from infancy to old age, have enjoyed this sociability, in converse and employment, lodging in the same houses without bolts or bars. Allow me to tell you, it is no vain curiosity that prompts me to be so forward as to ask personal questions on this subject, but I wish to learn the power that faith has in controlling one's actions through life. You are now an old man and widely, honorably kuown, and I am sure you will speak the truth. Now, excuse me, if you please, if I am too personal in my inquiries. I see, by a sketch of your biography in the late history of Kentucky that you was removed, when a young man, sa?,,s ceremonie, from the Order of the Ministry in Kentucky, and set down as a commoner, in the State of Ohio ; this was nearly a half century ago, and I think you might now be willing to tell the reason for this sudden removal, but I will not insist�you need not answer unless you are perfectly willing to do so. Pardon me, if you please, was there no sex about this?' Answer�None whatever. Querist�'It was a great change. ] am curious to know for what departure on your part this move was made? It seems that you was not only taken from the highest order, but was taken out of the State, as though a State offense had been perpetrated. Will you please inform us why it Avas done,?' Answer�I would freely do so if I could, but I cau not answer, because I do not know myself. I presume you enow that few persons are able to see themsel\Tes properly. It is possible I may have grown too tall and needed a dose or two of humiliation p^lls, but of :hat I know not. Querist�'Why did you not ask the reason for the procedure?' Answer�Because it was none of my business. I considered myself consecrated to God, and subject to his order. If I had been requested to go to London, it would have been all the same, and I would have gone, even if I was not told what for ; and now were I requested by the order before me to step down to the lowest rank, and employ myself in the most menial service, I would do it without a murmur, or asking the reason why the requirement was made. Although at times with my obscure vision all seemed dark and gloomy, yet I have always had Go i's blessing, and have been prospered in trustingly obeying his order, knowing that finally ' all things would work together for good to them that love God.' Rom. viii., 28. Any person or persons, who would demand of the Order the reason for their removal in order to effect a change in the gift felt best for them, or feel out gifts for themselves, and press them on the Order, have not yet made the Apostolic consecration, nor a fruitful travel in Christ's gospel. Querist�' Well, now, for the delicate questions I had thought of asking, and must again beg to be excused. As you have spent your long life of near four score years in familiar converse and social relations with the fair sex, allow me, if you please, without of- fense, to ask you if in all this time, in youth, or vigorous manhood, you have never at any time felt at least a streak of love to one or more, with a desire of marriage ? ' Answer�O yea, I have been tempted in all points, as Christ was, but in the particular cases you mention, I found upon critical and minute self-examination, as many streaks of lust as there were of love ; this caused a hesitancy and deliberation, when conscience began to speak and object, and faith stepped in, and the two together enabled me to say as did the Savior: 'Get thee behind me, Satan.' O yea, fortunes have been offered me, if I Avould fall down and worship the Beast, and each time Christ's words rang in my heart. 'What will it profit you if you gain the whole world and lose your soul ? ' This one electric flash settled the question. I have almost had his experience in other respects�like Him it is possible I may have been carried to the holy city, and (in imagination) was set on the pinnacle of the temple�where it is possible God may have found me when lie sent me to Ohio to be fed on humble pie for a season ; of this, however, I have not been informed. Querist�'One more question (have patience with me, please) and I will cease to trouble you. Have you, in all these eighty years, never so far departed as to have sexual connection with, or to kiss, or to be kissed, by any fair loved one ?' Answer�Never : neither the one or the other ; and if my sainted and consecrated Mother ever kissed me I am wholly ignorant of the fact. Querisl�' Well, Mr. Eads, I must sav this much : Faith is a much stronger motor than J had supposed, but will add that you have missed a world of pleasure. ' Answer�And you. may further add and say : 'You have missed a world of pain. ' Querist�'Possibly, and I must further confess that your works have been better than mine, if your faith is not. I would prefer being saved by faith alone.' Answer�The multitude is with you. ' For straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there be that find it. '
