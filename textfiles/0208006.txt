How do We do It ? The New YorJc Tribune lately reported that some seceding Shaker was lecturing against the protective measures instituted among the Shakers, upon shaking hands, kissing, etc., at the same time dilating upon the beauty and necessity of celibacy. It is refreshing to us to have The Tribune ' give it as our opinion, that when our friends, the Shakers, yield the point of kissing, celibacy will naturally go next.' When those, inimical to us, complain of our celibacy, we are led to remember how much we have suffered upon the charge of secret corruption, and since it is not a question, but a charge, how we live, we force the question, ' How do we do it ?' When any attempt Christian celibacy and succeed, without many simple abstainences and effective crosses, then we will admit being over scrupulous, and extravagant crossbearers. *
