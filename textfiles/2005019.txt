Hancock, Mass. The mild winter sent the ice hunters into this section. Some of them located their works about a mile from us on the shores of the Richmond Lake and the good Sisters provided them with food. At one time we had. thirty men and ten horses as boarders. We fed and lodged them as best we could. Your Sisters in Canterbury would hardly been able to have kept those tubs of bntter if they had a four weeks call from such a company. The company makes a liberal conpensation for all favors, and the ice busiuess it is thought, will bring an increase into this section of $500 000 and the laboring class get a good share of it. The company at Richmond Lake cut some one hundred thousand tons. For six weeks there has been two and three North Family. hundred teams drawing ice from the Onota and Pontookuc Lakes which are six miles from our Village. I. Lawson.
