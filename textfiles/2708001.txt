THE FUNERAL OF ELDRESS LOIS WENTWORTH. By Cecelia DeVere. ~T~V'T'E all have experiences at times that we know are not exclusively V V our own, and we long to communicate them to kindred souls. In ti e departure from this life of beloved Eldress Lois we met a loss,�we feel a sorrow that should be shared by the Household of Faith for she loved all Zion. Firm, true and hopeful was her spirit, broad was her mind and warm her affectionate parental heart. We loved her as a mother in Israel. We saw her enduring and faithful in the duties of her cherisht home and there we honored her, not only as a mother but as a Queen, crowned by angels and commissioned to administer the virgin laws of their holy life. By her wise tenderness she gathered and held twelve young girls,�they were her treasure. She labored to implant in them the principles she had tested and the virtues that were her own. If the good Brethren and Sisters in all our consecrated homes could have seen that stricken band they would pray for those young people that they may still prove loyal to her and make her glad by their confiding obedience to her beloved successors, the sincere and worthy souls who are now appointed to be the visible guides. It was a solemn assembly on the day of the burial. The ever helpful Ministry were present, going about as comforting angels to the bereaved little family. The memorial services were feelingly opened by Elder Louis Basting and the Ministry's words of appreciation for Eldress Lois covered her life from childhood to the close of her seventy-five years that kept her still bright and active. Her unreserved devotion to the welfare of others and her living spirit that went forth to humanity, making her an Elder indeed, were most lovingly spoken of and the tributes that followed their testimonies l'esembled the jewels in the Breast-plate of old, beautiful and of great value. The tides of sympathy that swelled even from the hearts of the silent were like the waters of life. Although the day was dark, and cold gusts of wind brought rain, into that house of sorrow came a spiritual light and warmth that shed consolation. Trusting the dear ones to immortal guardians we left Hancock in the spirit of prayer. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
