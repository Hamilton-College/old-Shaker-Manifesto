IN MEMORY OF ELIZA FOWLER, Gently rests her weary spirit, Free from strife and earthly care; Far beyond this world of sorrow, To those mansions ever fair. Long was she a faithful toiler In the vineyard of the Lord; Now the strife on earth is ended, She will reap her just reward. Why then should we mourn the parting, Could we wish her back to earth, Since she's gone to swell the number Who have found the heavenly birth. Thus when we like her have conquered, And our journey here is o'er; We may hope some day to meet her On that distant shining shore. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
