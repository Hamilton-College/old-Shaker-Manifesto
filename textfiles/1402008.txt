CHRISTIAN CONTENTMENT. FANNIE GILLEHI'LK. Paul gives us a good lesson on this subject in 1 Tim. vi., 6. ' Godliness with contentment is great gain. ' We think he referred to those who when trying to be content, still were restless, wishing to be more than God in his wisdom intended or made them to be. We are too prone to move along desiring most, that which affords selfish pleasure, rather than spiritual growth. Christian graces are developed by adherence to Christian principles ; contentment is found, by daily bearing the Christian cross against discontent, impatience with ourselves, and dissatisfaction with our lot in life. Discontent leads the mind ' into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.' Let us use every talent we may possess as a divine gift and thus return to our Master his own with usury. The root of Content is found in the recognition of God's love, his mercy, his truth, and a trust in his promises which are sure to the upright and faithful. ' He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might He increaseth strength.' No child at our table needs his daily bread, more than every child of God needs the Christian grace of true Contentment. Canterbury, N. IT.
