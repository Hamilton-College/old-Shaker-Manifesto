The fact that England is exporting humblebees to some of her eastern domains, for the valuable purpose of fertilizing red clover, calls to our mind that in one of the earlier works of Darwin, this keen observer treated on the subject of cats and clover. In said work, he estimated the number of mice hi the fields from the number of cats in the vicinity; and the number of bees by the number of mice nests remaining for the bees' households. He summed up thus: The more cats, the less mice; consequently the less humblebees; and with these wanting to fertilize the clover, the Isss clover. England, in transporting bees to New Zealand, is paying a grand tribute to the wisdom of Darwin. *
