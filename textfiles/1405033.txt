Ever complaining, nothing is right... Ever complaining, nothing is right; Daylight is dreary, wearisome night: Ever rejecting, quick to destroy The little that's left for our life to enjoy! Shame on the nature thankless and vain, Shame on the temper eager to pain! Hearts that in selfishness only are cast; Dark'ning the present with clouds of the past! Sad that the Summer of life should be spent In blighting the roses for happiness sent; Sad that afflictions so often should grieve Our natures that seem only born to deceive! Charles Strain.
