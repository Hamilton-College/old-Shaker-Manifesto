Many persons find it difficult to believe that a miracle... Many persons find it difficult to believe that a miracle ever took place. Science insists upon it that the universe is governed by unchanging and unchangeable laws. The Scriptures are rejected by some because of the miraculous element in them. It should be borne in mind that the grandest miracles recorded in the Scriptures are the miracles of life regenerated and ennobled by the gospel and by the spirit of God. De Quincey has well said that no exhibition of blank power�not the arresting of the earth's motion�not the calling of the dead back to life, can approach in grandeur to this miracle which we daily behold, namely, the inconceivable mystery of having written and sculptured upon the tablets of man's heart a new code of moral distinctions, all modifying �many reversing�the old ones. What could have been thought of any prophet, if he should have promised to transfigure the celestial mechanics; if he had said, I will create a new pole star, a new Zodiac, and new laws of gravitation; briefly, I will make a new earth and new heavens? And yet a thousand times more nwful was it to undertake the writing of new laws upon the spiritual conscience of man. The Prophet of the Lord said, Instead of the thorn, shall come up the fir-tree; instead of the brier, shall come up the myrtle-tree. This is the everlasting sign or miracle, which shall never be cut off. If all admit, as all must admit, that the gospel of Jesus Christ changes men in heart, in thought, and in character, we must not stumble over the account of the stilling of the tempest, or of the cleansing of the leper, or even of the raising of the dead. The greater includes the less. Selected.
