Canaan, N. Y. July 1891. Beloved Elder Henry :�There is so much good in the Manifesto that I wish to acknowledge my appreciation of it. Well, I am writing you some Home Notes, so as to be in union with the other Believers, as we like so well to hear from them. On the night of June 17th. we experienced a very heavy wind, that injured, but did not destroy our grape vines. It whipped and thrashed the tomato plants so much that we feared the elements would destroy them, but at this date all the garden crops appear quite promising, and we may have something substantial for the future. On the 25th. of June we picked our first peas from the garden, and that is pretty fair for Canaan. In fact, it is the earliest date for gathering peas that has been known during this generation. Strawberry picking has come, and a strawberry short-cake, some less than a foot thick and of a goodly diameter, soon comes from the Sisters' department and so palatable and so sweetly delicious! I tell you what it is beloved Editor, privately of course, if, well, if they�could only take care of the garden crops, they might infuse a magnetic influence into the food. Our Sisters have done considerable in the garden this season, in the setting of tomato and cabbage plants, and a general care in watering them during the dry season, etc. They prefer to do a little gardening rather than to have so much hired help. On the 29th. of June we had the pleasure of seeing a company of Sisters from the Society at Enfield, N. H. The company was most acceptable and the visit very enjoyable. Of late we have been drawing a few tons of Rye straw over the mountain to Lenox, thirteen miles distant. It is an all day job for Brethren and teams, and would pay fairly well if Lenox mountain was removed into the sea. The cherry season is upon us and with the help of crows, robins, boys and other birds, and the help from our worthy Sisters we expect to secure about all that nature is capable of producing on a cherry tree. Have done very little haying as yet, July 5th. but shall begin at once with a full determination to get through before Christmas. So it goes, and Ave must be up and at it all the time, in season and out of season. Accept much love and many thanks for the good contained in the Manifesto. Your Brother, G. W. C.
