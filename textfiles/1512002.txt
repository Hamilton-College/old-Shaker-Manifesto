CIRCUMSTANCES. JOSEPH WOODS. Turn as we will or plan as we may, circumstances often bear the sway. A family of children would have had an education if the father had not spent so much of his income for tobacco and rum. It became necessary for the support of the family that they should leave their school and form an acquaintance with that class which the boy in Oliver Optic's called *'workuses. ' St Paul was a lawyer. It is said that he was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel and taught the perfect law of the fathers. Paul was able to preach the gospel as the Spirit gave him utterance. The circumstance of his education enabled him to give us his permission gospel, of t; all things to all men.' Had it not been for his education, his writings might have been as few as some of the other apostles, and possibly his permission gospel would never have been written. Some individuals are so deficient in their creation, physically, intellectually and morally that a life time would not suffice, under good teaching, lo bring them to be good moral people. Two acorns, equally alike, fall from the parent tree. One falls into a space where there is a good proportion of sunshine and shade. It germinates and grows until it becomes the monarch of the forest. The ship builder finds in it some of his most valuable timber. The other acorn falls under the wide spreading branches of a hemlock. This also germinates and shoots up among the branches of the overshadowing tree, which being swayed by the wind breaks the top of the young oak and obliges it to remain a mere scrub,�nothing more.�Man was made a free agent. Had this not been in the creative plan it would seem to us a wise thing for God to sweep from the generative world all that were not perfect in their generations, and even those that did not remain so. I suppose that St. Luke gave us the right solution when he said that where much is given, much will be required, and where little is given, little will be required. This being the fact, the man having but one talent has far less responsibility than the one having ten talents, and yet it may puzzle him more and cause him more anxiety of soul to place his one talent where it would be safe from harm and draw interest, than it would the man with ten talents. Sometimes we think,�What have we in the talent line? Neither birth nor education ever gave us a shadow of a chance in comparison with St. Paul, and even he compared preaching to foolishness. If all were as we are, where would the preachers be? We thank God that all are uot like us. If we were to be the mouth-piece to preach the gospel, we should be obliged to tarry at Jerusalem until we received power from on high, and the probabilities are that we should make a protracted visit before that propitious moment should arrive. Yet we will not be faithless as was the 'ate keeper in the day of Elisha the prophet. One of the apostles has said, There are diversities of gifts, and something may meet our capacity in some quiet way. God has placed some in the Church as Apostles, some Prophets, some Teachers, some Workers of Miracles, some gifts of Healing, some Helps, governments, diversities of tongues. It is possible that we may help in some way. The poor widow with two mites cast more into the treasury of the Lord, than the rich man. We will give freely all that we have. Canterbury, N. H.
