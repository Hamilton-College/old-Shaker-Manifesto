In Memory of our Aged Father, MERRILL BAILEY. Fannie Casey. Softly as the day declineth, Gently as the waters flow Came the summons for our father To the Summer Land to go. He was ready for the summons Waiting, praying for the time When from earth he would be wafted To a holier, happier clime. Weak and trembling were his footsteps, White the locks that once were brown And the voice so strong in manhood Age, had made to different sound. All these weaknesses are over, Strong again we know thou art True and noble, sainted father Ready now to act thy part. Thou wert ever firm and loyal, To the cause of truth and right, Thou wert ever true and faithful In thy duty day and night. 134 THE MANIFESTO. Thy pure life of holy virtue As a guiding star will be To the faint and weary pilgrim Tossed about on life's rough sea. We shall honor, love and bless thee All thy acts of kindness done, We shall keep in fond remembrance Dearest father, faithful one. Let thy holy presence cheer us On our journey here below Let thy love and blessing keep us Where no harm our souls shall know. And when we shall end life's battle May we find a home with thee, Until then, farewell dear father, Happy spirit, blessed and free. Alfred, Me.
