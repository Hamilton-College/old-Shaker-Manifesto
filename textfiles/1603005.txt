NEVER FROWN. [Contributed by Harriet Shepard.] What though you miss some promised joy, Or wayward chance some hopes destroy, What though a lurking fear annoy? Tread it down. Keep ever on a smiling face, For 'tis the most bewitching grace ; And he who smiles will win the race. Never frown. If angry thoughts sometimes arise, If passion glitters- in your eyes, Ere angry words to lips arise Tread them down. A smile of scorn is better far, Than threatened words of instant war, When in the right you know you are, Never frown. But when you feel your breast within, A thought that stranger there has been, And one whic,h conscience tells is sin, Tread it down. Then, only then, restrain your smile, Nor let that thought remain awhile, Lest, straying, let your heart beguile, Even frowns. Selected.
