REIGN OF TRUTH. By Elder John Whiteley. God bless the hope and longing for A gift so much desired By every child of Mother Ann. And may he teach us what it is In us that is required To do, the best and all we can While by his love inspired. THE MANIFESTO. 83 Or patiently to wait and see His will and work, divine. The great salvation from our God We know 'twill come in his good time. Nor would we once repine, To hope is joyto wait is gain; Till then, we'll kiss the rod. The world hath need,who hath not need? Of love and life divine. The fount of good still overflows ; There is enough for every one That wish Christlike to shine. Let's do our best, and meekly say, Thy will, O God, be done. Shirley, Mass.
