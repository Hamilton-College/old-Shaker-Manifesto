Harvard, Mass. May, 1896. Looking at the calendar we are reminded of our duty to The Manifesto. If we wish our magazine to prosper and continue to regale us both spiritually and mentally we must not fail to contribute what we are able to its support. The sad demise of our beloved Elder John Yance brought the Central Ministry East, and they sojourned with us a few days at Harvard and Shirley. Their presence was refreshing and comforting. How can we but sorrow when the good, the true,to whom we look in confidence for help and sympathy in times of need are taken from us and we see them no more? Our next winter's supply of wood is all housed. The maples are now yielding up their sweets, which keeps some of our people busy gathering it and reducing it to syrup. Spring work on the farm is progressing finely for the late spring. Crocusses and snowdrops are opening their petals to catch the sun's rays, and a few robbins and bluebirds have made their appearance among the leafless trees. Joyfully we hail the spring. Marcia M. Billiard.
