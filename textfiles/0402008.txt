WASTE-BASKET SYMPATHY Beloved Editor : Knowing that our little Monthly has its waste-basket, I have resolved to contribute my mite to its support. Truly, by the aid of the ' Shaker and Shakeress,' light is increasing. It is a messenger of truth, and that too from the center of Christ's vineyard on the earth. I am with you, in spirit, in your effort to direct, through its columns, mistaken souls to the Fountain of eternal life. Its manner of dealing such persistent, untiring blows at the root of the tree of evil; of defending truth against error; of holding up light against darkness; and the sharp testimony it maintains against all sinful indulgences, make it, not only a bulwark of defense, but an invading power, before which depraved hearts must quail. For not only the Divine Searcher of the heart, but his chosen people also, by and through his Spirit, are made able to discern between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him not. I enjoy much satisfaction in perusing the truths set forth in the little sfteet for the edification of those who have ears to hear and hearts to receive ; that they may be as a lamp to their feet, and light to their path, to lead them from Babylon to Zion. I believe many souls will date the origin of their first light and conviction in the present testimony of Christ's second appearing â€” yea, and their final salvation, to the impressions received through this herald of truth. Then, how encouraging to continue its publication. I am thankful for this means provided for the extension of the knowledge of the way of salvation, that honest seekers after truth maybe convinced that in Zion is opened a fountain, where sin-sick souls may be washed from uncleanness, and rejoice that they have found their Father and Mother's House. I unite, with every feeling of my soul, in this call of the still, small voice of the Spirit, to the weary and heavy laden. David Orcutt, Enfield, Conn.
