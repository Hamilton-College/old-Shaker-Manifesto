Cure of Dry Teat A correspondent of the American Jersey Bulletin (Judge Beer, of Bucyrus, 0.), writes to that journal: « * * 'when she calved last year she lost one of her hind teats, and gave no milk from it during the year. * * I had noticed in the Country Gentleman (March 7, 1878, p. 155), that Dr. Home prescribed fluid extract of scoke root (Phytolacca decandra). I gave it internally and applied it externally, beginning ten days before calving. It had a marked effect from the first. The cow had commenced ' making bag' before the medicine was used, in the three sound quarters only. Immediately after its use the other quarter began to develop, and at the time of calving (December 2) was nearly as large as the others, and continued growing until it became so, and yielded as much milk as the rest. The cure is perfect.' [Dr. Home's directions are: Ten days or a week before calving, give one drachm of the extract in one ounce of rain-water, increasing to two drachms, and rub on a little of the same a day or two before and after calving—rub in hard. On no account allow the cow to become plethoric. — Ed. Manifesto.
