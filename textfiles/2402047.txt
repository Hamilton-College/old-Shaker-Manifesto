THE INDIAN HELPER THE INDIAN HELPER, is the name of a little paper sent us from the Indian Industrial School at Carlisle, Pa. 10, 000 copies are published weekly and the Publisher would be glad to have it, 100,000. The Indian boys do the printing but the editorial work is done by a white man. Send for a copy of the paper and see what is being done by the little Indians.
