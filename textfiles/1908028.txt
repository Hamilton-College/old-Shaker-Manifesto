GIVING THE BEST. Let us not be content with serving the Lord a little, with giving Him the odds and ends of life; the cold crumbs and broken fragments, as it wer.\ that fall from life's table. Thousands of people are perfectly willing to be Christians if their discipleship will not interfere in the slightest degree with anything else that they wish to be or do. In fact their sole purpose seems to be to solve the problem how to grasp the world with one hand, and to keep hold of heaven with the other. They do not seem to care for any stars in their crown, for any sheaves in their garner. 'A starless crown and a third-rate harp in heaven,' they seem to say, 'are good enough for me, if I can only keep from getting shut out forever.' Such service is little better than no service. In fact, we are not sure that it is considered service at all. If we read our Lord's life correctly, He would not have allowed such people to count themselves arao..g his disciples. If there was one thing about which He was emphatic, it was that if any one would be his disciple he must take up his cross. What sublime courage it was for a friendless young man, as He appeared to be, to turn away the rich young ruler from his standard, when his cause seemed to be in such desperate need of influence and wealth, simply because he lacked one thingï¿½because he would not give up all for Christ! His demands are just as imperative now. He asks our all and our best, or nothing. He never makes a compromise with any soul, and that soul dreadfully deludes itself that thinks it can make a compromise with Christ, and gives Him anything less than all it is or hopes to be. The Good Way.
