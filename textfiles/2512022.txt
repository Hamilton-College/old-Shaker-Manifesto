Sabbathday Lake, Me. Nov. 8, 1895. November 2nd, we had from two to three inches of snow, but since then the weather has been remarkably fine and spring-like. People say they never knew it to be so warm at this time of year; yet before long we shall have to be gathering round the fire for the storms of winter will surely come. Through the untiring efforts of Sr. Aurelia, much needed improvements are being made in our Office. The young Brethren are completing a larger hot-house 15x50 ft. In a portion of which the Sisters will grow tea roses and carnation pinks this winter, while the rest of the house will be used for the cultivation of early vegetables. We were glad to hear a word of encouragement from Florida. Trust those faithful workers will be prospered in their consecrated efforts, and that each plant and tree now started will yield an abundant increase. Four aged ones are still with us each over fourscore. We are thankful for every day that they remain with us although we see that they are gradually growing more feeble and must soon join their companions in a far happier home than this. Ada S. Cummings.
