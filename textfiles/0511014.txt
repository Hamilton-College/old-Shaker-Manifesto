J. M. Peeble's book of Travels Around the World is... J. M. Peeble's book of Travels Around the World is the first volume of this character that does justice to Brahmins, Buddhists, Parsees and other religionists commonly called 'Heathens.' He pronounces the morality of the orientals superior to that of Christian nations, and proves it. Drunken Mahommedans are unknown. Human life is safer in Canton, Calcutta, Bombay, and Cairo, than in New York or Chicago. Some of the dervish orders in Mahommedan countries are celibates. The Spiritualism of the Chinese, Hindoos and men of the South Sea Islands is fully described. The work is published at the Banner of Light office, Boston, Mass.
