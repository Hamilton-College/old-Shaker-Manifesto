Geneveve De Graw and all Dear Friends:--I am happy... Rochester, N. Y., Mar. 24, 1891. GeNEVEVE De GrAW AND ALL DEAR Friends :ï¿½I am happy to hear again through the columns of the Manifesto that the little band of Believers at Sonyea are still holding the fort and enjoying the usual amount of the comforts and blessings of life. Glad to hear that brother Clark is improving, hope he will soon be able to assume his wonted place. I was shocked to read the account of the lynching of the poor Italians at New Orleans recently. Shall such a spirit of hatred and revenge be allowed to run riot, scattering death and destruction everywhere? Public sentiment may possibly excuse the lynchers but if so the fact will be a terrible condemnation to that sentiment. Expediency wrhen pleaded in extenuation of such gross and heinous crimes becomes most absurd and ridiculous. Such outbreaks are but the natural fruit and results of the selfish, lustful lives men choose to live. It shows that beneath the smooth and fair exterior there is a force at work powerful enough to disrupt all political and social bands and engulf our boasted civilization in the chaos of despair. I tremble for our country. I am alarmed for the free institutions founded by our fathers in equal rights and justice to all. New Orleans has succeeded a treaty of Justice by a flagrant violation of our Constitution, the superior law of the land. This is as the alarm of danger, only an index of the hidden and powerful forces which threaten the present conditions. Will the alarm be heeded, will men open their eyes to the light of day, will they see in the formation of society the very elements of disintegration and death ? The cure is in their own hands. Eliminate selfishness, recognize the actual equality of the rights of mej, assume a universal brotherhood, abolish individual property, accept common property and the foundation is laid on the everlasting rock of righteousness, upon which may be constructed, by the faithful observance of the laws of our being and the practical enforcement of the Golden Rule, a structure which shall stand in beauty and pride, truly the light of the world. Let us hope these repeated warnings may lead to the hoped for consummation. I have no news of importance to communicate. My health is as usual, the weather is warm but damp and showery. I hope you may all continue well and that the coming season may be a profitable one in every way to you. Give my love to all not forgetting a little girl called Agnes. With love, Fredrick A. Stebbins.
