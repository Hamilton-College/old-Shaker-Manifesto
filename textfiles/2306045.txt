Prof. Nelson Sizer discusses the Ministry in his series on Human Pursuits and illustrates it happily. Governor Matthews, of Indiana, is written up by one who evidently knows him. Those who are really interested in domestic life and true social development will read 'Let Them Alone' and 'The Doctrine of Paternal Authority,' both articles by well known writers.
