ISSACHAR BATES.-N0. 7. BY H. C. BLINN. Issachak remained in Busro about two weeks at which time the subject was quite universally discussed having reference to the final removal of the Believers from the settlement. The malarial condition of the climate caused so much sickness, which in many cases resulted in death that it seemed hazardous in the extreme to attempt the continuance of a community in such a place. It had been proposed that the members of this Society should be received into those now established in the states of Ohio an'd Ky. and this arrangement was accepted by those who resided in Busro. Issachar has not entered into any details concerning the departure from the Indiana Society but makes this simple statement. ' The removal from Busro took place in March 1827 and Oh what a trying day it was.' After Issachar had closed his visit in Busro, he sorrowfully bade it farewell, and made a journey on horseback to Pleasant Hill. Ky. a distance of 100 miles. 'Here we (Joshua Worley and himself) were gladly received and kindly treated. ' After a tarry in this place of five days they passed on to Union Village, a distance of 140 miles, reaching the village on the fourth day. On the 10th Sept. lie went onto Watervliet, Ohio. He remained at this Society till June 1st 1830 when he, in company with Elder Solomon King, journeyed to Watervliet, N. Y. to see once more the friendi of his first gospel home. Nearly twenty six years had passed since he was called to New Lebanon and by the Ministry ot that place commissioned as a missionary to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in the then, great West. They made a call of a few days at North Union, Ohio, and then at the settlement at Port Bay, and then on to Watervliet. They crossed Lake Erie in a steamboat and then took the canal at Buffalo for Lyons and from Lyons to Albany, N. Y. On their arrival at Watervliet. Issachar says. 'The place of my former residence began to feel like a new world to me. For ten days we feasted on love and good-will and on many precious treasures. ' They next visited New Lebanon, N. Y. and after a few days passed on to Hancock, Mass. Deacon Daniel Goodrich accompanied them to Enfield, Ct. Keturning they again call at Hancock, 'where' as Issachar writes, ' we were favored with every privilege we could wish.' They again call at New Lebanon 'and their kindness and loveliness was one steady stream. ' And he says this of every place. They now return to Watervliet, N. Y. and after a few days take a canal boat at Schenectady and in five days were again in North Union, Ohio a distance of 500 miles. ' In a few days we were again on board a canal boat bound for Newark, Licking Co., then in a stage to Springfield, Clark Co., at this last place we have a conveyance in a wagon to Watervliet Mont. Co., where we arrived Aug. 20, 1830. ' In Mar. 26, 1832, Issachar was relieved from his official duties. Since Sept. 10th 1826 he had been an active and efficient Rider in the Society and was loved and honored by all who knew him. In 1833 lie again visited South Union and Pleasant Hill at the request of Elder Benjamin Youngs who was at this time, in the Ministry of South Union. He spent several months in these Societies, and shared bountifully in the good gifts of a loving people. He again visited Union Village on his way to Watervliet, reaching home in the early part of Sept. The infirmities of old age were now making active inroads upon his health, and the dear Brother certainly thought that his days would soon be numbered. He had even selected the spot for his last resting place, and bid farewell to many dear friends. Many more days however were to be added to his pilgrimage in time, more changes were to be made and more crosses to be borne before the last fareAvell word could be said to all his gospel friends. When Summer came a better degree of health was realized and he was able to do some light work in the garden. In June 183-i the Ministry of New Lebanon sent an invitation to Brother Issachar to visit them and also to make their home, his future home. Several other persons were to accompany him on the journey, which added a little pleasure to the very great cross which he now felt in leaving his western friends. He writes, � ' Then I thought of my grave, the place I had selected. But there was no way to get into it, and no one to help me ! And as there is no discharge in this woe, I must go with the gift. ' After many words of blessing, many expressions of loving kindness and many genuine yet sorrowful farewells, he left Watervliet on the 14th of May 183u. It had been just thirty years, four months and fourteen days since he left New Lebanon as a missionary to the western world He now writes.�' We went on our way like loving children, and although I was full of sorrow, yet I could take comfort. I told our company that this was my retreat. I had played it on the fife a great many times, but I had never had such a retreat as this one, and then composed the following verses. THE RETREAT. Time is like a bubble Floating on the main; Puffed with joy or trouble, Bursts and forms again. On high waves is fleeting, Takes its windy race Down 'tis next retreating, Takes the lowest place. So in all my motions Tossing up and down Puffed with various notions, How I'll win the crown Time will still be fleeting, Rifles all my plans Half the time retreating, Not one notion stands. Time is always changing, Never standing still I am always ranging Sight against my will In a joyful meeting If I take my stand Next I am retreating To some distant land. O let time forever Be removed from me ;� 0 eternal Savior Take me home to tl'.ee 1 am sick of fleeting, Let my days be few, I'll in my last retreating Bid the world adieu. The company arrived safely at New Lebanon on the 9th of June, having made a short visit at North Union Ohio and Watervliet, N. Y. while on the way. ' On reaching my home in New Lebanon every Believer I met was full of .loving kindness and tender compassion for me. This is a glorious place and the people all look glorious to me, and they are lovely and altogether beautiful. Elder Issachar continued quite comfortable in health till a short time before his death. After an illness of ten days he passed away on the 19th of March, 1837, being nearly 80 years of age. ' Issaehar Bates had a very remarkable experience and passed through many trying scenes, lie was active and powerful, devoted soul and body. He possessed an extraordinary talent for discoursing with persons of all characters on religious subjects, whether for inquiry, argument or opposition, always ready for an answer, and not afraid to meet any man or any subject whatever. He was a battle-ax to a'll hypocritical professors and a thorn to wrong-doers. He was very plain in his speech, rather humorous, generally setting off' his remarks with an anecdote or story. His mind was a store-house of information and with him we part with a treasure of knowledge and information. All his words and actions seemed calculated to inspire life and confidence in God's work. Of thee beloved Elder Issachar may it be said, ' Well done good and faithful servant, enter thou into the the joy of thy Lord.' ' (To BE CONTINUED.)
