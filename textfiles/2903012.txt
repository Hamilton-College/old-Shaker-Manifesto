Shakers, N. Y. Feb. 1899. We endorse without reserve all thatBr. George H. Baxter has stated in February Manifesto in reverencing the character of those departed saints, but would kindly suggest the following amendment. While it is beneficial to the individual soul to contemplate the example of those who have past over to the other side; be it resolved that we will not wait for that time to arrive but remember those pure and brave souls who are at present in the battle of life and gather from them that blessed inspiration which flows from those exalted lives and who are waiting patiently to be seen and appreciated. Those who have past to the evergreen shores faithfully performed their duty. We are here to perform ours; to be strengthened by their noble example. But to those weary and overburdened souls who are ready to give their lives for the truth, a kind word and a sympathetic look is accepted with a blessing; let us give it in overflowing measure. Day by day as we watch old Sol's advance as he moves northward, we are reminded that time is swiftly passing and soon Spring will be here with her inspiration in song-birds and flowers, and with toil on the farm and garden. The efforts that have been made in the later years to lift agriculture and horticulture out of the rut where it was supposed any ignoramus who was not fit for anything else could be a farmer or gardener, are bearing excellent fruit. Farming is classed with the most advanced scientific attainments, where brains and an intellectual training, as well as physical development are the factors that make the successful farmer and gardener.
