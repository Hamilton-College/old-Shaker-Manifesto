LINES IN MEMORY OF OUR SISTER ELEANOR VEDDER, D. AUSTIN BUCKINGHAM. [See Dec. Manifesto, 1883.] We have met to perform our last duty to one who has hut lately closed her eyes to the things of time and the trials of this earthly sphere. She acted well her part while in the body, and was true and faithful unto the end ; and we read that such shall be saved. She passed thnragh the trials and sufferings of life, keeping in view the bright side of her faith and conviction, and indeed, it may be said of her, that her long life and character is without spot or blemish. She has been a faithful burden-bearer a great portion of her life, having experienced the ups and downs of society life, and through all, led her course quietly and in a peaceable manner. Her kindness was not limited and partial, but extended to all without reserve. The poor and needy were remembered especially. She proved herself a true disciple of our blessed Parents in Heaven. We have reason to believe she had overcome the world in the same sense that Jesus declared that he had overcome the world. And his promise to such was,�' To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down witli my Father in his throne. ' She came among Believers n the morning of her days, in company with her sistei s, four in number. They were young and in good circumstances as to means for worldly enjoyments, all of which were cheerfully sacrificed for the one great and holy object�the redemption of their souls. She was the eldest of a family of five sisters, and has outlived nearly all of them, being over four score and ten years. We read, ' Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord. ' And also, ' To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a New Name written, which no man knoweth saving him that receiveth it. ' Dear Friends�I have not left you, My spirit still is near, To comfort and to bless you,� AH who the truth revere. Let no one feel discouraged, The way is free for all, And truth alone must save you, Obey your gospel call. Cheer up, ye sorrowing faces� I'm happy and secure, My love to you increases And will forevermore; For Christ thro' Mother blesses The true and honest heart, And such of heaven's glory Will surely have a part. My thanks and love, I give you� You are most dear to me, I claim you all, dear children, My joy yfith you shall be To endless ages growing, Increasing evermore, When you with me shall sing sweet songt With saints who've gone before. Adieu! adieu, dear kindred. Take faith and be ye strong : Faint not, nor be ye weary� But help each other on; For peace and quiet dealing With condescension sweet, Will make your earth-life pleasant, Your happiness replete.
