In Memory of our Departed Sister, KATIE DILLON. FIDELLA ESTABROOK. Ouk dear Sister now has left us, Gone to join the angel band, Gone to dwell with blest immortals In the blessed Summer Land. As a tender, fragile plant Left in uncongenial climes Droops its leaves then fades and withers On the barren shores of time. When transplanted in the sunlight Lifts it leaves in freshness up Sends forth tiny buds and blossoms, Holding high its floweret's cup. So her spirit now transplanted In the glorious realms above Is refreshed by dews of heaven Warmed by God's unbounded love. We shall miss this flower of beauty From the garden of our home, For her presence here was blessed She has earned the meed, 'Well done!' Hands found service for the Teacher, Feet each duty did fulfill, And her heart so loved his teaching That 'twas joy to do his will. Purity, was her adorning Star gem, crowning her with grace, So we'll dry our tears of mourning, With her run the heavenly race. Here no more shall we behold her, All life's ills with her are o'er; Time flies swiftly, soon we'll meet her On the bright and golden shore. West Pittsfield, Mass.
