THE MILLENNIAL AGE. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. The dispensation of the Spiritual Bride, ushered in by the Seventh Trumpet, establishes the rule of right over might. ' Thou Angel Woman who dost wear the Sun, And glow amid the orient horizon, With all th}' stars around thec, thou whose breath Is living tenderness o'ermastering death, Whose eyes reveal great heavens of love to be, Whose white bands sow the world with charity, WThose bounteous breasts an orphaned race might feed Dawn from thy upper sphere�the nations bked And anguish for thy coming; send thy hosts Of risen Angels; people all our coasts With thy bright myriads, numerous as the flowers; Pour down thy inspirations like the showers. Melt the hoar frosts of evil with thy smile ; Strike terribly each proud cathedral pile; Smite dumb prelatic lips that rail and curse And darken with their lies the universe; Break every yoke, let every bond one see Thy *Christ, and rise in love and wisdom free. So prays the weary hearted world. ' �Lyric of the Golden Age. Emep.sok, an intuitive seer, with great descriptive force, says, 'Our age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchers of the fathers. The foregoing generations beheld God face to face, we, through their eyes. Why should not we have poetry, and philosophy of insight, and uot of tradition [only.] and a religion of revelation to us, and not [merely] the history of theirs?' These utterances of poet and sage, voice a need of the age, and for every absolute need of humanity, an All-wise Providence has ample supply, accessible to all who will pay the price. This feeling is caused among the thoughtful and penetrating, by the present shaking of the powers of the old heavens, preparatory to their removal as a scroll when it is rolled together, which Jesus said would occur just before the appearing of the sign of the son of man in *Christ here means anointed female leader, teacher and emancipator. heaven. Hence it isfoue of the signs of our time. Jesus, on one occasion, upbraided the Jews who could forecast the weather by the face of the sky, for not discerning the signs of their time of spiritual visitation, implying that the latter are as plain to be interpreted as the former. Cariyle, gifted with almost spiritual insight, says, 'The crime of being deaf to God's voice, of being blind to all but parchment and antiquarian rubrics when the Divine hand-writing is abroad on the sky, certainly, there is no crime which the supreme powers do more terribly avenge.' To say that the revelations of the Holy Spirit given to man in ancient days are sufficient for all after generations, is .absurd, as it would be to suppose that all the suushine and showers necessary to fructify the earth for a year, should be given in one month, and leave the remainder to moonshine and desolation. What then shall be the estimate of the fragmentary record of that revelation which has no more light in itself than a broken mirror, or a chart which can reflect only the light which is brought to bear upon its interpretation. 'While the dead letter cannot compensate the absence of the life-giving spirit, it is yet of exceeding value as a history of spiritual experience and culture, and of the �dealings of the Holy Spirit with man in past ages, and as a witness of what that spirit designed further to accomplish. That revelation cannoi be final which announces another to succeed it, or which requires another to properly interpret it. It is true that Jesus foretold a cessation of revelation when he said the time would come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man and shall not see it. That the Sun would be darkened and the stars fall from heaven, and the night would come wherein no man could work the works of God. Micah uttered a similar prediction when he said, 'The Sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them that they shall not have a vision.' But when after this, mankind should see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of heaven, revelation would be restored. For none can see spiritual objects without spiritual sight, and such sight of holy beings, is itself a revelation. And as agreement is one criterion of truth, the new revelation must accord with the old in some degree, and the old must witness for the new, that it may be known to be the one announced. Those who have heard the call of the messengers whom Christ said he would send to gather his elect, at the end of the age, possess a revelation which marks the beginning of a new dispensation, wherein the judgment work makes a plain division between truth and error, light and darkness, and the tares from the wheat are separated in faithful Believers, with whom the harvest is begun. When the seven thunders uttered their voices in hearing of the Revelator, he was directed to seal up the things they spoke, and not write them. Then a mighty spiritual messenger raised his right hand toward heaven and testified that in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall -begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished. The voices of the seven thunders, are the voices of the seven Spirits of God, mentioned Rev. iv., 5, and are represented in the original, (Ch. x., 4,) in the feminine gender. Their utterances were not to be unsealed until the period of the seventh trumpet, which announced that the kingdom of this world had become, or was born of our Lord and his anointed. That is, was born of the spirit from above, that the time had come to judge the dead ; hence it was the time'for their resurrection, and to give reward to the servants and prophets of the Lord, and to those revering His name ; therefore it is the harvest season of the fruit of their painful labor and travail; and to destroy those that corrupt the earth ; that is, all the vile seed and products of the enemy of souls. If it is the season of judgment, it is also the season for promulgating the aiouian gospel. For the Revelator says (xiv. G. 7.) ' I saw an Angel flying in mid heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those dAvelling on the earth, to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people ; saying Fear God and give glory to Him, because the hour of His judgment has come ; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. ' Hence it will appear that human probation does not end with the beginning of the judgment, but in that solemn hour, the creature is instructed in a superior and abiding rule of life to walk by, (which being aionian, must ultimate in complete separation from error,) and starts upon a new probation, fora higher, spiritual state of existence. That is, to form in himself the character exemplified in Jesus, and in the 144, 000 virgins who stand with the Lamb on Mount Zion, (xiv.) which is the character and likeness of Sons and Daughters of God. In the Judgment, each revives in memory and carefully scrutinizes hispast history, perceives the value of the gifts and talents bestowed' by the Creator, with his present gain or loss by the right or wrong use of those gifts in the past, and feels the importance to his peace, well being, and happiness, of a wise improve men t of those gifts in the trial season that remains. Every transgression of known obligations must be atoned for by the labor or sufferings of the doer, in order to restore and preserve the equilibrium of the balance of Justice, before the culprit is released from self imposed indebtedness to the general economy of social life to which he belongs, and to which he owes the best use of the talents given him, for mutual increase, and benefit. The offense to the spirit of goodness, kindness, or mercy in others caused by wrong-doing, may be forgiven, that is, taken away, or covered, (which is what the scriptural atonement means, and nothing more,) by honest confession and repentance on the part of the offender. But evil consequences to ones self and associates, which have become the causes of other evils, and all their resulting progeny, can only be remedied by the toil or sufferings of the offender, sending forth an antidote, or countervailing good. The atonement effected by Christ, and still continued in his messengers, is an at-oue-ment of the will and desires of the creature, with the Divine will, in those only who accept the messengei'S in their mediatorial capacity. This restores the culprit to favor and enables him to cancel his debts by voluntary labor, instead of suffering; in duress and banishment. He that has been faithful in his first trial is prepared to advance, with the gain of his good conduct to assist him. All commence this new life with as full knowledge as can be given them of the results to themselves, both of obedience and disobedience, and as sure as God is just, He is pledged to give every soul a free and fair trial, and no final consequences can ensue to any soul, from actions not done with knowledge of their character, and in perfect freedom of choice. All have also, to assist them, the wisdom gained by experience and reflection, in their first trial. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
