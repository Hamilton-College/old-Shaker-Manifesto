SOUL OF SCIENCE Catharine Allen God is the centre of the universe. Religion is the soul of science. 'In Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.' Shakerism is not only in itself scientific, but being progressive, comprehends every principle of science. Those who esteem and seek goodness before any other attainment find the fountain source of all the streams of truth, that course through the universe ; while those who seek external knowledge through the outward senses,— at the expense of spiritual development, — may spend a life time in following one stream to its source.
