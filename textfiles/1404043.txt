I am richly rewarded in perusing the contents... Waupaca, Wis. Dec. 1883. I am richly rewarded in perusing the contents of the Manifesto. I look eagerly for it each month, and when I have finished reading it, I wish there was still more to read. Its influence is ennobling, and it leads the mind into the path of purity and deep piety, which brings the reward of peace. Harriet N. Miles.
