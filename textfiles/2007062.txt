The New England Magazine The New England Magazine for May opens with an article on Mr. Howells by Hanilin Garland. The remarkable change in spirit and purpose which marks Mr. llowells �later novels, especially A Hazard of New Fortunes, is what is chiefly dwelt upon, and Mr. Garland's socialistic inclinations lead him to write with the warmth which would be expected. The article is accompanied by a new portrait of Mr. Howells. A new portrait of George Kennan faces a stirring poem entitled 'Kara,' in which Mr. Allen Eastman Cross appeals to the world of good men to rise in protest against the Siberian outrages Mr. William M. Salter, in a brief article on Ethics in Politics, urges especially the divorce of municipal affairs from party considerations. The principal illustrated article in this number is a bright account, by Elizabeth Walling, of a March journey in a runabout along the Massachusetts North Shore, the paper abounding with interesting bits of antiquarianism and gossip about Beverly, Manchester, Magnolia and Gloucester. A beautifully illustrated article on 'Some Old Dorchester Houses,' by Mrs. Marion A. McBride, is also full of pleasant antiquarianism, and shows how finely some of our fathers housed themselves ; wo suggest that some of our modern architects und decorators learn lessons from the article, Mrs. Nina Moore Tiff mv contributes another of her stories of the Fugitive Sl-ives, and there are other articles touching p tints of New England history�one on t' e Mashpee Indians: another, very opportune ju�t at this time of the centennial celebration of the event, on 'How Rhode Island received the Con.-titution.' There is an article on the Cotton-gin, with portrait of Whitney and other illustrations ; a curious article on Dreams, ly Horatio King; some unusually 'ood love siories; and some poetry worth reading� which is saying not a little, as the magazines go nowadays. Mr. Hale contributes the customary installment of his bright 'Tarry at Home Travel.'
