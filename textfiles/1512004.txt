TRUE GREATNESS. MARTHA J. ANDERSON. Not iu (lie pomp and circumstance of state; Not in its war-like heraldry of fame; Its pride of power and striving for a name, Are found the qualities that make men great. No conquering strength its lauded heroes claim The beasts of passion to subdue and tame, And graceless heart-wilds to regenerate. True greatness forms the soul's sun-belted zone, Where virtue grows to heavenï¿½exalted deeds, Where good, all direful evil, supersedes, And love expands to meet all human need; Where righteous works, for errors past, atone, And mortal want and misery, are unknown. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
