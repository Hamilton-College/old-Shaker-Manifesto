FOODS FOR THE AGED. Some foods contain too much calcareous substance for health; but fruits, nuts, fish, venison and wild game contain only a very trifle of these calcereous salts and earthly particles, and are, therefore, very healthy for the aged. Fruits and distilled water are specifics for ossific depositions. A French physician observes That man begins in a gelatinous and ends in ah osseous condition.....In the human body water forms TO per cent, of its aggregate weight; in fact there is not a single tissue which does not contain water as a necessary ingredient. Now water holds certain salts in solution, which become more or less deposited, notwithstanding the large proportion eliminated through the secretions. Nevertheless it is only a matter of time before these minute particles deposited by the blood have a markt effect in causing the stiffness and aridity of advancing life. The reason why in early life the deposits of earthly salts are so infinitesimal is simply because they have not had time to accumulate. 'It is the old kitchen boiler which is found full of incrustations, not the new one, time not having been sufficient for their deposit. M. LeCann proved by analysis that human blood contains compounds of lime, magnesia and iron, averaging 2. lin every 1.000 parts. This clearly demonstrates that in the blood itself are contained the earth salts, which gradually become deposited in the system.'
