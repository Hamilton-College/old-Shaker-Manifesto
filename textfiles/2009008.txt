Luther and the Prayer Cure We can see in Luther the beautiful steppings of medical philosophy. He was taken quite sick. The custom of the time was to let out blood until the most of the fever and poison had run away in the red stream. Luther was a man of prayer In this particular he perhaps equaled any of the moderns. But he was also a wonderful student of human f.acts and nature's facts, and he came to the conclusion that cutting off food fir a few days would lessen the quantity of blood active and pure; so when the sixteenth century physician came with lancet ami ba-in Luther sent hin back unused as being less effective than fasting and lung walk-;. Luther says: 'I went without food and took long walks and got well ' Thus science cured Luther. When over with the attack no doubt the grand man thanked the Heavenly Father for such simple and beautiful laws of health. In our day the prayer of thousands should indeed be offered in the incipient stages of illness, but the burden of that prayer should be for grace and sense enough to be temper-rite in food and take a Lutheran walk every day.
