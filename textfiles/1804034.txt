THE ORIGIN OF WARS [James iv., 1.] There was tumult and there was din; There was Satan, and there was sin; There were groanings, and there were fears; Orphans' sighs, and widows' tears ; And there was cursing and piercing cry, And despair's last rending agony; And there were vultures, and worse than they, Hovering to gorge their human prey. Where were such sights, I pray thee tell? Where was on eartn so fierce a hell? There, where yon warriors armed and steel'd, Are cheering their troops to the battle field; There, where famed statesmen, and poets I ween, Declare 'tis a proud a glorious scene. But was there found, in that rilliant day, The heart to feel or the lip to pray? The accents of heaven or the looks of love, The Prince of Peace, or the Holy Dove? I say not what passes in secret souls, For dew-drops may fall while thunder rolls ; But I saw them not in the haggard cheek, I heard them not in the dying shriek; I marked them not in the frenzied eye; They calmed not the shouts of victory! They were lost in the yells of the frantic breath, That peal'd to the heavens for triumph or death ! They echoed not in the cannon's roar! I traced them not in the seas of gore. Star and Crown.
