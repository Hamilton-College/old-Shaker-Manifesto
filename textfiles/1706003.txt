A Tribute to the Memory of Sister Johanna Bloomberg. MARY JOHNSTON. Gone to thy rest, O dear worthy Sister, Gone to the land of thy bright happy home, Where joys evermore await thy pure spirit, And the message of comfort, my servant, well done. Gone, gone, fair jewel at noon of life's journey, In the beauty and glory and strength of thy prime; O ! how can we spare thee dear gentle Sister, From the fort of our Zion, with thy virtues sublime. O ! truly we need thy bright presence to-day, To aid against the spirit that error maintains; To hold forth the banner of the pure gospel way, For which thy example did nobly sustain. Deep on (he pages of memory i.re written, The halcyon daj-s with thy comrades below, Thy deeds of true merit to the Lord freely given, Are left as the seeds that will flourish and grow. Tho' marked the simplicity of the obsequies, No less do we prize the fair jewel of worth, And offer this, our simple tribute of praise, As token of love from gospel kindred of earth. Our spirits are sad while 'neath the chastening Yet, why should we mourn at thy happy release, For a myriad throng are chanting sweet pcans, Which welcome the victor to blight realms of peace.
