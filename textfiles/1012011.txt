Correspondence G. B. Avery, Shakers, N. Y. : Dear Sir : Enclosed, please find 60 cts. in stamps... Wyoming Chicago Co., Minn. Nov. 10, '80 G. B. Avery, Shakers, N. Y. : Dear Sir : Enclosed, please find 60 cts. in stamps, for which please send the Manifesto one year. I have examined the copies sent, and although I am not prepared to indorse quite all contained therein, yet there is so much that is good and true that I want to be a regular reader of it. I am a Methodist and heartily wish they might all adopt the unselfish living of the Shakers and the communism of property practiced by the Apostles. Yours very truly, NATHAN DAVIS
