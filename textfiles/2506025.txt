Union Village, o. April, 1895. Mabch has come and gone with his big blows and little snows, and snug days and wintry ways, and these we have utilized in sawing fire-wood with our twelve foot geared Air motor; a very economical power, requiring no feed and no fuel and always ready, when the wind blows, for any work requiring more than from one to ten horse power, according to the force of the wind. April is here, with her modest cheer, and gentle showers and early flowers, and corresponding to these, is the flow of life in our fraternal union. Free from extremes or forceful dreams and ever tending toward the settled warmth of fraternal love in the summer Land. The evenings are made cheerful by the long rows of fires in the big cornfields, the farmers burning the cornstalks; having been raked into winrows, and lighted almost simultaneously, the effect is very pretty. Health of Society usually good. Watson Andrews.
