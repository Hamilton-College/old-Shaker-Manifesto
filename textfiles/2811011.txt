Sabbathday Lake, Me. Oct. 1898. Having just read in the Oct. Manifesto, the very interesting account of our beloved Editor's visit, I am prompted to extend thanks to him for his kindly thoughts which are both interesting and instructive. We are enjoying a pleasant visit with two Sisters from Mt. Lebanon, Sarah Burger and Annie E. Stephens, also two from Harvard, Mass., Sister Olive Hatch, now over 90 years old, and erect and smart yet, and Sister Myra McLean. The meeting with these gives us a pleasant interchange and one that we very highly prize after the busy summer. Their presence among us is conducive to spiritual strength and the good influence thus shed upon all serves to draw us nearer to the God of purity and love. We have had several privileges the past summer. Prof. Osgood of Boston has kindly favored us with two hours musical training and made several short calls while he tarried at Poland Springs. Later, the two leading musicians from Poland Springs came down to our home and kindly gave us two concerts from the organ and violin. They belong to the Boston Symphony Orchestra which consists of eighty men. Our crops are almost harvested except the apples of which there are but fe w this season. Later, apple-pie will be 'a rarity' with us. Winter is close at hand and the Summer has past so quickly that it seems like a dream to look back over the past months. Ada S. Cummings.
