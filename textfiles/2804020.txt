CARELESSNESS-FORGETFULNESS. The usual excuse of a child for neglect of duty is 'I forgot.' This may be true, and yet not be an adequate excuse, for it is a part of one's duty not to forget to do it. Carelessness and forgetfulness are grave faults in children, which ought to be corrected lest they grow into habits. They are grave faults because they represent a selfish disposition, heedless of the wishes of those who have a right to direct, and one so absorbed in selfish thoughts and aims that all other things are forgotten. The child forgets to perform some allotted task because he is at play and his mind is concentrated upon his pleasures. He is careless about his manner of doing work because he is thinking of something else and anxious only to be releast. His faults in this respect, tho they may be trivial in themselves, have within them the seeds of a character dominated by self. The child whose selfishness renders him careless or indifferent acquires a bad reputation. It is in the interest of the child to prevent the formation of such habits which may be regarded as, at first, alternately the results of selfishness and a potent force for the development of selfishness. Discipline of some kind should be employed to admonish the child that he must remember what he has been told to do and must do his work well, as otherwise he will be thinking all the time of his own plans of enjoyment, and grow up not only careless and forgetful, but selfish. ï¿½Selected.
