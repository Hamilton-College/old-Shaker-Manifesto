When evil-designing and evil-speaking people come to us... When evil-designing and evil-speaking people come to us with their charges against others, tempting us, whether the accused persons are guilty or not, to condemn them, we find it some relief, especially when the whole matter is none of our business, to act as Christ did. 'as though He heard them not '(John viii., 6.) If they continue asking our opinion, a repetition of Christ's saying may silence them, ' He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone.' Perhaps, being convicted by their own consciences, they will go out until we are left alone, (verse 7.) Even when people are caught in the very act of crime it may not be our duty to pass judgment, but to urge amendment, (verse 11.) Even Christ came not to condemn the world, but to save it. Many of his professed followers act as if it was not their work to save sinners, but to sit in judgment upon them, even though they be sinners themselves, as great or worse. War Cry.
