If God's omnipotent, and reigns o'er all... If God's omnipotent, and reigns o'er all, The starry systems, great and small! Two hundred millions: they count at least, While billions of creatures on each would And provisions there for all. [feast, Yet puny, selfish, erring man, On this small world, for God, will plan ; Be teaching daily, what He should do, To save his race, or, at least a few! Perhaps 'tis best that He can do, From ' Adam's fabled fall. ' Why should a God to man not say; ''Leave me alone, I beg, I pray! For, should I your pleadings all obey, My God-ship would be cast away! And you would rule ; not I! Did I make worlds, and all life too, And know not then, what's best to do? That worms of dust, Yea erring man Should knuw what's best, and for me plan ! Don't I all life supply? Who brings your Seasons, rain and snow; Who makes all things on worlds to grow? Your fruits and flowers, all grain and seed, Your fish and beasts, all fowls I feed, Without their prayers each day ! Can you not learn—all Nature's plan ? How all was made for beast and man ! Can you not live and honest be ? Then never; need you pray to Me ! So I might rest, I pray ! ' (Amen.) — George Newcomer, M. D. Cleveland, Ohio
