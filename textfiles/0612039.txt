THIS IS NOT ALL E. T. LEGGETT If for this only man were bornâ€” To eat, to sleep, to dream and die* With smiles to greet each radiant morn, And frowns to face a lowering sky, To win more store of glittering gold Than he can use, or others spare, Or fame to grace, when life is told, The triumph of some thankless heir; To build, for pleasures by and by, A palace, in dreamland afar, Where clouds ne'er dim the azure sky, Nor darken hope's bright-beaming star; Where dreams ecstatic charm the night, And glowing schemes inspire the day, And darkness only pales to light. To show both dreams and life betray; To love where love makes no return; To hope and no fruition there; All life's rewards at death to spurn; This all, and who'd life's trials dare? This is not all; beyond the spheres Where darkness circumscribes the view, And smiles are only bright with tears, Far brighter worlds life's dreams renew: Beyond earth's bleak, storm-battered shore, Where wrecks of life and hope decay, Suns rise that set not evermore, And stars whose beams fade not away; There is the saint's immortal home, Where more than faith dare hope is given; There earth's tired sons and daughters come, For peace and rest, and find it Heaven.
