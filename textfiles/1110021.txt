A Change of Tune .â€” Deacon Hunt was naturally a high-tempered man, and used to beat his oxen over their heads, as all his neighbors did. It was observed that when he became a Christian his cattle were remarkably docile. A friend inquired into the secret. ' Why,' said the deacon, ' formerly when my oxen were a little contrary, I flew into a passion and beat them unmercifully; this made the matter worse. Now, when they do not behave well, I go behind the load, sit clown and sing ' Old Hundred.' I don't know how it is, but the psalm tune has a surprising effect on my oxen.'
