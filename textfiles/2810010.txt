Narcoossee, Fla. Sept. 1898. The love that labors and waits is the rewarded love. Our prayers are borne to God on the wings of our deeds, and this fruitage of the spirit can not be realized save through labor and sacrifice. Consistently speaking we have no faith in that love that is not a working or doing love. Go to work is the word and accomplish something for the good of humanity. God, if he blesses us with the fruits of the Spirit, expects us to make our profession good by acts. Are we fulfilling our obligations to our divine Father or have we concluded to sit down with folded arms and wait for him to do our work? The smallest deed done in a great spirit becomes significant. The most obscure life lookt upon by the invisible and the eternal becomes rich and full at last. Is there, then, any reason why our ranks should not be filled with true and noble souls if we do our whole duty? The extent and responsibility of our living does not wholly depend on beautiful surroundings of the material conditions. If it did then some of us might say we have done our work, and we will trust to the accomplishment of the rest. 'Variety is the spice of life.' Change sometimes gives food for thought. Orange trees are growing beautifully. All the late corn has made a good yield;Peas are blooming and bearing. The largest sweet potato crops ever known are planted in this section and are growing to beat the band, and take it altogether we might be a great deal worse off than we are. We should be and are thankful for small favors until larger ones can be received. Andrew Barrett.
