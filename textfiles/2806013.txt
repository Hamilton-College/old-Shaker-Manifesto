Narcoossee, Fla. May, 1898. It may not be too much to say that difficulty assists in the strengthening and conserving of human power, altho it may seem to the individual like passing over a rocky mountain to find a pleasant valley. It is quite true that the force which is used to break down the opposition, becomes in the future so changed that it enables us to face new difficulties with much greater power. Through this we are beginning to-find what may be required of us to form a home in a new country. Could we have shared the experience we now have, when we moved to Florida, we might, at this date, be able to sing the Victor's song. To-day the clouds have a more beautiful silver lining than ever before. Knowledge lias been gained by our failures and our difficulties. If there is to be any more Florida or Georgia movements we should suggest, that we look well to our laurels, and move slowly. We should obtain correct information in regard to the people, and then of the land we are to cultivate. During the past three months we have experienced a severe drought. The lakes have less water and we are able to ploi gh nearly two acres of muck land, and shall plant it with northern potatoes. Our table is now supplied with sweet potatoes, beans, cabbage and lettuce, direct from our garden, and on April 22, Brother Benjamin brought in the first ear of corn. At times we hear rumors of war, but it does not mar our peace. We are able to hold our meetings and to follow the voice of conscience. We are Believers in our quiet and humole life, and are not moved by the sound of war, altho it has come so near. We are studying diligently the spirit of true heroism, where the burdens of life are cheerfully borne and sacrifices willingly made. Andrew Barrett.
