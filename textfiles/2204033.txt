BOUNTIFUL. 'They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat'Rev. vii., 16. Canterbury, N. H. 1890. Divoto. O let us not hunger nor thirst, The fruits of the spirit abound; The riches of immortal truth I'm reaping on hallowed ground. My gospel companions, we'll rise, Rejoice in the light of today; We see as never before, How God doth his mercy display.
