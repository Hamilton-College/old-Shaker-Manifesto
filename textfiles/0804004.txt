Note From Elder F. W. Evans Elder F. W. Evans Ed. Shaker Manifesto :—Why do not Shakers have more materialization amongst them? The only use of materializations, as now in process of development in the world, is to prove the principle—create faith. The principle is proved, and the faith created THE in many Believers. More evidence is not needed, would be only vain repetition, like demonstrating our own existence. The use of the faith and the principle is protection. Not long since, a brother—Emil Bretzner, with a company who were cutting evergreens, fell from a tree thirty eight feet (by measurement) from the ground to his head. His experience is that as soon as he fell from the tree, it was into the arms of a friend, who had recently passed out of the body, whom we all know. He'felt, not frightened, but that he would not be hurt. When he struck the ground the company kneeled together in thankfulness that he was not hurt. He again ascended the tree. That is the kind of Spiritualism and Materialization that we need all the time. It is the protection of God.
