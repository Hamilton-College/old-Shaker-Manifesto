The smallest crust may save a human life... The smallest crust may save a human life; The smallest act may lead to human strife; The smallest touch may cause the body pain; The smallest spark may fire a field of grain; The simplest deed may tell the truly brave ; The smallest skill may serve a life to save; The smallest drop the thirsty may relieve; The slightest look may make a heart to grieve; Nought is so small but that it may contain The rose of pleasure or the thorn of pain.
