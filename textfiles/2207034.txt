FINISH THY WORK. Finish thy work, the time is short; The sun is in the west, The night is coming on; till then, Think not of rest. Yes, finish all thy work, then rest; Till then, rest never; The rest prepared for thee by God Is rest forever. Finish thy work, then wipe thy brow, Ungird thee from thy toil; Take breath, and from each weary limb Shake off the soil. Finish thy work, then rest in peace, Life's battle fought and won! And so to thee thy Master's voice Shall say, 'Well done!' Farm and Fireside.
