THE NEW LIGHT OF ASIA Edwin Arnold 'The Iliad of India' some call it, and others liken it to Milton's 'Paradise Lost.' Whatever terms may be used to describe it, Edwin Arnold's remarkable poem, 'The Light of Asia,' has certainly won a place among the classics in literature, and the best edition of it will be wanted in every home library. Related to the .religion of India it is not unlike Milton's immortal poem as related to the Christian religion. The new edition just issued by the Useful Knowledge Publishing Company, New York, is perhaps the most beautiful, typographically, which has ever appeared, and is of course far lower in price than any other edition published, which will compare with it, being only 20 cts. ior Utility binding, 30 cts. for the cloth, and 40 cts. for the half Russia, or for the extra cloth gilt edges. This edition is especially valuable, and for that reason will displace every other, and cau^e those who are already supplied with other editions to put them aside and take this because of the sketches of the lives of Edwin Arnold, the author, and of Buddha, the subject, and the numerous illustrative notes explaining the many references to persons, places, customs, etc., which arc necessarily enigmatical to any one not deeply versed in the history, religion, and literature of India. These valuable additions are from the pen of Mrs. I. L. Hi,user, a most competent writer, who was for many years a resident of India, and is known as the author of '-The Orient and its People.' Enterprising booksellers will supply this edition, and canvassers and club agents are wanted everywhere, to whom very unusual terms and facilities are offered by the publishers.
