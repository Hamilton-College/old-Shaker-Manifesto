EXCHANGES. The Church Monitor The Church Monitor is a four page monthly. Edited by G. T. Welcome, of Union Mills, Ind. Its doctrinal points are obscure, but as it presents the paper'Our Hope and Life in Christ' as the best family paper published in the west, we conclude The Monitor must be a Second Advent paper. The American Tramp The American Tramp is a National Weekly and published in the interest of humanity and common good of all. Edited by W. B. Emerson of Atlantic, Iowa.
