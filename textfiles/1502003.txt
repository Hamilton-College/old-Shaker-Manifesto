ASPIRATION. MARIA SCHULTZ. Birds plume their wings for higher flight And tune their chords for sweeter singing, As if expectant of delight, In richer voice, or further winging. And flowers grow with curtained eyes ; A long while in their timid budding, As if to give us sweet surprise The glad Earth with their beauty flooding. Likewise, the young heart reaches out, With cautious hope, its own strength trying, At first, though conscious of self-doubt, Is sure of God's love underlying. And, feeling thus its silent way, Up through the dark's perplexing winding, A blessing is the light of day,ï¿½ A joy, the sweet success of finding s The something ' sweet which it hath sought, Beneath the guidance of Love's teaching; And thus, the human heart is taught The blessedness of pure upreaching!
