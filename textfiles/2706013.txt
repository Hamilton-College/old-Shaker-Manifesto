In Loving Remembrance of Sister OLIVE CHAPEL. By Sarah A. Collins. 'She hath done what she could.'ï¿½Mark, xiv., 8. 'She hath done what she could' With willing hands and true, In service ever faithful Where duty called her too. Now rest our Spirit Sister A rest from toil you claim We grieve at your departure But our loss to you is gain. You're only homeward going, With dearest friends to dwell In mansions of bright glory Where all with you is well. Ah! only homeward going! Beautiful change is this; From earthly shades and shadows To a life of perfect bliss. A trusting, brave disciple Of truth, has markt each deed A record free from blemish The angels gladly read. You're only homeward going; Still you will bless and love And waft to us kind greetings From your happy home above. You're only homeward going NoJ; far, but ever near Shall be your presence, Sister To guide and give us cheer. You' re only homeward going Away from earth's rude care Away from pain and sorrow Mid peaceful joys to share. You're home at last kind Sister Where no more death can come Where angels chant sweet music Of Rest, your work is done. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
