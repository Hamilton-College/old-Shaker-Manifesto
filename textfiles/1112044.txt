ASKING A BLESSING M. A. D. He asked a blessing on all set before him With kindly, modest grace,and then began To carve the meat; just then a cloud came o'er him, Which made him look and act another man. ' Mutton again ! and almost raw, confound it! How can one eat this stuff with temper meek ? And these potatoes, just half-baked, around it! Oh, for a decent dinner once a week !' ' Some tea, my love? ' ' No love — no tea I thank you— I'm sick of things diluted and undone ; Charles Henry, if you don't behave, I'll spank you! Good heavens ! a careless wife, a graceless son ! ' The bread is sour! the butter—that is dirty ; I vow I find no food or comfort here. When will you learn, Maria, you're over thirty, « To cook ! I'll dine on ginger snaps and beer. The man meant nothing wrong—he asked a blessing. With gentle thoughts of food not mean or sparse, His words were always kindly and caressing Till disappointment made his prayer a farce. A little less of self and more of duty— A little care, God's bounties to disburse, Are things fare nobler than mere grace and beauty— These bring a blessing—those provoke a curse.
