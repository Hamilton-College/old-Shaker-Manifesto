TALENT A Christian community need, and have a right to, every faculty and talent. And no one who holds membership in such community can, in justice to that community, to his or her self, or to mankind, withhold or bury his or her talents, whether they be few or many. No one, through pride, because he or she does not possess as much as some others, can be justified in withholding what to him or her was committed. ' God will require his own with usury/' whether it be little or much. Unless talent be put to use, it is of no avail. Life in this way will be a blank ; and when called upon for a just account of Stewardship, those who have thus lived will receive the sentence ' Unprofitable servant.' Talent, though small, if well improved, is a blessing. In what better way can we honor God, the Giver of all good gifts, than to be active in duty ? giving with a liberal hand of what we possess, and diligently seeking to add thereto, that we may have more to give ? If we are only able to hand in a cup of water, in a right spirit, we shall not lose the reward of so doing; we shall hear the comforting voice speaking to the conscience, ' Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.'
