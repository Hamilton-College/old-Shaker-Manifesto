REMINISCENCES OF MY SHAKER CHILDHOOD. A UTITMN. 'Twas the home of my childhood My own country home, I love it the better Wherever I roam. Our Summer ending so happily always gave us a fresh start in our regular home duties wherein we were soon engaged. After the berries were gone came the gathering of apples and other fruits, and I particularly enjoyed these exhilarating occupations. The air had now began to have a touch of frost in it, the wind blew more keenly and seemed to call for more activity and exertion on our part. The orchards being at some distance from the dwellings we usually went to these in wagons returning home in the evening just weary enough to sleep without dreaming. I never shall forget the delicious fragrance of those apples or their peculiar flavor; there are none like them now a days. It was my delight to get perched upon the highest ladder I could find and thus peep through the branches of the tall trees feeling 'Monarch of all I surveyed.' How carefully I plucked the best specimens and put them into the basket for Winter use meanwhile tossing the worthless ones down and if perchance these were stopped in their fall by some unwary head, who for the moment like Sir Isaac Newton, was wont to enquire why an apple falls, found a ready answer when thus reminded of my lofty perch, as it was not done to inflict pain upon my humbler sister, so with a laugh on both sides it was made right without further philosophizing. Were there ever such lunches as we partook of seated on the sunny side of some convenient wall where with appetites sharpened by the robust exercise and the sweeping winds what did we care for other tonics. In the lengthening evenings we would meet to cut the apples for sauce or for drying, and such was the glowing warmth and genial cheer enjoyed that we shall not soon realize its like again. One of the sisters would sometimes read to us from some entertaining hook, to which we children always listened with the utmost pleasure. The cider made from the poorer apples in those days was boiled down for future use. I remember once of being permitted to sit up late to assist in boiling the cider and never shall I forget the huge open fire we had on the hearth or how it made fantastic shadows of my companions in duty as they attended the boiling caldrons for to my sleepy eyes, they assumed proportions at once gigantic and uncanny. Sometimes we would go for grapes both wild and domestic which grew near in abundance and return home laden with the- spoils. One year we children picked up the potatoes after they were dry and left on the ground; all this did not seem like a task but was one of continuous change of healthful employment never to be forgotten as long as memory lasts. Then as the frost began to harden the ground we would prepare to make all snug for Winter which we knew would come soon and last long but it was without sorrows to us � for we were sure of warmth and food nor did we take much heed for the morrow, and then as the last of our out-of-door occupations we would meet to husk the garnered corn, for the clean dry husks make an excellent bed beyond competition, while the disrobed corn gave promise of unlimited supplies of corn bread and Johnnie cake not to mention the succulent hasty pudding dear to every New Englander. Now it began to be cold nights and mornings,�and we did not linger over cur outgoings for we could not but feel with a pang of regret that the leaves were withering; at the North wind's breath, and we must prepare for Winter, well knowing that our intercourse with laughing brooks and singing birds would soon be only a thing of remembrance. The grand old mountains which surround the Village seemed to come nearer as though to encircle us in a closer embrace, and then followed the days when we heard the howling winds at night making ready for the coming of the ice king in good earnest, and all too soon would 'Rough Winter rudely rend the robes of Autumn,' and we would gladly ask.� Yet one more smile departing distant sun, One mellow smile through the soft vapory air E'er o'er the frozen earth the loud winds run, Or snows are sifted o'er the meadows bare One smile on the brown hills and naked trees And the dark rocks where summer wreaths are cast And the blue gentian flower that in the breeze Nod lonely of her beauteous race the last.�Bryant.
