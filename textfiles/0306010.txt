THE GOSPEL RACE Paul, in his exhortations to the Corinthians, alludes to the Grecian games, which consisted of running, leaping, etc. ' Know ye not,' gaith the Apostle, ' that they which run in a race, run all, but one receiveth the prize ? So run that ye may obtain.' 1 Cor. 9 : 24. According to history, the celebration of the running match excited great interest, and the preparation for these races was very extensive. All who presented themselves as candi- dates for the prize, were required to submit to very strict regulations: Their diet consisted of very coarse, unpalatable food; each candidate was to bear a good moral character, and to practice Bevere exercises, etc., according to certain prescribed rules, for twelve months before racing; all who participated in the race divested themselves of all needless clothing. The successful runner was greeted with shouts and cheers by the people, and crowned with a laurel wreath or a garland of flowers. The Gospel is compared to a race. The course marked out is the straight and narrow path of self-denial, which leads from this world to the world to come. All professors of religion are candidates for the prize, which is a crown of salvation. When starting in this Gospel race, all are required to lay aside every weight (by honest confession), relinquish the besetting sin, and run the race with patience, etc. Some run well for a time, then fall, overpowered by their besetting sin. A few persevere to the end of the race, and win the prize. Observe this : In the Grecian race, only one could win the reward, which was a crown of fading flowers ; and the judge was sometimes partial. In the Gospel race, all may run so as to win : And the Judge is righteous, and gives crowns of righteousness that fade not away. Daniel Orcutt, Enfield, Ct.
