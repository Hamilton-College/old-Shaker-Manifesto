Enfield, N. H. April 14. We learn from the sentiment expressed by a brother in Oregon, who evidently is a reader of our little messenger, that not only our Societies, but others also, look with interest to the Home ]S'otes. At first, one might think it odd that a stranger outside the gates should be especially attracted to these simple facts, simply written, on our home affairs, no 'doctrines' included, only as every word spoken or written has its influence. Yet a second considerate thought tells us they really are an indicator, possibly an educator, regarding the home life of the only Community that has, as yet, sustained the relationship of brothers and sisters in Christ. Those who study the 'Signs of the Times' declare that in these latter days there is much thought given to this mode of living, for a class who are satisfied with the experiments others have made in the 'old way' and desire a 'new way.' So it becomes our duty (which Frances Willard says should always be written with a capital D) if not always a pleasure, to delineate as we may, the homely topics which interest us in the New Creation.. Our maple harvest has been immense, almost a continuous flow, or rather 'drop in the bucket' since April 1st; very little rain to adulterate, making it unusually pleasant. The market is flushed with sweet, so the purse will not be made to extend on this score, but if all, big and little, have not had their 'sufficiency full' it will be their own fault this season. Health of our family has been unusually good all winter up to date, no 'grippe' here. We have concluded our home in the valley is fully as healthful as those on the breezy mountain top. House cleaning and painting has seized us early so will probably subside in proportionate good season, in time to attend to our friends should they be kind enough to make us a call. E. B.
