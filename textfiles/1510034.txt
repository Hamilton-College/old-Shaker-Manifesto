COMPLAINT 0F THE NORTH DOOR. [Contributed by E. Myrick.] Kind friends, your attention I earnestly crave, For without your assistance I'll go to my grave. I think that I am sick, or at least, ought so to be, For upon my poor body great mars you will see. In this place I have hung nearly forty long years, No complaint have I uttered, tho' I've shed many tears. I have kept out the cold, the rain, heat and snow, To the best of my knowledge you very well know. A true non-resident you judge me to be, While I'm injured by many, none are injured by me. It is an old saying that patience wears out; That mine is quite thread-bare you no longer will doubt. But I see you're quite anxious to know my complaint; It is this : I am bang�d without any restraint. The tall and the short, the lame, weak and strong, All feel it their duty as they pass along To slam me and bang me as hard as they can, As tho' I had injured the whole race of man. O, how I do shiver and quiver and shake. When one I see coming with fear almost quake, For I know what a clatter they'll make with my latch, My hinges, my panels and door-sill to match. Now I am quite fearful that alive I'll be buried, For I over-heard a sister quite worried, Declare she would take me right off the hinges, And hide me away,�at this my frame cringes. Since in friendship and greeting my life has been spent, And to render good service I am ever intent; E'en the sick and afflicted who're over my head, Will start with a spring almost out of their bed, And then with harsh epithets lay themselves down With a wish that poor me was laid under the ground. Sweet spring and fair summer bring me no relief, Unlatched I am left to annoyance and grief. When the soft gentle breeze creeps over the hill, And enters the door yard where all is quite still, It moveth the grass like the waves of the sea, Then with joyous delight it boundeth to me. It finds me unfastened and slams me at will, Quite enough one would think to break door-latch and sill. O, could 1 convey to your innocent minds, I would speak it in prose or sing it in rhymes, How ashamed I do feel that here I am placed. Shaker Door is my name, O, how I'm disgraced, By you gentle folks for slamming me so. Don't think me too hard for I tell you 'tis true. Now my story to you I have simply related, Yet not half my grievances have I narrated, But if all will remember softly me to close, I'll never, nay never, disturb your repose. Harvard, Mass.
