SCIENTIFIC AND USEFUL. Repeated experiments have proved... Repeated experiments have proved that, in schoolrooms lighted by windows on both sides, the children suffer more or less from injured vision, and so important has the subject been considered in Germany, that a law has lately been passed forbidding such windows in schools. TESTING THE PURITY OF WATER Some experiments have been recently made with a very simple process, to test organic impurities in water, that are worthy of further trial. The process consists in filling half-pint bottles with the water to be tested, and then adding one gramme (about 15 grains) of powdered sugar. In one experiment, boiled distilled water and no air remained unchanged for fifty days. In another, impure water assumed a milky hue in two days, and in three days had a froth on top. These experiments are easily repeated, and they may prove valuable in pointing readily to wholesome and unwholesome water. The milky appearance is the result of the development of certain fungoid growths.
