ACTS AND DEEDS. By Robert F. Doty. Fine raiment can not make us good, But qualities of heart; Each person in this maddened world, Must choose a better art. We play a drama in our life, Which shows us what we are; The motive soul which we control, Must be the guiding star. The mind of man must ever shine Eesplendent in its way, And leave impressions on the world, O'er which it holds its sway: We judge not man by laugh or frown, But by his work portrayed, The axis round which all revolves, Is hinged on acts displayed. Beyond this limitless expanse, Far, far from human eye, The soul must seek a place of rest, In some sweet bye and bye; Then if our heart and brain is free, From all life's trifles light. We may expect in future time To float beyond the night. Beyond the vision of our being, Lie realms of beauty rare, Ah! in those realms we fain would be There lives the God of care, Who tells us we are good or bad, Perverse or wantonï¿½mean, So dreaming o'er eternal law, We see as we are seen. One little deed of charity, May make us kings of men, Ah! in some heart we heroes be, To some fair persons ken; ' The age in which we wish to live, Will idolize brave acts, Then let mankind in daily life, Impress on man these facts. The Home.
