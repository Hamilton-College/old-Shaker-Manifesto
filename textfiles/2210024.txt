Dayton, Ohio. Aug. 1892. We have very dry weather; need rain. But we will not murmur as we have been blest with a large wheat crop. This averaged twenty-five bushels to the acre. We are putting in two hot air furnaces purchased from the Dayton Furnace &amp; Foundry Co. I think they are among the best furnaces that are made. We have also been improving our Dwelling by putting in new sash in the front part and adding a veranda on the front. So when our linoleum carpets are down in the halls and our walls papered or painted, we shall have closed a good job. The health at Watervliet is generally pretty good. The Sisters have had a large amount of cooking to do for the past two weeks for the working men and it is pretty hard work. When they get all through with cooking it will be easier. The Brethren help the Sisters in the Laundry, and sometimes in the cooking department, while we have so many men at work. Elder Joseph Slingerland spent two days with us recently, and a Brother, Leander Divine, from Union Village made us a visit last week. We are also having about one hundred rods of smooth wire fence put on the farm. H. W. F.
