Science and Superstition EZRA T. LEGGETT What a storm through earth is brewing! Temples totter, churches fall; Faith upbuilding, faith undoing,— Science writing on the wall. Law demands full recognition, Truth is arming on her side; Facts are ranging in position,-Nature 's summoned to decide. Rock-ribbed mountains, storm-tossed oceans Lonely valley, mine and cave; Planet orbits, comet motions, Darkling secrets of the grave. Seers who 've crossed the mighty river, With the love beyond the sky; Sons of God, who 've lived forever,— There are general principles applicable to all' All are called to testify. Startled ghosts of midnight pinion, Hosts from dreamless realms below, Croaking for long-lost dominion, When 'twas death for man to know, dols from their thrones are jumping, Devotees are in dismay; Buddha is with Brahma bumping, While Mahomet stands at bay. ?ogies stare with big-eyed wonder, Orthodoxy quakes in fear; Progress thunders, ' Stand from under! ' Bigots shriek, ' The devil 's here ! ' Creeds as old as Time, or older, Tumble now before the storm ; Durgatory 's growing colder, While its friends are growing warm. Darthly saints who, by election, Claim first-class, front seats in Heaven, ^ow would sell that cboice selection Less than cost,—good titles given. Vlan and monkey making faces O'er the Darwin pedigree; Monkey scorning all that traces Man from monkey ancestry'. Woman, too, the storm is riding, Not as witches rode of yore, But with visor up, and guiding Where she followed just before. Woman, stern as thunders rolling, Lightnings flashing from her eye; Man, forlorn as church-bell tolling, Sadly waits the by-and-by. Woman, freed from fear and fetters, Onward, upward, how she flies ! War's domain, and law and letters, Pills and potions, now her prize : Tyrant man, by fear o'ertaken, Seeks for some lone island, where, By all womankind forsaken, He may soothe his sorrw there.
