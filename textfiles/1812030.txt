PILLAR OF FIRE. Shieley, Mass. 1. O hail the bright morning whose heavenly rays On earth are 2. We welcome the dawning, thou morning divine; Blest harbin3. Blest morning divine, may thy rays still increase, Encircling beginning to shine. In songs of thanksgiving O God, we will ger of that great day When God will of mercy and righteousness the universe round, Till nations shall bow to that sceptre of praise make peace, Thy name for this glory divine. Bright emblems of heav His last and his final display. For souls can no long Which now in Mt. Zion is found. May they by thy brighten, O let thy pure beams Our souls with new vigor inspire, To foler in darkness remain, Concerning what He doth require; His word ness begin to discern The kingdom of Christ, the Messiah, When sublow thy brightness as Israel did, When led by the Pillar of Fire, has gone forth, it is Yea, and Amen, Revealed in a Pillar of Fire, jects at all times, by night and by day. Are led by a Pillar of Fire.
