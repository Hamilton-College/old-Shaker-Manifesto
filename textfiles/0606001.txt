BE NOBLE, YOUNG PEOPLE SARAH L. SAWYER In your walks in life, you will see many who may appear singular, or have some peculiarity of form; never appear to notice such defect, or let the parties know by looks or words, that you observe it; but treat such with kindness and politeness, especially the aged ; treat them with respect, showing them, by kindly acts and helping hand, that they are appreciated. If we treat others with politeness, we may, with reason, expect to be treated with the same consideration in our declining years. And, indeed, we should never withhold a kindly word or act, that would brighten the life of any one; but deny that which would create unpleasantness and sorrow. By so doing we shall enjoy a happiness in the joy of others, that will be an agreeable compensation for all the pains we may take to make others happy. Let ours be ever, to love, and be loved.
