CREMATION Cremation, in India, is the cause of the Asiatic cholera. Let Americans, who have plenty of land, bury their dead, far enough apart, to plant a tree by each grave—have all funeral ceremonies as simple and inexpensive as possible. When Catholics enter church, Rich and Poor are on a level. When Protestants come into their sick rooms, and burial grounds — let them then, if nowhere else, be on a dead level Quaker equality. The following address was recently delivered at the funeral of a San Francisco type-setter : ' Our brother, Mr. John Harlan, is dead. His last letter is distributed, his case is emptied, his stick is full, the last line is spaced out, and the clicking of the type is no more heard as stuck by his hand. A paragraph is made, a period put in! his last proof is taken, his galley cleared. His form is made up, and lies upon the cold imposing stone of death, silent, lifeless. His faults are set in diamond and pied, so that no more pi oof can be taken. His virtues are set in six-line pica, colored, framed and hung on the walls of memory, never to be forgotten. Be warned and be ready. Correct your proof.'
