Our Animal Friends Our Animal Friends is a beautiful periodical sent out by the 'American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.' This great kindness that is extended to the animal creation is a strong evidence of the upward march of the human race. 'Blessed are the merciful,' was not spoken in vain, and the merciful man rests assured that in his care over these animal friends he is approved of God. This beautiful work is published each month at 10 East 22nd St., New York City, at $1.00 a year.
