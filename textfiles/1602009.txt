THE APOSTOLIC COUNCIL. LOUIS BASTING. One of the most interesting episodes in early church history is the council held in Jerusalem, as recorded in Acts, xv., and it may be instructive to consider the cause which led to it, and the manner in which it was conducted and brought to a conclusion. The first converts to the new faith had been Jews exclusively, among whom was a large company of priests. They had been brought up in the strictness of the ancient formalities of the law, and they still clung to those observances, especially circumcision and abstinence from food declared ceremonially unclean. Then came a revelation to Peter, in consequence of which he preached the gospel to the gentiles also, not requiring any conformity to Jewish customs. Paul also had converted many who had not been under the law. All this aroused the indignation of certain ones of the Jerusalem church, who took it upon themselves to go to Antioch, where Paul had established a congregation, and to represent that circumcision was necessary for saltation. Then the matter was brought to an issue, and the whole question was wisely referred to the mother-church for a decision. A crisis had evidently come upon the infant church : on one hand were all the influences created by national tradition and education, on the other were the far-seeing eyes of liberal hearts who recognized the gentile world as the true harvest-field and who felt unwilling to lay upon them the yoke of non-essential formalities. The composition of the council by which these momentous questions were to be decided, was, a most significant one. There were the twelve apostles, every one of whom held his commission from the Master himself, yet they did not claim exclusive authority to decide the matter before them ; nor did the elders, appointed by the apostles, arrogate to themselves legislative powers ; the matter was decided by the apostles, elders and brethrenï¿½by the whole church in council assembled. The discussion was evidently unrestrained, for there was 'much disputing, ' and the result of the debate was finally summed up by James, bishop of the local church. It is note worthy that it was James, not Peter, the 'rock' upon whom the church was to be founded, who acted as presiding officer and exercised the most commandinginnuence. Nor was James' ' sentence ' anything more than a counsel, embodying the sense of the great majority of the meeting, declaring that gentile converts should not be required to observe the Mosaic law. A few prohibitions were however insisted upon, possessing great importance by having the effect of separating them from old customs and associations, and leading them to a new mode of life of higher rectitude. And the future proved the wisdom of the council. A threatening crisis that had endaugered the very existence of the church, was happily averted and unity of faith and action brought about. It would have been impossible for any one man, or any one set of men, to secure such results, no matter how high their standing or how pure their intentions might have been, but by the simple expedient of calling the faithful together and affording an opportunity for exchange of thought and discussion of views, they were enabled to arrive at a satisfactory decision. A noble example was presented by the bishop of the Jerusalem church. He himself belonged to the old school and was opposed to innovations ; yet when he saw the drift of the sentiment pervading the assembly, he gave his adherence to it at once and recommended its general adoption. His name has gone down in history as Saint James the just. God dwells in human i tj . 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.' When, therefore, a crisis arises in the affairs of men, whether it relate to state or church, experience teaches that it is safe, wise and statesmanlike, to go to the people for counsel; for the masses of the people are honest and trustworthy and will sustain and support the leaders that have confidence in them. The advice of Lincoln to an aspiring young man was to keep as near as possible to the people. The wise leader, having the good of humanity at heart, will seek to ascertain the voice of the people, for it is the voice of God. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
