'WE WILL SUSTAIN THE STRUCTURE.' J. G. RUSSELL Dedicated to the Editor of The Shaker. We will sustain the structure God's great and glorious plan, Which he in mercy has revealed, To poor benighted man. Deliverance from all evil, Redemption's praise It brings; We leave the haunts of BabyIon, M To dwell 'mid better things.' 2. We will sustain the structure, we will not let it fall; It is the burden of our lives, — Our holy heavenly call. Intrusted to our keeping, Unblemished to remain ; The structure God has reared to us, We will, we will sustain. 3. We will sustain the structure, Whatever be the cost; It is the glory of our lives, — Without it we are lost. It worketh peace within us, And universal love ; It brings us into unison, With angel spheres above. We will sustain the structure, For by its light and power, From Egypt's thraldom we were drawn, In deep affliction's hour. The rolling, rolling waters. Through which our journey lay, Were, by the power of God's own hand, Controlled and kept at bay. We will sustain the structure, Its noble form shall stand Unchanged, in all its purity,—The same as God hath planned. We will sustain the structure, God, be our help and stay, Throughout our earthly pilgrimage, Throughout eternal day. Dear Editor : — On reading your article in the April number, on the evening of the 21st, in our Lyceum, the above hymn suggested itself to me, which I now send with haste to you, that you may also enjoy the sensation before it gets to be old. I send it in its simplicity, without any intention or desire to have it published; but, simply as a pleasing token of gospelJove and affection from your brother for you. JAMES G. RUSSELL.
