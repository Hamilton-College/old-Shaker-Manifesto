THE GOOD WORK GOING ON ANNA ERWIN We often hear the question asked, why we are content in our quiet way, when there are such great opportunities to sound the trumpet of our testimony to earth's inhabitants. But I am persuaded that the Archangel's trump is now blowing, and sounds high over all other strains. I discern his silver thread of music as it solves the doubts of the present time ; and as it knits up the hopes of the future saying to us : 'Be brave, be strong, be patient. Think not to accomplish great things without a struggle, and labor. Yea and patient labor too. We need to double our energies, and press forward ; for 'tis the patient brain, and untiring eye, that win the crown.' And as the sound passes on the regions of the future, leaving a breath of peace behind it, so shall we, held by its gentle spell, listen, and know the counsels of .God are just and will not fail. We have much yet to learn which experience alone Â«an teach us. Our Faith is precious indeed, and the standard bearers learn through pains, perseverance and forlorn hopes what well becomes the true cross bearer, and what fits them to aid in the cause of truth. The end and the THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 35 means are strangely confused in the instinctive judgment which guides our actions. Our intentions do not often leap up the high ideals of action ; but while we do our little work to secure peace and harmony, the secret unravels, that we are working as much for others as ourselves. And this has been proved experimentally, and accepted intellectually. The true and honest heart recognizes the brotherhood, and allows the claims of 'good will to all,' which is the opposite of selfishness, and antagonism. God's tests will bring out the traits of both. Brother Peebles has said : 'This life is a hotel in which mortals tarry for a little season for rudimental experiences, ripening through toil and suffering.' Enfield, Conn.
