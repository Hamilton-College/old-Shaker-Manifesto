PARLIAMENTARY POINTER PARLIAMENTARY POINTER. The above is a neat little volume designed for the vest pocket, containing all the rules of ordinary parliamentary practices, so arranged as to admit of ready reference while a question is before a meeting and requiring an immediate solution. This can not be said of any other book on parliamentary law. All others seem to have been designed more for study than for use in assembly work. The different phases of this subject (of which every man thinks he knows considerable, and yet very few know more than enough to lead them into blunders) are carefully classified, and in many cases the same point is repeated under different headings, thus furnishing immediately the desired information. By a unique system of easily learned abbreviations the whole subject is brought into a space that can be readily concealed in an ordinary sized hand. To any member of any society, open or secret, the 'Parliamentary Pointer' is worth its weight in gold. It is published by Thos. J. Crowe, Detroit, Mich. Price by mail in flexible cloth cover, only ten cents.ï¿½
