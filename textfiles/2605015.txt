A Tribute of Love to the Memory of ELDER JOHN B. VANCE. By Mary Ann Walker. With hearts bowed in grief we have assembled to-day to pay the last tribute of loving care to our beloved father, Elder John who has passed from this life to a higher sphere. We need erect no costly monument to his sainted memory as his life was full of love and blessing for every earnest toiler in the vineyard of the Lord. His pure and godly example will ever prove a shining star to guide us safely to that beautiful, spiritual home. His spirit now resting in the embraces of infinite love, must rejoice that he has kept his early vows of consecration to follow the life of Christ. The dear departed was a man of God, and was beloved by all his Brethren and Sisters. His charity for the erring was unbounded and he has often said:'I would gladly bear all your crosses and trials it' it would save your souls, but each one must do his part toward gaining the prize of salvation, and my advice would be, always yield obedience to the small voice of conscience and you will have strength given urito you to persevere to the end.' His testimony was as a two-edged sword against sin, yet no one ever sought his aid in vain, or failed to receive strength in the hour of need, and by his prayerful ministration souls found relief and forgiveness. Words fail to tell how much we shall miss our beloved Elder, and though we mourn at our loss, to him it may be great gain. O may thy blessed spirit ever be near to guide us through our journey here below, that when our time shall come to pass over the river, we can rejoice among the ransomed, and hear the same joyful sumAlfred, Maine.
