SALVATION. NANCY G. DANFORTH. There seems to be an idea prevailing in many minds, of saving the soul independent of the body. This is erroneous, as it can never be done while we dwell in clay tenements. When the soul is saved from all sin, the body will also be saved from gratifying low passions and appetites. Not only will it cease to be an instrument or medium for the worst of vices, but every wrong habit will be laid aside. With this view of the subject, it will readily be seen, how impossible is instant salvation, by every one Avho realizes how hard it is to leave old practices, which have been strengthened by the growth of many years. The conviction that some favorite indulgence is wrong, may be and often is, instantaneous; but the power to leave it forever, comes by slow growth, attained through sacrifice, by constant watchfulness and prayer. When we have gained power sufficient to keep us from falling into temptation, this may be called salvation, but not redemption. This is only obtained when we have so far overcome the world that we cannot be tempted of evil, When Satan com- cth and finds nothing in us, by which to incite evil desires, then shall we become like our Lord and Teacher. When the love of God reigns supremely in the heart, it will manifest itself by love and kindness to those around us, thus inspiring them to love and good works. In this way we shall see salvation wrought out through the physical organism. Hence our faith in the resurrection of the body from all evil and wrong habits pertaining to the laws of this life, and through this medium can the soul be resurrected to that which is higher, even unto life eternal.
