EVIDENCES OF CHRISTIANITY. E. P. Sevester. According to the understanding of the writer, we possess in our own souls a plain evidence of Christianity, if the spirit of Christ dwells in us. That manifests itself by living a better and holier life. If we feel an anxious desire to grow pure and holy, living honestly the principles and precepts of the gospel, according to the best of our understanding, and the highest light we possess, we shall make no reserves. Christianity when it is received wholly in truth and in reality, causes us to grow wiser and better ; to grow in virtue and to rise above our surroundings which will have no influence over us to mar our spiritual natures, but heavenly inspirations will flow into out1 souls. When a person has contracted bad habits which by long continued practice have grown strong and has bound the soul as with iron bands, it becomes almost a second nature. lie realizes his lost condition, and if he desires to break these iron bands, he must make a determined stand, and resolve to conquer all his evil propensities. He must make a full saci'ifice of all that is near and dear to him, if it is not owned of God. This also is the blessed fruit of Christianity. It gives us power to overcome sin, and to turn away from all evil companions. This becomes imperative if we desire to save our own souls and make ourselves able to help others. Very truly hath the poet said :ï¿½ 'How shall I a habit break? As you did that habit make. As you gathered you must unloose, As you yielded, now refuse. Thread by thread the strands we twist, Till they bind us neck and wrist, Thread by thread the patient hand Must untwine ere free we stand. As we builded stone by stone, We must toil, unhelped, alone, Till the wall is overthrown.' Every soul that struggles against his inbred foes, is helped by and receives strength from God and from his angels. A protecting influence is thrown around him, so that the evil one cannot touch him.
