Valuable Household Hints. Pieces of licorice laid around where ants run is recommended. Take iron stains from marble with lemon juice or a mixture of spirits of wine and oxalic acid. Meringues should be put on puddings after they are slightly cool, as, if the pudding be hot, the egg will liquefy. Old newspapers torn in small pieces and wet in water softened by the addition of a little ammonia, are excellent to wash lamp-chimneys. Steamed dumplings, with stewed chicken or veal, are an acquisition. Cook both these meats until nearly done, then make the dumplings like baking powder biscuits; pour all but a little of the water from the meats into another vessel for gravy, and put the dumplings in the pot on the meat so they will not touch the water, and cook until all the water is boiled away. To remove scratches and bruises from furniture, rub them gently with a fresh walnut, butternut or hickory nut kernel, and they will disappear as if by magic. To remove the unsightly marks caused by drippings from the faucets in marble basins, or in the water-closet bowl, nothing equals pulverized chalk, moistened with a few drops of ammonia. Apply with an old tooth-brush and they quickly disappear. In cooking vegetables, always remember that boiling water evaporates rapidly on the approach of a storm or when it is raining.
