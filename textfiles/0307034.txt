INHERITANCE The Spirit spoke by the Prophets, and again by Jesus Christ, saying, ' The meek shall in- herit the earth.' Now we have the perfected order of the revelation of God through the Shepherd and Shepherdess of Zion, and the text is read thus : ' Blessed are the meek ;' for they shall have an inheritance in the mansions of the pure. We have also received additional blessings, which will happify and adorn the receivers of the word, who alone are doers of the work. Blessed are those who have a continual controversy with the powers of sin and darkness ; for theirs is eternal life. Blessed are those whose eyes are fixed on the mark of the prize of their high calling; for they shall inherit the true riches. Blessed are those who abide in the truth ; for they shall be the light of the world, and the glory of heaven. Blessed are those who watch, that no concealed evil or wrong habit mar their uprightness ; for they shall be clothed with honor and beauty. Blessed are those who seek wisdom; for their lips shall communicate excellent things. Blessed are the prudent, in whose storehouses are garnered treasures with which to help the needy; for out of their abundance shall the multitude be fed. Blessed are those who are slain by the sword of the testimony; for they shall live, and never die. Blessed are those who are baptized with the power of repentance; for their iniquity shall be blotted out. Blessed are the wise virgins who are ready, and who come when called; for with such the Lord is well pleased. Blessed are those whose kindred and relations are the followers of the Lamb ; for they shall move in the Angelic ranks, and sing the song of the redeemed.. Blessed are those who bear the rod of correction and endure ; for out of the bosom of their souls proceed strength. Bhoda Blake, Mt. Lebanon
