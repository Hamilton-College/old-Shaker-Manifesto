ELDER DANIEL. Notwithstanding that for two years I was frequently forewarned of the increasing infirmity and gradual approach to the nether shore, of our most worthy father in God�Elder Daniel Boler�yet the announcement of his actual exit from time gave me a shock and a tremor. The loss to the Church seemed so utterly irreparable ! The departure from our midst of such wisdom and love, such ripe experience, such heroic self-abnegation and selfsacrifice for the good of others, is indeed far beyond my power to portray, as I look back through my Official relation and connection with Elder Daniel. In these things which are the essentials and substantials of a Christian life he may have had parallels, but Superiors, never. His desire that union and harmony prevail in the Church, among all classes, and his zeal to promote the same was unceasing. He once said to me, 'Elder Oliver, I will maintain my union with all for I can not do without it, even if I must obtain it by asking forgiveness for things I have neither said nor done, but which the aggrieved party really believes I have. But I must remove the stumbling-block some way and have union and good feeling restored.' Now, 'If lie's not a good Believer Who makes such a sacrifice, Then was Christ a grand deceiver, And the Scriptures, pointed lies.' To speak of good Elder Daniel's personal righteousness and practical purity, his complete elevation above the selfish, rudimental, animal plane of life, would be an act of supererogation, his lovely and holy life having been one long and complete demonstration of the same, 'a living epistle known and read of all men.' Finally in my meditations upon the life of one who has so thoroughly 'made of justioe a measuring line, and of righteousness a plummet,' I can only say in the solemn words of the rapt seer of old, 'Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.'
