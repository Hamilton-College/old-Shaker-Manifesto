How to Have Sound Teeth The Science of Health says : Mushes, gruels, puddings and soups maybe made hygienically. But they should also be eaten hygienically. They must be chewed, not bolted. The nursing infant masticates its mother's milk, for which purpose it takes it slowly, drop by drop. Mastication is for the purpose of insalivation. Unless food is properly insalivated, it cannot be well digested. The teeth are the finest, densest structure of the body, and this means they are intended for hard work. Eat solid food at every meal; and when you take semi-liquid, or very soft food of any kind, eat very slowly and take a bit of hard bread, crackers, a green apple, or something similar, with it. Then will your stomach please and be pleased, and your teeth, like your eyes and nose, and fingers and toes, will remain to bless and comfort you to the last. If all persons, after being weaned, would only chew their food enough, we would hear very little of aching and rotten teeth, and dentists would be nowhere.'
