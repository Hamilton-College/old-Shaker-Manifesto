Chittenden, Vt., June 20, 1875 Friend Evans, This is our location at present. We are held here, by the bands that control in our seances, for a purpose known only to the Powers that control us. We shall wait their bidding. Should they desire us to go to Mt. Lebanon, or anywhere else, we are ready. We trust in all their movements, knowing full well they will do all things right, and keep us where they can get the most power, and do the most good. Let the Spirits make their own conditions, and the world will be convinced of the power of Immortality, as fast as they are prepared to be convinced. Should we, on this side of the Spiritual or Spirit world, make conditions for the Spirits, there might be many pull-backs. We are not permitted to make any arrangements to go away from here, at present. Best wishes from your friend, in the cause of truth, H. G. Eddy
