Plain Talks To whom these presents shall come : We commend the little work 'Plain Talks upon Practical Religion' to the consideration of all who are anxious for information concerning our faith and principles. We deem it unpretentious, concise and plain; yet considerably illustrating the subjects commonly arising as questions in the minds of most people concerning Shakers and their principles. We recommend Novitiate Elders, and any others interested, to aid in its extensive circulation. Ministry of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
