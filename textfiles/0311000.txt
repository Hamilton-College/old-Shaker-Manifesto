AMERICANISM Ulysses Gkant, as a mere man, may be a Methodist, as he is a General; yet, as President of these United States, this gives him no right to obtrude either of those upon the American public, who are neither Methodists nor Generals. Were he an atheist, like Bradlaugh, or a Roman Catholic, or an Episcopalian, or a Jew, or a Hindoo Mahometan, or a Chinese Confucian, or a Persian follower of Zoroaster, or a Buddhist, it would be, in him, as great a violation of good taste, as a citizen; and of Americanism, as a statesman, to project his personal theological views upon the public, as it is for the President to officially sanc- tion Protestantism, by inviting the members of the ' Evangelical Alliance,' from New York to the American Capitol. Washington declared, in his official capacity, as President, that the United States Government was not a Christian Government. Thomas Paine, or Thomas Jefferson, might, with equal propriety, and with equal law, have incorporated their Deism into their public services due to our common country, as for Ulysses Grant to thus ally himself to the Protestant Alliance. The Constitution of these United States is eminently cosmopolitan; and he or she, in the past, or present, or future, who shall have been, or shall be, instrumental in putting the Protestant Bible into public schools, or theological chaplains in the Army or Navy, or into the Halls of Legislation, have thereby constituted themselves judges of other persons' consciences; and, so far, are religious bigots, and superstitious persecutors — enemies to Americanism — to perfect liberty and equality of colors, races, sects, creeds, and sexes; — and to the right of each human being to believe or disbelieve, according to evidence presented, any proposition, philosophical or theological, possible for the human mind to conceive and construct. Even Gentile Christians, Catholic and Pro- testant, who, like Ulysses Grant, hold to war and passional marriage, and who swallow the ' Atonement' as they would a drug, to cure them of the sins arising therefrom, have the same civil rights to protection of life, liberty, person, and property, as had Jefferson, the infidel author of the Declaration of Independence, himself; or as had the still greater skeptical originator of the Emancipation Act, by which millions of human beings were restored to those civil rights of which the Gentile Christian kidnappers, and slave-hold- ing masters and mistresses had so long deprived them. Lincoln, like Thomas Paine, and all of the Founders of our Government, were infidels to all the theologies of earth. But they were friends of humanity; and as such, and for which, God 'first loved them,' until, by Spiritualism and Shakerism, they should learn to love and honor Him and Her as the Foun- tain of all practical good to their own offspring— man. Let us all unite to keep intact and immaculate our American Constitution, into which shall enter no theological tenet against which a single citizen shall protest — I do not believe it!
