LINES SUGGESTED FROM SEEING THREE FLOWER BEDS, KEPT BY OUR THREE LITTLE GIRLS ANNIE STEPHENS Three little mounds lay side by side, Kept free from weed and tare ; I'd passed them often on my way, Nor gave them thought or care, But now, they seemed to speak to me, And my attention drew; They spoke in silent whisperings, Of things both old and new. They told me when the skies were blue, And birds began to sing, Some little hands went forth to sow Flower seeds in the spring. They planted balsams, pink, and red, And violets white and blue; And many sweet and lovely flowers Of every name and hue. The dews came down at eventide, And nurtured them by night; And solar beams upon them shone, To give them warmth and light, Till they began to peep above Their darksome prison earth; O! the wondrous latent powers That give creation brith! Still on they grew — for grow they must • Till embyro buds were seen; Then blossoms followed, one by one, To rival with the queen. And there they lived, to bud, and bloom, And yet to fade away; Ah! are they not the emblems true Of life's fair passing day ? Childhood and youth are vanity; They pass too soon we find; But plants eternal, bloom within The garden of the mind. For truth can grow within the heart, And purity bloom there; Sweet love, and charity and peace, Are flowers of fragrance rare. O let these plants be watered well, By dew drops from on high ; That they may bloom in loveliness, And never, never die. For all that's pure and beautiful, From virtue ever springs ; And linked with all that's dutiful We'll think upon 'these things. Mt. Lebanon.
