TIME DEVOTED TO MEALS Dr. Derby states that the average time occupied in the process of taking food by the people of Massachusetts dees not exceed from twelve to fifteen minutes for each meal. Such haste is injurious to health for many reasons. The process of digestion begins in the mouth with the action of the teeth, and through excitement of the salivary glands by the presence of food. Unless saliva is abundantly mingled with the latter, the first act of digestion is obstructed and nature's plan is changed. The fluid not only lubricates, but acts chemically in the mouth, if a reasonable time is given it, upon all the starchy elements which make up the great bulk of what we eat. Eating in haste a great deal of air is swallowed. Air is to a a certain extent always entangled in the saliva and assists digestion, but when 'wads' of food succeed each other very rapidly, they act like pistons in the tube leading from the back of the throat, and drive before and between them into the stomach such amounts of air as to distend that organ and impede its functions. Another evil of eating in this way is that the masses of food, imperfectly mixed with saliva, become impacted in the Eesophagus, checking its muscular action, which is obviously intended to propel one piece at a time. The embarrassment is overcome by taking at one gulp as much fluid as the mouth can hold, thus distending the elastic tube and washing the obstructed food into the stomach. All this is unnatural, and can hardly fail to work mischief.
