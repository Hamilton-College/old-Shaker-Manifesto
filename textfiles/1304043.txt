THE LOCOMOTIVE OF 1881-1891 1881. Axles groaning, pistons hissing, Tearing, wearing, bolts all missing, Bushing hideous thro' night air, Always wanting some repair, Boisterous, blustering, screaming, sooty, That's the way he does his duty. 1891. Silent, voiceless, quickly speeding, Coal or water never needing, As he rushes thro' the dark, Showing but a single spark; Like glow-worm or fire-fly, Or star twinkling in the sky, Soundless all his work will be, Moved by electricity! Railroad World.
