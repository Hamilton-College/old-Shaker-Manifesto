Society Record and Social Life The necessary haste, to put copy into the hands of the publisher for this particular number, is Our excuse for leaving until February, SOCIETY RECORD, and more extensive 'SOCIAL LIFE' letters, None can understand but ourselves, why the haste. But we would remark , that there has been nothing looked for more eagerly by our renders, than the items of our' SOCIETY RECORD,' so far as we are made aware, That this RECORD I may do good alone, it should be as full as II possible, ever dignified, and free from mere gossip. We cordial lv invite such items of , interest each month,' from each Society, as will corrti nue to make the RECORD appreciated and most profitable. A short time siuce, we remarked that there was much correspondence to and from the Societies, that would be very interesting arid proper for THE SHAKER to invest. Let ue have it, 'boiled down,' and full of sunbeams. We know not why SHAKER SOCIAL LIFE should not be the happiest; and if it is, why withhold the recipes, with directions?
