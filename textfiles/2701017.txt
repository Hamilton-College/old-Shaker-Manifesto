East Canterbury, N. H Dec. 1896. 'Time without end.' There need not be so much anxiety about the time, as about the use that we make of the time. Faithful in duty toward God and man, will inevitably bring the reward of 'Well done.' We have past our 'Thanksgiving;' enjoyed our religious service; sat in the seat of the gastronomer and are now anticipating the coming Christmas. Winter is with us but as yet, no snow and but little ice. The singing birds have all gone to their southern homes, but we still have left to us the blackest of Crows, the beautiful Blue Jay, the incessant chatter of a Sparrow and the social, little Chickadee. For all of these we give special thanks. H. C. Blinn
