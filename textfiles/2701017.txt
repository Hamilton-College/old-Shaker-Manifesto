Pleasant Hill, Ky. Dec. 1898. Beloved Gospel Kindred;â€”It is with kindly greetings that I go on my mission of love to greet the dear friends of our Communal home. My whole soul is interested in the peace and prosperity of God's people, who have consecrated their lives in honest endeavor for the good of humanity. Those who follow the spirit of Christ, in making a full sacrifice of all selfish relations, will be endowed with that love and charity, that will go far toward the saving of the world. It is now a lovely Sabbath morning and my spirit goes out to meet those dear souls, with whom it was my privilege to walk in 'Wisdom's ways of pleasantness,' before they past on, to enter the Father's house of many mansions. With what trusting love my whole life, became a part of their life, and their wisdom and loving kindness inspired me with a confidence that time can never change. Through faith, even at an early age, I made the gospel my choice, and became fully assured that it was the power of God unto salvation. With age came experience and I with many others still enjoy an unshaken faith in the fundamental principles of the gospel of Christ. O that trusting love that forms a tie; Too strong to break, too pure to die. Nancy L. Rupe
