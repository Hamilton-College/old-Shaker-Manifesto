Fear of the Lord is the... CHARLES JULIUS PRETER. ' The fear of the Lord is the -beginning of Wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.' Prov. we.. 10. Our souls are emanating, or coming forth from God, they are the 'Offspring of God. ' Acts, xxii., 22. The all important question arises ; What was the object of our souls being sent to earth? Was it merely to live an animal existence to eat, drink and gratify the desires of the physical body, or was it tor the glory of God, and the development of the soul? If it was the latter, then ail our efforts ought to be, with energy and all our ability and means, to attain to that exalted condition. Our sojourn on earth is a time of probation to discipline the soul, to endure all trials and sufferings, which through the means of temptation evil spirits throw in our way, to frustrate the design of God. We were not created to be mere machines, but endowed with the gift of volition, to choose between good or evil. If the good works outbalance the evil, there is a glorious reward awaiting us in the spirit world, but if the evil deeds have gained the ascendency, there will be guilt and remorse, and an adequate punishment * the consequence. Life on earth is therefore a constant warfare, it is but a moment to compare to the countless ages in eternity. In our Father's house are many mansions, or spheres. Our souls have to progress or travel from one condition to another, until we have attained and reached the Christ sphere, which is the nearest to God. The time has arrived, which people for tliousands of years have been praying for, the Millennial day has dawned, the marriage feast of the Spirit and Bride is made ready and all are invited to come in, who are willing to come out from among them, to touch not the unclean thing,' 2 Cor. vi., 17, and to put the wedding garment on, which is the righteousness of the saints. In Christ's first appearing they saw only as through a glass darkly, the vail of the temple was only rent; figuratively they could have merely a glance into the most holy place, but we read that in Christ's Second Appearing the vail is taken away, so as to see eye to eye, and face to face. Is' there any people on earth who have greater light than Believers, of whom it is required, that they should be ' a shining light, a city set on a hill, a standard for the nations to gather to ? When they see our good works, they may praise God in their day of visitation. ' Hence our responsibility is great, for ' To whom much is given from him much is demanded.' To illustrate these remarks, we must keep in mind, that there are four distinct divine dispensations. The first was the Adamic, when the waters of life reached to the ancles. The second was the Mosaic, when the waters reached the knees. The third was Christ's first appearing, when the waters came to the loins, and the fourth was Christ's second appearing, when the waters became so deep that those, who want to cross this river of life, have to swim over it; and the less a person is en- cumbered with earthy affairs, the easier it is for him to swim and to reach safely Canaan's happy shore. During the first two Dispensations was the proper time to multiply and replenish the earth, that is, to obey strictly times and seasons, and the laws of nature, as do all uncorrupted animals. The meaning of the waters going to the loins in Christ's first appearing is this,�They had their choice either to live a pure holy virgin life, such as the Church of Jerusalem did live, who were disciplined after the mosaic law, or to live as those gentile Christian churches did, who had to be fed with milk, and to whom, for the present distress sake, one wife was allowed, for they could not digest strong meat to ' make themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. ' These last were the antitypes of the outer court of the temple, whilst the former were the antitypes of the inner and holy temple. Nevertheless, the Apostle told these gentile Christians, that the time was short, those who had wives would be as those who had none, that is, the wife became a sister, and the husband a brother. 1 Cor. vii., 2i). He pointed out to them a better way ; 'He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord, but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit, but she that is married, careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.' 'iFpr the fashion of the wrorld passeth away. ' ' Walk in the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh, for the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, ai-.d these are contrary the one to the other.' Gal. v., 1G. The Apostlevadvises us to keep our vessels in sanctification and honor and not in the lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles who know not Cod. Believers have borne for more than a hundred years a strong testimony against all fleshly lusts and we rejoice to see, that some of our friends are waking up to perceive the depravity of man, and loss from God in that way, as will be obvious from the following extract of Tiffany's monthly ; Page 288, August, 1884. 'The high destiny of the soul is to perceive all truth, and dwell iu every pure affection, and therefore the laws of its being must have true respect for such destiny. It is for this cause, that all the various pursuits of man after wealth, fame, power or self-gratification in any form have failed to give complete happiness. From this we can understand the origin and nature of sin against the soul. It. may be summed up in one word�'' Lust'�that selfish desire for gratification, which begets all the actions which antagonize with the high condition and destiay of the soul. This lust provokes man to seek gratification in meat and drinks. It breathes its polluted breath into the germinating immortal as, to fulfill its desire, it begets him. It leads him early to eat of the forbidden fruit, and to blind him in the perception of truth, and to convert it into error. The sentence of death is upon their lusts, and when that comas, they can put up their hands, and pluck the fruits of heaven.' Union Village, Ohio.
