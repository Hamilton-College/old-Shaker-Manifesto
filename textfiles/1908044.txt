Published monthly, by Gould and Woolley, 1416 Chestnut St. Philadelphia, Pa. The Teacher's Outlook The Teacher's Outlook, is a new work and No. 1. of Vol. 1. is before us filled with articles that are interesting and instructive to both Teachers and pupils. It is published by the Teacher's Publishing Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, and will be devoted to 'Literature, Science, Health, Industrial and National Affairs.' The Magazine will contain a review of the Month, and present to its readers a fund of information that cannot be found in any other educational Journal. An essentially new feature in this work, will be to awaken an inspirational interest in the Teacher, in his high calling, and at the same time to place before him all the Literary questions that are receiving the attention of active minds. For the outlook we may anticipate an extended circulation, as we wish for it the success of earnest labor. Office 120 Fourth St. Des Moines, Iowa.
