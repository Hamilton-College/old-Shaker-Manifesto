THE WHOLE OF IT. by Rev. A. W. Jackson. [Contributed by J. J. Kaime.] Two golden texts, two truths,one for the mind, The other for the heart: the two combined, All higher guidance in them may we find. Deeds done by which earth's praises may be earned, Poor fed, the body given to be burned, If cold the heart, are surely all in vain; Our God's approval they shall nowise gain; In deeds no worth their motive fails to attain. In bonds we are, and some time, soon or late, In falsehood leai'n ours is the slave's estate. Nay, howsoe'er content we may remain, A pleasing error's but a pleasing chain. 'This know,' saith Christ, 'all ye who follow me; Love doth the law fulfill. The truth shall make you free.'
