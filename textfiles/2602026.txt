Pleasant Hours for Boys and Girls That bright and entertaining magazine for young people, Frank Leslie's Pleasant Hours for Boys and Girls, has some particularly good things in its January number. There is a beautifully illustrated article on 'The United States Naval Cadet,' by Joseph Coblentz Groff, which tells how appointments to Annapolis are secured and describes the daily life of the cadets; Charles Frederick Holder contributes a splendid short story about some boys who caught sharks for a living: there is an article telling how a boy may build a low-priced iceboat and learn to sail it, by Wilf. P. Pond; an illustrated New Year's story in verse, by Ethel Hatton; a paper on 'Snow Igloos and Images, and How to Make Them,' by J. Carter Beard; the continuation of' the two serials by Edward S. Ellis and Jeannette H. Walworth; several other short stories, some tricks and puzzles, and the editors interesting chat on the new books for boys and girls. Mrs. Annie Trumbull Slosson, the author of 'Fishin' Jimmy,' had a strangely impressive experience, a few years ago, while driving through the Green Mountain country of Vermont. She met a man, a waif, who evidently believed himself to be the Christ.
