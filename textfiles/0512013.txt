Chittenden, Vt., Oct. 30,1875 Dear Father Evans â€” I saw, in your monthly, a letter from Dr. Miller, stating: ' They say the Eddy Brothers are jealous of their Sister, Mrs. Hunter.' Please allow me to say, through your beautiful little paper, If there be jealousy, Horatio G. Eddy has no part in it. I have witnessed my sister's seances two evenings only ; I never saw such wonderful manifestations; I will not attempt to describe them. I was disappointed; old Mrs.Eaton, a spirit in William's seances, said Mrs. Hunter was a fraud. There was no fraud the two evenings I was there. I was surprised and glad to know she had so wonderful a gift; I wish there was a good materializing medium in every house, and spirits seen in all places. Good Angels, bless every medium in the land; do all you can to convince the doubting, that they have an immortal spirit. Their prison bars will be broken ; churches rot and decay; lawyers defraud no more for money ; ministers and all will have to do right, for the spirits of the dear ones can tell their own story. Good spirits, do your noble work ; come in every house ; I could beg, in every street, to have your work go on ; I am humble, and ask no praise for what the spirits do through me ; but bless the spirits for doing their work. Such, friend Evans, are my feelings. Publish, if it seem you good. Horatio G. Eddy
