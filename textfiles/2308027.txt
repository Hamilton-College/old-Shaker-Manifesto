'HOLINESS TO THE LORD.' Agnes Lee. 'In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, holiness to the Lord, and the pots of the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.' Zech. xiv., 20. In ancient times the people of Asia used bells on their horses and camels to encourage them in their work. The above passage was prophetic of a time when the law of the Lord should be 'written in the inward parts'�-when all the promises concerning God's chosen people, should be fulfilled in the great Sabbath, the millennial period of which their jubilee year was typical. A time of spiritual rest from all that was sinful, or in any way contrary to the higher laws of being. Truth is a unit, and real science and religion are always closely connected, as body and soul. The Jews were thoroughly schooled in relation to every department of physical existence, by their great lawgiver, Moses. They received many special instructions concerning agriculture and dietetics;�the manner in which they should manage their land, cook their food, etc. Their obedience to those laws made of them a distinct people, separate from all the surrounding nations. In that day they were a very crude people, just having been emancipated from Egyptian servitude, and could not understand spiritual things, therefore all their religious ceremonies were of an external nature; but the prophet foresaw the time, when in the progress of the race, their righteousness in physical things would be only as the foundation of a superior order of society, wherein man's moral and spiritual nature should be controlled by those higher laws of divine truth which should be taught by the Christ spirit, when' the whole life should be one of perpetual consecration, so � sanctified � through obedience to truth in every department of life that 'holiness to the Lord' would be as much observed in the treatment of the animals, the tilling of the earth or cooking of food, as in the sanctuary of worship. The prophetic period has come to us, and has or will come to any other people, according to the light given them and the mt-asure of ob^ dience they yield to that light in the observance of physical and spiritual law. We believe we can serve and honor God just as acceptably in the performance of the lowliest duties, of manual labor, as in those seasons set apart for spiritual devotions. To live in the truth is to 'write holiness to the Lord' on everything with which we come in contact. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
