SOUL AWAKENING. 'O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me.' Psalms, xliii., 3. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Awake, O soul, arise With faith and prayer, Cast 2. The angels circling, will With gifts reiine, And 3. Tread not the vale of woe Where shadow lies, When 4. Array thyself, O soul, In virgin white, Put ev'ry sin aside God's light to share. Go teach the holy laws Of life divine. Ope heights thou mayest scale 'Neath truth's fair skies. When on the jeweled crown Of dimless light. Work forth with firm desire, With trust and love, To wide thine avenues, Thy courts make pure. That pearly mansions shine, For thee a home, A with the power that works Triumphantly, Joined meet thee good will come From heav'n above. Christ may live and reign In thee secure, bide not where the floods Of evil come, to the heavenly host Then thou wilt be.
