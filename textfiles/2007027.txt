THE BIBLE IN THE SCHOOLS. A recent decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin declares the reading of the Bible in the public schools to be unconstitutional. The Court says the place where the Bible is read is a place of worship, and that as tax payers are compelled to erect and support school-houses, and the children are, under the law, compelled to attend public or private schools, the constitutional clauses forbid us to use school-houses as places of worship.
