GIVING UP EVIL HABITS We commend the following sensible advice to the consideration of a very important subject. Perhaps, reader, this is the great want of your manhood or womanhood. If applicable to your cases, fail not to accept and to act upon its suggestions: A very thoughtful editorial in a recent issue of the New York Sun calls attention to the high scientific opinion that can be quoted in favor of reducing the passion for intoxicants by the use of vegetable diet instead of meat, i. e., animal food. The experiment, we happen to know, has been made in a loose way in a small institution in England, without any scientific knowledge, and only on general principles, and from observation, and so far it sustains the opinion that vegetable food is less fitted to excite the terrible craving than animal. ]STo country in the world is richer in vegetables than ours. Why should not this point be tested in some of our asylums? The evil is so crying as to render any remedy welcome. Who is willing to give up his evil habits for the sake of preserving future generations from danger? Men toil to acquire property to bequeath to their children, but they never think of restraining their selfish impulses or intemperate desires, that their children may benefit by their restraint. It is a well-understood truth that the children of an habitual drunkard will be inclined to intemperance. Habit becomes second nature, and impresses the mind permanently ; and if a man indulges freely in drinking he excites the hereditary love of liquor in himself, and transmits it with accumulated force to his children. And were it not for the fact that most children were born before their parents had indulged in the degrading appetite to a serious extent, there would scarcely be a sober man found in the community.
