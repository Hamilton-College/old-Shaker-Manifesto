A Good Reminder The earliest converts to Christianity in Africa, were very earnest and regular in their private devotions. They had no closets, rooms for retirement, but each had a separate spot in the thicket, to which he used to go. The several paths to these little Bethels became distinctly marked; and, when any one began to decline in the ways of God, it was soon manifest to his fellows, and they would remind him of his duty, by saying, 'Brodder, de grass grow on your path yonder.'
