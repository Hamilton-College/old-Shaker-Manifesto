REMARKS. [We take from ' The Index of July 8th. ' the remarks that were made at the Convention of the Free Religious Association, held in Boston, Mass. May 29,1885.�Ed.] Joanna J. Kaime, a representative of the Canterbury, N. H. Shaker Community, arose in the audience and asking permission to say a few words, was cordially invited to the platform. I rise to express the very great pleasure I have enjoyed here in attending the meetings of Anniversary Week with you. When I look back and realize the changes that have taken place since the time the founder of our institution, who was a woman, came to this country, a little more than a cettury ago, and first pronounced many of the views I have heard expressed here this afternoon and during this week, I say to myself, The world does indeed move. Ann Lee, whom I am pleased to call ' mother ' first pronounced in this country, as we understand it, the equality of the sexes, and the duality of the Godhead, which is now recognized and indorsed by many outside of our institution. To set aside the doctrine of the Trinity was then considered almost blasphemous. Yet she did that, and established a parental form of government. She denied, too, there was any such thing as a literal physical resurrection. Perhaps she established the co-operative system as early as any one. Of course, she preached the doctrine of peace and unity; and, coming at the time of the American Eevolution, she was imprisoned as one who was a Tory, and as preaching what was detrimental to a republican form of government which our fathers were trying to establish. But the institution which she so early established has survived so far, and prospered; and whatever there may be of error, whatever there may be of wrong in it, I know that time and the blessing of God will purify it. It has been our effort to live true to the teachings of Christ, and to show ourselves to the world as earnest, Christian workers. I am glad to meet in this hall with the members of the Free Religious Society. My early days were so blessed with the ideas advanced by the anti-slavery movement, and all the way up since I joined the institution I am in, that I feel I live in the very atmosphere of free thought. My father was an intimate friend of Mr. Nathaniel Eogers, and the Herald of Freedom was as well known in our family as the Bible. I remember reading with tears of the murder of our lamented Lovejoy in the West. I have kept pace with the progress of all those movements, and I always feel it a pleasure when I meet any of the friends of woman suffrage or of Free religious thought. I came upon the platform to speak these few words, simply from a conviction of a religious duty I owe the institution of which I have been a member almost forty years. That institution has afforded me every opportunity for freedom of thought, for freedom in every respect; and if any advancement is lacking, and there is much which I hope to gain in the future, it is not owing to our institution. I thank you, Mr. President, for the privilege I have enjoyed. I am very glad to have met all these friends here and hope you may prosper as oar prayers go up to God for your success.

My dear Friends,�In listening to the earnest speeches this afternoon and throughout the week in behalf of a purer Christianity, of woman suffrage, and temperance, and moral reform, I said often to myself: 'Can I leave the city without telling the friends that I live in a home where I believe the kingdom of heaven is established upon the earth? Can I leave the city without proclaiming this truth, and inviting all who have any interest in this direction, who are seeking and asking what they shall do to be saved, to come with us ; to go wherever the spirit of God will lead you to seek a higher life and a greater truth that will bring your souls nearer God? ' I have found this life. I have found the truth that has been spoken of this afternoon. It is in Christ. It is a Christian life. It is the purity, the uprightness, the honesty, the nobility, that alone gives a noble character to any one in this world. And it is this character that will bring about the reform that is needed, that will result in the Free Religious associations, that will result in the greatest benefit to mankind. And the Shakers, my friends, are thoroughly in earnest in this work. They are really members of your Association. We are not able to become actual members, but in life and in principle we are members. And I want it to go far and near. I ask you to bear it in mind, and remember us in your prayers before God as brothers and sisters, as co-workers with you in this universal brotherhood. This principle is thoroughly exemplified in our Societies. Practical peace is there taught, and it is there practiced. And there are many other noble principles j I migh, speak of, all taken from the beautiful ex. ample of the life of Jesus. We live after that pattern. We have no other God but the God that you are serving.
