A Good Prayer A little boy, the son of a 'Friend,' about six years old, after sitting like the rest of the congregation in silence, all being afraid to speak first, as he thought, got up on the seat, and, folding his arms over his breast, murmured in a clear, sweet voice, j ust loud enough to be distinctly heard on the fore seat: 'I do wish the Lord would make us all gooder, and gooder, and gooder, till there is no bad left.' Would a longer prayer have been more to the purpose ? What will People Say.â€”This question makes the mind homeless. Do right and fear no one ; thou mayest be sure that with all thy consideration for the world thou wilt never satisfy the world. But if thou goest straight forward on thy way not concerning thyself with the friendly or unfriendly glances of men, then thou hast conquered the world, and it is subject to thee. By heeding the question ' What will people say ?' thou becomest subject to the world.
