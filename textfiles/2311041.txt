THE OVERCOMER. 'He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith.'ï¿½Rev., ii., 7. Canterbury, N. H. To him that overcometh, Will I grant to sit with me; I share my Father's Kingdom, There also he shall be. . . . No harm shall overtake him who worketh to the end; But power over nations upon him shall descend. THE OVERCOMER. A pillar in God's temple, Who overcomes I'll make; Go no more out for ever, A new name shall he take, He'll feed on hidden manna, Be clothed in raiment white; And him will I confess before my Father in the light.
