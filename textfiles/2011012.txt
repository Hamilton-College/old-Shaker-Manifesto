CHRISTIANS SHOULD NOT MARRY. Count Leon Tolstoi Declares That Marriage Was Not Instituted By Christ. The Author of 'Kreutzer Sonata' Advances a Startling Theory That Celibacy Is Right and Marriage Wrong. Continued from October 'Manifesto.' [Translated from Count Tolstoi's Manuscript.] CONSCIENCE THE GUIDE. 'Love God with all thy heart, all thy soul, and love thy neighbor as thyself.' 'As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.' 'Love your enemy.' Such is Christ's doctrine. He gives no definitions of acts ; He only points to that imperishable ideal which every man finds in his own heart the moment it is revealed to him. For him who professes the formal doctrine the scrupulous fulfillment of the law is attainment of perfection and puts a stop to all further aspirations. Thus the Pharisee gives God thanks that he has fulfilled the law, and the rich young man is satisfied because he, too, has obeyed it. And it is impossible that they should think or feel differently, for having reached their actual level there is no other height visible toward which they might wend their way ; whereas, for him who professes Christ's doctrine the ascent of one summit is but a fresh incitement to climb to one still higher, whence another pinnacle is seen in the distance, and so on without end. The Christian is always in the position of the publican; ever painfully conscious of his own shortcomings, ever eager to advance as he looks at the long stretch before him that lies between him and his goal. The man who follows the outward, forward law may be aptly likened to one standing in the light of a lantern attached to an immovable post. He cannot see to go further than where he stands. On the other hand, he who hearkens to the promptings of his inner conscience is as one who carries a lantern before him on a long pole : the rays are always dispelling the darkness in advance of him, ever lighting him forward, ever leading him on to new spheres. Chastity and celibacy, it is urged, cannot constitute the ideal of humanity, because chastity would annihilate the race which strove to realize it, and humanity cannot set up as its ideal its own annihilation. It may be pointed out in reply that only that is a true ideal which, being unattainable, admits of infinite gradation in degrees of proximity. Such is the Christian ideal of the founding of God's kingdom, the union of all living creatures by the bonds of love. The conception of its attainment is incompatible with the conception of the movement of life. What kind of life could subsist if all living creatures were joined together by the bonds of love? None. Our conception of life is inseparably bound up with the conception of a continual striving after an unattainable ideal. THE RACE DOOMED ANYWAY. But even if we supposed the Christian ideal of perfect chastity realized, what then? We should merely find ourselves face to face on the one hand with the familiar teaching of religion, one of whose dogmas is that the world will have an end; and on the other, of so-called science, which informs us that the sun is gradually losing its heat, the result of which will in time be the extinction of the human race. If the lives of us Christians are characterized by such a frightful contradiction between our consciences and reality it is because we fail to understand the doctrine of Christ, which points to an unattainable, imperishable ideal, and in consequence allow ecclesiastical prescriptions, wrongly called Christian, to be substituted for the Christian ideal. This has been done in the matter of divine service, of apostleship, of power and of much else. The same thing has been done in respect to marriage. Christ not only never instituted marriage, but if we search the formal precept on the subject we find that he rather disapproved of it than otherwise. ('And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land for my name's sake shall receive an hundred-fold and shall inherit everlasting life.' Matt, xix., 25; Mark x., 29, 30; Luke xviii,, 29, 30.) He only impressed upon married and unmarried alike the necessity of striving after perfection. The churches, however, by endeavoring, contrary to Christ's teaching, to establish marriage as a Christian institution, failed to create a solid institution, and yet deprived the people of the guiding ideal set up by Christ. The upshot of this ill-advised effort was that the people flung away the old before receiving the new: they lost sight of the true ideal of chastity pointed out by Christ and embraced outwardly the ecclesiastical dogma of the sacrament of marriage, a doctrine that has been built upon no foundation whatever, and which men do not really and sincerely believe. This affords us a satisfactory ex lanation of the fact, which at first sight seems a strange anomaly, that the principle of family life and its basis (conjugal, fidelity) are found to be more firmly rooted among peoples who possess clear and minute external religious prescriptions on the subject�among Mohammedans and Jews, for instance�than among so-called Christians. The former have a code of clear, detailed external precepts respecting marriage, whereas the latter have nothing of the kind. It is only over a very insignificant fraction of the unions which they contract that the men and women of our society have a ceremony performed by the clergy to which they give the name of sacramental marriage; they then live on in polygamy and polyandry and giving themselves up to vice in the belief that they are practicing the monogamy they profess. CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE A FRAUD. Now, there is not and cannot be such an institution as Christian marriage, just as there cannot be such a. thing as a Christian liturgy (Matt, vi., 5-12; John vi., 21,) nor Christian teachers, nor church fathers (Matt. xxiii., 8-10,) nor Christian armies, Christian law courts, nor Christian States. This was what was always taught and believed by true Christians of the first and following centuries. A Christian's ideal is not marriage, but love for God and for his neighbor. Consequently, in the eyes of a Christian, relations in marriage not only do not constitute a lawful, right and happy state, as our society and churches maintain, but, on the contrary, are always a fall. Such a thing as Christian marriage never was and never could be Christ did not marry, nor did He establish marriage : nei� ther did his disciples marry. But if Christian marriage cannot exist, there is such a thing as a Christian view of marriage. And this i-s how it may be formulated. A Christian (and by this term I understand not those who call themselves Christians, merely because they were baptized and still receive the sacrament once a year, but those whose lives are shaped and regulated by the teachings of Christ.) a Christian, I say, cannot view tlie marriage relation otherwise than as a deviation from the doctrine of Christ�as a sin. This is clearly laid down in Matt, v., 28, and the ceremony called Christian marriage does not alter its character one jot. A Christian will never, therefore, desire marriage, but will always avoid it. Tf the light of truth dawns upon a Christian when, he is already married, or if, being a Christian from weakness he enters into marital relations with the ceremonies of the Church, or without them, he has no other alternative than to abide with his wife (and the wife with her husband, if it is she who is a Christian,) and to aspire together with her to free themselves of their sin. This is the Christian view of marriage; and there cannot be any other for a man who honestly endeavors to shape his life in accordance with the teachings of Christ. A TERRIBLE CONCLUSION. To very many persons the thoughts I have uttered here and in 'The Kreutzer Sonata' will seem strange, vague, even contradictory. They certainly do contradict not each other, but the whole tenor of our lives, and involuntarily a doubt arises, 'on which side is truth�-on the side of the thoughts which seem true and well founded, or on the side of the lives of others and myself?' I,. too, was weighed down by that same doubt when writing 'The Kreutzer Sonata.' I had not the faintest presentiment that the train of thought I had started would lead me whither it did. I was terrified by my own conclusions, and was at first disposed to reject it; but it was impossible not to hearken to the voice of my reason and my conscience. And so, strange though they may appear to many, opposed as they undoubtedly are to the trend and tenor of our lives, and incompatible though they may prove with what I have heretofore thought and uttered, I have no chance but to accept them. 'But man is weak,' people will object. 'His task should be regulated by his strength.' This is tantamount to saying : 'My hand is weak. I cannot draw a straight line�that is, a line which will be the shortest line between two given points�and so, in order to make it mure easy for myself, T, intending to draw a straight, will choose for my inock'l a crooked line.' The weaker my hand the greater the need that my model should be perfect. (From the Philadelphia Press.) Leon Tolstoi.
