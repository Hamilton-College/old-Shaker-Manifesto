We are Remembered The dear, good sisterhood of a certain mountain home, appreciating our labors on our little Shaker have most kindly sent us a set of nice shirts. We do not know what we have done worthy of such a compliment; but we are full of resolves to work more earnestly for the cause, because of such kindly remembrances. We should be pleased io publish the loving letter accompanyingâ€”so full of the clear, sweet, tangiole gospel love and sentiment; but they will not permit. Unsalaried, but we are remembered!
