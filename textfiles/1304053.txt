Elzevir Library LITERARY CURIOSITIES. The poet, Richard Henry Stoddard's brilliant narrative of the 'Life of Washington Irving' forms No. 4 in the elegant little Elzevir Library, and is sold for the price of only 6 cents! After all cheap and handsome books are not limited to the so-called 'piratical reprints,' as this illustrates : the publishers paid Mr. Stoddard $500 for the Manuscript of this sketch—which is a tax of only a half-cent each, when charged over to one hundred thousand of their customers. Number 5 of the Library, also just issued, contains Andrew Wilson's 'The Sea Serpents of Science,' price 2 cents, and Number 6, Tennyson's famous 'Enoch Arden,' price 2 cents—in iormer years sold in large editions for $1.00, or more, per copy. And yet, these numbers are in beautiful type, handsomely printed on excellent paper. Sold by all dealers. John B, Alden, Publisher, 18 Vesey St., New York.
