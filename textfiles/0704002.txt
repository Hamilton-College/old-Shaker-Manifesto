Awake to the Danger! DANIEL OFFARD The Shaker is intended for the nunciation of truth ; and what truth is nore important to human welfare than hat the American government should be very unsectarian ? Believers should realize how great the dangers of a church-and-state combination in our government! The Shaker should awaken such as are asleep to the dangerous fact that old anti-christian, persecuting theology would injure unto death those who would not, could not think as it does. There is no crime known to men which church-and-state governments have not committed, and in the name of God and Jesus Christ too ! I do earnestly hope that The Shaker may be true to its name, and wage spiritual war, in battles of shaking, against every evil principle and power that is at work against the good of humanity. And let us, as brethren, true to the faith, hating the lusts of the flesh and of the mind, have our entire lives in accord with the sincerity of truth ; and though there may be differences of opinion theologically, the main purposes of our faith will be accomplished.
