Mount Lebanon, Jan. 7, 1871 'Dear Brother James — Almost three months have passed since I wrote to you. They have gone very fast, as I have been quite busy all the time. Our religion is decidedly practical, and therefore requires practical work. The teachings of the first founders of our system inculcated that principle in a most remarkable degree. One of the counsels of Mother Ann was : ' Put your hands to work, and your hearts to God.' And so we do. We work, not only because we like to do it, not only because we love one another, and, therefore, want to help and assist one another, but because we see the God-principle in it. God is love; and true love is active—active in self-sacrificing and devoted work for the good and happiness of others. ' During the short season you staid here, you went with us through our daily occupations ; they are, of course, very different now from what they were then, in the fail. Perhaps you would like to hear a little about them. In the winter we pass the most of our time in our shops. Only a few favored ones, the happy farmers and teamsters, are still out, drawing their logs and bringing ho7iie the wood that you are coming to help us saw and split next spring. I fear they would not think much about the favor of a day like this, when the mercury stands 20 below zero in a Fahrenheit thermometer, and the north wind would call forth thrifty colors on their cheeks. Such a clear, beautiful day you could never see on that foggy little island of yours, so you had better leave it, as soon as you can, and come over here. Now we will go through the shops; we have many such to answer our needs. Here is our printer at work, that old brother you remember, with a little bent body and the active speculative mind. Here is our carpenter, with his lumber and chips; a great heap of the latter, showing that he has done a good deal of work. Here, among all this machinery and iron-ware, is our comfortable looking little blacksmith. His enviable business is to mend all that the rest of us break, and to fix all that we put out of order. Do you wonder that his face is so bright, and his smile so pleasant, when you know that he has had so many good opportunities to practice patience and other Christian virtues ? Then come the shoemakers, in two shops, both full of sunshine. In the one dwells that venerable old brother, with the silvery hair; he who cut the carrot seed swifter than any of the rest of us. In the other, we feel the inspiring influences of more youthful powers devoted to a holy cause. While we speak about the shoemakers, it comes quite natural to think of the tailors. Well, the sisters are our tailoresses, and they are excellent ones too, as this is about all they do. There are two more shops that we have not yet visited; one of them is the broom shop. Do you remember, Wilbur, thai tall young brother with the open countenance and the bright eyes ? He is our broom-maker, and he turns out a good many every day. Now there remains only the seed shop : that is a very important place. If you only had known how much trouble we take about those seeds you helped us gather in last fall, you would have considered more than once before going to England. When we have got the seeds thrashed and well cleaned, we take them to the shop and put them up in little paper bags to send to our customers. What a job that is ! One cuts the bags, another folds them, a third one prints, a fourth one pastes them, a fifth one put in the seed, a sixth seals them up, a seventh puts them in the boxes and off they go, to our great rejoicing. One more has to go and collect the money for them, and that is the worst of all. Now, what do you think of all this ? I do not know how my description may appear to you; but I do know that the reality is very pleasant, very beautiful to me, to us. Our system stands unequaled. The spiritual man never yet arrived to a higher plane. The natural man never will understand it. When you come to taste its sweets, you will be heartily welcomed by all of us, and especially by your friend and brother, Emil Bretzner
