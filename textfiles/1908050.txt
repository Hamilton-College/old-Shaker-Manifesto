Henrietta Cook Henrietta Cook, at Harvard, July 10, 1889. Age 59 years. A victim in the prison-house of physical disability; she was deprived of the active exercise of those rare talents with which nature had generously endowed her. Hence, her life was one of enforced, passive, rather than active goodness. She has won the well-earned love and respect of all who knew her. No purer feet tread virtues path. E. M.
