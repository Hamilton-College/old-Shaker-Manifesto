SCRIPTURE TEXT. The 8th. verse of the 3rd. chapter of John. The wind bloweth where it listetn, and thou nearest the sound thereof,' but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit. A great many interpretations have been given to this passage of Scripture and yet the worldly wise-men have not confidence in their own illustrations. The rendering in the Diaglott gives us a better form,' 'The Spirit breathes where it will and thou nearest its voice.' The breathing or the outpouring of the Spirit of God awakens new life in the soul, and to accept this new life is to keep unspotted from the world. To be born of the Spirit is to grow in goodness, and a close communion with the testimony of Jesus affords a protecting influence over evil and assures us that he 'that is begotten of God keepeth himself and the wicked one toucheth him not.'
