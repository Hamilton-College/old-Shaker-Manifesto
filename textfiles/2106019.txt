Canaan, N. Y. May 12, 1891. Beloved Elder Henky :ï¿½Summer weather has burst upon us suddenly once more which makes us feel anxious to put the seed into the ground as fast as possible. Our grain is sowed, potatoes planted and we are ready for corn planting. We are having a beautiful spring, just now. It seems to me that the blossoms on the cherry, plum and pear trees never looked so lovely as at this time, and a promise of a bountiful yield of all kinds of fruit this season. We have been much favored through the winter just passed, with a good degree of health through the family. The 'grippe' has no place to lay its head in this part of Canaan and we are thankful that it is so. The Manifesto comes laden with good things like the refreshing after a summer shower. Your Brother, G. W. C.
