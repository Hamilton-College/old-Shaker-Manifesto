Resurrection of Life BY A. J. DAVIS When mankind shall have become spiritually larger and finer in body, they will have fewer and fewer children. Down in the lower stratum of society, behold how populous ! Take the early races, they propagate rapidly. Earth's mothers have been broken down by their exceedingly numerous progeny. Rise higher in the scale and the married have fewer children and less frequently. Rise still higher in the mental scale and you can easily believe the time will come that reproduction icill cease! There will then be fathers and mothers with their descendants, and the progeny will become as angels, neither marrying nor giving in marriage, having risen above the mission of reproduction. The cerebellum, I repeat, will one of these days cease to have any furniture with reference to reproduction! The finest and most poetic and spiritual minds gather nearly all their propagating power and essences into the front brain and top faculties. Only friends to truth dare to speak the whole truth on this subject.
