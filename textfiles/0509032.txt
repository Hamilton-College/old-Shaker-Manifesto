SABBATH Turn from the outward leaf of life, And give the Sabbath place ; Be earnest in the upward strife, Be thine the Christian grace. A Sabbath is a day of rest, Not measured by a span. They who with gospel faith are blest, Have rest in God's own plan. Each covenant the Saviour taught, Gives peace unmarred within. And forms a Sabbath, truly wrought, Out from a life of sin. Second to this, the work of hands, The toil on earthly sod; For when the truth our life commands, We've constant rest in God. M. Whitcher, Canterbury, N. H.
