'ABIDE WITH ME.' FIDELLA ESTABROOK. Abide with me, O Lord, forever, In the morning's ruddy glow, When temptation's darkening shadows In my pathway seem to grow. Still be near me, ever guiding, Up the steep and rugged height. On whose glorious summit beaming, Is a crown of golden light. Still be with me at the noon-tide, Through the heat and toil and care, And though rough the toilsome journey, May I know that Thou art near; Helping me to brave the tempest, ï¿½Guiding o'er the weary way; Teaching me the blessed lessons That Thy love and truth portray. And when evening's gentle shadows Gather near and nearer still, May I feel Thou wilt not leave me But Thy promised care fulfill; Then sweet peace shall crown my efforts. And will be my true reward, If aright I've turned my footsteps, Upward to the throne of God. Thus abide with me forever, Make my heart thy dwelling place, Where thy light in glory beaming Every error shall efface. And through phases ever changing I will cling in trust to Thee, While my earnest prayer ascending, Shall be, Lord, 'abide with me.' Hancock, Mass.
