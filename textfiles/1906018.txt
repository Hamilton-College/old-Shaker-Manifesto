THEOSOPHY. B. F. Bailey. [written for the manifesto.] Of the many topics which will naturally interest the readers of the Manifesto, the discussion concerning theosophy, will prove most valuable. I refer not only to the rapid dissemination of theosophical literature and organization of theosophical societies generally, in this country, but especially to the criticism of Dr. J. R. Buchanan who, as is well known, stands in the foremost rank of the spiritual writers of the day, and the very able and exhaustive reply of E. I. K. Noyes Esq. F. T. S. published in the ReligeoPhilosophical Journal of Chicago, in its issue of Apr. 2. 1889. I would that time and space permitted quoting the latter article entire, in lieu of being content with a few excerpts. Bro. Noyes in his article says:ï¿½ ' Theo-Sophia or Theosophy from two Greek words meaning Divine Wisdom, is a very comprehensive term. It means Divine Wisdom, the absolute sum of all knowledge, whether relating to the field of research we call science, or to the other and spiritual side of nature which has been claimed by The- ology us its special field, yet which must be in reality just as much under the rule of absolute law, and as scientific as the physical side of nature.' * * * ' It was under this definition of theosophist that the Theosophical Society was founded by a few sincere seekers after truth, and has grown and prospered up to the present time. It is not a religious society in the ordinary sense of that term, as it has not a set creed, requires assent to no dogmas, and has no prescribed theology.' * * * 'It numbers among its members, people of all beliefs, Buddhists, Brahmins, Hindus, Parsees, Mohamedans, Liberal Christians, Spiritualists and Agnostics, each studying from his own standpoint, and allowing full liberty to others, to do the same, recoguizing that no one observer has, or can have, the whole truth.' * * * 'The objects of the Society are as follows : 1. To form the nucleus of a universal Brotherhood of Humanity without distinction of race, creed or color. 2. To promote the study of Aryan and other Eastern literatures, religions and sciences. 3. To investigate unexplained laws of nature and the Physchical powers of man. ' The principle object of the society is the first, not simply in order but in importance. We believe that the inculcation of the principle of brotherhood and the essential unity of the race spiritually, is of the utmost importance at the present time, and that the carrying out of the principles of love and brotherhood, not simply in theory but in practical life, is the only remedy for the present ominous and uneasy condition of the working classes, (so called) and necessary to prevent the catastrophe, which must come as the logical and inevitable result of a civilization, which is purely selfish in its aim, putting every man against his neighbor in the struggle for material aggrandizement, instead oi' looking to the advancement of the community as a whole. We believe that mankind are one in their higher spiritual aspect, and that all true progress spiritually or materially, must be made as a race through the inculcation of the principle of love, and help of our fellow men ; that it is as impossible to really progress spiritually through the present selfish rules of life, where each strives to rise at the expense of his neighbor, as it would be for one to nourish one finger at the expense of the other fingers.' 'To aid in an humble way, the future spiritual growth of humanity through the inculcation and practice of the principle of brotherhood and love, and by unselfish impersonal work for humanity. Personally by striving to kill out selfishness in ourselves, forgetting self in work for others and as a society, by spreading these ideas as widely as possible and trying to bring their truth home to as many individuals as we can.' It will readily be discerned by our Shaker friends that the Theosophical society is an arant courier in disseminating the very doctrines and principles which are fundamental in all Shaker Societies.
