I thank you heartily for saying you hope I shall get well... ' I thank you heartily for saying you hope I shall get well. I mean to get well, and shall do all in my power to accomplish it. But I don't pray for it any more than you, in the sense you write the words. To me prayer is a natural and most delightful exercise. It is thus: I feel conscious of the presence of the Infinite power, mind, and love, which makes and governs the universe; I feel that it is close to me; then, conscious of that dear Presence, I think over the blessings I have and the use I make of them, I remember the many things I have done, and I think of the right things I ought to do, I recollect my joys and my sorrows, my hopes and my fears. 'So my prayer is an act of gratitude, of penitence (if I have done wrong), of aspiration and of joy. But it is not an act of petition. I don't ask God to do my work; to saw my wood; to write my books, or to make me a good man. Now, with this notion of prayer, I should no more ask God to restore my health, than I should to buy me a cargo of tea. I am amazed that men should think their feeble words can alter the mind of the Almighty God, and, still more, that they should dare to do it if they could. If I thought it was God's desire that I should die, to-day, but that my asking for life would lead him to let me live thirty years more, I should not dare to put my little mind against his infinite wisdom, and ask for life.'
