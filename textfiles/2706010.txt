It being customary to use our Periodical for recording notes of the weal and woe of our various organizations, I take the liberty to present a picture in brief of how things move in and around our domicile. It is the vernal season of the year, when 'Vernal flowers are preparatives to Autumnal fruits.' It being seed time we are busy in making preparation, by plowing and sowing, for the future harvest. The earth is attired:� 'By the soft season, when descending showers Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flo wei's.' If old Tyrant Frost is firmly kept in check and martingal, the indices point to a fruitful season. Sr. Amelia Calver having taken a trip to the United State's Capitol City and vicinity and having surveyed the works of art and monuments of wealth returned to her mountain home April 30. Some others have made an eternal visit to the New Jerusalem, the City of Heavenly Light. May 2nd, Sabbath afternoon, a company from the Mount went to Hancock to attend the funeral of Eldress Lois Wentworth. This afternoon we are summoned to attend the funeral of Sister Olive Chapel of the South family. 'On Eaith we have no ul&gt;iiing place . But to*t as billows beat.' My wandering thought sometimes runs against a query, that may not, at present, admit of a definite solution.�Example: Is the earth plane a nursery for producing intelligent individualities to people the spirit spheres'? Were there individualized spirits without first being developt in the matrix of materiality? If so, why were not all created spirits at fiist, uninfected by materiality? Why? Calvin G. Reed North. Family. May, 1897. Yesterday there past, through our peaceful village, seven teams heavily loaded with gun-powder; whither bound we are not yet informed. We hope it may not be for human destruction, but the thought gives vis a shudder while the news of war and rumors of greater war are daily reaching us. Greatly in contrast is this to the sights and sounds which greet eye and ear at the present moment. The strife may not be less�but how different in motive and effect. The 'shouldering arms' with lumber and garden implements by the Brethren,, with equipments for housecleaning and window painting by the Sisters, while the wondrous miracle of spring unrolls as TERMS. a beautiful vision to the inner as to the outer perceptions when we read what it symbolize.s in the life of humanity. Surely as the gushing life of spring and the golden wealth of harvests are wrapt in the cold bosom of winter, so during the long period of seeming spiritual inertia which, has brooded over the world, vital forces have been concentrating that ere long will find expression in a more enlightened and advanced people than have ever before been the subjects of a deep spiritual revival. Let us who have years and responsibility before us renew our faith in God, in the potency of justice and in its fuller meaning�Love, and whatever the present seeming advantages, bear always in mind that no blessing to the individual or community can ever accrue through a compromise of righteous principles. Many before us and with us have set noble examples while some have mist the mark. We are debtors to the wise and to the unwise. . By kindness of Editor in sending copies we are glad to know that 'History of the Shakers' has been put in pamphlet form entitled 'A Christian Community.' We think it the most agreeably written and, for its length, the most comprehensive of any sketch which has yet been issued. In appearance and worth it is a twin to 'Advent of the Christ in Man and Woman,' by the same author. The latter is equally graceful, clear and well-adapted for present circulation among refined and intelligent people. Blessings to all who are spreading the light. Catherine Allen. West Pittsfield, Mass. May, 1897. As I tried to recall some item of news by which I might interest the members of the Home Circle, and finding none, Sussyi Coolidge's beautiful poem came to my mind so appropriately that I 'pass it on' for the benefit of others. 'A commonplace life we say and we sigh, But wliy should we sigh as we say? The commonplace sun in the commonplace sky Makes up the commonplace day. The moon and the stars are commonplace things, And the flower that hlooms, and the bird that sings, But dark were the world and sad our lot, If the flowers should fail and the sun shine not,� And God, who studies each separate soul, Of our commonplace lives makes His beautiful whole.' Daily duties, enobled by Christlike motives may, like the diamond, be transformed from stones in the pathway to bright jewels in a crown. Housecleaning has been the chief industry during the past few weeks, and the 'Little drops of water, and little grains of sand,' have found a more practical use than 'making mighty oceans' or 'forming beauteous lands.' Nature's artist is busily at work adorning the hills and valleys about our home. The sweet Trailing Arbutus, which in part recompenses for the long cold winter, has brightened us with its star-like blossoms, and the friendly wild flowers, respond in answer to the 'Roll-call,' of the sun. The birds are daily holding long sessions of a Congress for the purpose of discusssing summer residences of safety and comfort. Among other welcome spring arrivals was that of Eldress Miriam Offord who alighted at our home and spent a short time with us, but she 'spread her wings for flight' and disappeared, ere we had but heard the flutter of her wings. Elder George Clark also spent a few hours with us. We are at present enjoying the presence of our loved Ministry. We would chain the feet of Father Time if by so doing we might hinder his flig ht, and thus make their stay with us lo nger, but he is a swift traveler, and each day disappears with 'King Sol' in his journey beyond our mountains in the west, before we can capture him. Eldress Lois, of East family, left us, the last day of April for a home in the Sum- mer Land, where we are told the beauties of summer are never interrupted by the cold winter. Her friends, including some from Mt. Lebanon, met to say farewell, only for a time, however, for we wish to join her in that heavenly home, at some future time. Fidelia Estabrook. Shakers, N. Y. May, 1897. Action is the watchword at present in the agricultural and horticultural domain. The tillers of the soil are preparing it for the reception of the good seed and will anxiously watch its growth and defend it against its many foes in the shape of weeds and injurious insects. We hope that the harvest will be one that will gladden their hearts. That nature abhors a vacuum is proven by the fact that whatever the preparations may be for sowing the good seed if it is not placed in the ground where it can receive warmth and moisture to cause its latent powers to come forth into a more advanct life, its place will be filled by he tares which will be a hindrance to its development. The harmony that exists in the forces that are denominated the material and the spiritual is such that the line can not be drawn which is to decide where one ends and the other begins. In both there are the seasons of seed-time and harvest, and also the silent winter of rest waiting for the resurrection of the spring-time. May not the present be that season in which our spiritual forces are being strengthened for the coming compaign? The prospect at present is looking favorable for all kinds of fruit. We would just whisper to our good Editor that we planted some melon seeds a few days ago and will guard their growth very carefully, hoping the Editor will make his appearance when they are ripe. Hamilton DeGraw. Enfield, N. H. May, 1897. On May oth, our Society met with an irreparable loss in the demise of Sister Julia Kussell. The departure of so valuable a member is only consolable in the sweet anticipation of our future meeting when we exchange the germ of materiality for a spiritual robe of immortality. Living justly and purely, life becomes glorified in Christ. Should grief assail, if out of the waters of tribulition we piss upon the golden sands of moral solidity, we shall receive from the spiritual censor of God's love, soul strength and consolation. Difficulties insurmountable? 'Where there is a will there is a way;' and in the wilderness of human imperfection, the ax of industry in the hands of earnest heartedness only hews off all unprofitable branches that disfigure the tree of life: whereas the jump rope of pleasurable ease never rids of that which defileth. Thus in the life of Christ, and with the knowledge of right and wrong which experience gives, no one his an excuse to walk blindly from the way which requires willing service for the good of home and humanity, that tones life to the key of harmony with Christ and enables one to read the notes of Christian service in every law of righteousness, prompting the strife to 'go and sin no more.' Sister Fanny Fallon has opened the summer term of school with twenty-two pupils. Our maple harvest was very short, consequently the yield was less than that of last year, yet one hundred and ninety-five gallons of syrup were made. Our kitchen garden, under the fostering care of Brother Fred Houndslow, gives promise of a satisfactory yield of good things. While busy hands are active in caring for the temporal needs of our Society, may our lives yield but those fruits which bless Zion and fashion us after the Christ life. George H. Baxter. ?1 Sabbathday Lake, Me. May, 1891. May comes in quite cold, with frequent frosts. On the 6th inst. we had a thunder shower accompanied by hail which fell in solid globules. During the past week we have set out two thousand strawberry plants which are in a fair way to yield a good crop another year. Notwithstanding the low price of apples we have taken courage and are setting out two hundred apple trees. Elder William Dumont has planted chestnut trees for each of the children and if they grow into big trees, how happy they will feel by and by. The young Brethren are setting out raspberry bushes and caring for tomato, celery and cabbage plants and at this time the green-house is much crowded and the many blooming plants make it quite an attractive place. We have nearly three hundred potted plants for sale b'esides many dozen boxes of flower seedlings. Our usual amount of sweet pea seed is already in the ground and before long we shall be making the beautiful flowers into bouquets. How much we should enjoy attending the Union Feast with the North family at Lebanon, but we too must not 'hope for the impossible.' Not long since our boys had a picnic dinner which they took to the Lake, where they spent the day in fishing. All day� in a boat�first in one place then in another they fished and not a fish did they catch! Ada S. Cummings.
