Sabbathday Lake, Me. May, 1891. May comes in quite cold, with frequent frosts. On the 6th inst. we had a thunder shower accompanied by hail which fell in solid globules. During the past week we have set out two thousand strawberry plants which are in a fair way to yield a good crop another year. Notwithstanding the low price of apples we have taken courage and are setting out two hundred apple trees. Elder William Dumont has planted chestnut trees for each of the children and if they grow into big trees, how happy they will feel by and by. The young Brethren are setting out raspberry bushes and caring for tomato, celery and cabbage plants and at this time the green-house is much crowded and the many blooming plants make it quite an attractive place. We have nearly three hundred potted plants for sale b'esides many dozen boxes of flower seedlings. Our usual amount of sweet pea seed is already in the ground and before long we shall be making the beautiful flowers into bouquets. How much we should enjoy attending the Union Feast with the North family at Lebanon, but we too must not 'hope for the impossible.' Not long since our boys had a picnic dinner which they took to the Lake, where they spent the day in fishing. All day� in a boat�first in one place then in another they fished and not a fish did they catch! Ada S. Cummings.
