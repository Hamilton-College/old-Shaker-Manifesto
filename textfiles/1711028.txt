A THOUGHT FOR OTHERS Life is full of earnest purpose, Noble deeds and worthy care ; But amid the strife and struggle Let the pleasant word be there. Smooth the brow from frowns unlovely: Tune the heart to cheerful words; Pause and look at smiling Nature; Learn a lesson from the birds. High resolves and lofty planning Need not cloud the dauntless heart; With the hoping and aspiring Let a kindly word have part. Oh, the world would be the better, If each morn our hearts would say : 'Through the struggle and the warfare I will help some soul to-day ! ' Only, mayhap, with a greeting, Or a passing word of cheer; Yet some downcast heart may brighten, Finding sympathy so near. Selected.
