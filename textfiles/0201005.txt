ANIMADVERSIVE Our leader, in Sept. No. 1871. has been the subject of much valuable criticism ; our object being1 therein, to urge the necessity of worshiping the Christ-principle, and not the person of Jesus; and to worship this principle in whom, and wherever it is manifested. The critics have almost invariably concluded, with us, that Jemawai not, but hecame'the Christ—the first born of many Christs—our exampler; and Saviour only, as we follow his example. The following ' 'child of promise,1' from The AmyjSpiritualist, bearing on the same subject, is from the pen of that exalted spiritualist, J. M. Peebles.
