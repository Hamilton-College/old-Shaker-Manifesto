Slave Pompey's Logic â€” ' Pomp, when your master died, he left word in his will that you should be buried in his vault.' ' I thanks you, ma'am,' said Pomp, \' I thanks you for that ar ; but I'd rather not.' ' Rather not, Pomp ! why ? ' ' 'Cause, missus, I'm feared that when the devil comes for old massa, he might make a mistake and take old Pomp.'
