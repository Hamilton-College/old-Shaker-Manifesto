A Tribute In Memory of Sister MARY ELLA DOUGLAS. Ada S. Cummings. O precious, precious Sister! Time's journey now is o'er, And in the noonday of thy life, Thou'st reached the Golden Shore. Thou dost not fear to enter Thy rest, thy heavenly home, Tho' thy barque is frail to venture On that strange voyage alone. Thou dost not fear the murmur Of that ever restless tide, Thou knowest well the boatman Will be to thee a guide. Thou dost not fear O Sister, Death hath no dread to thee, Thy spirit goes to dwell above, Among the ransomed, free. We've seen thee drooping, day by day, Like a lily pure and sweet, And fragrant petals in the way, Thou hast scattered at our feet. We've known so frail a flower Would not withstand our clime, We knew 'twould be transplanted In the Master's own good time. Thou walked with us in Springtime, When earth renewed her dress, Thou lingered ever near us, In Summer's loveliness. And when the winds of Autumn Closed down upon us here, We saw thy form grow chilly, And knew that death was near. We knew with sad regretting That short would be thy stay, E'er Winter's sun was setting, Thy life would ebb away. 75 THE MANIFESTO. And when old Winter's chilling blast Roars round our home, in pain We see thy loved form borne away Ne'er to return again. Come often near us, angel one, And make thine own self known; O be to us a guiding star! And leave us not alone. We always loved thy presence pure, And now 'twill sweeter be For thou hast doffed the robes of time For immortality. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
