SILENCE It was said of Zeno, that he chose silence as his pet virtue, because thereby he could discover better the errors of others' speech and, at the same time, conceal his own. We clip from an exchange the following gem on the same subject: ' Have you learned the secret of silence ? Silence under injuries, when speech would breed wrath; amid discouragement when it would spread fear? Silence through welldoing, which speech would mar by telling ; after successes, to trumpet which were to fail ? There are times enough for speech ; times when silence is false, cowardly, treacherous. To know when to be silent, and how to be silent, neither defiantly nor artfully, but gently, truly and strongly ; a silence of the mouth uncontradicted by look of the face or thought of the heart; this is one of the finest of the fine arts, one of the most beautiful of the beauties of holiness. ' He shall not strive nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.' '
