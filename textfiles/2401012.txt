When this number of our Manifesto reaches us, we shall stand at the portal of a New Year, recognizing the fact that this New Year will be to us what the Old Year has made it. If it has been our earnest labor all along the past months to carry out the honest intentions of last New Year, when we could say, 'Build thee more stately mansions O my soul, As the swift seasons roll' we are now more fully expanded into a noble Christian character. How beautiful is ideal life as it pictures itself before us, when we are on some 'Mount of Transfiguration.' But the possession of that ideal comes not through observation. 'When the humblest duties of life are performed with a cheerful patience; when the left hand hardly knows what the right does; when we can sacrifice ourselves in little acts in which we feel no glory at all' then the perfect character is growing within us though we may know nothing of it, save the restful assurance that we, by aiming to be faithful in little things, are reaching our highest possibilities. We read with pleasure the Centennial observances, of Enfield and Shirley, and wonder why we could not have done as well, when it was so often agitated in our Society previous to the closing of our Century. Many thanks to the contributor of 'A Paraphrase on Taking Offence' in Dec. No. When we have learned this lesson much of the vinegar of life will be transformed to the oil of peace; for the effort to guard and care for 'I, mine, and me,' is the foundation of most of life's inharmonies.
