A note from 'The Gospel of Good News'... A note from 'The Gospel of Good News.' 'Employees of the Boston and Maine K. R. have received the following circular,' 'Your attention is called to the fact 239 240 TJ IE MA NIFES TO. that you are not allowed to use tobacco in any form whatever, while on duty, nor on trains, nor in stations when off duty with uniform or badge on. This rule is imperative, and must be regarded at all times.' Scientific American. REMARKS. The managers of the B &amp; M. R. R. are certainly worthy of many tlianks for this advance movement in moral reform, and we hope they may be able to carry it to a successful issue. Neatness comes quite near to godliness, even in and around the railroad cars, and if as it is said that great corporations have no soul, and as a consequence can not become godly, they certainly have a quality the next best which allows them to preach the gospel of neatness. We wonder what the tobacco chewing and tobacco smoking ministers will do now?
