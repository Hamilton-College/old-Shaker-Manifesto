NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN Socrates, at an extreme old age, learned to play on musical instruments. Cato, at eighty years of agï¿½, learned to speak the Greek language. Plutarch, when between seventy and eighty, commenced tke study of Latin. Boccaccio was thirty-five years of age when he commenced his studies in light literature, yet he became one of the grandest masters of the Tuscan dialect, Dante and Petrarch being the other two. Sir Henry Spelman neglected the sciences in his youth, but commenced the study of them when he was between fifty and sixty years of age. After this he became a learned antiquarian and lawyer. Doctor Johnson applied himself to the Dutch language but a few years before his death. Ludovico Moenaldsco, at the great age of one hundred and fifteen, wrote the memoirs of his own times. Ogilby, the translator of Homer and Virgil, was unacquainted with Latin and Greek until he was past fifty. Franklin did not fully commence his philosophical pursuits till he had reached his fiftieth year. Dryden, in his sixty-eighth year, commenced the translation of the Iliad, his most pleasing production. We could go on and cite thousands of examples of men who commenced a new study, either for livelihood or amusement, at an advanced age. But every one familiar with the biography of distinguished men will recollect individual cases enough to convince them that none but the sick and indolent will ever say, 'I am too old to learn.'
