Groveland, N. Y. May 4, 1890 When we wrote our notes about home last April we promised that during the May month we would give a continuation of the story commenced away back in the Autumn of a year which is to be no more. To begin our conversation, we will tell you that Easter Sunday was observed in this place. Our Sabbath morning devotions were opened by the reading of a chapter from the Episcopal Service. With the entire exclusion of the great and flourishing display of floral designs, which is ever the leading burden of all other churches throughout the religious world, we participated in a mightier and grander offering, an offering of the never fadeless plants and blossoms, flowers created to flourish only in the spiritual realm, to their increase and beauty there shall be no end. Spring with its usual duties is again with us, and all around us Are fields to be planted and meadows to be sown; Orchards to be caved for where sweet fruits are grown. With plowing and hoeing from morning fill eve, With hands ever busy much good we'll receive. Winter wheat all through the Genesee Valley is quite seriously damaged; the upland fields appear somewhat more promising than the low land; warm days and cold nights, as all farmers know (especially the western class) are most unprofitable weather for wheat; it is far more injurious than constant freezing, even though the ground remains without snow from November first till April last. The wheat fields through this section of the Genesee, will at the present estimate, produce less than a two-thirds crop, though we ï¿½ may be agreeably disappointed. House-cleaning with its variety of labor is just now one of the principal factors in our household economy; as the rainy days go on a vacation we improve the sunny ones to the best advantage by renovating carpets, mats, rugs and all such useful items that are repositories for dirt and dust. Windows and furniture each in their turn are cleaned, and stoves are blackened and polished to Ethiopian perfection. And when arranged each in its place, They'll envy not the darker race. But the ceiling, Ah! the ceiling, On inspection there's revealing Dots and dashes, numerous splashes Made by traveling insect might. All must be removed by sweeping And the labor keep repeating, Till the dashes, dots and splashes Are removed from human sight. While we strictly recommend practicing the wise old saying 'Look Upward' we must admit there are exceptions to this teaching. Here is one of them. When your apartments are ready for the ceilings'and upper walls to be brushed, mark the place, then close your eyes and proceed with your brushing, and so on till the walls are thoroughly dusted; but if you must look up while the sweeping continues do not fail to first shut your eyes tightly. By following this mild plan you can pass through house-cleaning with eyes healthy and shining, undimmed by the falling dust or other foreign obstructions. Summer birds are daily returning, but 'Her Majesty's Grand Army' the English Sparrows or pirates have taken up arms against the. multitude of superior excellence and are yearly driving them from home and happiness. These English pets are American pests. Who can devise ways and means for exterminating them? If they are allowed to grow and increase as the 'leaves of the forest' which they are year by year, a famine is feared by many in this country. Wise men and women make haste to stay their progress. The warmest and hottest day we have met with this spring was on the 15th. ult. The mercury reached 94 degrees in the shade, 'Yet these are to follow.' G. D. G.
