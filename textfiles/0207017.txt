'This is for your Health.' The most popular and consistent Health journals of to-day are those which teach prevention of disease; and where this has been contracted, direct applications of water or magnetic baptisims. Of this class of journalism, we cannot speak too highly. It begins a reformation of the physical race in the most proper direction—diet. And until this is accomplished, we shall, from the unnatural concomitants of blood, continue to bewail the multiplication of so-called human beings, of whom God cannot make Shakers. We have need of more good material for Christ baptisms; and we hail every effort made on the earthly plane, to regulate the diet of the race, through this its reproductions, and through both of these, teach man of the two orders of existence, first the earthly, then the heavenly; and that properly directed, expedites this. We call attention to The Herald of Health: is a good and re- liable journal of its class. It has, in some late articles, dealt out to its readers some xery unpalatable truths; but whoever has swallowed them, have been convinced of their efficacy. Price, $1.25 per year, Wood &amp; Holbrook, New York. Home and Health, is also deserving of much success. $1.50 a year. De Puy, Holmes &amp; Co., New York. The Laws of Life, Danville, N. Y., comes from ' Our home on the hillside'; and no journal tells more truth about dress for females, and diet for dyspeptics. Austin, Jackson &amp; Co., Publishers. Send for sample copy. The Science of Health threatens to surpass all else in counsels to the well and in its truth-telling to the sick. Whoever subscribes for this, may ' throw all medicine to the dogs'—who heretofore have been too sensible for the doctors. Its appearance is strikingly beautiful. Price, $2.00 a year. S. K. Wells, New York.
