THE WAY, THE TRUTH, THE LIFE. NANCY G. DANFORD. ' No man cometh to the Father but by me. ' Christ. The reason is obvious, we cannot go except we walk in the way. It would be very absurd to say we wish to reach any particular place and still continue to persistently walk in the opposite direction. Even so we must walk in Christ, who declares himself to be the only way, which leads to Clod, the fountain of all goodness, if we would obtain that oneness, which is both the right and the test of the true disciple. By walking in Him we walk in the truth, as He is truth. We shall be upright and honest in all things. Not only shall we speak the truth to our neighbor, but we must deal it to our own souls, by condemning all wrong in ourselves, thus live the perfect truth at all times and in all places. Christ is also the Life thereof; if we would walk in the way and the truth, we must live the life. This calls for a renunciation of self and selfish desires and appetites, even the laying down of our carnal lives that we may be able to live by the same principles that he lived, thus following his example by walking in the same self-denial and continually doing good to all, as far as lies in our power. In this way we conquer and crucify self. When this is accomplished we have no inclination to follow any other course. Then shall we be filled with all the fullness of love and inherit the reward of sweet peace, when we have come to God our heavenly Father and Mother, not by believing merely, but by actually living the ' Way, the Truth, and the Life.
