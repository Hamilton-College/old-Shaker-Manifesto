Potato Custard Pie Take good sized potatoes, either sweet or Irish, boil and as soon as done, remove the skins and rub through a sieve ; add one-half dozen eggs; two teacupfuls of sugar; beat well and add one quart of sweet milk, and flavor with lemon. This makes six pies. One large sweet potato is allowed to each pieâ€”Irish potatoes in proper proportion.
