NO BAD HABITS That the absence of bad habits, such as drinking, using tobacco, and playing games of chance does speak volumes for the success of young men when considered merely from a business standpoint, is clearly illustrated by the following anecdote from a popular daily : ' Horace B. Clafflin, the most prominent and wealthy dry goods merchant of New York, was alone in his office one afternoon, when a young man, pale and careworn, timidly knocked and entered. ' Mr. Clafflin,' said he, ' I have been unable to meet certain payments because certain parlies failed to do by me as they agreed to do, and I wTould like to have $10,000. I come to you because you have been a friend to my father, and might be a friend to me.' ''Come in,' said Mr. Clafliin, 'come in and have a glass of wine.' ''No,' said the young man, 'I don't drink.' ' ' Have a cigar, then?' ' ' No, I never smoke.' ''Well,' said the joker, 'I would like to accommodate you, Lut I don't think I can.' ' 'Very well,' said the young man, as he was about to leave the room. ' I thought perhaps you might. Good day, sir.' ' 'Hold on,' said Mr. Clafflin, 'you don't drink?' ' ' No, sir.' ' ' Nor smoke, nor gamble, nor any thing of the kind?' '' No, sir' ' ' Well,' said Mr. Clafflin with tears in his eyes, 'you shall have it, and three times the amount if you wish. Your father let me have $5,000 once, and asked me the same questions. No thanks â€” I owe it to you for your father's sake.''
