A MERCHANT'S STORY. HOW HE SECURED A SITUATION�A LESSON TO YOUNG MEN. [Contributed by Elder G. B. Avery.]I was seventeen years old when I left the country store I had tended for three years, and came to Boston in search of a place. Anxious, of course, to appear to the best advantage, I spent an unusual amount of time and solicitude upon my toilet, and when it was completed, I surveyed my reflection in the glass with no little satisfaction, glancing lastly and most approvingly upon a seal ring which embellished my little finger, and my cane, a very fine affair, which I purchased with direct reference to this occasion. My first day's experience was not encouraging; I traversed street after street�up on one side and down on the other�without success. I fancied, toward the last, the clerks all knew my business the moment I entered the door, and they winked ill-naturedly at my discomfiture as I passed out. But nature endowed me with a good degree of persistency, and the next day I started again. Toward noon I entered a store where an elderly gentleman stood talking with a lady by the door. I waited till the visitor had left, and then stated my errand. 'No, sir,' was the answer, given in a peculiarly crisp and decided manner. Possibly I looked the discouragement I began to feel; for he added, in a kindlier tone, 'Are you good at taking a hint?' ;'I don't know,' I answered, while my face flashed painfully. 'What I wish to say is this,' said he, smiling at my embarrassment; 'if I were in want of a clerk, I would not engage a young man who came seeking employment with a flashy ring on his finger and swinging a fancy cane.' For a moment, mortified vanity struggled against common sense, but sense gained the victory, and I replied�with rather a shaky voice, I am afiaid�'I'm very much obliged to you,' and then beat a hasty retreat. As soon as I got out of sight, I slipped the ring into my pocket, and walking rapidly to the Worcester depot, I left the cane in charge of the baggage master 'until called for.' It is there now, for aught I know. At any rate I never called for it. That afternoon I obtained a situation with the firm of which I am now a partner. How much my unfortunate finery had injured my prospects the previous day I shall never know, but I never think of the old gentleman and his plain dealing, without feeling as I told him at the time, very much obliged to him.
