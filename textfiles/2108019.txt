NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Average of Weather at Mount Lebanon. June.. Thermometer. Rain. 1890. 66.10 2% in. 1891. 66.16 3)4 in. Geo. M. W. Center Family. July 12, 1891. Otjk farmers are deep into haying. Youth boys are picking cherries, of which we are having a plenty and to spare. Had new potatoes on the 4th and to-day. They seem a third larger, though still small and not more than half grown. Have two in- quirers here, who seem to be far advanced in spiritual perception, as to the fitness of our work to the present needs of the world. Mark M. Pomeroy and wife spent the Sabbath here, a few weeks since, and has given us a rosy description in his July Advance Thought. He seemed pleased with his visit and with the way we conduct matters and to rightly appreciate our place and work in the world. We view such as indicators of the world's advance in spiritual enlightenment, if no more. * The past month has been a very fruitful one. Strawberries have yielded very abundantly, and extra fine. Cherries are just splendid, and the boys are about tired of picking them. Gardens are looking exceedingly well and promise a plentiful harvest. We enjoyed a beautiful visit with our gospel friends from Enfield, N. H. Only one fault to find; there were no Brethren. They were the most prompt company I ever had the pleasure of waiting upon, always on hand at the appointed time in every instance. Am very sorry to learn we are to have no more visitors this season; perhaps they are being reserved for 1892. We have commenced haying, but oh! the weather; much better for setting out cabbages than for making hay. We have set up, ready for use a hay loader; big stories are told about it, we shall have a story to tell bye and bye. We also have a reaper and binder alreadj to put in the harvest field when the time comes. It costs a good deal to keep up with all the various improved machinery; but I rather think it would cost more to keep on in the old way. Life is a continual problem solved one day at a time. We can generally see afterward where we could have done better. Thanks for new music. In kindest love, D. O. Bk. Daniel's notes slipped off from the end of his pen and into the mail before we were aware he had written them. I thought we would give the account of the strawberry crop, which has been so bountiful this season. According to the size of the patch which yielded best, .we think there would have been over one hundred bushels to the acre; the berries were marvels as to size, and delicious in flavor, I think they are mostly of the Sharpless variety. Here is the aggregate account. Picked 37 bushels and 19 quarts. Preserved 55 gallons. Sold 7 bushels and 22 quarts. Gave away 2 bushels, and 26 quarts. Finished picking the eleventh. Desiring that our love and best wishes may be communicated to one and all of our gospel friends at Canterbury, I am as ever your gospel sister, M. J. A. Watervliet, N. Y. July 1891. Elder Henry :ï¿½I send a few notes from the north family. We are busily engaged at farming and the making of brooms. We commenced the cutting of hay the 27th of June. We are anticipating some fruit from the apples, pears, plums, peaches, quinces and grapes. Elder Nathaniel Fry, who is 88 years of age, has raised and picked five bushels of strawberries this season. Pretty good for one of that age. We have about an acre in raspberries, of the red, 'Cuthbert variety. We are all interested in the Manifesto as a medium of communication between the Societies'. The Home Notes are a good thing. J. L. Hancock, Mass. July 12, 1891. We have recently been blest with refreshing showers, but the weather is quite warm and the earth has become so parched that more rain is needed. Our farmers have commenced haying and find the grass crop lighter than that of last year. North Family. We have also been spiritually refreshed by the interchange of love, sweet association and intercommunion with those dear, true-hearted Zion travelers who recently visited here. Mav the reflections of their brief sojourn here, be as pleasing to them as it is to us beneficial. We notice that the death of our beloved Sister, Anna Pool, was not recorded in the July No. of Manifesto, owing doubtless to our negligence in sending it. The heavenly riches are hers. She has been a resident of our Society for fifty-five years, was a worthy Sister devoted to the cause in which she had enlisted, and was loved and respected by all who knew her. Our school having been in session for twelve weeks, closed on the 10th. inst. for a short vacation. The closing exercises were witnessed by several spectators and were alike creditable to teacher and pupils. Br. Ira who has been quite sick the past week, is, we hope and trust, recovering. J. L. S.
