GENTLE MANNERS. Hannah R. Agnew. Into holiness and beauty, Gentle manners lead the soul; By their careful cultivation, We reap blessings manifold. Manners should be more than formal, Systems of external rules; They should represent the life� Of every scholar in Christ's school. Pure and peaceful, kind and loving, Sons and daughters of the Lord; Chastening every act and motive, Wholly in good works absorbed. Youthful friends, let gentle manners, Give your lives their first impress ; Peacefully through life they'll lead you, Bless you in the hour of death. Gentle manners, so essential To our happiness in life. Cannot be too closely guarded� Age to crown with glory rife. Gentle manners, aid in giving Grandeur to the youthful mind; Beautifying their deportment, And their language is refined. And through all life's varied changes, In our pilgrimage below, Pleasantly they'll journey with us, And intelligence bestow. In acceptance of this treasure, We have something always new ; Bearing peace to humble cottage, Making every home more true. Summer heat or chill of winter, Changes not this gift so rare : To possess it more than talents. Wealth nor beauty can compare. Gentle manners cultivated, Form a base whereon to build Future usefulness and honor; And our hope in life fufill. E'en in walks among the lowly, An agreeable address Never fails to give us pleasure, And produce a good effect. In society well-ordered, Gentle manners should abound; And of language coarse and vulgar, We should never hear the sound. But alas ! it sometimes happens, Some who would be rather good, Lose their balance and are saying Many things they never should ! Then like the neglected garden, Mind becomes the fruitful soil For the growth of thorns and briers, Poisonous plants and serpent's coil! To eradicate this evil From the active growing mind, We must guard the soul immortal, Heavenward keep the course inclined. Thus, devoted to our duty In God's love we shall prevail; Moral principles increasing, Gentle manners never fail. Lovely plants be cultivating, All obnoxious weeds destroy ; Our success be thus accomplished;, And our labors crowned with joy. The apostle's words of wisdom, We in loving memory keep : Whatsoever a man soweth, That also he'll surely reap. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
