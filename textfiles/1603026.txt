SANITARY What is a cold? The Lancet says. 'It is startling to discover how little we know about the common forms of disease. For example, a 'cold'ï¿½What is it? How is it produced, and in what does it consist? It is easy to say a cold is a chill. A chill of what part of the organism? We know by daily experience that the body as a whole, or any of its parts, may be reduced to a considerably lower temperature than will suffice to give a man a cold if the so-called chill be inflicted upon the surface suddenly. Is it, then, the suddenness of a reduction of temperature that causes the cold? It would be strange if it were so, because few of the most susceptible of mortals would take cold from simply handling a piece of cold metal or accidental contact with ice. The truth would seem to be, that what we call coldtaking is the result of an impression on the nerves to reduce the vital energy of nervecenters presiding over the functions in special organs. If this be the fact, it is easy to see why nature has provided the stimulus of a strong fit of sneezing to rouse the dormant centers, and enable them at once to resume work and avoid evil consequences. This explains why the worst effects of a cold do not, as a rule, follow up a ' chill' which ex cites much sneezing. Shivering is a less effective convulsion to restore the paralyzed nervous energy, but, in a lower degree, it may answer the same purpose. The shivering that results from the effect of a poison of the nervous centers is a totally different matter. We speak only of the quick muscular agitation and teeth chattering which occur whenever the body is exposed to cold, and evil results do not ensue. It follows, from what we have said, that the natural indication to ward off the effects of a chill is to restore the vital energy of the nerve centers, and there is no more potent influence by which to attain this object than a strong and sustained effort of the will.
