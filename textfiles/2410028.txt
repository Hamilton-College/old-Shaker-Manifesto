The Credibility of the Christian Religion The Credibility of the Christian Religion, by Samuel Smith, M. P. This being the twelfth thousand that has been published, of this little work, is sufficient evidence that the Book is appreciated in the Christian Churches. The writer evidently has an unshaken confidence in the work which he has written, which goes far to make a favorable impression upon its readers. Chapter second which teaches of 'The necessity of a Revelation,' is beautifully written and must lead the mind to an appreciation of the arguments there brought forward. The other chapters lead the reader through equally beautiful written arguments which are as carefully wrought out and sustained in the heart of the writer. The Christian religion is something that can never be clearly represented by arguments either written or spoken. When the spirit of Christ takes up its abode in the soul, then righteousness will be manifested through the whole life,then it will be 'peace on earth, to men, good-will.'
