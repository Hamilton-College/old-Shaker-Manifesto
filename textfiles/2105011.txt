'THY KINGDOM COME.' Acrostic. Annie R. Stephens. This holy prayer of faith, and hopeful trusting, .How many hearts have raised to Heaven's throne; F'et could not see the orient hills all beaming, ITeeping the glory that is still their own. It is not meant that hearts should toil and anguish, nor meet a recompense for every tear; God's truth is law, tho' now by sin enshrouded. Drive back the shadows that so long have clouded, 0 light divine! bring truth's grand era near. .May we not see the dawn of revelation Chasing afar the darkness of the past? O law of love! that yet shall rule the nation; .Man forms with man a brotherhood relation, _E'en then shall God's true kingdom come at last. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
