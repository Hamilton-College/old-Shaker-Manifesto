It gives me pleasure to... Union Village, Ohio. Dec. 1885. It gives me pleasure to read the Manifesto, and I feel grateful to those who care for it from month to month. I hope the little Monthly may prosper, as it is for the good of Believers, and for those not of our order. Your Gospel Sister, Louisa Farnham.
