I desire to find in books... Godfrey Wilhelm von Leibnitz I desire to find in books, not what may be blamed, but what may be praised, and that from which I may learn something.

Nevertheless, though there are few books or persons in whom I cannot find some thing of use to me,I know how to make a difference in granting them my confidence.
