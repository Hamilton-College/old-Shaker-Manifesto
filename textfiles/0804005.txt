What is, and what should be life? WM. PERKINS It is to lie quite late of mornings, Then stretch and gape and go thro' yawnings ; Then hunt the poor old trowsers' pockets,— Thrusting the hand into their sockets-— And chase the precious crumbs to chew, To soothe the temper from its stew ! In honor of the green-horn worm, Men love to eat the weed in turn. Then as they leave their filthy couch, Of grotesque mien, both sad and slouch, They find, some easy place to sit, Drawling out words, of hit, not wit; Feeling that Pope did well to write, 'Whatever is, is surely right.' Thus in this lazy state of ease, Go well, go ill, all goes to please; And so they move with scarce a strife, Till death engulphs their dolesome life. Should Darwin need more facts to show, That men have come from things below, Just let him seize upon this class, Then see his notions current pass. Others, there be of IshmaePs mind, Whose hands are turned against their kind, By fraud and trade are robbing all, Worse than from Peter to pay Paul. Another class with fiendish rattle Rush to the war in hellish battle; And thus in carnal, deadly strife, Destroy the heavenly gift of life, And when they've vanquished all their foes, They sink beneath their well earned woes. Life as it should be springs up early, Views the vast heavens, bright and pearly; Sees the great sun in all his might, Pour out his flood of glorious light; Dispelling every shade of night. With 'hands to work and hearts to God,' . They seldom need his chastening rod; With noble philanthropic mind They're doing good to all their kind; Too far above the vulgar strife To sacrifice the meanest life. With Cowper, they would never tread Upon the poor worm's humble head, And all which they wish to receive, In turn, they will to others give. Such are the lives of all the great; Not in the wars nor in the state, But in the Kingdom ruled hy love, Gentle and pure as Noah's dove, Rise from this life to that above. South Union, Ky.
