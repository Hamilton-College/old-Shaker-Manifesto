Mt. Lebanon, February 18, 1875 Dear Friend Jeremiah : Your kind, sympathizing letter, of the 15th inst., is received. I thank you for the love and blessing. Your gift is none the less real because you cannot make an outward expression of it in the form of the almighty dollar. Neither is mine any the more real because I express it in the form of a $5 check. Please receive it as a token of love and remembrance of your North Family friends—Daniel Offord, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle and Sister Anna White, who have deep affection for you. I have ever considered you a Prophet, to this generation and nation — more especially to the people of Portland and Maine. With many discomforts and trials, you are still mindful of the good that remains, and encourage us to be like-minded. That is right. Am glad to learn your mortgage has been lifted. Friend Joseph will be none the poorer for what he does for you. Any time that you are liable to suffer for food or clothing, write me freely, and we will do you a little good, if we cannot do all you so richly deserve. You are mistaken about the materialization business. There is a. principle involved in it. That principle is as old as time. There have been periods when materializations were frequent— will be so again. Spiritualism is an agency, for use, in the Divine economy. There is meaning to it. Be patient, and fret not thyself because of evil doers, who seek to get a living by it. Have they not done the same by the Gospel? While so many preach for hire, why should not mediums divine for money ? Your friend, F. W. Evans
