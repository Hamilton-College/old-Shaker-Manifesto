WANTED! Mary L. Wilson. We can hardly look at any of the secular papers published, without seeing under the above title a long column of advertisements for help in the various trades and professions. Jt occurs to us that there is an equal demand in the world for the best exponents of pure religion. If the spiritual faculties were as keenly alive as are the natural senses, would not the soul within us, cry out� -'Lord, send me from the selfish, The worldly HfV within, To fields where the seed must be sown; There let me labor and work in good faith Till a harvest for Thee has been grown.' This would be only an echo from the voice of God, in the Resurrection Heavens, calling for active Christian workers and angel reapers in the harvest-field of the world. Lives of honest self-denial have prepared them for this Christian ministry. Only those who live a Christian life can preach the gospel effectually, if Christ was to appear in the clouds of Heaven and speak to the inhabitants of earth, as many are expecting, what would be said to those who profess and preach a gospel that they do not practice ? Could our Savior look upon the efforts now be- ing made by his disciples, as worthy of the mission in which they are engaged ? Shall science claim more attention than the practical religion of ''Doing good and being good?' Science will eulighten the understanding, while religion teaches us to use the understanding for the elevation and salvation of the soul. We think Christ would say to many disciples, 'One thing thou lackest, go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and come, follow me.' Our possessions may be earthly riches, or they may be other selfish conditions ; but all of self must be surrendered before the soul can be consecrated to the service of God. Let us read what the Recording Angel has written about our spiritual status. It is over the door in golden letters ;�'Wanted, meu of integrity, who obey God's laws ; women who do not stoop to the menial servitude of a fallen nature ; but stand uprightly, co-workers with their brothers in creating a 'heaven on earth.' We also read�'Almost, but not fully persuaded,' Wanted, more firmness of character. Over the second door is written�'The ^st of the flesh, the lust of the eye and the pride of life,' have reigued supreme. Wanted, a messenger of truth to carry conviction to this household. Over the third, the augel writes�'The cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches have choked God's word.' Wanted, more of those who 'seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness.' The fourth record says�'Where envy and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.' Wanted, more of that wisdom which is pure and peaceable. Over the fifth door�'God is no respecter of persons.' Wanted, that these should learn that 'whoso exalteth himself shall be abased, but whoso humbleth himself shall be exalted.' The sixth record tells us that 'the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity.' Wanted here; 'those who can show out of a good conversation, their works with meekness of wisdom.' Finally, the angel pauses at a plain, obscure dwelling and writes, 'I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, but thou art rich in Christ. I know the blasphemy of those who belong to the synagogue of Satan. Fear none of these things, be faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.' Wanted at this Harvest Church, those who are sick j of sin and desire salvation therefrom. The angel of Judgment now passes through every homestead visited by the former, and with the sword of truth destroys every condition that offends the Spirit of God. These are followed by the angels of Mercy and Forgiveness who continue their ministrations of love until every soul is healed of its infirmities^ and led to glorify God. Canterbury, N. H.
