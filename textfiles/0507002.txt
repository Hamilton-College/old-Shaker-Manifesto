A MAN WHO NEYER TASTED MEAT One half-mile south of Holmesdorf, Pa., lives an old fanner by the name of Abraham Blatt, who is about sixty years of age, is healthy, robust and as strong as a horse, who has never in his lifetime tasted the least bit of meat of any kind. He says he never tasted beef, pork, mutton, or veal, no kind of poultry, no kind of fish, no kind of game, in fact nothing pertaining to meat. He has such an abhorrence of meat that when they kill a cow or hog on his premises, he generally leaves home and goes about other business. He is the father of a large family, all healthy children. Among the lot is also one boy, who, like his father, eats no meat of any kind. In reply to the questions put to the father how he could work so hard without eating any meat, he says he believes he is much healthier than if he ate meat. He uses very little butter. The popular error that flesh meat creates more muscular strength than do grains, fruit, or vegetables, was equaled by the once popular belief, that to the farmers and hard working laborers, Alcoholic drink was a positive necessity. We are apt to forget to reflect. The Horse after his kind. The Ox and'Buffalo; the Camel and Dromedary; the Elephant and Mastodon, were and are Graminivorous. Do they lack muscle, as compared with the Carnivora ? Is the fact, that no animal living habitually upon other animals, will ever work, presumptive evidence that Man, who performs so much physical labor, does not belong to the Carnivora, and that he will progress beyond it?
