The Ladies' Home Journal Mrs. Borer's magazine, 'Household News,' has been absorbed by The Ladies' Home Journal in order to make it possible for Mrs. Borer to form an exclusive editorial connection with the latter magazine. All of Mrs. Borer's literary work will hereafter appear exclusively in the Journal, of whose domestic department she will have entire charge. Several pages of their agazine will be given her each month, and in these she will begin by giving a new series of simple cooking lessons to be followed by domestic lessons treating separately the care and arrangement of each room in a house.
