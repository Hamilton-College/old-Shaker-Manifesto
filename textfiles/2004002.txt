DAWN. Watson Andrews. Fair on the eastern verge of day, A dawn, a glorious dawn appears, The light of ages, focused here, Proclaims the promise of the years. I see ! I see ! the millions cry, The million tongues that erst were dumb. Eesplendent in the life He lived The answer to 'thy kingdom come.' Go thou, and likewise do, He saith, So shalt thy faith restore thee whole ; Go sow in works what thou wouldst reap; Faith, demonstrated, saves the soul, Whoso will come, may come, He saith;' Into my way, my walk, my life; Into a peace that passeth farï¿½ The wisdom of a world of strife. A world, indeed, of needful strife, Where each must battle for his own, His houses, lands, his children, wife; Nor can he say 'thy will be done,' Until he's called to leave these weights, To break these needful bands of time, To walk in true discipleship, The pathway to his peaceful clime. Self cannot walk these peaceful ways Self-care is no more duty here; Then care for others by the way, In universal goodly cheer. North Union, Ohio.
