THE LINK OF GOLD ''Lost '�somewhere�a golden hour Of this glowing spring-like day ; Since the sunrise, ere the sunset, I have lost it on my way. Was it when I sat and lo tered� That short chain of such great cost, Slipping idly through my fingers, That my golden hour was lost? Was it talking to my neighbors, Weighing all their hopes and can s, And too full of idle gossip, Well to mind my own affairs? Did I fret away the minutes, Was I murmuring, was I cross? Where could all my sense have flown to. That I met with such a loss? For my hour was a jewel, And with sixty small ones setT Round each minute sixty seconds Make the radiance brighter yet. They could buy me, 0 ! what riches, And what wisdom they could bring; Each was worth in its true value, All the jewels of a king. For the Lord would give me something If I went to him, for each. 0, how precious those short lessons He can in a minute teach ! (), how grand those views of glory Which a second can make known! 0, my hour�0, my minutes, Nevermore, alas, my own ! Some I might .have well invested Other people's lives to bless ; Those bright mements wisely traded, Purchase healing for distress. 0, has anybody seen it, Seen niy precious hour of gold? I would go to buy another, But such treasures are not sold. God prepared for me a number, Just how few I do not know ; Did he give them for no purpose But that I should lose them so? The Catholic.
