In Loving Remembrance of our Sister LYDIA DOLE. By Louie Bussell. A Mother in Israel has left us; A loved one has gone from our sight; To reap the reward of her labors, In mansions of eternal light. We're stricken with grief and sorrow, We miss her wherever we roam, But know it is well with our Mother For angels have welcomed her home. For years she has toiled in the vineyard, Has filled many places of trust; And others will rise up to bless her, Her words were so loving and just. As strong as the oak in its planting, Unswerving in duty and truth, Whatever her station or calling She blest both the aged and youth. Her life to the gospel was given, Her toil was for triumph o'er sin; She sacrificed all in the conflict, Full vict'ry her labors did win. Many a soul has she guided Into paths of virtue so bright; Stood by them thro' doubt and trial And led them from error to right. And now we're bereft of her presence, But know her spirit is near To bless every earnest endeavor To give us both courage and cheer; Her life and example shall guide us, And this is the prayer that we breathe, 'O help us to 'go and do likewise,' Our all for the gospel to leave.'
