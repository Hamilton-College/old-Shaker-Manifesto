Narcoossee, Fla. Feb. 1899. The balmy breezes for the past two months are having a salutary effect upon the fruit trees of Florida. The peaches in many sections of the state are in full bloom and some blossoms have even fallen. To pass through an orchard of one or two thousand trees, and inhale the sweet fragrance, is a thing to gladden the heart of every lover of nature. The last orange crop has nearly all been gathered, and the nursery men are now fertilizing the trees for the coming crop. Sweet potatoes will not be ready for market before June. The long, dry season since last spring prevented their growth. If our crop of potatoes does not mature in one season, it is left in the ground and begins a new growth the coming season without the least injury. Every year tells a little better for the lands we are cultivating. We are now trying our luck on a crop of onions and from present appearance we anticipate a good crop. Hope on, hope ever, is the motto for Florida. Andrew Barrett.
