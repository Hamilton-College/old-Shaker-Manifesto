DANCING The Shakers are often ridiculed for the practice of dancing in their public worship. It did not originate with, nor is it peculiar to them. Not to mention the various instances familiar to the readers of Holy writ, nor the practices which obtain in India, in Turkey, and amongthe various tribes, of Indians on the American continent; it is a well known fact that the French clergy not only permitted, but looked upon dancing in their churches with favour until the twelvth century, and in this present nineteenth century it forms part of the Easter Sunday ceremonies at the Cathedral of Seville in Spain. The principal actors are boys, who are placed in the open space in front of the altar, five standing on each side opposite to each other. They be-: gin a slow movement by singing hymns, and keeping time with their cassinettes, warming into enthusiasm as the ceremony proceeds. A dignitary of the church disapproving of the custom tried to stop it, but this so enraged the authorities that they suddenly shipped off the boys to Home, so that the Pope might judge for himself as to it. propriety. He saw nothing objectionable in it. and continued the privilege, allowing them to' dance with their heads covered before the Sacrament; and this is done to this day. Amigo Shirley Village, Mass.
