Moldgreen, Huddersfield, Apr. 1882 S. Moldgreen, Huddersfield, Apr. 1882 To my dear Friend W.;—I beg to thank you and Mr. W. for your kindness in sending me the papers and also the Shaker Literature, which I have carefully read, but do not yet fully comprehend; so that I shall probably go over them again in order to fully understand the Shaker System. I think you are fortunate in meeting with Br. W. who will give you some interesting information and also renew old acquaintanceship. My mind has very vividly gone back forty years and recalled the happy hours we spent together as teachers in the Sabbath School, and prayer leaders at the Cottage houses. I confess I do not fully comprehend the Shaker System, but I presume that they mainly hold the same faith in Jesus as we do, but they differ in their mode of worship and discipline or government. I send you a paper along with this letter, and I wish you to give my very kind thanks to my friend W. and say that if ever it should be my happiness to cross the Atlantic I should esteem it a pleasure to call at Shirley and see him, as whatever peculiarities attach to Shakerism, all agree that they are extremely hospitable, and if he should ever again visit the land of his birth and the scenes of his youth, I should be glad to entertain him at my house during his stay here. Accept my very kind regards.—S.
