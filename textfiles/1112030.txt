GOOD RESOLUTIONS DANIEL ORCUTT Form and re-form good resolutions. If some are not kept, that constitutes no reason for not making them. ' Gird on the heavenly armor' for good works more earnestly than ever. Good resolutions are the spirit's safeguard. Some persons are always intending to do better but never find time to begin. Now is your opportunity, don't miss it. Keep the good resolves now that you should have kept last year. The year 1882 will be as fresh and new as any preceding it; so live that it shall be the best. Make your own heaven and you will be sure to have it. You have the solid benefit of one more year's experience ; profit by it. Never give up ; it is unmanly.

If bad habits and vicious courses hold you in their fell grip, don't despair: grapple manfully with them and you can work wonders. What others have done by their own efforts, and God's help, you can'do. No other one can perform your self denying work, and if you fail, what you should have done will be greatly missed. It is the self-denying struggles that save. There is joy in the thought that you have conquered temptation. Never exchange the blessings of virtue, for the burning fires of vice. ' A sinful life stains clear through.' Virtue confers present joys ; secure them now. Let virtue be the mainspring animating your whole life, and your future is safe, Enfield, Gonn.
