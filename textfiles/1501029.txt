Kind Words Washington, D. C. June. 1884 I gather much comfort from the teachings of the Manifesto. Religion is made to live out the Christian life, which the great body called Christians have only in theory. I hail the time when the great majority will obey the teaching of our Christ and King, and to this end I like to study and get comfort from the Manifesto. Your friend, J. G. Toepper
