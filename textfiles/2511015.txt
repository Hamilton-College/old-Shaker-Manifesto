Shaker Station, Ct. Oct. 1895. 'Let us be happy while we can, For life is but a little span.' Mental, physical and spiritual activity is the source of happiness. We should fill the hours with some noble object, for they seem to fly as if on the wings of the wind. Let us discipline ourselves to take what each moment brings of duty or of privilege. Let us perform the duty of the hour now passing, for if we grasp well the little fragment of time present, and perform the duty that this hour brings, we shall do that which will please God and perfect our own character. Duty is the watch-word. The secret of success in the self-denying life is to be patient, persevering and untiring. Each day we are rearing for ourselves a structure no one else can lay claim to, our individual character. What is the influence of that character on those around us? This is the question each on should often ask of himself as the days flit by. 'The largest loaves of bread baked in the world are those of France and Italy. The bread in Italy is baked in loaves two and three feet long, while in France the loaves are made in the shape of very long rolls four and five feet long and in many cases even six feet.' 'Eighty-two million acres of corn in this country this year; the largest breadth ever planted.' ******* Hens will not lay in the winter unless they finish moulting before December. Milk, meat and bone are the best egg making material. Daniel Orcutt. South Family. Oct. 1895. We can but feel deeply interested in our Manifesto and its valuable teachings, embracing so much truth; and we gladly offer the few items of interest we may for those who read it. The blessings from our heavenly Parents' hand are abundant, and as we look over the works of creation we may continually stop to admire the beauty and system which indicates the benevolence which we can not fail to understand. The weather the past month has been unusually pleasant, with but little rain or wind to interfere with the work on the new green-house which is nearly completed and will be put in operation as soon as finished. The fall work has been prospered and the potato yield is very good. Apples are harvested and quite abundant. The late sweet corn is excellent, producing a good supply for the table, which is a new feature at this late date with us. Ploughing is going on and everything goes forward prosperously. Two new houses for hens and chickens are built and one repaired. Thrashing of oats also finished. So the diligent hand maketh rich, and overcomes all obstacles; and 'Sufficient unto the day shall thy strength be.' Maria Witham.
