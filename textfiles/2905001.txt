BALM IN GILEAD. By Ezra J. Stewart. 'Bless the Lord 0 my soul, who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeih all thy diseases.'Psalm, ciii., 2, 3. Once more the Lord reveals His grace to men. With healing in His wings The Christ comes forth again, Inharmony and discord cease As to this earth-bound sphere He brings Immortal life, and joy, and peace. Signs follow those whose firm belief Reveals a substance, sure and safe relief. Mortality is doomed to death, The curse of God rests on its brow, Dust unto dust, for lack of breath Its sinful, suffering sense must go. Spirit, life and truth shall now Possess His rightful place below, And God will lead through love His image and His likeness unto himself above. Shirley, Mass.
