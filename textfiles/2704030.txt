The Pulpit The Pulpit for February, has Law and Liberty, by Rev. Benj. D. Thomas; The Human Power to Forgive Sin, by Rev. M. C. Lockwood; The Program of Jesus Christ, by Rev. S. II. Howe; For the Gospel's Sake, by Rev. Philip S. Moxoni; The Virgin Mary, by Rev. E. II. Rudd. Two of these sermons are by Baptist Ministers, two from Congregational and the last by a Protestant Episcopal. As these are the best that our good Editor could obtain for this month, and the best that the several writers could prepare for us, we will accept them with thanksgiving. Edited by G.
