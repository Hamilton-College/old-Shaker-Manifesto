Specimen Bricks from the Babel of Higher Critics Specimen Bricks from the Babel of Higher Critics, by H. L. Hastings. This is No. 41 of 'The Anti-Infidel Library,' and is an examination of some statements that have been made in reference to the Scriptures. The mistakes of the Old Testament Prophets, �which v ere brought forward in a lecture by Prof. II. G. Mitchell are carefully analyzed and it is concluded that 'the guides which the Prof, seems to have followed in his investigations exhibit great aptitude for confounding all hings sacred, profane, divine and devilish.' Br. Hastings has no mercy for the Biblical criticisms. 'A man who pronounces the Books of the Bible forgeries, its history fictitious, its miracles impossible, is none the less an Infidel because he writes 'Rev. Professor' before his name and 'Doctor of Divinity' after it. A lie is a lie a\ helher uttered in a church or a beer garden.' Pub. by II. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston Mass. Word and Works Word and Works for Macrh opens with an interesting chapter on the 'Moon and the Planets.' With the accompanying pictorial illustration we are pleasantly introduced to the heavens, and can see how nicely we are all 'swinging around the circle.' Just now it will make but little difference 'whether we live on the outside or inside of the earth, so long as we sie assured of a safe passage around the sun. The 'forecasts for March' are as we have been taught to expect. The snow-storms and high winds will probably be with us to the end of our days, but when Word and Works urges us to make special preparation for tornadoes and blizzards, it is time for us to be on the thoughtful side. A large amount of good reading on varied subjects will alto be found in this numberwhile the 'queiy corner' will give pleasure to many, especially the careful answers about a perpetual motion, and about Br. Cain and his lady. Wtokd and Works Pub. Co. 2201 Locust St. St. Louis, Mo.
