To Tin a New Soldering Ikon. W. J. T. sends the following: 'The old fashioned way is to file your iron or copper on the point into the shape you want it, put it into a clean fire and heat it until it will melt solder easily, wipe it clean and rub it on a pine board with rosin and solder until the point is tinned as you want it. The new way is to heat as above and wipe clean, then apply soldering fluid (made from zinc dissolved in muriate acid,) to the point where you want the tin, and rub it on a board with solder as above.'
