Union Village, Ohio. Oct. 5, 1891. Deab Manifesto :ï¿½Our health is very good and we are trying to move the wheels of our destiny in the most favorable direction possible so far as we have anything to do with it and that is a good deal, as I view it. Elder Joseph Holden made us a short visit about the 9th. ult. but short as it was we felt very greatly blessed and comforted thereby. He also made a flying visit to White Water and Watervliet and thence took his flight for home via. Groveland. We are beginning to harvest our potatoes which are a fine crop. We have dried about sixty-five bushels of apples, (I have to say bushels because I don't know how many pounds a bushel of dried apples weigh.) We shall continue until time to gather the winter apples, saving all that fall from the trees in this way. We westerners need to learn a good many lessons in saving all that is savable. Our corn has ripened up splendidly and is out of the way of the frost and is a huge crop. Our Office is undergoing quite a metamorphosis. We have a Society meeting at 9-30 every Sabbath morning and a singing meeting at 2-30 P. M. We have a meeting for practicing and learning music each Monday evening at 7-15 and another for the same purpose Thurs. evening at 7-15. We have a spelling school every alternate Friday evening and propose to have some kind of intellectual exercise on the intervening Fri. eve. If any one feels inclined to furnish any suggestions as to the manner of conducting such an enterprise, here is an openi ig for him or her and sucli suggestions will be gratefully received. We are not of the class, be it known to all men, who believe that there is, ever was, or ever can be, any antagonism between science and religion. We think with dear Elder Frederick, that they have joined hands in a holy and eternal compact. We must hold to this sentiment so long as we believe all Truth is of God. We believe that 'Who would divorce this mystic band supernal Or break the ties their holy compact rule With atheistic ministry infernal* Must be a gibbering madman 01 a fool.' We still persist in preparing medicines and this department is superintended by Br. William L. Lincoln, who is very faithful and efficient in all the arduous burdens and details thereof. We who lived in the Office are at present occupying the Meeting House and adjoining shops, where the hired help and those stopping transiently, receive their board. We find it pretty difficult to entertain strangers, but so iar we have man- aged somehow to do it. Our Sisters all round spare no pains to care for and make the Brethren as comfortable as they possibly can, for which we feel sincerely grateful and vastly more contented and happy than if it were otherwise. Indeed life would not be worth having without them. O. C. H.
