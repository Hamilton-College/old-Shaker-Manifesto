In Memory of our Sainted Mother, Dolly Saxton. EMMA J. NEAL. We all, are wending thither, Toward the opening gate� Who next responds to bidding, Or who must longer wait� No human power can fathom, No prophecy foretell, But if prepared to enter With all it shall be well. Though called in early morning, While lisping infant prayer, Or when the dews of spring-life, Are glistening bright, and fair, Or yet in manhood's Summer, When cares and toils surround, Of in the Autumn stillness, When burdens arc laid down. The noble life now ended, Fame's highest niche doth till, Of consecrated service, Unto Our Father's 'will, A Century's golden moments Life's tide hath borne away, Since first she learned the lesson, Of Christ, the Truth, the Way. And childhood's faith obeying, When sterner days drew near, With calm unchanging purpose, She walked the waters clear, Prepared with faith unshaken Each sacrifice to make, However dear the idol, The Christian law, would take. All through the weary night-watch, She asked for no repose, And when the opening morning New toils of life disclosed, She, armed in stately queen-ness, Goes forth to battle still, llesolved throughout the conflict To do her Father's will. Until the Peaceful Victory, At last crowns human strife, And the Divine Afflatus, Becomes her breath her life, And like the great Apostle Whose words vrere few and sweet O, love ye one another, Would oftentimes repeat. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
