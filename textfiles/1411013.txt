OUR DOUBLE NATURE. Two lives the meanest of us live; One which the world beholds, and one Whose hidden history none may give But he who lives it; he alone. Its wondrous ecstasies can know, Its ever-changing streams of thought, Its deep unutterable woe, Its vision bright and heaven fraught. He o'er its secret sins may groan, And blush to hear the common praise Of actions, which, if rightly shown, Could only loudest censure raise He o'er its noblest may rejoice, Though none the virtues can behold; For acts that win the common voice Demand a blazonment of gold. And so with full potential power For vilest sins or purest deeds, We pass through life and win a dower Of mingled praise and blame, that needs� A juster judge the scales to hold Than e'er on earth weighs cause and deed, Ourselves and God alone behold The motives which to actions lead. And thus we gather fame and shame, Alike unearned�alike untrue ; Receiving praise where men should blame . And blame where praise is rightly due. Selected.
