Looking over the monthly home notes, we find something in each so much like our unwritten ones, that it is very easy to say 'ditto' and let it pass. We too had an abundance of strawberries, and had they yielded according to the faithful care bestowed upon them, our twenty-three bushels would have been doubled; but either the dry weather or their close proximity to the salted asparagus bed, seemed to blight them. Cherries are so well graded in our locality, that in a fruitful year like the present, their season is from the middle of June until the first of August; and 'big boys, little boys, and middling sized boys' are faithful to gather them. The small boy and the cherry tree are agreeable companions in more ways than one. He can sway from the topmost branches to gather the luscious fruit without injury to himself or the tree. But no one speaks of the currants. Following closely as they do, in the umbra of the strawberry, their reputation, though not their worth, seems rather eclipsed. Our currant garden this year was a beauty. So neatly cultivated and such strings of pearls and rubies, from every branchlet in striking contrast to the verdant foliage. Apples, pears, x)lums and even our few peach trees are doing their best. This is the year 'we shall lose a thousand bushels of peaches for the want of trees.' Our apples are so carefully housed during the winter that there is seldom an apple vacancy the year round. The Roxbnry Russet of '90 docs not desert us until the early pippin is suitable to take its place in the apple pie. The three hundred windows of our brick dwelling- are being repainted by faithful home labor, which will save in many ways, we hope. The windows will be rescued from wear of time, and the money sometime paid to hired labor, will be doubled, since 'a penny saved is two pence clear.' Thus we are anxiously looking forward for means to repair the drainage of our Dwelling before another winter, and thus save the tax sometimes imposed by the Board of Health, as well as doctor bills. Since the irresponsible monetary monocracy adopted by Believers has devastated so much of the consecrated wealt i of our Communities, it comes very hard on those who, though on the same plan, are wise and skillful enough to be successful. We too have enjoyed the pleasant visits to our home. Br. Watson Andrews, the dear Sisters from Enfield, N. H.; Sister Anna Case from Watervliet; and are now made happy by the brief return of Elder Andrew Barrett to his former home. A. J. C. Center Family. Aug. 9, 1891. Deab Editob:�We have had the satisfaction of having had visitors here from four of our sister Societies who were welcome, thrice welcome to our home and hearts. It does us good to see the Brethren and Sisters from various branches of our communal interest, having a like faith, and actuated by motives springing from a good heart and true. Elder Andrew D. Barrett of Harvard is one of the number, a former inmate of this home, which was made dear to him through consecration. He is an earnest, warm-hearted, whole-souled man. We love him for his work's sake and glad to have him come among us for rest and recuperation. He has well earned it by devotion of body and soul to the well-being of the household of faith. We have finished marketing cherries and have commenced on the pears, which promises to be a good crop. Hay crop secured some two weeks or more since, expect to finish harvesting^ oats this week. Dear Elder Henry, if you should journey so far west as this place, we would be glad to give you hospitable welcome. The latch string hangs out and you have only to grasp it to have the door swing wide open. T. E. North. K'amily.

We put the hay-loader in operation and it did work splendidly, rolling up a load of hay in six or twelve minutes. It takes two good men on the wagon and a careful hand to drive the team. The reaper and binder, after about live days' experimenting and adjusting, was made to work very satisfactorily. Our rye was very heavy and crinkled badly; so that it was impossible for the machine to separate each bundle and a man had to follow behind and pull them apart; but in the straight grain, wheat and oats, it was just music set to harmony, to witness the operation; on quite a side hill and over some very rough places it kept in time, though occasionally a rest was introduced which only gave the more volume to the music. Have cut some twenty-three acres of rye, several acres of wheat and twentyfive acres of oats; have nearly twenty acres more to cut of oats and seventy-five of grass; hope to be done by the first of Sept. On the 29th. of July, the trustee of School District No. 12, (by mistake) called the annual school meeting. It was attended by a selected company who went through the legal forms, electing officers, etc. and not till near the close did we discover that our meeting was premature. We adjourned to the last Tuesday in August. Although the meeting was a legal mistake, it did good, and it is hoped, awakened an interest in school matters that will be felt when we meet again. The subject of education is one that all who take an interest in the rising generation, should study and exercise their minds upon; it is of great importance. The whole every-day life in our Community is industrial education, and it is firstrate; but industrial education, practiced mechanically, is drudgery in its lowest sense, even when exercised in that which is genial; while that which would usually be termed menial, if mind and brain are brought to bear upon it, becomes interesting and elevating. No labor, however disagreeable, if its end is use, is in any way dishonorable. But when the necessity of the labor is scientifically understood, the disagreeable is largely diminished. Our district, or home schools, should be so conducted that they will instill into the minds of the pupils the light of understanding, and made so interesting that the scholars will drink in by absorption. What a child understands it will remember, what is learned mechanically is soon foi'gotten. Last Sabbath, on account of the weather, our Society meeting was omitted. Elder Andrew Barrett from Harvard is making us a visit; he is all alone, which in olden times was thought not to be good; however that may be, I think it is better now, when Brethren visit, to have some Sisters along. We learned through Elder Andrew that some time ago, while Elder John Whiteley, with a company of Sisters were on their way from Shirley to Harvard, one of the horses fell; as he fell the harness broke, which let the wagon on the horse. The horse got up instantly while the wagon was upon him, and turned it over with all its occupants. A single horse was following and was so close to the team ahead that when the horse fell, stopping the wagon, the single horse ran into the wagon, breaking both thills. Fortunately no one was seriously hurt; they fixed up as best they could and returned home. We are called to learn by everything that passes before us; and two important lessons are here given. First, that when we take company riding the harness should be strong enough to sustain the horse, even though he fall: Second, that one team in following another, should keep at a respectful distance. On the 21st. of July we had a very pleasant visit with Br. Watson Andrews of North Union, Ohio. He was a very interesting visitor; but that interest would have increased many fold, if he had brought some Sisters along. I hope the Brethren will not do so any more. If business is the special object, there is some excuse; but when visiting is the business, there is no visible excuse. The August Manifesto came laden with treasures from the good editor's heart. In our 'Home Notes' what a lot of thought we gave to what we had to eat. Not however, for the gratification of appetite but for the honor and glory of God. Blessed be the Manifesto and all who contribute thereto. D. O. Hancock, Mass. Aug. 11, 1891. Beloved Elder Henby:�When the girls of the Bible Class read the last question they were unanimous in the opinion that they knew the answer perfectly well; so sanguine were they in the belief that there was no necessity to 'Search the Scriptures' that they delayed the work too long, so that we have but a few to send you this time. It is true they did know the day on which Jesus was crucified, also when he arose from the grave, but they found it hard to find the Scripture reference to it. Think they have learned that it is well to be certain that our knowledge is well founded. It is a bright, beautiful morning, all nature is rejoicing in loveliness and seems to wish so much to prove a true tribute of praise to the Creator that my heart bounds in unison and prompts me to add my mite to the universal praise-offering of nature. As I have not sent any Bible Class papers for some little time I enclose a few which please examine and do with as you think best. Please accept love from Ministry, Elders, Brethren and Sisters in Hancock for yourself, and as far as you think it best to extend. E. H. B. Enfield, Conn. Aug. 9, 1891. Everything passing smoothly with us gives reason for thankfulness. Our efforts on the farm have prospered. Eye has been garnered and threshed, proving a good yield. Oats are cut and ready to get in. Potatoes are large and fair, yielding fairly well. Blackberries are plentiful and large. Canning them for winter has taken much time and labor, without which nothing can be accomplished. We have more than we can use and are selling some. The weather is warm and dry. The present month thus far is more like summer than was July; the nights and mornings of that month were very cool. Repairing has been going on about engine and boiler house and other buildings. An excellent spring has been cleaned out and bricked around, so as to put in usable condition. Seeding down to grass and putting in rye are in progress. It is hoped all the land that will be in cultivation next year will be plowed this fall. A pleasant ride through Forrest Park was very much enjoyed by all the members of the South Family one cool day the past month. M. Witham. Harvard, Mass. I see by the home notes from our Canterbury friends that they have been bountifully blest through their harvest time, by the troublesome blessing as the farmer styles it just at this time, of rain. Could this blessing have been equally dispensed over Harvard and elsewhere, I think we could have reported a more perfect crop of the staff of life for the animal kingdom. However, haying is closed and our tally counts up one hundred tons of the best hay that has been put into the barn for the last twelve years. Monday the 8th of June we cut our early piece of clover and then with a short intermission to the 22nd. when we started again and from that time to the present we have had but one shower of rain to wet our hay. Early peas, beans and potatoes came along in uncommon good season. Corn is looking excellent, for which I think all the farmers will feel thankful. ]S'o doubt it will make the speculators feel a little sore, but this year we hold it is the farmers' year, and am glad to see them come up and fill the important place assigned to them. Health of Society good. Our dear Eldress Eliza whom we had given up to the care of the angels and we thought they would claim her as one of theirs, is slowly improving though quite weak in body. Our Manifesto grows better each time and we long for the next number. This is the way it should be, and many blessings rest upon the wearied hands who toil to make it so. What greater blessing can we realize than to know we are striving to help others. This is the love of God. This formed the key-note to our meeting this morning, to look for the bright spots in the lives of our Brethren and Sisters, to spread sunshine and cheer in the path of everv one. A few weeks since there was a book sent to Harvard, entitled 'The Greatest thing in the World.' Now what do you think that great thing was? It was the true spirit of love, and I felt that I could endorse the sentiment and say, thus it is. The love principle when understood with perfect wisdom and knowledge will be the true Savior to mankind. Love is magnetic and draws to itself the condition loved. It is the prime factor in a spiritual growth. We read, 'God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,' who said, 'I am the light of the world.' Godliness then is a love of humankind, a love that is like that of a father for his child to help him from all suffering conditions. Have this love clothed with knowledge and wisdom and what a powerful factor it becomes. The mighty Alexander with all the forces of Greece could not stand before it. Love then, surely, becomes the greatest thing in the world. A. D. B. Enfield Conn. 'Thy will O God be done,' is the lesson life teaches us day by day. Let it be our best thought�this thought that it is God's will and not ours which shall 'be done,'�the will of our heavenly Father whose love and mercy can never fail us. Let us lay hold on eternal life and feel the power of his strong arm sustaining us. Through all trials and afflictions we can still look up and say, 'It is well, O Father.' We know with an ever increasing knowledge that the self-denying path is the way in which we should walk, and we are so glad to trust all the ordering of our lives to Him. He who cares for the little helpless sparrows will not forget his trusting children. 'The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knoweth them that trust in Him.' 'They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth f or8*79 dollars were received for cream for one year ending May first. 4882 spaces of cream were sold in July. In selecting hens for layers the active, busy hen should be retained. Hens differ as breeds and they differ individually. A knowledge of their characteristics can only be gained by frequent association with them. The rule that 'like begets like,' holds good with poultry, and should lead to the production of better stock. It is feed and management of poultry that determine the profit, and not luck. To keep them in good thrifty condition is economy, first and last. D. Orcutt.
