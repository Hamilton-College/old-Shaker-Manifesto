TRUE TO TRUTH. True be to Truth, though you serve it alone. Trust to Truth always with faith never shaken; Serving it, shrink not to suffer and dare; . Preach it and fight for it; though it be taken For 'Falsehood, for its sake all contumely flare; God seems to will that the furnac should prove it, Tested with fire, that its worth may be shown; Fut your firm faith in it, let nothing move it; True be to Truth, though you serve it alone. En it God speaks; as His awful voice hear it; Take it, as Moses the tablets received, Trusted to you still to love it and fear it, Told evermore till by all men believed; 'Be it IJis fiery pillar to guide you, You to whose blest eyes its radiance is shown; Ieed through the desert, whatever betide you, True be to Truth, though it guide you alone. Ever its prophets the world has derided, Stoned first the Saints it has learned to adoie ; Girdled m fire, true to Truth they abided, Firm in the flames till they suffered no more. Heroes and Saints and new Martyrs, we need them, Wrong to make right and God's will to make known, Till tyrants are smitten and bondsmen have freedom, And Trutli rules the glad world, supreme and alone.
