COMMITTED. 'My people shall be satisfied with my goodness.'ï¿½Jer. xxxi., 14. Canterbury, N. H. Divoto. My heart to Thy work is committed, My hands in Thy service find rest; Thy laws to my needs are well fitted, How greatly my spirit is blest! O glorious, glorious foundation! Most safely I'm building thereon,......, Come building thereon; storm or come rain as a tempest, I'm saved by the truth I have sown.
