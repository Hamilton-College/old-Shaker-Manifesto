'NOT MY WILL.' ELMIRA HII.LSGBOVE. Not my will, my Father, but thy will be done , The race set before mo, I'd patiently run; For truth is unchanging my soul fully knows, And mingled with chastening, thy love deep! Then why should I linger, when duty I tee, Pointed out by the finger of pure love for me; While child-like and humble, to principle true, My Father and Mother will guide safely through. I'll trust in this care, and banish all doubt, The spirit of prayer this foe casteth out; My soul smgs its treasures of blessings anew, While I joy in whatever my hands find to do. I would work in thy vineyard in dew of the morn, In the shadow of evening, or heat of the noon; Only make me of service, thy troth to declare Leading sonic soul to seek Thee, thy mercy to share. And may I ne'er question the means Thou wilt take, The chains of oppression and darkness to break; But wrestle till error before truth succumb And whisper in spirit, thy will, Lord, be done. Canterbury, N. H.
