FAITH'S VISION. ' Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God.'ï¿½ Psa. lxxxvii, 3. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. To the spirit land we're hastening, Golden moments flit 2. Oft its pearly gates are opened, Floods of glory thro' before, While each sunset brings us nearer To its seeming them come; And we catch a glimpse of beauty Just a foresight distant shore. Yet upon her snowy pinions,Faith will lift our hearts to see In the life that is before us Blessed immortality. of our home. Oh, it is by holy living That we gain an entrance there ;For communion with the angels, Spotless robes we must prepare.
