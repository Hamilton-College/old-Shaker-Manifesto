Quietness before god QUIETNESS BEFORE GOD ' I could write dowu twenty cases,' says a good man, 'when I wished God had done otherwise then He did, and which I now see, had I had my own will would have led to extensive mischief. The life of a Christian is a life of paradoxes. He must lay hold on God, he must follow hard after Him, he must determine not to let Him go. And yet you must learn to let God alone. Quietness before God is one of the most difficult of all Christian graces; to sit where He pleases, to be what He would have us be, and this as long as He pleases.'
