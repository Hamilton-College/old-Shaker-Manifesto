Gardener's lesson The Gardener's Lesson.— Two gardeners had their early crops of peas killed by the frost. One of them was very impatient under the loss, and fretted about, it very much. The other went patiently to work at once to plant a new crop. After awhile the impatient, fretting man went to his neighbor. • To his surprise he found another crop of peas growing finely. He wondered how this could be. ' These are what I sowed while you were fretting,' said his neighbor. ' But don't you ever fret ? ' he asked. ' Yes, I do ; but I put it off till I have repaired the mischief that has been done.' ' Why then you have no need to fret at all.' ' True,' said his friend,' ' and that's the reason I put it off.'—Presbyterian.
