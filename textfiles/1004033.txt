Book Table Another cheap series of popular reading... Another cheap series of popular reading, in the quarto form of the ' libraries' so much in vogue, but containing books of a high order of merit, has been started by I. K. Funk &amp; Co., 21 Barclay street, New York&gt; under the title of the Standard Series. It begins excellently, the first number (price, twelve cents) containing the full text of the Eev. Spurgeon's John Plough man's Talk, or Plain Advice to Plain People â€” and also Carlyle's well-known essay On the Choice of Books. The second and third issues will be Thomas Hughes' The Manliness of Christ (price, ten cents), and six selected essays of Macauley's (price, fifteen cents). The type is large and the impression neat; and the numbers are issued in a stout paper cover. The above firm seem determined not to be outdone by the publishers of flashy literature, so far as the cheapness of the better material is concerned. Let the mind ' reach after heavenly things,'' and try the above.
