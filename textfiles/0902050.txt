We hear it asked if doctrinal zeal... We hear it asked if doctrinal zeal can, in this country, be fanned into war. I answer, mix it with state matters, and see. Show me a people, whether Catholic or Protestant, who persistently shut their eyes and ears to free discussions and candid investigation— who see no good, no honesty, and no religion outside the picket lines of their own church —who are so destitute of moral sense as to base their regard and respect for their fellow man upon the doctrine he professes, rather than upon the solid substratum of character he is known to possess, and I will show you people who carry perpetual war in their hearts.—Clarke.
