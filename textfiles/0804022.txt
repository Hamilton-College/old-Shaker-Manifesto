REAL HELLS Extracts from a letter. Spiritualism and Infidelity must be credited-with providing the people free nails, they are a great blessing to a thinking people. If, like the volcanoes of earth, they throw out, occasionally, fire, smoke and cinders ; do they not also give vent to internal forces that would otherwise cause destructive explosions? New Haven has just voted the Bible out of the Public Schools; and the Congregationalists, have, by a majority of 14, voted hell out of their Churches ! They have? cast their theological 'death and hell' into a lake of logical fire, without the brimstone. If they will keep out of the real hell and death, that came of evil doing, we will forgive them. F. W. Evans
