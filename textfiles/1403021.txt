Giles B. Avery, Respected Friend: I received your welcome letter... Alms House Nov. 27, 1883. Giles B. Avery, Respected Friend: I received your welcome letter Nov. 23, also a book. The books I received over two years ago were quite different; they were larger in size, had the picture of the Shaker Village on the cover but this answers the purpose, in speaking of the letter, etc. Now as to joining your community, it is for the purpose of leading a religious a different and more quiet life which a confession would more fully develop. As for becoming one of your members for temporal support you misunderstood me all together; as how to get to your place, I am completely broke both in money and clothes, my clothes are very much the worse of wear. I owe nothing, my debts are all paid, and I am tired of this life of sin and crime which you meet with in the outside world. I have studied your book and it pleases me. If nothing happens I leave here on the 18 of December, my age is about 40 years, my height is about 5 feet 7 inches. Your Friend Truly, C. J. S. Blackwells Island, N. Y. P. S. Please answer.
