OUR CHRISTIAN HOME. NANCY G. DANFORTH. ' I'll sing of home, my happy home, A home beyond the wind and tide, I find it here, with angels near,� My happy home, my heaven. ' Home ! how many sweet associations cluster around the name ; a place where father and mother, brothers and sisters dwell in love and peace, and sound of discord should never enter. This should be the condition of every earthly home, but the blessings of a gospel home far surpass all the joys of earth. A home where each inmate is pledged to give all his strength to upbuild gospel purity and love. They may have come from different nations, yet, making the love of Gol their guide, they seek to lay aside all incongruities of habit and disposition and mold themselves to the one pattern of love and good will. Our Christian communistic home is a place where all are striving to rise from that which is immoral or unchristian, and forsake all that pertains to worldly mindedness even the life of generation, which in itself is good, being ordained of God as the seed time for the continuance of the race. But now has come the harvest when those who are ripened for the heavenly garner, are being reaped from earthly conditions and gathered to the home above. Above earthly, sensual desires ; though still on earth, yet above earth's elements or attractions. Here is found the bread of life which feeds the hungry soul, here flows the fountain of living waters, where all may drink to a fullness, and freely bathe until made pure and white, free from all the stains of sin. We would invite all who are truly sick of sin, and earnestly desire to ' lay their heavy burdens down,' to seek this home, ' beyond the wind and tide ' of earthly strife, and find that peace and rest their spirit's crave. As all we possess is dedicated and consecrated to the service of God and his people, we have no right to appropriate aught for selfish purposes. Neither may we admit those who merely wish a worldly home where they can be cared for in their infirmities. Those who wish to be shielded from disgrace, still have no desire to relinquish the life leading thereto, need not seek admittance to our gospel home for those elements would soon destroy the order and harmony of heaven itself. Rather let such take their fill of the fading pleasures of earth until their souls are glad to seek the mercy of God. But to the humble and penitent soul the offers of salvation are free, for the mission of the Christ Spirit is to save people from, and not in their sins. Therefore we rejoice that we have found the ' new and living way, ' where the old life is no ' more remembered, neither comes into mind. ' Here we are called to live ho- ly and unblamable before our most holy faith. Since we as a people are privileged to enjoy these rich blessings, we may joyfully sing,� ' Beautiful home, beautiful home ! Truth is thy brightness, And peace is thy whiteness, Thy fullness has never been told. Home of the soul, home in God's love, That love which endures ; Redemption secures, Is a treasure more precious than gold. ' Canterbury, N. H.
