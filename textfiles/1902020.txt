Dear Editor:--If you are of the same mind... Shaker Village, N. H. Jan. 1889. Dear Editor :ï¿½If you are of the same mind, I should like to see the following piece, in the columns of our Manifesto, because I believe in the spirit of it. 1 am nearly eighty years of age ; and for more than forty years, teaming has been my chief employment. When Brethren and Sisters have been with me, and when taking the youth and children out to ride, I have asked God to protect us from accident; and He has never failed to hear and answer my prayer. Your aged frieud and brother Sullivan Wright.
