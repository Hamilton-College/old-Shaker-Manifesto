THE KENTUCKY REVIVAL. By Richard M'Nemar OF Uxion Village, Ohio. Published in Albany, N. Y. in 180S. No. 2. The New Testament appeared to be the proper fruit and product of the church of Christ, and manifested by its purity that it was a pure church out of which it sprung. Taking the church as the tree, and the Scripture as the fruit, both seemed to be good. But the fruit, which had been for many generations produced by those churches which bore the same name, was very different. The writings of these churches instead of uniting the people in ^righteousness and peace, had kindled endless controversies and angry disputes; and from the manifest difference in the fruits, it appeared that modern professors could not be the same kind of people with those that had formerly been called Christian. According to the Scriptures, Christians were united, all of one heart and one soul. They laid aside all anger, wrath, clamor, envy and evil speaking ; were kindly affectioned one toward another, and loved one another with a pure heart fervently. Daily observation proved that those who now assumed the same name, were full of envy and strife, railing and backbiting, hateful and hating one another; and in every sense different from those holy men of God, who were formerly called by the name of Christ. This distinction was observed not only in common professors, but even in the ministers. While the New Testament represented the ministers of Christ, as meek, humble, honest men, examples to the flock, in charity, faith and purity ; those who were called the ministers of Christ in the present day, appeared to be proud, aspiring, contentious men, striving who should be the greatest, overlooking common people as an inferior rank of beings; deeply immersed in the cares of the world, eager after salaries, or posts of profit in civil government, and some even holding their fellow-creatures in perpetual slavery, or selling them for money. These appeared not to be the same kind of men as those whom Christ ordained, nor did it appear that they had the same Holy Ghost dwelling in them, or could be as safely believed or followed, as the ministers who wrote the Scriptures. They admitted the conviction that they were far sunk from the power and purity of the Apostles of Christ, and were preaching about a salvation which they had not in possession. Another important train of ideas arose from searching the Scriptures. There was a falling away spoken of by Christ and his Apostles, and an antichrist to rise, which appeared, according to history, to have taken place a great while ago. And it appeared by many promises, that after the reign of this antichrist was out, there would be glorious times upon earth, and Christ would appear again and set up his kingdom and gather the nations into it. Here many enquiries were raised, concerning the reign of this antichrist: when it began and when it would end, and when Christ would appear and set up his true kingdom. And many began to apprehend that this period was not far off ; and concluded it was time to leave off their vain disputes and unite in prayer for Christ to come and pour out his spirit, gather his people into one, make an end of sin, and fill the earth with his glory. For several years there were praying societies kept up in different parts, composed of persons who were distinguished in some things from all the denominations, though blended with them in their outward communion. These professed to be in search of the truth and power of religion, and ready to embrace it whenever it should appear, but did not believe it to be among any of the denominations, in purity. They believed there were errors in all their systems of doctrine, which kept them dead and lifeless, without the spirit of God. The social exercises which sprung from this faith, were reading the Scriptures without any comment, praying for the divine spirit to open them, confessing and lamenting the deplorable state of mankind in general, and that of cold, lifeless and corrupt professors of Christianity in particular ; and pleading for the accomplishment of those blessed promises which respected the coming of Christ and the glory of the latter days. Examining themselves by the evidences and marks of grace laid down in the Scriptures, lamenting a lack of those evidences, confessing their short-comings in duty, and resolving to correct past errors, and be more watchful over a deceitful and desperately wicked heart, opening their trials to one another, and encouraging each other to persevere until they found Christ in very deed. When any one prays for a thing, it is a sure and certain evidence that he has not that thing in possession : and hence the united prayers of hundreds of the warmest professors, entreating Christ to come and visit the churches, loudly proclaimed that he was not already there.' While he was contemplated at a distance through the promise, the following lines well suited the day, and proved his absence from the soul: 'When I turn my eyes within; All is dark, and vain, and wild: Full of unbelief and sin; Can I deem myself a child?' The following extracts of letters from persons of no small note in the churches, will show more particularly the state of religion at that period. Dear Sir :�I received your kind letter, and I now undertake to answer it. ***** The dead state of religion is truly discouraging' here, as well as elsewhere. It appears a wonder of mercy, that God is so kind to this Sardis, as to afford her the means of grace ; without this she would certainly run into total infidelity. When I look into my wretched heart, and consider how much I have dishonored God, by a dead and careless life ; I have reason to cover my head in the dust. * * If some are spotted with sin ; I am spot all over. * * J. T. Lexington, Sept. 1796. Dear Brother :�It is not likely I can say anything to entertain or refresh you. I sometimes think I would be willing to travel with you to heaven ; but I feel very unlike an inhabitant of that place, I would be glad to be at the truth, and the substance., But I commonly feel so much more like a devil than a Christian, that it makes me often forebode the displeasure of God, the holy and the just. I sometimes think I am coming towards the birth, but can seldom think I am born. O how long ! how long ! And what am I ? I would strip off everything but Christ and his holy spirit, to enter the narrow gate * * I can tell you but little about my poor congregations. I see but little prospect of encouragement. I dare not say none. * * * I sometimes hope to see Jesus King in Zion. J. D. Now let any one judge from the foregoing evidences, wiiat kind of work was necessary to take place among such a people, in order to their recovery; a people confessedly, vain, and dark, and wild; full of unbelief and sin, dead and careless, spot all over; and more like devils than Christians. The generality, however, unaffected with their sad case, were still going on, crying out against infidelity, lampooning the Deist, treating his cavils with contempt and laboring each one to augment his party: while a distressed few were watching, like the guards of the night and ready to meet the first dawn of the approaching day. A sense of the total depravity of human nature, and the entire separation of the soul from God, is the first thing necessary to prepare the way for the entrance of spiritual life. Therefore, such as honestly confessed their lost and deplorable state, and intensely groaned for deliverance from it, were not in so dangerous a condition as those who made a high-sounding profession, and gloried in some plan of salvation that still left them in bondage to corruption. But a conviction of being lost never saved any one, though many have made conviction a great evidence of their election, and vainly rested upon that light which searches out the evil and wickedness of the heart, without going any further. But such as were honest before God, could not stop here : they must be at the truth and the substance. Therefore, it was necessary that the channel through which the quickening power of God has access to the soul, should be opened: namely�,the everlasting covenant of redemption. As this is the only channel through which' souls can receive any special favor from God, it will be proper here, to make a few observations concerning it. When one makes a promise to another, and that promise is accepted, this constitutes a covenant or agreement. Thus the promise of eternal life was made to Christ and accepted by him in behalf of all ^tho accept him. In this promise, or covenant of life, the Father and Son are perfectly united. It is an everlasting and unchangeable covenant. The covenant itself, is absolute, unconditional and inviolable. But in order to its being fulfilled and finally settled, there is a work given the Son to do, which, in the nature of things, is necessary to be done, and that is, to overcome death, and him that has the power of it. Until this is actually done, the heir is in bondage. It is true, eternal life is secured in the covenant, to all the faithful, though they be not in actual possessioit of it. But while death reigns, the blessings of the covenant can only be administered by way of promise, and the party to whom the promise shall be fulfilled, designated in the Father's revealed will. This everlasting covenant has ever been a mystery to man, nor could anything certain ever be known respecting it but by a living revelation from God, an express manifestation of the divine will, attested by living witnesses. Where this orderly administration has been wanting, the more that has been said about it, the greater confusion and controversy has been stirred up. It is true, the Scriptures contain a copy of the divine will, concerning the redemption of souls ; all the promises of God are there recorded. But of what use is a bare copy of a will without witnesses ? These great and precious promises could effect nothing real; the inheritance itself was not in them ; and although thousands have undertaken to administer upon the authority of the Scriptures, as though it was the very original itself, sealed and confirmed by unalterable seals, and have pretended to be the true witnesses of God: yet their folly is made manifest to all men. They have not agreed in their witness but have filled the world with endless debates, concerning the sense and meaning of what they call the icill.. If the witnesses were all divided, and could not even agree in their testimony who were the proper heirs, how could anything ever be decided in such a court? However much these presumers have altered, amended, expounded and paraphrased upon the copy ; yet the original has remained unsullied. God is of one mind, and his promises in Christ, are Yea and Amen. When God revealed his covenant to Abraham, it was only by promise. 'In thee and in thy seed, shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.' The blessing promised, was not to Abraham and his seed ; but to all the nations of the earth. It was not, Thou and thy seed shall be blessed with irresistible grace, but uIn thee and in thy seed [which is Christ] all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.' All were tinder the curse, and stood in equal need of the blessing. Sin and death had their dominions equally over all. But a better dominion was promised; a kingdom of righteousness ; a dominion of life ; in which all the nations of the earth should be blessed. Although death reigned from Adam to Moses, and from Moses to Christ; yet the promise of God to Abraham, was sure to all the seed ; death could not destroy it; the law could not supplant it, or make it void ; the threatenings and curses from Mt. Sinai, were not against the promise made. Tne promise was established and confirmed by unalterable seals, illustrated by types and figures, and attested by a long succession of living Prophets, until Christ the proper heir made his appearance ; �finished the work that was given him to do, received the substance that was promised by the Father, and took possession of the inheritance. Until this took place, souls were in bondage under the rudiments of the world. They could find no resurrection into eternal life, until the son of God, in the fulness of time, was made of a woman ; made flesh ; placed under the same rudiments by which they were held in bondage; and from thence ascended step by step, until he entered the promised possession. Then, and not till then, the way was open for the substance to be ministered ; then the first-born could give gifts unto his brethren, substantial, real gifts. What he received of the Father, he gave to those who were joint heirs with him to the promised possession, and sent them into the world as he had been sent, to minister to others as he ministered to them. Moreover, he did not send them to some particular persons, but to every creature that was under heaven ; and commissioned them to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound ; one as much as another. No nation or individual was excluded, but the promise was to all, and upon all, and should finally be fulfilled to all them that believe and obey. While the everlasting covenant was thus ministered in truth by the Apostles and true witnesses of Christ, it was confirmed by the most convincing signs, wonders, miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit. They healed the sick, raised the dead, cast out malignant spirits, spake with unknown tongues, held converse with angels and departed spirits, saw visions, fell into trances, and had gifts of prophesying. These, and such like, were seals to their ministry. But above all, the salutary change produced in the lives and manners of those who believed, confirmed the doctrine to be of God ; and served as a test to those who should come after, whereby to distinguish the true covenant of God, from all the counterfeit doctrines of men. When the true administration of the covenant ceased, the signs and seals of confirmation ceased with it. God would not affix his seal to the canons, decrees and covenants of wicked men, who rose up to supplant the true work of redemption. For many ages, what has been called the Christian doctrine, has been void of authority, except what arises from superstition, vain philosophy, the power of human eloquence, or the civil sword. But when God, in infinite kindness, began to revive the everlasting truth in these latter days, the living seals of the covenant were annexed. Such seals and evidences of a supernatural and divine power, have excited as great astonishment in the minds of mankind, as those of antiquity. (to be continued.)
