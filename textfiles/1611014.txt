SALT AND DIGESTION. If a piece of salt is taken into the mouth the flow of saliva is temporarily increased, though it is not certain that the amount secreted in any given time is any greater than it would have been had no stimulants been used. It has been argued also that the effect of salt on the gastric juice ir the stomach is the same, and that its use promotes digestion. Some recent experiments, however, on a man who had an artificial opening into his stomach to supply food which he could not take through th- - mouth, seems to negative this assumption and that salt hinders the secretion of the gastric juice and digestion rather than promotes them. If the amount of salt is considerable, digestion almost ceases. Sour wines and alcoholic drinks used on the same person were also proved to hinder instead of help digestion. Experiments like these have great value, for they help to clear away the superstitions of past ages which seem to be held by the educated and the ignorant alike. Bay Star.
