Long speeches, long letters, long communications, are out of place... Long speeches, long letters, long communications, are out of place these stirring times. We have a whole world's news to look after and put in order for our readers over night. Remember that, kind correspondents and contributors. Avoid parentheses. Drop the semi-colons altogether. Make the spaces between your periods as brief as possible. Shake out the adjectives without remorse. Sacrifice the pet metaphors. Be not led away by the lovers of antithesis, or alliteration. Be clear and crisp, pertinent alike in your invectives, eulogies, and recommendations. Think of the Lord's prayer, and then of the awkward sub- stitute served up by sensation-mongers in too many pulpits. That flights of tawdry rhetoric, and volleys of expletives; what endless repetitions of tedious details weary and disgust the hearer. It is frightful to think of the time wasted by these self-parading petitioners and long-winded inditers of many-headed sermons. Life is too short, too full of cares and duties, to be thrown away thus. The best advice, the brightest wit, the deepest wisdom, come over in small packages. Boston Globe
