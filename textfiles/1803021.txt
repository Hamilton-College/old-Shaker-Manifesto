IN VAIN. May Maurice. Though our path be strewn with flowers, Bright and joyous all the hours, Crowned with honor and success, Rich in hope and happiness ; If we never strive while here, Any darkened life to cheer, Never soothe one grief or pain, We shall live our life in vain. Though our hearts with music thrill, Visions sweet our moments fill, Gifted with a poet's power To beguile the passing hour; If we sing no happy song, Wake no joy, and right no wrong, Draw none heavenward by our strain, We shall live our life in vain. Though we gather wealth untold, Heaping up the shining gold, Though our wants are all supplied, Nothing we would ask denied; If we never from our store Feed the hungry, bless the poor, If the world share not our gain, We shall live our life in vain. Through life's path we have a Guide In whose love we may confide, And his foot-prints mark the way, So the feeblest need not stray; If we will not heed his voice, Making other paths our choice; If we shun the way so plain, We shall live our life in vain.| Contributed by A.
