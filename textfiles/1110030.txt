LITTLE CHILDREN Keep guard of your words, my darlings, For words are wonderful things; They are sweet like the bees' fresh honey, Like the bees they have terrible stings. They can bless like the warm, glad sunshine, And brighten a lonely life, They can cut in the strife of anger, Like an open, two-edged knife. Let them pass through your lips unchal lenged, If their errand is true and kind ; If they come to support the weary, To comfort and help the blind. If a bitter revengeful spirit Prompts the words, let them be said; They may flash through a brain like lightning, Or fall on a heart like lead. Keep them back if they're cold and cruel, Under bar, and lock and seal; The wounds they make, my darlings, Are always slow to heal. May peace guard your lives and ever From this time of your early youth; May the words that you daily utter Be the beautiful words of truth.
