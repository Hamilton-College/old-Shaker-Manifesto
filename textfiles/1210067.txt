Slander â€”Against slander there is no defence. Hell cannot boast so foul a fiend, nor man deplore so foul a foe. It stabs with a word, with a nod, with a shruV, with a look, with a smile. It is the pestilence walking in darkness, spreading contagion far and wide, which the most wary traveler cannot avoid. It is the heart-searching dagger of the assassin. It is the poisoned arrow whose wound is incurable. It is as mortal as the .'ting of the deadly arrow ; murder is its employment, innocence its prey, and ruin its sport.
