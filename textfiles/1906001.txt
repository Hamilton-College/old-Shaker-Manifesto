CONSIDERATE REFLECTIONS. George M. Wickersham. Can it be true that our young people, those upon whom we have set our hearts, to save them from the sins and follies of the world, those for whom we have spent weary hours of toil to serve, and to make life enjoyable, and to educate them for virtue and usefulness, we ask, can it be possible that they leave us because they are driven away from us? If so, who, or what is it that drives them? If we drive them away, why does the memory of their experience here haunt them like a dream of Paradise towards which they frequently turn, hoping, sometime when the fetters of their exile are brok.n, to be allowed to return even to a lower statica than the one fro.a wh'ch they went. If they are driven out by unreasonable treatment, we say, why do the brightest and best behaved delight to come back and call up old memories, associatio is which must bring back the recollections of ill-treatment, so much greater than the benefits, as to have forced them to depart; if that was the case. Or, why do others under the samo treatment, abide with us? It appears to us, that the cause of leaving is not co much in being driven away by others, as it is by being enticed away by natural and uugoverned propensities. The same as the first pair were driven or more properly enticed from a state of purity in Eden. It has been the policy and practice of our leaders to concede many thiags to yonug people, and overlook many -Indiscretions in order to hold them, hoping that as the/ grew in knowledge, and understanding themselves, they would see the propriety of the greater restriction, and come to it voluntarily. It will not do to yield to all the wants of young people ; for that would be to surrender all government and ail regulation to the unskillful notions of inexperience. The uugoverned child is ungrateful and unhappy ; even though it is sheer affection that indulges it. It is a slave to its own passionate impulses, and is tormented with their restless and ceaseless demands. Only the governed child knows how to appre- date kindness ; only those who are disciplined by love have much to be thankful for. Only such can be held by obligation, or heed the call of duty. The ungoverned child on arriving at the youthful period, is impatient of all restraint but that of caution and seeretiveuess. and is driven by his masterpassions and impulses to all sorts of expedients, tricks, and rogueries to accomplish their desires, till finally they drive him from order-loving society to repeat his exploits elsewhere. This is an extreme character, but there is a mixture of every grade from the governed to the not governed. And it is the mixture of ungoverned and undisciplined elements of character which causes all the trouble disaster and ruin. Many seeds of the world have germinated in the heart of the child before it is given into our charge. These are nourished and others spring up as the opportunities of the child enlarge by continual communication and contact with worldly elemeuts and conditions, kept up by frequent communication with outside friends or relations, and their exchanges by letters, presents, and social visits, both ways. Most young people in these days are readers of books and story-papers, newspapers and magazines, which are charged with influences foul or fair. Those coming from the world convey knowledge of the world, both its truth, and falsehood, good and evil, selfish and unselfish, clean and filthy, wise and foolish from which the reader's mind attracts and assimilates as food, consciously and unconsciously, whatever agrees most with its leading impulses and desires. For the heart is a magnet, and as sure as magnet draws steel, it attracts to itself whatever it most desires, or else it finally draws to it; if the desire be not given up or exchanged for another. T lis is the law of all growth in life. The unavoidable frequent contact with hirelings and strangers, increases the number of avenues by which the great outside world flows into the youthful mind to nourish aud claim its own, planted there in its beginning. The mind of a child having such a start, all these feeders grow into a compound that thinks happiness consists in the attraction of pictures that are excitable, useless games that if indulged in lead to gambling, and trying to bring in many things contrary to the feelings and judgment of the officers of Society. Loving to think only on the agreeable part of the pictures photographed on his mental atmosphere ; he is dazzled by surface glitter and display, and lives in an unreal world created by the imaginations of his own heart. To some the world appears as a vast play-house, and it seems to be enjoying a holiday. Others look upon it as an open market where most things sought by young people are supposed purchasable with brains, muscles, or money. All these things operate like magnets upon the youthful mind to weaken the sense of obligation aud of duty in serving ; and to lessen in its esteem the value of moral law, and the necessity of daily faithful service to Society as an essential ingredient of happiness, because these interrupt its dreams of pleasure and bring it face to face with sober realities. Outside, idle ease and fancied freedom, or pleasure and selfish gain invite; inside, is toil, crucifixion, and restraint. The former attracts, the latter repels. The former appeals whol- ly to what is external and transitory, the latter builds up the internal, and enduring, and aids growth by exercise of faculty. To counteract these is needed, First, a sense of duty arising from a proper cultivation of conscience, a principle to do right because it is right. Any one who has not this principle enthroned within, is not prepared for happiness in this world or auy other. If we cannot succeed in planting or unfolding it in those who regard it not, they will be like thorns in the side of their friends and neighbors, and very unsuitable material for our Society. Second, youthful minds should be allowed such innocent pleasures as do not interfere with proper discipline and the performance of necessary duties.' We think, good judges will agree that children and young people should never be spoken to in anger, or crossed unnecessarily. For certainly the faithful performance of all life's duties brings crosses and burdens enough to perfect discipline without inventing any extra ones. Third, it is necessary to cultivate Spirituality in the young mind, to teach it the value and importance of the life after this, and how our conduct here will determine our conditions there. If we obey our best light and understanding, and heed the monitious of conscience, and the teachings of our superiors who have had experience, renouncing present pleasure for future good, our condition hereafter will be happifying and all that we can desire, far beyond anything we can conceive while here. Such as neglect dutyï¿½disregard conscience, disobej teachers and guardians in a careless, self-willed, headstrong way, unless they repent of such ways and change their course, thev are heds-iner ud their own way, and are gathering fuel for their own destruction ; are making work for future repentance before thev ca'3 gain that degree of happiness which gives peace and comfort to the soul. Our bodies contain appetites and passions which are self-impelling forces, and if we do not acquire complete dominion and perfect control over them, by obedience to the highest light given us through understanding, and the moral and reasoning faculties, and thus obtain our relation and union with the order of rational, spiritual beings above us, they will acquire dominion over us, and cut us off from associating with higher intelligences, and degrade us to the level of the animal creation, holding such relation to the universe as animals hold, without their peaceful, restful state, because out of our true order and relationship to the superior Intelligences. Spirituality gives faith in the unseen, which is the key that unlocks the kingdom of heaven w thin. It lifts all the sublunary functions of the mental faculties, and bears them on its own heaventending pinions in a more refined and clearer atmosphere. It is the organ of enthusiasm, aud of higher aims than those which relate solely to man's material welfare, aud discloses within an immovable center of attraction, opposed to the attractions of the worldly elements. If the young be not taught how present conduct will effect their future condition, and to employ a reflection aud forethought which looks beyond the present moment, to a retributive harvest by which to regulate their actions, and test their aims ; they will be most sura to leave us, drawn by attraction to that which is most agreeable to the general make-up of their minds. For it is on- ly by forethought, by keeping in view a distant and specific object to which lesser aims are deemed at least as subservient, that the mind endures with undiverted purpose. Mt.
