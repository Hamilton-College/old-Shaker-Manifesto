PRAYER JAMES S. GLASS Prayer is the breath of the soul. A breathing operation, through the spiritual organs of respiration ; by. which the soul is nourished, and furnished with food, and clothing, necessary to its existence, and eternal progression ; being analogous to breathing through the physical organs, the lungs, by which the external body is animated, and moved, by the essential elements, of an outward physical existence. Although this operation, in both cases, is involuntary and natural, yet it can be rendered more powerfully effective for good or evil, by voluntary exercise ; the will, and mind, combining the strength of all the faculties, of soul and body. So it appears we must pray, 'whether we will or no.'â€”But to make more profit by prayer, we must earnestly use our most important faculty of Judgment; to reason, and discern, what we need to progress us, unto real happiness ; which is that blessed condition, that all rational beings desire to attain unto. But why are so many disappointed, and come short of this all desirable object? We might say briefly, because of a lack of understanding what to pray for, and how to ask aright. Perhaps we might enlighten our understandings by looking farther than this comprehensive, and indisputable answer. The details of such a study, and meditation, let every one run out for themselves. It is sufficient to show that our associative assembly for the more special purposes of the sacred gift of prayer, is no idle, trifling, or unimportant object. If we choose to trifle with it, it will fail to be as edifying, and beneficial, as it is our privilege, if not our duty, to make it. But as the subject embraces, and comprehends, a much greater field than I am capable of harvesting, I will leave it, for abler heads, and more inspired pens than mine, to do justice to this peculiarly interesting theme.
