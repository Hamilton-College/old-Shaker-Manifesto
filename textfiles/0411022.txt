Should we explore this spacious earth... Should we explore this spacious earth, And view its contents o'er and o'er, Renew again our diligence Add search the sea from shore to shore; How vain, alas ! our search would be, If happiness we seek to find, It can't be found on land or sea, Except we have it in the mind. 'Tis there our choicest treasures lie, Abroad for joys we need not roam, Nor stretch our sense beyond the sky, Our greatest heaven is at home. Anna Granger, Enfield, Conn.
