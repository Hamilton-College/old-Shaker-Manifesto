A hundred years ago, in 1780, a strange darkness came suddenly at mid-day upon the State of Connecticut, and many thought the end of the world was come. The Speaker of the House of Assembly, then in session, was in his place, and when many desired to adjourn, he calmed the rising fears of the members with these words, 'If this be the day of judgment, I desire that the Judge may find me at my post of duty. Let the candles be brought in, and the business proceed.' May God help us to be at our posts always and to the end! So say I in 1888. A. M. G.
