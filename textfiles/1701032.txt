AGNUS DEI [The following lines are contributed by William Justice, aged 84 years, who is patiently awaiting the call of the Lord.] Great God, thy name be blessed, Thy goodness be adored; My soul has been distressed, But thou hast peace restored. A thankful heart I feel, In peace my mind is stayed : Balsamic ointments heal The wounds by sorrow made. Though elements contend, And winds and waters rage: I've an unshaken friend Who doth my grief assuage. Though outward storms arise— Emblems of those within— Oa Christ my soul relies, THE MANIFESTO. 23 The sacrifice for sin. Though inward storms prevail, Afflicting to endure, I've help that cannot fail In Him who's ever sure, Though outward war and strife, Prevail from sea to sea, I've peace in inward life, And that sufflceth me. Though clamor rear its head And stalk from shore to shore, My food is angels' bread— What can I covet more? Though ill reports abound, Suspicion and surmise, I find, and oft have found, In death true comfort lies ; That death I mean whereby Self-love and will are slain, For these the more they die, The more the Lamb doth reign. And well assured I am, True peace is only known Where he, the harmless Lamb, Has made the heart his throne. Then may the tempest rage, And cannon roar in vain, The Uock of every age, The Lamb, the Lamb dotli reign. Selected
