POOR LITTLE DANNY There is a touch of Dickens in Little Danny's soliloquy over the death of his mother. We find it in the New Orleans Picayune : I've just been down in the parlor to see mamma. She's in a long box with flowera on her. I wish she'd come back and bathe my headâ€”it aches so. Nobody ever makes it feel good but mamma. She knew how it hurt me, and she used to read to me out of a little book how my head would get well and not ache any more some day . I wish it was ' some day ' now. Nobody likes me but mamma. That's cause I've got a sick head. Mamma used to take me in her arms and cry. When I asked her what's the matter she would say, 'I'm only tired, darling. Aunt Anges made her tired, for when she came and stayed all day, mamma would take me up in the evening on her lap and cry awful hard. I ain't had any dinner to day. Mamma always gave me my dinner and a little trenty pudding with ' D ' for ' Danny,' on the top. 1 like little puddings with D's on the top. I like to sit in my little chair by the fire and eat 'em. I wish mamma wouldn't stay in the long box. I guess Aunt Agnes put her there, cause she put all the flower trimmings on and shows her to everybody. There ain't any fire in the grate, but I guess I'll sit by it and make believe there is. I'll get my little dish and spoon and play I've got a pudding with D for Danny on it. But any way I want mamma so bad.
