No more let us pray, Lord we are great sinners... No more let us pray, Lord we are great sinners pardon us through the merits of Jesus. Rather say Lord we have sinned and we expect by the law of Justice to suffer for it. Let this teach us to do better in future, a.nd that vice brings its own punishment, and virtue its own reward. How comforting to know that a parental spirit presides over our destinies. That all the disadvantages we struggle undei are known to our all-wise Father aud Mother. C. D.
