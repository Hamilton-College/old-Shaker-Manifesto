Dear Editor:--I thought I would write something about our home... Sonyea, N. Y., Feb. 4, 1890. Dear Editor :�I thought I would write something about our home. Our school is in session now. There are twelve pupils who attend�seven boys and five girls. We also have a Bible class and our teacher has given us some questions from the Old Testament for us to search out the answers. One of our questions is, 'What ancient King used the dromedary for a mail-carrier?' I will not tell the answer for perhaps some other little girl would like to answer it. Our regular lessons are in the book of Acts. Jennie Wells.
