Here are a couple of items worthy of being told... Here are a couple of items worthy of being told. Farmers who have tested them say they are effectual as good scarecrows : The best scarecrow is a suspended lookingglass. Take two small, cheap mirrors, fasten them back to back, attach a cord to one angle, i elastic pole. When the glass swings in the wind, the sun's rays are reflected all over the field, even if it be a large one, and even the oldest and bravest of crows will depart precipitately should one of its lightning flashes fall on him. The second plan, although a terror to crows, is especially well suited to fields subjected to the inroads of small birds, and even chickens. It involves an artificial hawk made from a big potato and long goose and turkey feathers. The maker can exercise his imitative skill in sticking the feathers into the potato so that they resemble the spread wings and tail of the hawk. It is astonishing what a ferocious bird of prey can be constructed from the above simple material. It only remains to hang the object from a tall bent pole, and the wind will do the rest. The bird will make swoops and dashes in the most headlong and threatening manner. Even j the most inquisitive of venerable hens have been known to hurry rapidly from its dangerous vicinity, while to small birds it carries unmixed dismay.â€”Scientific American.
