The Farm Poultry We have received a copy of 'The Farm Poultry,' and this is No. 1, of Vol. 1, which informs us that it is new in the world. On the first page it has a very pretty illustration of Cottage life. Better than that, it will tell 'How to make money with a few hens,' and the Editor expects to tell how this may be done. We all want the money, and want the hens, and as the cost of the paper will be onlj fifty cents per year, we must send that amount to I. S. Johnson &amp; Co., 22 Custom House St., Boston, Mass.
