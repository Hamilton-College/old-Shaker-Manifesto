Whitewater, Ohio. June, 1897. The wheels of time have brought us around to June,ï¿½the month of roses. Our crops are in good condition altho we have had a cold, late spring which has retarded the growth of corn. Wheat and clover are doing well. We have removed the hot air furnace, that was in our family Dwelling and now use steam and hot water heaters. The Trustees' Office is f urnisht with a hot water apparatus. These changes we think will bu a great improvement. Some painting has been done in the family Dwelling which will improve the general appearance very much. Alexander Smith.
