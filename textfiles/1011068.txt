A Comprehensive Prayer . — Thomas a' Kempis, who died just one hundred years before the German reformation, is said to be the author of this prayer, ' Give me a clear understanding against all error, a clean heart against all impurity, a right faith against all doubtfulness, a firm hope against all difficulties, fervent charity against all indifference and negligence, great patience against all disturbance, holy meditation against every filthy imagination, continual prayer against the devil's assaults, good occupation against the tiresomeness and drowsiness of the heart, and lastly, a devout remembrance of thy holy passion against the wounding of the soul by .vices. Assist me, Oh ! my God, with all these, Thy good gifts, and confirm me in all Thy holy words. Amen.'—Alliance-
