WEED, PARSONS AND COMPANY ¦------------------?------------------.. We cannot afford to come to a full close of our labors, without acknowledging deep and lasting respect and gratitude, to Weed, Parsons and Co., Albany, N. Y.,—our printers. Much of the beauty of art of typography, freedom from errors, etc., is due to their credit. We would speak for them the patronage of the entire world; and whoever desires their printing, binding, lithographing, electro typing, and press work done by a most careful and painstaking firm, at most moderate rates—they have done The Manifesto work at cost, or less—apply for the estimates of such work of our noble patrons— Weed, Parsons and Co., Albany, N.
