Whilk practicing law a number of years ago, ' said Judge Tourgee, 'I had a peculiar will case. An old lady who was a slaveholder, dying, bequeathed her colored man, John, and her dusky maid, Jane, who sustained to each other the relation of husband and wife, to the trustees of the church, ' to be used as far as possible for the glory of God.' I was curious to know what course was taken, and upon investigation found that after meditation and prayer, the pious trustees sold their living legacy at auction, and with the proceeds sent a missionary to China.
