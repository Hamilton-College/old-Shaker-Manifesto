Sanitary. GOOD BREAD. To the Editor ;�I notice articles upon Graham bread in the American Agriculturist and other papers. Perhaps our experience at the North family, Mt. Lebanon, may be of some interest and service to the public. For many years wn have used bread made from wheat of our own raising. We wash the �wheat thoroughly, kiln dry, grind it ourselves coarsely, use it unbolted, and bake it in a soap-stone oven. No leaven in it. It is good wheaten bread, and we are certain that it is pure and unadulterated as we are that no deception is possible in the production of spiritual phenomena got up among ourselves arid especially for our own delectation and edification. I doubt whether really good men and women�Christians�can be raised upon poor bread, made of adulterated materials and chemically corrupted by leaven. If a clean thing cannot be brought out of an unclean, then how can a good thing be made out of bad materials? Have not a loaf to spare, (unless to feed the hungry,) a bushel of wheat, nor a barrel of flour to sell at any price. F. W. Evans. LIME WATER. The housekeeper should never be without a bottle of lime water in the house. To have it always ready and in good order, with little expense, place in a tall quart bottle of any kind a gill or so of good lime just slacked with water. Then fill the bottle with rain or other pure water, and allow it to stand quietly, well corked. The lime will settle, leaving clear lime water at the top. Pour this off gently, as wanted, adding more water as needed. Lime water, even when closely corked, often deteriorates; the carbonic acid in the air unites with the lime and settles as an insoluble carbonate on the sides of the bottle, which is nearly impossible to remove. This will spoil the bottle for any other use. Therefore select one from the store room which is not valued, but which has a good, tight cover. A wide mouthed bottle is preferable. The lime should be removed and fresh put in once a year or so, unless kept very tightly corked. A pint of cold water dissolves less than ten grains of lime, and warm water still less. The uses to which lime water may be put, are innumerable. If good milk disagrees with a child or a grown person, three or four tablespoonfuls of lime water added to a pint of it will usually help digestion and prevent flatulence; it also counteracts pain from wind in the stomach caused by eating acid fruits. Over-eating of candies and other sweets will sometimes cause acidity, for which this is a sovereign remedy. A tablespoonful for a child two years old to a gill or more for an adult is an ordinary dose, while considerable will have no bad results ; in fact, it is a simple anti-acid and slightly tonic. A small quantity put into a mug with the water for cleaning the teeth wilL harden the gums and prevent soft decay, which is a serious evil which many desire to avert. For burns and scalds, to two parts of linseed oil add one part of lime water, and apply with soft linen. American Cultivator. LOOK UP, NOT DOWN. Life to some is full of sorrow, Half is real half they borrow, Full of rocks and full of ledges, Corners sharp and cutting edges, Though the joy-bells may be ringing, Not a song you'll bear them singing, Seeing never makes them wise, Looking out from downcast eyes. All in vain the sun is shining, Waters sparkling, blossoms twining, They but see, through those same sorrows, Sad to-days and worse to-morrows, See the clouds that must pass over, See the weeds among the clover, Everything and anything, But the gold the sunbeams bring. Drinking from the bitter fountain, Lo ! your mole-hill seems a mountain, Drops of dew and drops of rain, Swell into the mighty main. All in vain the blessings shower, And the mercies fall with power, Gathering chaff, ye tread the wheat, Rich and royal, 'neath your feet. Let it not be so my neighbor, Look up, as you love and labor, Not for one alone, woe's vials, Every one has cares and trials, Joy and pain are^ linked together, Like the fair and cloudy weathei&gt; May we have, oh let us pray, Faith and patience for to-day. Selected. ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF CHRISTIANITY. In a sermon recently preached by Canon Farrar, he said: 'Blessed is the church which takes hold of the new as well as the old. * * * * An unprogressive church is a dying church, and a retrograding church is a dead church. The slumber of an unquestioning acquiescence is dropping buckets in an empty well. God is leading us upward and onward. He does not expect us to stand still and be bound within fixed limits. In every good and progressive church there must be freedom. There are systems, as we see, which God shakes to the ground in the earthquakes of history, because these systems are means, not the ends. They are the shadows which men take for the substance, and hold on to them with bigoted zeal when they should be allowed to give way for the progressive systems in which the real things are not changed at all. * * * * When doubt is sincere, as it very often is, then Christians should sympathize ; but when the trouble is in the moral nature, the doubts are hypocritical. * * * * Quench the life of God in the soul and soon no star of faith will gleam upon its cheerless midnight. But what shall we say to those who doubt in sincerity? There are many of them. How shall we guide these lost mariners to the true course? First, let them begin with what they know to be true. What are their doubts? About church organizations, about forms, about popular opinions, about miracles, about the sun's standing still for Joshua? Well, what oi them. If you cannot believe them, let them go. They are not essentials. To believe them will not make one wiser or better. ' These ideas were beautifully enlarged upon by the archdeacon, who, in conclusion, declared that no one is bound by dogmas or creeds, that sects are an abomination, and that the man who believed in and practiced the precepts of the Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, and the Golden Rule, had a foundation upon which he could stand and defy all sects and all doubts. Selected. THE SOLUTION OF THE LABOR PROBLEM. DANIEL FRASER. Population ever gravitates towards subsistence. 1st. Land is the source of subsistence. 2nd. That portion of the population engaged in providing clothing, shelter &amp;c. must ever bear a definite relation to the supply of food. 3rd. When the wage-earners are employed, they have access to subsistence. When not employed the food supply is cut off. 4th. Open to the unemployed immediate and free access to the source of subsistence, and the labor problem is solved�it solves itself automatically. 5th. The great law-giver founded the moral law on a just apportionment of the land, and enacted 'Thou shalt not steal.' Those who are denied access to the elements of subsistence, cannot be justly held to moral responsibilities.�Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. A TURNIP STORY. A farmer was once told that his turnip field had been robbed, and that the robbery had been committed by a poor, inoffensive man, of the name of Palmer, who many of the people in the village said had taken away a wagon-load of turnips. Farmer Brown, much exasperated by the loss of his turnips, determined to prosecute poor Palmer with all the severity of the law. With this intention he went to Mollie Sanders, the washerwoman, who had been busy in spreading the report, to know the whole truth; but Mollie denied ever having said anything about a wagon-load of turnips. It was but a cart-load that Palmer had taken, and Dame Hodson, the huckster, had told her so over and over again. The farmer, hearing this, went to Dame Hodson, who said that Mollie Sanders was always making things out worse than they really were, that Palmer had taken only a wheelbarrow load of turnips, and that she had her account from Jenkins, the tailor. Away went the farmer to Jenkins, the tailor, who stoutly denied the account altogether ; he had only told Dame Hodson that Palmer had pulled up several turnips, but how many he could not tell, for that he did not see himself, but was told it by Tom Slack, the plowman. Wondering where this would end, Farmer Brown next questioned Tom Slack, who, in his turn, declared he had never said a word about seeing Palmer pull up several turnips ; he only said that he pulled up a turnip. This is a fit illustration of how reports often grow and are circulated to the injury of a neighbor. Let every one be careful how they give credit to or aid in circulating evil reports, lest they be found lifting a hand to slay the innocent. Star and Crown. WHAT I KNOW ABOUT BOTANY. First I will tell about the liose. Our gardens are growing beautifully with them, and the pink wild'rose begins to blossom in the fields and by the roadside where we love to go and get them. There is much to learn about the rose family. It is a pretty flower, and related to it are many plants and trees that you will be surprised and interested to find classed with the pretty rose. Many flowers resemble each other very much, because they are made from them. Some flowers we find in our home walks and pleasant woods, and then, away in a distant State in a field, or upon a mountain-side, grows its own sister or a near relative. There are books that would aid you in finding these wandering families, though of course you do not expect to see every plant that makes each one, yet there are plenty for us to visit and compare, quite within our reach. Each Summer God's goodness gives us back these lovely roses, and we may be sure that all the rose-like plants are cared for by Him who cares for all. Now I will explain a rose. I will take the little wild one, for it is a real ros�. A large double one is not in its natural state, on account of its cultivation. It has five pink petals a tuft of little golden things in the center called stamens. Now there is a certain tree which has a flower that looks very much like little roses. Strange as it may seem to you, this tree is an apple tree 'vith its little roses. They have five rosy petals, and a cluster of paler stamens than the wild rose. This is only one but there are the pear, quince, cherry, a peach too, all delicious fruits, whose flowers resemble roses clustered together. These silky, pink Damasks came originally from Syria; the little yellow Scotch are British; the hundred leafed and Moss came from southern Europe, and the pure white from Germany. So you see you are looking at a rose many times when you do not know it. I. M. F. Kind words are the music of the world... [Contributed by Harriet Shepard.] Kind words are the music of the world. They have a power which seems to be beyond natural causes, as if they were some angel's song which had lost its way, and come on earth. It seems as if they could almost do what in reality God alone can do, soften the hard and angry hearts of men. No one was ever corrected by a sarcasm, crushed perhaps, if the sarcasm was clever enough, but drawn nearer to God, never. F. W. Faber. '- Whilk practicing law a number of years ago, ' said Judge Tourgee, 'I had a peculiar will case. An old lady who was a slaveholder, dying, bequeathed her colored man, John, and her dusky maid, Jane, who sustained to each other the relation of husband and wife, to the trustees of the church, ' to be used as far as possible for the glory of God.' I was curious to know what course was taken, and upon investigation found that after meditation and prayer, the pious trustees sold their living legacy at auction, and with the proceeds sent a missionary to China.
