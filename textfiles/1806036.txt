SPIRITUAL FEEDING. The neglect of the Bible among those who call themselves Christians is one of the marked signs of the rimes. It is a sort of reference book in the Sunday school, but the old time reading of it, the close familiarity with its stories, with its poetry and its history, with its language as the most beautiful use of English that has ever been known, with its great spiritual truths which always enkindle the soul, is passing away, and there is coming up a generation that is as ignorant of Holy Scripture as it is of the Choctaw alphabet. The religious newspaper is a poor substitute for the Bible, and the average modern book is poorer still. The sermons on Sunday are not disquisitions on Bible themes to any extent, and the people are turned out to pasture in spiritual fields, for the most part, where the grazing is not much better than it was in the country where the prodigal son staid till he was famished. People are in search of a religion which ignores sin, gives a man a soft creed to believe in, feeds him on pleasurable sentiments, and at length tosses him into the other world to come down he knows not where. The decay in religious reading of the bracing sort has had this effect everywhere. But this is only the symptoms of a much wider-spread dis ease. The Bible and the sermon and the devotional book are superseded by the prevalence of an easier feeling about life. People are in the backswing from a period when the severities of the divine law were set forth in sermon and book alike, and when the Bible was recommended chiefly because it was a sure revelation of the eternal doom of the vast majority of all mankind. The religious life of the people has been demoralized, and there has been altogether too much cheap and simple re 1 gionï¿½a religion that either frightened men out of their five senses in order to make them Christians or set before them such simple requirements for a consecrated life that they felt they were well enough off as they were. The one extreme has been as bad as the other, and both have tended to destroy the growth of a devout spirit which finds in Bible and sermon and book the nourishment of the spiritual life. Again and again the study of the Bible has brought out the stronger affections of the people into such reality that they became like the Hebrew and Christian saints whum they knew through imaginative sympathy, and rose to faith and trust and noble deeds like them. It is the presentation of this stronger life which is greatly needed to-day in the pulpit, in the Sunday school, in the family, in the channels of Christian literature. Where there is something to take hold of, where the thought of the average man is reached, whether through Bible or sermon or secular reading, the mind has been awakened and the spiritual nature is almost sure to be aroused. Much as the people are now distracted by their multiplied engagements, they will not shun the Bible when it is made interesting to them, nor will they turn away from religious reading when it is made to convey the true message of God to man in this generation.
