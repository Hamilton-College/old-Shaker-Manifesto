GOOD DESIRES MARTHA J. ANDERSON I would that my hands were swifter Love's duties to fulfill, To meet life's needs in earnest deeds, As prompts the heart and will. I would that my feet were fleeter To move with the mind intent, To answer the call, do good to all, On heavenly missions bent. I would that my tongue in praises Might tenderly, lovingly speak, That never a word by passion stirred, Would injure the strong or weak. I would that my lips might seal the vow, That nectar may from them fall, Life's golden cup with joy fill up, And blessing bring to all. I would that my eyes were clearer; Their vision reaching far Might pierce the trail through the misty vale And the gates of heaven unbar. I would that my ears were dull to sounds, That rise from the world's great strife, And could only hear from the inner sphere The songs of eternal life. I would that my heart's full measure O'erflowed in its melody, To meet the strain of the glad refrain That floats from eternity. Oh, sun of my being's centre, Immortal and God-like soul! Through outward things thy life takes wings Unto perfection's goal. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
