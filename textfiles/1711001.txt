GRATITUDE. AGNES E. NEWTON. I bless the power that taught my soul Upon the rock to fall; Tho' broken are my selfish hopes And scattered is my all; Wherein I've sought or e'en desired, Aside from Christian gain : To know, to be, to have, or share Without the spotless name. I sing the joy of sins forgiven, Of love that knows no fear; Of truth, that in my inner life Today, is shining clear. And by this truth I know my soul Will be made pure and free; No distant triumph I've in view, Each hour brings victory. And so I've learned to bless the means, And trust the guiding hand, That wisely laid the structure low, When building on the sand. And does the storm or calm surround, I've found a solace sweet; And make the living sacrifice, With gratitude replete. Canterbury, N. H.
