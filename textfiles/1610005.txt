Respected friend, Adin Ballou: A kind friend... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Apr. 15, 1863. Respected Friend, Adin BalLOU :�A kind friend, brother Oliver Prentiss favored me with a perusal of your interesting letter ; interesting, because of your position in the important moves of the day, and personal experience in relation to persons and things connected with attempts to form a community having goods in common. You have had an opportunity to see the workings of human nature under peculiar circumstances, and though painful in the detail and in the aggregate, such experience will yet prove of much value. The non success of the Hopedale Community in common with others that have arisen and gone down,' must have its weight in establishing ground for suspicion, that man and woman on the Adamic or procreative plane, occupy a position antagonistic to communities having goods in common. Taking it for granted that they do, leads us to an analysis of human society. Firstly, what are the primary atoms of human society? Secondly, what are the forces of these atoms? Thirdly, what are the products or results of these forces. Proceeding in this manner, we may arrive at some definite conclusion whether those on that plane are capable of forming themselves into such communities or not; for specific forces, have specific results. Man and woman are the primary atoms of society, and their most potent inherent force, is an affinity for each other, which induces them to unite and ' become one flesh. ' This force may be called the animal force ; for all animals in common with man and woman are its subjects. The product of the union of these atoms, is the Adamic community or family, composed of father, mother, and their children. When their clrldren, the off-shoots, are matured, they fly off to fulfill their destiny as their parents have dene. Here we see a force to form a community, and to disintegrate the same. And within every such community there is a force, repelling any coalescence, with every other such community. Hence family distinctiveness. And those families who are considered the most cultivated, exhibit the lines of distinctiveness the most vividly. The history of the Courts of Probate, indorse the fact of the existence and intensity of said forces, Having arrived at a knowledge of the forces which create the Adamic community, and limit its extent, we become possessed of a base of operations, to weigh and measure what they are able to do, and what they are not able to effect. The forces of the physical world are to some extent controlled, applied, and modified by man ; but he cannot change them essentially; whatever form they may assume under his hand, they continue to bear a strict relation to their primary forces. So man and woman on the Adamic plane, can be educated and developed under favorable conditions, till a very great change (in the common acceptation of the term) has been effected. But on examination, they remain essentially the same, and bear a true and strict relation to the forces of their being, on the plane they occupy. And any attempt of the subjects of said plane, to raise themselves out of and beyond the power of the forces thereof, by the aid of said forces, must prove a nullity. Hence the formation of communities embracing a number of families recognizing the forces alluded to, whether on philosophic or devotional premises, have all died out, or merely linger along. And it is worthy of note, that the philosophic have flashed and flared, and gone out in the greater darkness ; and so long as the primal forces already indicated, remain intact, the same results will attend any attempt to work antagonistically to them. Taking it for granted that we have disposed of the Adamic or procreative plane, and deem its subjects incapable of forming communities in your and my acceptance of the term; what is to be done with them ? Under the action of their own forces they are dissatisfied, uneasy, and in trouble, and often confused. And all attempts heretofore to help them out of the sphere of their troubles, by the forces which formed their sphere, has only made the confusion somewhat confounded. On looking over the history of the past, occasionally we find a mind that has discovered a force, that existed in the arrangement of created things, unknown till that mind revealed it. Newton discovered the force that binds the universe, gives law to the velocities and limits the spheres of the planets. Watt applied the force of steam ; Galvino, the galvanic force. And so of others who have been focal points of physical knowledge. Having seen that there are forces in the material world, once hid, but now revealed and applied to us; may there not be some force in the human world uot yet discovered. In the material world the forces are material. In the human world the forces are material, mental, and spiritual; these are the magazines of human force. In the human world, the animal or material force predominates, the mental is its servant, and what little there is of the spiritual incorporated, hardly amounts to an acknowledgement of its existence. Hence the kingdoms of the human world, ' are the kingdoms of the Beast' because they operate physically, or after the manner of the beast. Seeing that there is not a kingdom (recognized as such) an earthly, where the spiritual force predominates, and has taken the mental and subdued the animal ; and brought forth an order of society, with law, order, and government; and a civilization corresponding thereto. Perhaps, we may find a single individual, who may have focalized in himself such a kingdom. On looking over the past, we find one individual who states that his kingdom is not of this world, and as a proof that it is not, he farther states, 'that his subjects will not fight' and 'that the world receiveth him not.' Here are encouraging indications. But what are the forces by which this Nazarene purposes to create and vitalize his kingdom. He says 'those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven ; the same is my mother, sister and brother. ' Here is a new relationship. His Father is in heaven�in a heavenly sphere; and those who do the will of his Father� whose every word and act, are in harmony with the Father, are also of that sphere�the sphere of love. And he who is the least in that sphere, is greater, than the greatest born of woman. Here we see that love to God is the vitalizing element or force, and love to those brought forth by that force, creates a community or the Christ family. And wherever such a commuuity exists, it may be called Christian socialism. It will not be of the world, for its government will not stand in physical power, nor operate after the manner ol the kingdom of the beast. The germ of the Adamic community, is extremely limited in its unfoldings. The germ, love to God, in its unfolding, can embrace all the people, of all worlds ; and the voice of that unfolding, is ever, 'whomsoever will let him come' and inherit all things, temporal, mental and spiritual. Under the influence of this power�love to God ; there is no need to manufacture a community having goods in common ; it springs up of itself, and is the result of the internal forces of the new relationship. Again the Nazarene says ' Come learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and you will find rest to your souls.' But if you will learn of me, you must bear your cross daily ; against what ? against your own life�your natural loves and desires. And 'he who seeks to save it, will lose it.' 'And he who loves father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. ' Or in other words, he who does not hate the affinities, the loves and desires that bring forth the father and the mother, the wife, and the child ; cannot love the affinities that bring forth the universal sister, and brotherhood of Christ. Again he says, ' ye cannot serve two masters ;' neither will it do, to patch up the old with a piece of the new, 'it maketh the rent worse.' Here we see focalized in Christ,� First. A force to create an universal sister and brotherhood. Second. A force to destroy the organizing forces of the Adamic relationship. And wherever two or three are gathered together in the power of these forces, there will be the law, and the government, and an ultimate civilization ;�that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered the heart of the Adamic man or woman to conceive of it. Such is an outline of some of my views in relation to Communities. I hope they will be acceptable to you. At all events accept them as a token of my esteem.
