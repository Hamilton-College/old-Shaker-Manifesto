TO LESSING'S NATHAN. FOR THE MANIFESTO. 11 The genuine ring has proiably been lost.'' / Nathan. The ring was never lost, no, Nathan, never! Deep rests the jewel in the human breast, And 'twill be born again to sparkle ever With purest joys of heart by heaven blest. No, Nathan, no, man's faith in God undying, Shall prosper still all human speech defying. In vain shall atheistic mind endeavor To pluck this treasur'd jewel from our hearts, To foster selfishness and curb forever The feeling, that a holier life imparts. But while we yearn for nobler things and higher Xo pow'r shall squench our soul's most sacred fire. In vain shall priests with thoughts sectarian teeming In pious frenzy strive to dim the light Of God eternal; vain the craftiest scheming, For reason still shall conquer in her might, And while the stars shall gleam above us nightly, The lasting light of life shall glimmer brightly. The ring was never lost, no, Nathan, never! Deep rests the jewel on the human breast And 'twill be born again to sparkle ever With purest joys of heart by heaven blest, No, Nathan, no, man's faith in God undying Shall prosper still all human speech defying.
