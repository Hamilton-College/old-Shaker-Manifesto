HOT WATER AS A. MEDICINE. In drinking hot water it should be tipped, and not drunk so fist as to distend the stomach and make it feel uncomfortable. From fifteen to thirty minutes may be consumed in drinking the hot water. A period of six months is generally required to wash out the liver and intestines thoroughly. Not more than half a pint of hot water should be drunk with the meals. To make the beverage palatable or to medicate it, aromatic spirits of ammonia, clover blossom, ginger, lemon juice, sage, salt or sulphate of magnesia are sometimes added. Where there is an intense thirst or dryness a pinch of chloride of calcium or of nitrate of potash may be added to allay the thirst and leave a moistened film over the parched and dry mucous surface. When there is diarrhoea, cinnamon, ginger and pepper may be boiled in hot water, and the quantity lessened. For constipation, a teaspooniul of sulphate of magnesia, or half teaspoonful of taraxacum, may be used in hot water. Inebriety has a deadly foe in the use of hot water. All thirst and dry mucous membrane disappear in a few days and a moist condition of the mucous membrane and skin takes place. The relaxing influence of the heat inside the alimentary canal relieves spasm and colic of the bowels, just as heat outside the abdomen relieves. Hot water dilutes the ropy secretions of the whole body, and renders them less adhesive and tenacious. It dissolves the abnormal crystalline substances that may be in the blood and urine. It washes out the stomach and leaves it fresh and clean for eating. It promotes elimination everywhere. As we are 75 per cent water, to keep from stagnation we need continual renewal. The universal use of hot beverages at meal time is based on a physiological necessity. If hot water in due quantities is taken between meals there will be but little use of taking water at meals. N.
