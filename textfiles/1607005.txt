WHAT SHALL I WRITE? LUCY S. BOWERS. What shall I write? It seems to-night There's not a thought to think; My brain is weird as if 'twere seared, I'm quite too dull to wink. My hand is dead as if 'twere lead Or some more heavy ore, Much I desire, but gift or hire Could prompt to do no more. Oh pressing thought! I know I ought In something to excel, Through effort strive to keep alive, And fill each moment well. Sweet happy sleep, your vigils keep When Sol his course has run, Not till the day has passed away Is all I wish for done. Pulsate 0 heart, to action start, Dream not in vagary, Deem noble thought in care outwrought, A worthy industry. Waste not thy life in listless strife, But something dare and do ; Perform some good well understood As only right for you. See, everywhere is toil and care, In insect, bird and flower, In breeze and brook, and silent nook, A ceaseless, active power. O golden years ! my spirit fears You flit away unseen, Without returns that merit earns, Full record white and clean. Bestir thy mind, in duty find A place for hands and feet; An insect home will have no drone To share the unearned sweet. Think not of crowns where grace abounds And recompenses great, In future days to bear in praiseï¿½ Rewards lie not in wait. Just as we do, is brought to view, Our glory or our shame, Whate'er our life, whate'er our strife, In character we claim. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
