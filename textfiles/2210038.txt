Phrenological Journal and Science of Health In the Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for September the favored readers of that veteran monthly will rind the customary variety of good things drawn from human life, some of which are especially striking and valuable. A running commentary on the four candidates for President, with their portraits, is given. Three distinguished criminals are contrasted. Physical Morals, a very acute and interesting analysis, will receive the attention of the reflective. There are two excellent articles on the application of practical mental science. Child Culture is more than usually rich. Every parent should read slowly 'Which was Eight?' and get a working idea as to the treatment of inquisitive children. An Infant's Reflections, too, contains more sober truth than its apparent humor. Science of Health department can be earnestly commended. It always has seasonable advice and help. Another admirable contribution to the Moral Education series graces the editorials, and many bits of things fill in the occasional spaces to a nicety. The Journal is published at $1.50 a year, 15 cents a number, and is offered six months 'on trial' for only 50 cents. Address Fowler &amp; Wells Co., 26 East Twenty-first street, Xew York.
