GOD'S PLANS. MARIA WITHAM. Let those who love God supremely, rejoice that they are counted worthy to suffer for his name's sake. Earth has no honors which can compare with those that come from God only. We may complain of the wickedness of the world at large, but this will not work a reformation. Can we make any efforts to increase the good, and counteract the evils, that now exist in society? There is a peace that God will bestow on those who do his will, and safely rest the result with Him; it brings us into communion with Him. Those who come the nearest to the divine standard will experience more of the divine favor, and will coincide with their Maker's will by a life of willing sacrifice. It is the faithful who eat of the hidden manna. Enfield, Conn.
