I BELIEVE. I believe in God the Father, Maker, helper, friend of all; In whose power creation standeth And whose life is all in all. I believe the great, good tidings, Life of God in man revealed; Glorious in the life of Jesus, By his cross proclaimed and sealed. I believe in man, my brother, Claiming sympathy and care, By whose need the Father pleadeth, Through whose love his love I share. I believe in simple duty, Sacred trust to mortals given, By whose steps o'er prostrate selfhood, We ascend from earth to heaven. I believe in God the Father I believe in man, his son, In the spirit of true service Whereby heaven on earth is won. An English hymn. I believe in thought expansive, That unto the pure belongs; Wisdom vast and beauty fadeless, Known to the angelic throngs. I believe in God�the Mother, Holy Fountain�Heart divine; In whose care our souls like lilies On the tide of truth may shine. I believe in cleansing waters, Where Parental power doth brood; In earth's yearning sons and daughters, Struggling up to angelhood. I believe in God�the Mother, In the daughter of Her grace; In the sparkling virgin day-star, And in dawn for all the race. Cecelia De Vere. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
