CHRISTIANITY AND EVOLUTION, AND THE DIFFERENCE. By Watson Andrews. IN considering the Christian and Evolution theories of the origin and destiny of the human race, and making due allowance for the allegorical habit of the early peoples in accounting for phenomena, there appears to be little difficulty in reconciling the two. The Biblical account declares that God made all things; the world, plants, animals and man. Evolution claims the same thing, only ascribing all to natural forces�as though natural forces were not God's will and desire. No tolerably enlightened Christian of to-day, entertains the idea that God constructed the physical universe as a mechanic constructs a watch or a factory; or that anything beyond the will and desire�inspiration of the laws of nature�of an Almighty and All-wise being is required to cause all things to be. Let us say then, once for all: man was made, produced, caused to be, in common with other animals; and hence necessarily endowed with the instincts, appetites, passions and desires 60 THE MANIFESTO. indispensable to animal life. Up to this point Christianity and Evolution agree. Here however there is a divergence ; but, seemingly only in the manner of expression. Christianity claiming the direct, and Evolution the indirect application, inspiration or in-breathing of Divine force or power in producing or evolving humanity. � The Christian ascribes man's double nature (of the possession of which we are all but too well aware) to a union of the animal and Divine having taken place by direct in-breathing, inspiration or obsession; while Evolution ascribes the difference between a 'gorilla and a gentleman,' to the indirect action of Divine power through natural laws. This difference is further shown to be one of mere words, when the facts of the history and present condition of the race is considered, since these answer the logical demands of both theories alike. 'Uniformity of results, proves uniformity of cause.' Given the human pair in the state of innocent inexperience described in the Mosaic account of creation, and the excesses, dissipations and consequent disorder of human society becomes what the theories of Christianity not only but the laws of cause and effect require. And given the most human-like of the lower animals, and admitting the epochal change in the workings of 'natural selection,' evolving human reason, imagination and invention, as Evolution claims; and is not the successes, excesses, grandeur and demoralization of the world of to-day, the logical outcome? Hence it would seem a matter of indifference which theory we accept, since the results are shown to be the same, to wit, the peopling the world by natural generation. But in peopling, generation has pauperized the world. Morally the whole world, pecuniarily the larger share; this, although in the nature of things unavoidable, is not well. However, it seems the world was to be peopled, if peopled at all, in accordance with the laws of nature through the instrumentality of man and woman, and to result in a civilization susceptable to Christianity; hence the private family with its exclusive loves and interests become unavoidable. And govern a world with exclusiveness of loves and interests, the competitive system, and strife andcontention, bloated wealth, squalid poverty, crime, war and blood-shed, become unavoidable. It follows, whether we accept the Mosaic or Darwinian cosmogany, the natural or artificial theory of the world; we are alike confronted by the same inextricable dilemma, to wit, the necessity for peopling our planet, necessitates the depravity of its people. This being admitted�and there seems no way of escaping the conclusion�there can be, at bottom, no essential difference between the requirements of Christianity and Evolution, or indeed any other theory that proposes to rescue the world from its evils; since generation, with its partial loves and divers lusts must cease, as a prerequisite, with all who are to be �rescued. In a word, the world must come to an end with all who would THE MANIFESTO. 61 cease to be worldlings and subject to the spirit of the world. All who would advance from the rudimental to the complete ; from the passing to the permanent; from the natural to the spiritual; from the animal human to the Divine human being; from the necessary self-care of the one to the equally necessary and spontaneous social care of the other, where self is merged in social, and partial, in universal love; must accept the new regimen, the second great epochal change�and this Evolution seems to have overlooked�where a second in-breathing or more properly, obsession takes place, changing the man's motives of action from generating a natural race, to re-generating the natural to a spiritual, or spirit race. This time the obsessing force is said to be visible, descending and abiding upon the man Jesus; thus constituting him the head of the New, as Adam is the head of the Old creation, or phase of man's existence. The first being endowed and properly empowered to set the example and transmit the element of generation to his followers ; resulting in a world of natural human life. The second being also endowed and adequately empowered to set the example and transmit the elements of regeneration to his followers ; resulting in a world of spiritual human life. The terms natural and spiritual are here employed, not as separate matters, but as compliments of each other, as the stalk and grain ; the stalk to perish when its usefulness is subserved, the grain to be transmuted to a higher phase of life.
