RESIGNATION. OLIVER C. HAMPTON. Resignation is a peaceful and quiet surrender of the spirit to the inevitable trials and sorrows of life. One of its indispensable elements is patience. We are so constructed that we can fight with our inevitable fate, and in the process pass from unreasonable impatience, to despair, from that to desperation and finally be forced to look toward the ghastly portals of suicide. On the other hand by our efforts at complete resignation we may disarm our trials and sorrows of a great part of their poignancy and sometimes even get released from their entire weight of affliction in this way. I was once placed under so severe a scene of suffering I scarcely knew how to bear it or what to do. It was suggested to my mind, (doubtless by some wiser and holier intelligence than myself,) that this was a good time to try what a spirit of resignation would d for me. In the words of the rapt poet, I was minded to try ' What consolation I might draw from hope ;�If not what resignation in despair. ' Under the inspiration of this good thought I sat down and composed the following Stanzas. In perfect resignation, Unto thy just and holy way, O God of my salvation,� Still help me travel day by day. Thy visible Anointed� In every thing I will obey, For this thou hast appointed, To be the only saving way. Grant me thy holy .spirit, All opposition to put down That peace I may inherit, And gain a bright, unfading crown. My journey is to Heaven, Tho' wicked spirits should assail The pow'r of God is given� To stem the d:irk and stormy gale. While in the land of sorrow, I'll patiently pursue my way, Tho' grief 1 will not borrow, I'll calmly bear what conies to me. Celestial hope shall cheer me� � Until I reach that tranquil shore. Where grief shall come not near me. But peace be mine forever more.0 'tis a land of pleasure,� A land of everlasting rest, Where without weight or measure. Each weary spirit shall be blest; Then in true resignation, I'll steer to that delightful shore Where death makes no invasion,� Nor sorrow's dismal thunders roar. I labored with all the power of my spirit to attain to a state of complete resignation to this severe trial which was brought on me, as I felt, unjustly, and I realized in a short time the full influence of this good spirit and became so fully resigned that all my sorrow fled away and was followed by a 'peace which passelh understanding. ' 1 knew another experience precisely ]ike the one above narrated, and the agonies of which produced the following lines under a sincere effort to be wholly resigned. My soul approves the lovely way The gospel spirit shows, And as I prove it day by day� t The more the blessing grows ; 0 who could bear the gal.ing load* Accusing conscience brings, While on life's rough and weary Eeady The wicked feel her stings. Then how ungrateful I should be To murmur on the way, And disrcgaul the charity, My Elders show to me. 'Tis Order binds the carnal mind� And breaks the sullen will, ; Then to its counsels I'm resigned,. In patience to be still. The same happy results followed thi* effort on the part of the suffering brother, which was experienced in my oA\n case, viz. Peace, tranquillity and contentment of mind. No effort should be spared to shun all unnecessary sufferings both physiological and psychological, but when this has been faithfully done, and there still remains a residuum iu the crucible of affliction which cannot be parried by our best wisdom, resolution and forethought, it is wise and prudent to make a strong effort to pass into the realm of sweet resignation at once, and there remain in patience and prayer until we have become perfectly passive under the stroke of our affliction. The consolations of the Holy Spirit are sure to rise up in time as a u well of water springing up unto everlasting life. ' Bv this calm discipline the scathing fires of affliction are ..gradually assuaged and quenched by the waters of consolation until our spirits learn to conquer the whole ground and come to inherit the regions of invulnerable peace. And although as was foretold by the rapt prophet 'The fruit of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever ' yet tlie same inspired sage assures us. tfiat ''� lie that believeth shall not make haste. ' The chafed spirit is so impetuous under the agonies ot protracted trials and depressions, that it is often tempted to rebel and as it were, iu the words of Job's wife to almost ' curse God and die. ' But this is only a throe of undisciplined desperation, which would result in consequences infinitely more excruciating and unendurable. Patience and prayer will unfailingly furnish relief if only persevered iu. I do not want to be egotistic but as little episodes of experience are more interesting and to the point, with me, than any other mode of elucidation of a subject, I naturally infer they are to others, so 1 will give one more short one. Being once under very heavy tribulation something seemed to say to me ' You cannot mahe all your sacrifice at once and you are not required to. If vou were ascending a ladder and should let go with one hand before you had secured a hold with the other you would fall and ruin yourself. So you must wait and get what little good you can out of your present imperfections till you have time to secure your hold firmly on something better and higher. You need not sacrifice any faster than you can find something better to sacrifice for. Be more calm and less anxious.' By the time these suggestions and inspired counsels were closed. I was very peaceful and quiet and very much comforted and re-assured. So Dear Brethren and Sisters it being a time of the Church's experience and travel, where much waiting and great patience are especially in order, let us take hold of the gift and be daily, nightly, and hourly exercised therein and pray not only for ourselves but for each other, not only each other�but for our friends not of our order, not only for our friends but for our enemies everywhere, for all saints and particularly for all sinners. Let our prayers be the constant prelude to our acts of benevolence and charity to all souls in all worlds, that we may 'le perfect even as our Heavenly Father is perfect. ' And when our work is done here may we be gathered in peace to the summer land as ' n .shock of corn is gathered in his season. ' � Union Village, Ohio.
