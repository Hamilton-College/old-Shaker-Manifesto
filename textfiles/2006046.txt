Editor Manifesto;--Thirty years have passed since I was taken... CORONADO, SAN DlEGO Co.,CaL. Apr. 24, 1890. Editor Manifesto ;ï¿½Thirty years have passed since I was taken from my dearly loved home at Watervliet, N. Y. In all that time, 'mid all the world's experiences, that it has been my lot to pass through, Mother's Gospel has sustaiued me. In that time I have met a great many people and have always been proud to tell them what I knew of the loved Gospel Friends at home, that they were the best people on earth, living and obeying the precepts of Christ, and I know that if the people here could see and hear those precepts taught and lived ' there could be a very large and prosperous family established here. Already there are sever/al who have said that they would be glad to live such a life but they cannot travel so far as it is necessary for them to do now in order to reach a Community. I truly believe that the time has come, and that this is the place that Mother meant when she said; 'The next opening of the gospel will be in the south-west; it will be at a great distance; and there will be a great work of God.' I have faith to believe that this will come true. Your valuable 'editorial' in the April number gives me courage to write this and I hope to see the time when you w'll send missionaries into the world and they will have success and make many converts. Some few grains of seed have been sown here and if some good missionary could come the harvest would prove bountiful as the people now are in such a disturbed condition that they are ready to accept anything that gives a promise of the betterment of their spiritual condition.
