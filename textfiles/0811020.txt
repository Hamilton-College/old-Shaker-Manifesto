'Christ's Second Appearing' Ere we come to our readers, in this our Nov. No. there will have been held in N. Y. city a Convention of sincere souls, who are particularly interested in, and anxious for the coming of Christ the Second time. Led by very prominent ministers of various denominations, the Convention promises to be a very interesting occasion. We shall send delegates thereto, prominent among whom will be . the Elders of the North, Mt. Lebanon. To us, the Shakers, Christ has come already the second time, without sin unto salvation. We are variously experiencing the degrees of this salvation, inasmuch as this spirit of Christ manifests itself to and in our lives. We are anxious to experience more of this Second Advent power ; and anxious that others should do so. We are an invited guest to the Convention ; and if we can attend, will give to our readers in Dec. No. more information thereof, and its probable consequences.
