Who does not participate... Count Moltke the famous military strategist and commander-in-chief of the German army, lately sent the following reply to a Saxon workman, who had written suggesting a decrease of military burdens. ' Who does not participate in the heartfelt wish to see lightened the iheavy military burdens which Germany is obliged to bear, being, as she is, situated between powerful neighbors 1 The princes and the government share in the same wish, but this happy state of things cannot be hoped for until all nations acknowledge that every war, however successful, is a general calamity. Even our emperor is not able to bring about this desirable conviction, which can, in fact, only be produced by a better religious and moral education of the populations, and this is the work of centuries. Neither you nor I will live to see it.— Yours truly, H. V. Moltke.'—Christian (London) Herald.
