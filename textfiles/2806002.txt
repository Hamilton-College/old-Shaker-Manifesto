BETHESDA. By Cora C. Vinneo. Without the Holy City's ponderous gate, Lay bright Bethesda's sweet refreshing pool, Whose waters gusht from hidden fountains cool. , Beside its banks lay stricken ones whom fate Had made to suffer, there to watch and wait Till God's good Angel came, as was its rule, To bring the gift unknown to man or school, That would restore the sick and desolate. We all have sin and weakness and distress, That need the healing of the cleansing wave; That need the power of the Angel's touch. We all must pray for comfort and redress, Must seek the help that mighty is to save, We can not serve our Savior overmuch. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
