Hancock, Mass. Dear Editor: In our locality we are realizing the benefits of a good old fashioned winter. The earth is slumbering under a heavy covering of snow, and the ponds and reservoirs wear a coat of ice some eighteen inches in thickness, of which our Brethren have secured a good supply for future needs. We think the Knickerbocker Co. will not be necessitated to come to Berkshire for ice this season. In contemplating the changing events of time, these poetical lines occur to mind. 'As time rolls on new things we see Which seldom with us do agree; Its now and then a pleasant day 'Tis long a coming, soon away.' We find, however, exceptions to this, for we enjoyed a very pleasant Christmas and in our morning service realized that fulness of blessing, which Christ is ready to impart to the sincere seeker after righteousness. The New Year came to us with a beaming face, but our hearts had been made sad by the unexpected announcement of the death of a loved Father in Israel, Elder Giles. Who can estimate his worth or fill his vacant place? We mourn with those who mourn, and mingle our tears with those who weep. On the 8th. inst. a company of us were privileged to accept a kind invitation that had been tendered us by our Mount Lebanon friends of the First Order, to make them a visit. The day was beautiful, but cold and the cordial welcome we received, the hospitality, kindness and attention shown us by all,' was duly appreciated, and will ever be gratefully remembered. J. L. S.
