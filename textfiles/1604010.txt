TESTIMONY OF ABIGAIL COOK. I was born in Bridgewater, Mass. When I was about the age of sixteen, my father, Zechariah Watkins, moved with his family, to Patridgefield, now Peru. I was soon after married to Gamaliel Cook, who had moved with my father, from the same place. From my childhood 1 was often exercised in my mind about the salvation of my soul, which increased upon me as I grew1 older. After I was married I felt still greater trouble of mind ; though my husband was very kind to me, and my feelings were very much attached to him ; I soon found that he was exercised with deep concern of mind as well as myself. We had neither of us joined any church, but were continually seeking for something to satisfy our souls. In the fall of 1780, we heard of Mother'Ann and the people who followed her ; but did not in anywise believe they were of God. My feelings, more especially, were quite biased against them. The winter following, my husband's distress of mind became so great, that one day, while on his knees, in prayer to God to direct him in the right way, he aiddenly broke out in very loud acclamations, which were succeeded by a violent shaking of the body, at which I was greatly alarm id. He then testified that the people we had heard of, were the people of God, and that they were in the right way. This was a striking evidence to me; for I believed he was operated upon by the power of God. Soon after this, some who had embraced this new religion, came into Patridgefield, and we visited them, and found them to be very upright and godly in their conversation and deportment; and all their teaching agreed with the precepts of Christ and his apostles. My feelings of nature and the vanities of the world strove hard to stifle my conviction, and induce me to try, if possible, to turn some other way; for this way was excessively crossing to my vain hopes of carnal enjoyments, being then only in the eighteenth year of my age. But their testimony was too clear for me to withstand ; I could not gainsay that word of God which I heard from them. In short we both confessed our sins, and set out, once for all, to obey the testimony of the gospel. This was in Februaiy, 1781. About the beginning of March, we visited Mother Ann and the Elders at Watervliet. The love and kindness I there saw in them, both among themselves aud towards those who visited them, was truly beyond anything of the kind I ever saw before. Many people were there from different places, and their house was but small; but they accommodated all who came. In their THE words and actions they displayed pure godliness and innocence. They taught us to confess and forsake sin, to live uprightand pure and'to be honest and just in all things. They often reminded us that death, judgment and eternity were the certain lot of all; and exhorted us to live in such a manner that we could meet these in justification and peace. My husband continued strong in the faith until he departed this life, at Hancock, in 1788. Mother Ann was very modest and chaste in her deportment, and I have often heard her admonish young women to be modest. I visited Mother and the Elders often at different places�at Ashh'eld, Harvard, Hancock, Mass., and New Lebanon, N. Y., and always found them very exemplary and godly iu all things. As I increased in the knowledge and understanding of the things of God, they appeared to me more and more like Christ, which gave me full assurance that I should be saved, if I would be faithful to take up my cross and forsake all sin ; for sin is the separating line between God and the soul. Mother was always faithful to teach prudence and economy, as well as all o her virtues. ' The blessing of God, should not be lost. ' They always seemed to receive their food, as well as all other things, with great thankfulness, and taught us the same. 'For'' said they 'you cannot make one spear of grass nor one kernel of grain grow without the blessing of God. ' They taught us to love one another. Mother would say to those that were married, 'You ought to love one another in the Lord. ' To the man, ' Be kind to your wife ;'� and to the woman, 'Be subject, and obey your husband in the Lord : it is according to the doctrine of the apostles. ' She taught children to obey their parents ; and parents to teach their children godliness, and bring them up in the fear of the Lord. Mother was faithful in teaching, counselling and instructing in every virtue, of which she was herself a perfect pattern. I never saw the least failing in her. I know of a certainty, that in all things, Mother walked very circumspectly. Her testimony is truly that which leads souls to God. This I know because I have proved it by more than forty years experience. She testitied to us that, if we were faithful, her spirit would remain witli us ; and so it has proved. I have felt the same spirit in every succeeding ministration in the Church down to this day. I have also been a witness to the same testimony and example, and can freely testify to what I have heard, seen and felt. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
