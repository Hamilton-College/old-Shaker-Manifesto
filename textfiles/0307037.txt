HOUR OF PRAYER Listen from the higher spheres, Angels whisper ' we are near ; We've come to raise your souls from earth, To taste the joys of greater worth, In this the hour of prayer.' Come, leave awhile all toil and care, With God commune who heareth prayer ; For He who doth the ravens feed, All humble souls will bless indeed, While they bow low in prayer. We hail your influence, angels bright, While looking to the Source of light, It gives us courage by the way, To constant watch, and hourly pray ; To keep the gift of prayer. 'Tis prayer that keeps the soul from sin, And makes it light and pure within; Then let us watch and pray forever, Ceasing not from strong endeavor, In this, the hour of prayer. What consolation prayer imparts, How sweet the peace that fills our hearts, When we can meet in that pure love, Which blends the angel hosts above: Thrice blessed hour of prayer ! O righteous Father, may we be Forever clothed with purity : Only the pure thy glory see, Dwell in thy light continually, And seek the hour of prayer. Lucy A. Hasking, Mt. Lebanon
