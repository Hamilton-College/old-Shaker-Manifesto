WHAT THE SHAKERS D0 BELIEVE ELIZABETH A. KIDD It has been asserted, that the Shakers do not believe in the efficacy of Jesus' blood— shed upon Calvary. This is very true, as far as it pertains to the washing away of the sins of any soul. But we do believe, that by an honest confession of sin, in the presence of living witnesses (who have by confession and repentance been made worthy to be such), forgiveness can be, and is found. Confession of sin, and a repentance which means to ' go and sin no more,' are the provisions that under the Shaker gospel are ' the power of God unto salvation from sin.' We believe Jesus ' worked out ' His salvation ; and as He did this, so must we. We believe He was born with the same nature which we possess — inclined to estrangment from God, but he took up His cross against His lustful, fleshly nature, and overcame all temptations to be less than a Christian. Doing thus, He was the first to be baptized with the unction of the Christ— became the first Christian, and a model for all Christians. The Shakers believe in rising above all relations belonging to the flesh, and entering into bonds of spiritual brotherhood and sisterhood. I am very young, both in years and in privilege among this people, but this is what I have been taught to believe ; and in this belief, accompanied by submission to its demands, I find salvation from sin every day.
