Shakers, N. Y. North Family. May, 1893. The unfolding of leaf and blossom and the reclothing of the destitute forms in the vegetable world with fresh and unsoiled garments, while beautiful to view and inspiring to contemplate, reminds us that now is the acceptable time in which the good seed should be sown and cared for if a harvest of those fruits which bring joy to the reaper is to be expected. Action is at present the watchword on farm and garden, and the toilers are up early preparing the soil for the reception of the seed. The prospect for fruit in this section is very poor; many peach trees are frozen. April, while giving us a week of tropical weather, was devoid of those 'April showers which bring May flowers' and at present writing we are greatly in need of rain. We peruse with pleasure the Home Notes and have in mind some that we should be glad to see occasional communications from in that department. The Manifesto is our interest, and prayer is sent forth that it may prosper, and may the spirit of the Comforter be with those who are directing its ministrations. Hamilton DeGraw.
