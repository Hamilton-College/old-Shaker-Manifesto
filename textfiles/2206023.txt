West Pittsfield, Mass. May, 1892. Deab Editob;The wise man tells us in the good book, that 'to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the Heavens.' We find that the rapidly revolving wheels of time have again brought round the season for collecting 'Home Notes' and if we do not make haste we shall be as far in the rear as the present spring season. 'Smiling May seems not to come this way,' tkough we find her name registered on the calendar. April appears to hold dominion yet, and through smiles and tears is slowly covering the earth with verdure. Have to-day for the first time, turned a portion of our stock to pasture. A few events have transpired since our last writing. On the 24th ult. Sunday, P. M. a company of tramps while strolling over our fields, either accidentally or purposely set fire to the dead grass which rapidly spread, burning over some ten acres but was happily arrested before it reached the woods or did serious damage. A few days prior to this, Br. Thomas Farish of the East family, owing to the breaking of the harness, was thrown from a carriage and badly injured, but is fast recovering. Notwithstanding this an$ other afflictions the enterprising members constituting that family are not disheartened, but are alive and active. Are remodelling their dwelling house somewhat, by dispensing with the old windows in a portion of the house and replacing them with large plate glass windows adding bathrooms and other modern improvements. House-cleaning painting and some small repairing is in progress and dirt ought to feel that it is a nuisance. Our dear Sister Maria Donne took her departure from earth very suddenly and unexpectedly. We miss her from the circle in which she has moved for nearly half a century, but we would not recall her to earth for she has suffered much physically, and is no doubt happy in the change and now rejoicing in her freedom from the pains of mortality.
