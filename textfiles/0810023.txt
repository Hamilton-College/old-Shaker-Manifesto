How to Treat Scandal What 'they say' is beneath your ziotice. What's the use of lying awake of nights with the unkind remark of some false friend running through your brain like forked lightning? What's the.use of getting into a worry and fret ovdr gossip that has been set afloat to your' disadvantage by some meddlesome busy-body who has more time than character. These things cannot possibly injure you, unless, you take notice of them, and in combating them you give them character and standing. If what is said about you is true, set yourself right at once; if it is false, let it go for what it will until it dies of inherent weakness.
