Selected Fault Finding In speaking of a person's faults Pray don't forget your own ; Remember, those with houses of glass Â¦ Should never throw a stone. If we have nothing else to do, Then talk of those who sin, 'Tis better we commence at home, And from that point begin. We have no right to judge a man, Until he's fairly tried; Should we not like his company, We know the world is wide. Some may have faults, and who has not? The old as well as young, Perhaps we may, for all we know, Have fifty to their one. I'll tell you of a better plan, And find it works full well; To try your own defects to cure, Ere other's faults you tell. And though I sometimes hope to be No worse than some I know, My own short-comings bid me let The faults of others go. THE SHAKER Now let us all, when we begin, To slander friend or foe, Think of the harm one word may do, To those we little know. Remember curses chicken-like, Sometimes to roost, come home. Don't speak of other's faults until You have none of your own. How to Treat Scandal What 'they say' is beneath your ziotice. What's the use of lying awake of nights with the unkind remark of some false friend running through your brain like forked lightning? What's the.use of getting into a worry and fret ovdr gossip that has been set afloat to your' disadvantage by some meddlesome busy-body who has more time than character. These things cannot possibly injure you, unless, you take notice of them, and in combating them you give them character and standing. If what is said about you is true, set yourself right at once; if it is false, let it go for what it will until it dies of inherent weakness.
