BAD PROPHECIES An almanac maker, who it must be admitted has prophesied correctly in several re- markable instances, says: '1879 will be a year of troubles. In February, Saturn and Mars will come in conjunction, stirring up trouble in Europe, Mexico and India. In March, many deeds of vengeance will be perpetrated in Russia, and on March 11 danger will lurk about Emperor William. A great church scandal will be developed in England. War and famine in China and India. Great discord between President Hayes and his people ; also with the Indians. In April, great religious agitations. In May, great adversity with railway securities. In June, war in Austria, Turkey and Greece. In America, cruel epidemic fever and cattle disease. Good fortune to the ADVOCATES OF WOMEN SUFFRAGE. In DECEMBER, Socialists of Europe will become a terror, and shake many dynasties.' This London astrologist has gained celebrity by coming within 24 hours of the earthquake at Cumana in which 4,000 lives were lost ; also of the Ashtabula railroad horror, and by the terrible sunstrokes of last July. We wish him good luck in better prophecies.
