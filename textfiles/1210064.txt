Select The first Watch. â€”At first the watch was about the size of a dessert plate. It had weights and was used as a 'pocket clock' The earliest known use of the modern name occurs in the record of 1552, which mentions that Edward vi, had 'one larum or watch of iron, the case being likewise of iron gilt. with two plummets of lead.'' The first watch may readily be supposed to have been of rude execution. The first great improvements, the substitution of springs for weights, was in 1560. The earliest springs were not coiled, but only straight pieces of steel. Early watches had only one hand, and being wound up twice a day they could not be expected to keep the time nearer than fifteen or twenty minutes in twelve hours. The dials were of silver and brass, the cases had no crystals, but opened at the back and front, and were four or five inches in diameter. A plain watch cost more than $1,500, and after one was ordered it took a year to make it.
