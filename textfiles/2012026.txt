NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Nov. 12. '�Time and tide wait fur no man' nor yet woman, :ind we have hardly time to write a passing note as they rush by. It seems but yesterday that the breezes of spring whitened the earth with scattered blossoms; and now the somber clouds are falling at our feet in feathery crystals. The blossom tells of coming fruit and says to the young, that 'if the tree bears no blossoms in spring, we may look in vain for autumn fruit.' A wise and happy truth is also evolved by eve^y matured leaf that flutters to the earth; for it leaves not its place on the tree, until it has assisted the growth of tiny buds at its feet, wherein is wrapped the entire growth for the next season. Our first snow in this locality, on the 11th and is hailed with as much ecstasy by happy childhood, as were the first signs of spring. Would that we could all take 'whatsoever the good God sends' with equal gratitude. The Indians and squirrels prognosticate a severe winter, but of this we shall know more in March. We hope not for a repetition of the insipid weather of last winter but cling in faith to the promise that 'while the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not cease.' By limiting its use to the greatest necessity our scanty supply of ice lasted until the middle of October, which spoke well for the patience and economy of the Sisterhood; for none but those experienced can tell of the weary steps saved by this household luxury. At 2 P. M. Oct. 19, a new and beautiful phenomenon was ours to behold. A gorgeous rainbow in the northeast. Its colors were so very bright, that the reflection seemed to be repeated to the horizon, making the entire north-east one splendid arch of rainbows. Amid such beautiful displays of the laws governing the works of the Almighty Creator, who can but with humble reverence declare with the Psalmist, 'The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork.' A. J. C. Center Family. Nov. 13, 1890. The Nov. number of Manifesto has much choice reading matter among which is Eld. Eobert Aitken's account of his visit to England. It is especially interesting; and that was a singular coincidence that those two Brethren, Elder John and himself, should start for the old country and meet on the same steamer without preconcerted action ; they had a real good time. I hope Elder John will favor us with his notes of travel. The History of the Church at Mt. Lebanon, by the Editor, has been very interesting and instructive, for which he has our sincere thanks. While we contemplate the coming cold season and expect to be more secluded from outside influences, we hope to gather the fruits of the spirit in our retired domiciles. Our fall work is well nigh finished ; never, that I know of, were we better prepared for the rude storms of winter than this season. I wish to send greetings to all my gospel kindred. The Christmas festival is close upon us, and I would say peace to him who is near and also to him who is afar ofF; let all Zion's children sing in their hearts the song of the angels, 'peace on earth, to man goodwill.' T. Kayson. UNTortli Family. 'Waves of light like ocean billows Break upon time's beaten shore Opening to our darkened vision Scenes that ne'er were viewed before. Shine, O glorious light of heaven! That all souls may bask therein, Bathe and wash and be forgiven By confession saved from sin.' Nov. 10. Christmas time is nearing, a very appropriate season to forgive and be forgiven. If the confession is full the forgiveness will be complete. Love will abound and our salvation be increased. I wish all my gospel friends a joyful Christmas and a Happy New Year. Our joy and happiness will depend very much on each individual effort. One sinner destroyeth much good that belongs to all; especially is this the case in our community relation. Have had two successive stormy Sabbaths, and we shall probably have no more Society meetings this season. We have had some signs of approaching winter, with its white wings on the mountain tops and frosts in the valleys. Soon 1890 will pass into history long to be remembered and talked about. We havs not accomplished all we set out to do; if any body has we shall rejoice. The blessings of the past season, notwithstanding some unfavorable weather, are abundant and ample to incite us to thankfulness, without even a proclamation from the President or Governor. Thankfulness is made manifest when a proper use is made of the good things with which we are blessed. A wasteful, self-indulgent spirit and practice always savors of ingratitude and leads to unholiness. The past season we have painted all our buildings, and are now engaged digging under our dwelling-house preparatory to setting in the new steam boilers to take the place of one that has been in use nearly thirty years and has not had one cent of repair expended upon it in all that time. At the same time we also expect to improve the sanitary condition of our house, by making it rat proof, and putting in iron pipes to take the place of the old stone and brick drains that have been a nuisance ever since we learned that we live by breathing and that the night air is not poisonous. Perhaps some young people do not know that even the doctor* of old taught that the night air was very injurious, so people would sleep in closed rooms to keep out the night air. Then when any one got sick the priests taught the people that it was sent of God, either as punishment or to make them more pious. But now, some of the coirmon people have found out that even foul drains are avenues through which disease enters and that the air out cf doors at night is full of health ; while the day air closed in a room becomes a deadly poison if people remain there long enough, whether they are saints or sinners. Houses inhabited by human, or other animals should as really breathe as does the house we live in, our bodies. Elder Frederic says, no one can be a perfect Christian unless he has good bread to eat, and much less, except he breathes pure air. It takes time for even religious people to learn to eat, drink and breathe to the honor and glory of God. In our farming operations, we have made some grievous blunders; one was, in not putting our ensilage cutter in perfect order when we got through using it last season. We thought it might run all right and and if it did not we could easily get the needed repairs ; but alas, we broke down,, wrote and then telegraphed, but it took twelve days before the repairs arrived, in the meantime the corn-cutting went on in the field, and some of it laid on the ground about three weeks before it reached the silo. We have commenced feeding it and the unanimous voice of the cows and herdsman is against such a manner of going. Let no one do likewise ; it is not good cattle gospel. Another blunder was, that we let too many weeds grow and mature their seed, and these will spring up in due time and condemn our heathenish manner of farming. Nothing should go to seed on the farm, or in the garden, except what is so designed. Using large quantities of fertilizers, and raising immense crops of weeds, is like having two openings in the grain bag; what is put in at one goes out at the other. It is only by constant watching and care of the little things or a big machine that it is kept in working order. One little nut or key getting lost will disable the whole concern. It is very easy to find excuses for the weeds growing, and for this, that and the other; but these often times only make matters worse. This laying to Providence and the weather what properly belongs to our carelessness and after thought, is hardly the thing. Let the truth stand, though it reveals all our crooked ways. In kindest love, D. Offurd. Soiitli Family. Dear Editor :�We do not care to be considered as gossips, but home notes are inspirational, that is why we chat in that corner so often. In spite of the rain, we have some fine days, and Elder William has taken between four and five hundred bushels of potatoes to Pittsfield, for which he gets a good price. He has secured from the rats, five hundred winter squashes and is now putting up some wire fencing, which is very much needed. We are still making and selling nice chairs and mats and will gladly fill all the orders we receive. Sister Olive has made a large quantity of butter this year for home use, and to sell. At the Second Family they make excellent cheese. Are we telling tale* out of school ? Our Sabbath service is now held at our Dwelling, knowing where 'two or three assemble in his name,' he will be in the midst to bless. In this age of reason and unbelief, a few of us are trying to live in peace and bridle the 'unruly members,' our tongues, and to practice daily Christianity, that we may not regret in the future. S. A. C. Enfield, Conn. Again as the seasons return, and the years fly, we are preparing for winter. Our fall work is nearly finished; another week as favorable as the past, will see the roots harvested, corn husked and fodder in the barn. Three hundred and fifty bushels of carrots, and five hundred bushels of sugar beets, should make happy cows and swell their fame when fed in some such daily rations to a. cow of one thousand lbs. weight for butter production. One feed clover hay at midday. Two bush, corn stalks cut fine by power. One half bushel of carrots or beets. Three quarts cob meal. Three quarts wheat bran. One quart cotton seed meal in two feeds. Please suggest improvement. T. Stroud. Since my last correspondence to the Manifesto have been from home, up in the Berkshire hills; received much benefit thereby, also the pleasure of Gospel interchange which is always profitable. The ministrations of love and kindness received, inspires the soul ever to pursue the strait and narrow way, where we may experience the wisdom and goodness and love of God. Our frail bodies are tottering habitations, every beat of the heart a rap at the door, to tell us of danger, and the wheels of time roll swiftly along. Though my flesh and my heart faileth, yet divine faithfulness and compassion fail not. M. Witham. Harvard, Mass. Nov. 1. 1890. Eain, rain, rain. For some time past the heavens have been pouring copious showers of rain upon us, making it almost impossible t.i do any fall ploughing or other outdoor work. But why complain or feel disheartened? The old negro said, 'more rain, more rest, Massa.' But ours must be, more, rain, more work and more weeds. Let us remember that it is a long lane that never has a turn. And so it is with rainy weather. After a long season of the disagreeable, and old Sol shines out again, how beautifully it feels. Almost like the touch of the electric battery, it nerves us again to start about our duties. Wood chopping has commenced and we are planning for one hundred and fiftythousand ft. of lumber to be drawn to the mill and sawed as required. It is the Sabbath and we have just returned from a beautiful meeting, filled with heavenly ministration. Our friends from the other side came to join in our devotion. This made the hour very pleasant, and it is of all hours the most precious to the good Believer. When we meet the dear ones who have passed beyond the vale, how sweet will be the meeting. A. B.
