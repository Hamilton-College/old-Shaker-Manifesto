Harvard, Mass. Nov. 1. 1890. Eain, rain, rain. For some time past the heavens have been pouring copious showers of rain upon us, making it almost impossible t.i do any fall ploughing or other outdoor work. But why complain or feel disheartened? The old negro said, 'more rain, more rest, Massa.' But ours must be, more, rain, more work and more weeds. Let us remember that it is a long lane that never has a turn. And so it is with rainy weather. After a long season of the disagreeable, and old Sol shines out again, how beautifully it feels. Almost like the touch of the electric battery, it nerves us again to start about our duties. Wood chopping has commenced and we are planning for one hundred and fiftythousand ft. of lumber to be drawn to the mill and sawed as required. It is the Sabbath and we have just returned from a beautiful meeting, filled with heavenly ministration. Our friends from the other side came to join in our devotion. This made the hour very pleasant, and it is of all hours the most precious to the good Believer. When we meet the dear ones who have passed beyond the vale, how sweet will be the meeting. A. B.
