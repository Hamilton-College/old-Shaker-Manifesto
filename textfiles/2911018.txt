THE REFINER'S FIRE. He sat by a furnace of seven-fold heat, As He watched by the precious ore, And closer He bent with a searching gaze As He heated it more and more. He knew He had ore that could stand the test, And He wanted the finest gold To mold as a crown for the King to wear, Set with gems of a price untold. So He laid our gold in the burning fire, Tho we fain would have said Him 'Nay' And He watched the dross that we had not seen, As it melted, and passed away. And the gold grew brighter, and yet more bright, But our eyes were so dim with tears, We saw but the firenot the Master's hand, And questioned with anxious fears. Yet our gold shone out with a richer glow As it mirrored a form above, That bent o'er the fire, tho unseen by us, With looks of ineffable love. Can we think that it pleases His loving heart, To cause us a moment's pain? Ah! no, but He saw thro' the present cross The bliss of eternal gain. So He waited there with a watchful eye, With a love that is strong and sure, And our gold did not suffer a whit more heat Than was needed to make it pure. Selected.
