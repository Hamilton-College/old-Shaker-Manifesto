PRAISE. By Annie R. Stephens. For the rich autumn days, the summer's rare treasures, That past like a glad spirit's flight; For the gift of our lives, their unfailing pleasures, We thank Thee, O Father of Light 1 An unending chain of mercies eternal From life's rosy dawn to its close, Has filled all our days with blessings supernal, While joy like a fountain o'erflows. We'll count the calm hours of sunlight and gladness, And walk where the hope-light appears, We'll banish the clouds of sorrow and sadness, And praise Thee through smiles and through tears. Then hear, Father, hear our songs of thanksgiving, Accept our sweet incense of praise; Our voices shall tell in the courts of the living, The worth of our fullness of days. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
