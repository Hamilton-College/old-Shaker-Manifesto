Reed. South Family. May, 1896. As this is a fine spring morning with a bright sky, bracing air and music of birds to be heard everywhere, we are induced to make you a brief call just to tell you about home. Eldress Sophia Copley of Enfield, Conn, and Sister Martha Johnson of Hancock, Mass., favored us with a flying visit one day. The home here is being improved by the removal of some old fences and the building of new ones; the orchards are being renovated, busy hands are trimming and grafting fruit trees; when you come this way, which we hope will be before long, you shall dine on the very best of fruits. Poultry culture is an important and profitable item in the domestic economy. The industrious chicks deposited over two hundred and fifty doz. eggs the past mo. These hens are not April fools. The dairy record for the last year records 3814 lbs. of the finest quality of butter in market. Br. Wm, Thrasher passed his one hundredth anniversary April 11. He enjoyed hearing some articles that were written for the occasion. He is well and happy. Genevieve DeGraw.
