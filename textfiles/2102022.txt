Groveland, N. Y. Jan. 9, 1891. Eight days of the last decade of the nineteenth century have passed; the only century we have personal experience with, and we wonder just now what the last ten of the coming one hundred years will bring to life and prove to man. Vast truths will be unfolded in the spiritual, physical, scientific and political worlds truths unseen and unheard-of by earth'i inhabitants of yesterday. The wonderful to-morrows! how fathomless, without center or circumference. The yesterdays were mighty, the to-days still mightier, the to-morrows will be the mightiest of all. Sunday, the 4th. inst., 'Memorial Services' were observed by the Society in honor of our departed Minister, Elder Giles B. Avery, whose beautiful life was feelingly recalled through the hymns and speaking, all expressive and in harmony with the occasion. We have read with interest the leading article in the recent Manifesto 'Woman's Mission,' by Eldress Anna White, and we wish every reader on this broad planet would read and study it with eyes and ears open: also 'Reminiscences,' by the earnest Earnest Pick was perused with equal gusto; while we were reading the spirit side of said article we earnestly wished that the venerable prophet Elder Frederick W. Evans would catch an inspiration to take the first train bound for Western New York, locating his headquarters at Sonyea, Livingston Co., N. Y. We are fully persuaded that great benefits might be derived in this town and surrounding country by a few lectures from the inspired evangelist, orator and preacher. The ice harvest is great, and ice the very best, while the laborers are many and engaged the whole day through securing the frozen mass which measures nine inches thick. For the blessing of ice we are thankful, For all other blessings also; Each day is a day of thanksgiving As journeying onward we go. G. D. G.
