My beloved and honored friend, Eldress Nancy E. Moore:--... [The following is published by request. Ed.] My Beloved and Honored Friend, Eldtcess Nancy E. Mooke :ï¿½I have often been desirous of writing to you. Surely many hours have elapsed since our former acquaintance. &gt;iot knowing how long it may please God to continue you here below I am willing to embrace this opportunity of writing to you, and letting you know a little of where I stand. Perhaps you know enough. It is sad to say and yet I feel it is true that the last avenue is closed. I have withdrawn myself from you, thinking that I could take pleasure in this unruly way of going, but alas ! I fear it is a deadly cost. Oh! that I only stood just as I did this time last season. But as it is 1 have roamed over hills and over vallies, and I am now on the top of the highest hill, doubting which path to choose and fearing I might land in the bottomless pit. I wish I could be as wise in my pleasures, as you are pleasantly wise. Your virtue is agreeable, your wisdom amiable, and your philosophy the highest luxury. I know, my dearest, that I have weighted your burden to any amount, but with sorrow and repentance I ask you, fervently, to forgive and forget the past, and with trusting heart look forward to the future for sunshine and happiness. But if ever I get so casehardened again, as I have been, I shall want to go to some far-off uninhabited island, where the earth shall be my bed, the sky my covering and the wild birds my company.
