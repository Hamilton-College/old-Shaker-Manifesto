ARDENT SPIRITS. We use spirits in tinctures and syrups when we think it necessary, and in no other case whatever unless we think in our best judgment that the stimulus of ardent spirits is indispensable. We find that medicine administered without spirits is far more efficacious than when given in combination with it, in the majority of stomach complaints. In cases where alkalies such as soda or salts of tartar are indicated we add them to syrups, which preserves them from souring without the addition of spirits. No definite rule can be given ; but it is our firm purpose and intention never to let Old Alcohol creep into the church under the cloak of medicine. Sept. 15, 1828. Eliab Harlow, } ri. Garret K. Lawrence, physicians. [At the above early date the temperance cause found able advocates in the good physicians. The position they occupied was in advance of the people generally, whether members or not members of the Society ; and the same care has been maintained to the present date. Ed.]
