MEMORIAL SERVICES. ELDER DANIEL BOLER. Held Nov. 15, 1892. Our beloved gospel father passed to spirit life Friday morning at six o'clock the 13th gf November, in the �9th year of his age. He was born in South Union, Logan Co., Ky., May 7, 1804 and came to Mt. Lebanon, when only ten years of age. Since grown to manhood he has filled many places of care and trust, in the Society of Believers where he early found his home. For the last thirty years he has officiated as senior Elder in the order of Ministry and was a spiritual director of all the Societies of Believers. On Sunday afternoon of the 15th inst. at two o'clock, the funeral services were held in the Mt. Lebanon, meeting-house. A large assemblage of Believers was present, not only from the parent Society, but representatives from seven of the eastern Communities, whose presence and assistance greatly added to the interest of the services. The Mt. Lebanon Ministry with whom Elder Daniel Boler had been associated, until within a few months of his demise, came from Watervliet, N. Y., to participate in the last duties conferred upon our beloved father in Israel. Though age and infirmity had somewhat weakened the stalwart frame and dimmed the bright intellect; yet before the vision of all, rose the great soul, 'so true in word and tried in deed,' the lustre of whose character time could not dim, neither could age warp the dignity and grace of unblemished manhood. In the realization of his benign and glorified presence there came from the hearts and lips of his noble sons and daughters whom he had counseled and guided in wisdom through all the years of his ministration, words of truthful eulogy. Elder Joseph Holden addressed the audience with appropriate remarks relative to the last tribute and duties to be paid to the deceased, and then said :�'I kindly welcome our gospel friends who have come from the several Communities, to bear us company on this peculiar occasion. I am impressed with the great love and gratitude which are for the blessing of association with upright souls who are faithfully bearing the cross and walking the straight way of self-denial in humility of spirit. I have ever felt the divine unction that rested upon our beloved gospel father, which enabled him to be a minister of good gifts to souls, and it is my desire that the same gift may still rest upon our Zion. I pray that I may be clothed with the same spirit of anointing. With a heart full of welcome for all we shall wish for the freedom of the spirit to rest upon every speaker.' How true these words,� 'Did we not witness in the life of tliee, Immortal prophecy? [steps trod And feel when with tliee that thy footAn everlasting road ? '' An appropriate hymn was then rendered by the singers, entitled the 'Harvest Reward.' 'Hushed are the strivings of nature, Calm and serene the new day; A loved one has crossed the dark river, Borne from earth's sorrows away. THE MANIFESTO. Strong as the oak in its planting, Vernal in spring-tide of youth, So was thy shadow of blessing, Broad and expansive in truth. Eighteousness throned in thy temple, Filled it with glory and grace, Led thee in strait paths of duty; Honored thy calling and place. Zion, thy interest and treasure, Brings a love offering, free; And with a sweet song of welcome, Angels are waiting for thee. Chorus. Peace tinto thee sainted spirit, Rest in the joy of the Lord, Worthy the crown of thy merit, Eich thy harvest reward.' Eldress Harriet Bullard who has been a member, for several years of the order of Ministry, in company with Elder Daniel Boler, made a few remarks. She dwelt upon the great interest that Elder Daniel felt in sustaining the cause, and his anxiety that Believers should keep a separation from the world and build upon the sure foundation laid in Zion. 'Our gospel father possessed a gift of wisdom and was eminently just: he always spoke the truth in plainness and could meet and adjust difficulties with calmness of spirit, because he had carefully subdued his own spirit. He never swerved from principle to meet individual favor ; but gospel order was yea and amen, and though often, seemingly, stern in correction, he bore with him the fatherly spirit, and a desire not to hurt 'the oil and the wine' in any individual.' Eldress Augusta Stone, the companion of Eldress Harriet, said, 'I have lived from infancy in the Church family at Mt. Lebanon, and have known our good father more than forty years. Integrity and uprightness were marked features in his life, while the spirit of consecration was characteristic in all that claimed his attention. Elder Daniel had a correct idea of equality. He did not want any indulgence or extra attention, in the supplying of his physical needs, because of his age or position. We have, dear Brethren and Sisters, left for us the bright example of a true Christian character.' The hymn entitled, 'Happy Change' was then sung. How happy the immortal mind That rests beneath Jehovah's wings, Who sweet employment there can find, Without the help of earthly things. When such shall lay their bodies by, And from their manual labor cease, They'll find a band of angels nigh, To guard them safe to realms of peace. 0 may I know and prize my day, My span of time, how swift it rolls! 1 soon must leave this mortal clay, And then explore the land of souls. Elder Calvin Gr. Reed, of Mt. Lebanon then spoke, '1 have shared an intimate acquaintance with beloved Elder Daniel Boler, for more than sixty years and always found him strong and unwavering in the gospel cause, as is expressed in the verse, 'Strong as the oak in its planting, Vernal in spring-tide of youth, So was thy shadow of blessing Broad and expansive in truth.' 'The breadth of his love and sympathies was not measured by an earthly standard : his interest was universal for Believers and he prized his union and relation to true Brethren and Sisters everywhere. His gift of blessing was broad and expansive, for he 28 THE MANIFESTO. 29 lived only to do good and to plant in the souls of others, a love for truth and righteousness. Elder Timothy Rayson, of M8. Lebanon, read a poem that was written for the occasion, by Sister Amelia J. Calver. He supplemented this with a few remarks relative to the long life of usefulness that was crowned with glory and honor. He has left a record and example that we all may emulate, reaching, through faithfulness, the same glorious victory and blessed reward.' We felt while we were singing the simple song, 'While all of Mother's children meet within her mansions fair,' that the heavenly hosts drew near and many of the ancients of the city joined in the sweet music. The song was so full and strong that the whole house was filled. Elder Frederick W. Evans, of Mt. Lebanon, made affectionate reference to beloved Elder Daniel, and then said, �'I want to thank our good Brother, James Little, for his very kind care of Elder Daniel, during his term of sickness. Br. James is a young Believer, and has entered the Community in advanced years, but he well merits the love and blessing and appreciation of all the Brethren and Sisters for his faithfulness.' Elder Frederick then referred to some of his own experience as a reformer, and contrasted the difference between the present and past; said he, 'I brought gold and silver into the Community, which were the truths pertaining to physiology and hygiene. When the Societies were organized, the people brought with them all the habits of the old Egyptian state, and they had not the light nor the power to change. The first cycle did its work in laying the foundation of the kingdom of heaven, and I hope that in the next cycle of progress, we may see great advancement.' 'I have an affectionate regard for our beloved Elder Daniel. He always exercised a very kindly interest toward me, and was always charitable and consistent, even though we might not always be able to see eye to eye on all subjects that were under discussion.' We were glad to have with us the saintly presence of our aged Brother, Elder Albert Battles of the Ministry of Hancock and Enfield, and to hear his sincere testimony of truth. His love and practice of righteousness found full accord with the life and teachings of our worthy father, with whom he had many years of acquaintance. He said, Elder Daniel's wisdom and judgment were known and valued and he prayed that all would adhere to gospel principles as Elder Daniel had done that we might be blessed and prospered. Elder John Whiteley, of the Ministry of Harvard and Shirley, Mass., then remarked,�'I know I can not do justice to my feelings on this occasion, though I have known Elder Daniel many years and always to love and revere him as a wise counselor; as a remarkably strong defender of righteousness and justice on all occasions where he was called to act. One whom it was safe to follow, but it is with great pleasure that I am able to be here and add my testimony of love and respect to the departed. I also am 30 THE MANIFESTO. happy to meet so many whom I believe have come with the same feeling. I am especially glad to see so many young people in the assembly and know from experience that they could not do better to secure happiness in time and eternity than to pattern after the lovely example set us by our departed father and friend, Elder Daniel Boler. I will make it my labor the few remaining days, months or years that may be allotted to me, and hope all present may feel it their duty and privilege to do the same. I have brought kindly greetings of love and sympathy from gospel relation at Harvard and Shirley, and hope all may receive them.' Elder John B. Vance of the Ministry of Alfred and Gloucester, Me., said :�'It gives me great pleasure to meet so many Believers though the occasion brings serious reflections. We mourn not as the world mourned when the ripened fruit was gathered, but �would rather sing the 'Harvest Reward.' ' 'In reflecting upon the character of our beloved father, the words of the Psalmist came to mind, 'Mark the perfect man and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.' I thought that King David had such a man in his mind as Elder Daniel, if one existed in that day. I suppose there were those at that time who lived up to their knowledge of the truth and in so living found justification. But with increasing light and knowledge the standard is lifted higher, bringing new duties, new crosses and a higher degree of perfection from the days of the Psalmist, to this day.' 'We hear much about reforms and progression but we may be assured every step in advance compelling us to leave something behind, brings its crosses. If we do not find this, but greater indulgences called for, that is retrogression.' He spoke of how much Elder Daniel was respected and loved in the Societies outside of his Mt. Lebanon home by those now living, and the saints gone on before, naming Elder Otis Sawyer, Elder Elijah Myrick and Elder Harvey L. Eads, whose voices, if we could hear them, would unite with ours in singing the praises of our beloved father. 'Who shall say a more perfect man ever lived ? ' Turning to the young people, he said 'You aie considering what your future lives shall be. Are you ambitious? What nobler ambition can be yours than to strive to become like Elder Daniel Holer? The aged are fast passing away and your duty is to prepare yourselves to take up their burdens. People who have no sympathy with our manner of living, seeing the aged passing away, and but few coming to take their places, wag their heads and say, 'The Shakers are running out and soon the places that knew them will know them no more ? ' I have heard this story for fifty years, but we still live. Truth is eternal and any person or people building upon that foundation can not fail.' Eldkk Abraham Perkins of Enfield, N. H., who bears the weight of eightyfive years with grace and dignity, added his testimony to the virtuous and noble manhood of him whom he claimed as a spiritual father, counselor and THE MANIFESTO. 31 friend. It had been his privilege to visit Mt. Lebanon many times, and each time lie hud received great good, his love, faith and hope, were strengthened and increased by intercourse with gospel kindred. He acknowledged the Christ Anointing that rested upon the ministerial order, and he hoped that the spiritual gift would sustain it. Elder Henry C. Blink, of Canterbury, N. H., remarked;� 'It is a great privilege to be invited to enter the house of the Lord, and on such an occasion as this, although embodying the sad remembrance of a final farewell to a dear friend and Elder; it becomes a privilege of the deepest interest. We have not met to mourn without hope, but rather in commemoration of a translation into a higher sphere of action, and to bear witness of the blessedness of the consecrated life of a good man and of one who was universally loved and respected.' 1'Elder Daniel has faithfully closed his labors on the earth, and has been blessed to live to a full fruition of days, before the final farewell. In harmony with the inspired writer we may well say, 'Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord, for from henceforth, they shall rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.' While this season is a witness of our love and affection for our beloved Elder Daniel, it is more directly for the benefit of those who are present, and are the active workers of to-day.' 'The great progress which has been made since the organization of our Communal homes should encourage us to move on with an increasing zeal. It is God's light that shines so beautifully, above and around us. Let us abide in this light and as we pass through the different degrees of religious experience, carefully preserve the gift of our union. If the increasing light opens before us new avenues and an order of life more in harmony with that light, let us receive the truth and step forward upon this new ground. We need not fear the increasing selfdenial, nor the power which brings to us the salvation of either soul or body.' 'If Mother Ann and the little company with her were able to hold fast the everlasting gospel of truth, amidst all the trials and persecutions, and physical deprivations, how much greater zeal and devoted interest should we manifest who are blessed with beautiful homes and the combined strength of so many faithful souls who form our Societies of to-day.' ' 'Upon the beloved Ministry who are present with us, we ask the blessing of God, and that more than the mantle of Elijah may fall upon them, to aid them in the ministration of blessing and love to all who have accepted the gospel testimony of Mother Ann.' Eldress Joanna J. Kaime of the Ministry of Canterbury and Enfield, N. H., united in the giving of love and remarked:� 'I heartily respond to the beautiful and truthful sentiments that have been expressed. Elder Daniel Boler was my ideal of a noble and true man. In the gift of spiritual ministration, in which he stood he was more than man, he was God-man ; the divine spirit was uppermost in ministering to those who felt the need of salvation from the sins 32 THE MANIFESTO. of the world and from the errors and imperfections of the natural man and woman. We have great cause of rejoicing in our union and spiritual relation.' Eldress Eliza A. Stratton said that Elder Daniel's life was a light to the Christian traveler; those who have been favored to know his life through daily association, sharing an appreciation of the same, never need stumble for the absence of an ever present light to their feet There are those present better acquainted with the good father than mtmy of us at Canterbury, yet the much good that we have gathered and cherished by his frequent visits will remain choice as a beacon light marking the way on our Christian journey. Elder George Wilccx of Enfield, Conn., said:�'1 feel deeply the importance of living up to that faith that has always proved a 'savor of life unto life.' Elder Daniel I'oler was a consecrated soul, full of the spirit of humility, lie never boasted of his gifts or merits, but was content to do the will of God and perform every duty assigned him with conscientiousness and in the interest of Zion. 1 pray that the same spirit may be over all of us and that we may love and bless our gospel relation.' Such sincerity, earnestness and loving expression coming from a truly honest soul, could but touch every heart. Elder Nicholas A. Brings, was the next speaker. 'It does not become me to say much on such an occasion, but I am reminded that the many left at home on the hills of Canterbury, and who would be much pleased to be here 13-day, would wish me to say for them : We loved Elder Daniel and we know he loved us. He has said that he did, and he was a man of truth, and besides he has proved it by very many labors in our behalf. May we not confidently hope that the spirit of our dear father, like that fabled bird of old, will rise and live again to bless our efforts, and help us in our times of great need?' 'As I look upon these hoary heads before me, these leaders in Zion, these fathers in Israel, and think that a few short years will see them all joined to Elder Daniel in his spirit home, I am led to inquire most anxiously how will their places be filled ? Who will assume their responsibilities and bear the heavy burdens so long and so nobly borne by them ? The solving- of this question is of immense importance to our Society to-day.' 'Another subject claims our attention,�the Union of Believers, than which none is more worthy of anxious consideration. Upon this hangs our destiny. Our Very existence as a people depends upon it. ]n the first place we must acknowledge Mt. Lebanon to be our Center of Union. In our Eastern homes we have been taught from early childhood to look here as to our spiritual Mecca, from whence flows gifts of blessing and gospel increase. This is right. May it continue is my earnest prayer, and to this end I will contribute strong, personal effort, and whatever influence I am able to command.' Eldek Hiram C. Baker of Enfield, N. H., remarked :�'I esteem it a priv- THE MANIFES TO. ilege at this time to meet my gospel kindred assembled to pay our respects, the last we can render, to Elder Daniel Boler, our dear father and friend, whose life has been faithfully given in Christian service for the salvation of s-oul* ' ' I o be numb, red with the righteous, so many devotedly engaged in th? support of Christianity, the most worthy of causes, is my happy privilege, and which I realize to be to me the grateest of blessings. With you, I pledge myself to be true to the cause in faithfully maintaining its principles as our father has done.' Elder Louis Basting of Hancock, Mass., said:�'It is not strange that I should feel somewhat diffident to address an audience like the one before me, when so many whose age and experience so far exceed mine, have preceded me. But I can say that every word spoken in praise of Elder Daniel's life and character has my full union and support. ' It has been my good fortune to meet our departed leader a number of times, and several interviews were deeply impressive. The words of solemn counsel and wisdom then received will abide with me while life and consciousness exist. I am glad to know that he is released from suffering, that he has been called home to rest from his labors and to enjoy the reward he has earned for himself. Surely it is well with him. I have no doubt that he has met Elder Giles, and others who were his fellow laborers here, in joy and glory. I think his reception to spirit life must have been somewhat like as England's great poet describes it,�a poet but recently passed away, whose verses belong to the whole world, because they speak to the human heart:' 'The great Intelligences fair That range above our mortal state, In circle round the blessed gate, lleceivedand gave him welcome there; And led him thro' the blissful climes, And showed him in the fountain fresh All knowledge that the sons of flesh Shall gather in the cycled times.' 'This implies not only a state of felicity, but also increased knowledge. We can not obtain all knowledge in this life ; much is hidden from mortal sight that will appear in the life to come. God in his infinite wisdom h:is placed us in this world for a wise purpose ; he has revealed himself through a Savior whose life and teachings ai\^ before us as an infallible guide to final and full redemption. Elder Daniel's influence for good has been felt in the remotest bounds of Zion. 1 feel assured that the gift of God has rested upon him as it has upon Mother Ann and her successors. And we are thankful that the Order of which he was the worthy head and leader, remains with us to-day. In no other way can we better honor his memory than by rendering a loving, loyal support to those upon whom the chief burden now rests.' Brother Ira R. Lawson spoke affectionately of the departed one and felt the necessity of adhering to gospel principles, and walking in the uprightness of our pure and holy faith. A new hymn entitled, 'Only Arisen' was sung in the unison of the spirit. (See page 54 of this Manifesto.) Eldress Anna White of Mt. Lebanon read, 'The Victor,' a sonnet, written expressly for the occasion by Sister Martha J. Anderson. 33 34 THE MANIFESTO. Like a brave knight in panoply of war, He laid his armor by with kingly grace, Life's battles he has fought, and run the race And nobly won the garter and the star. Bring laurels fair ye sons from near and far! Bring blossoms rare O daughters to this place, Ye see no more the Patriarch's sainted face With shining ones his soul has crossed the bar. O long, and tried and true his life has been, With justice he has wielded trusted power With righteousness has meted out her dower, And, guided by the perfect light within, Has wrought for good each passing day and hour, Has conquered self, and vanquished every sin. Eldress Caroline Helfricii, of the Ministry of Hancock and Enfield Conn, expressed her union with what had been said, and was thankful for the present manifestation of the spirit of God. Elder Andrew D. Barrett of Harvard, Mass, said;�'I feel the importance of all that has been spoken in the meeting. To assemble with the Brethren and Sisters at Mt. Lebanon, reminds me of the many privileges in years past. I am grateful for the instruction and guidance, of early years and for that planting of faith that has kept me safe under all trials and temp. tations, and I bless all who have ministered the gospel of salvation. Elder Daniel was to me a true father and friend and I have always loved and honored him. I now realize the presence of Elder Daniel and of others who have passed from our midst in years gone by. They still feel an interest in the welfare and prosperity of our Zi on home.' Eldress Harriet Bullard then spoke of Eldress Ann Taylor and of her extended labors in the Order of Ministry, and invited Eldress Ann to come forward and receive the love and blessing from the hands and hearts of her Brethren and Sisters. Eldress Arm came forward and there was a general expression, and a pleasant manifestation of love, from every one present. We could readily have voic d the words of the po?t;� Thrice blest whose lives are faithful prayers Whose loves in higher love endure; What souls possess themselves so pure, Or is there blessedness like theirs? The sunshine of our mother's sweet, gracious spirit gave a cheerful aspect for the moment to the occasion. She spoke beautifully of the good Brother whose joys and sorrows she had shared through the long years of official care and burden. She thought all had been said that could be, and that Elder Daniel must feel very happy. Thanking the Brethren and Sisters for th &gt; kind attention, she now hoped that while she lived, her life might still be lovingservice to the household of faith. We next sang; � 'Strong the ties that bind us to }7ou.' The beloved Ministry asked the blessing of the people to rest upon that Order, and manifested great humility of spirit and dependence on the gift of Clod. A heavy responsibility rested upon them to deal justly and to maintain the gospel in its purity. They asked to be ministers of truth and saving power to the people. Bit. Robekt Valentine of Mt. Lebanon remarked ;�'I have known beloved Elder Daniel for more than sixty years. He has been to me a counselor a guide and a Savior. He has helped me through the struggles and temptations of youth and young manhood and planted my feet firmly in the truth. I loved, honored and revered THE MANIFESTO. 35 him, and I hope to meet him when I pass over to the other shore.' Elder Bishop Pomekoy of Hancock although advanced in years and in feeble health, added a few choice words to the already full and glorious meed of praise. The assembly then knelt in silent prayer. Elder Joseph Holden again remarked;�'Doubtless there are others who would be pleased to speak, but as our meeting has continued two and one half hours, and as the day is closing, the Brethren must attend to the last duties, and the funeral services are closed.' We returned to our several homes with a feeling that a beautiful life which had borne the fulness of immortal fruit had gone from our midst, but the influence and overshadowing presence of a greater good remained to bless, strengthen and encourage us to go and act well our part in our respective spheres of duty;�all striving to build up the interests of our beautiful Zion.
