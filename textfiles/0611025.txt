SOCIETY RECORD North Union, O. North Union, Ohio. Anticipated development of stone quarry at this place looks like a steady source of income to Society. Grist mill, built in 1843, has failed for years to be more than a convenience, and sometimes only an expense, is now running by steam, and likely to be appreciated as one of the best in the country. Nearly 1,000 bushels of oats threshed. Early potatoes were a good crop ; late ones not so good — bugs, etc. Roots and garden products coming in well. This Society has 1,350 acres of land. A dairy herd at the centre family — forty cows — are unequaled in the State. For reasons, see cover, of what Ohio Farmer says.
