HAPPY MANSIONS. 'In my Father's house are many mansions .-*** I go to prepare a place for you.'1'1ï¿½John xiv., 2. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. To the bright and happy mansions in our Father's care, We are going, we are going gladly on, ..... Naught of evil may we carry to that Heav'nly home,Only virtues that our souls have won. Thro' this vale . . . dark and lone. . . . let us journey,With faith never falt'ring,led by truth and love,Pass the trials, brave the storms, with this goal in view, Our holy happy home above. dark and lone Thro' this vale gladly on,
