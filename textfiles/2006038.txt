A BIBLE STORY. One nice Sunday morning three of we little girls went to see sister Sally Ceeley who is eighty-three jears old and she told us this nice Bible story. In the city of Lazarus there lived a man by the same name who had two sisters named Martha and Mary. Mary left Martha to get dinner and do all the house-work while she spent,the time sitting at Jesus' feet visiting him. Martha didn't like to do all the work, no more than I should, so she spoke to Jesus about it and Jesus reproved Martha and told her that Mary had chosen that good part which should not be taken from her. This meant that it was better to stop and visit the Savior than it was to be so anxious about something to eat. Canterbury, N. H. 8 yrs. old. Lou Leonard.
