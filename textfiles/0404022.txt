OF SUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN Words, O, how full of meaning, uttered by lips so mild, revealing a pure undefiled heaven to man ! Not the heaven the haughty priesthood preach of, in fanes where the wealthy and fashionable meet one day in seven. Those devotees of fashion, may proudly kneel in cushioned pews — read from gilded books long liturgies—but, their practices are such, as tend to impoverish the nation, and foster crime. Their church steeples may point heavenward ; but, while their church communicants, are so fraught with avarice, and have so little righteousness that they will not feed the poor with bread ; God's Angels will not recognize them ; their heaven is too gross. God will not own a hireling priesthood who are pampered with every rare luxury,while the orphan, and widow, hardly obtain scanty fare. There is no such enslavement for the meek and lowly born, in the heavenly city, whose streets are paved with gold. Truth's grand fruition, that will bring to earth the heavenly prize, will be a baptism which will sweep away all priestly superstition, and establish brotherhood. If earth shall ever roses bear, Where thorns are wont to grow, The idlers must do their share Of labor here below. Come, come ye Angel forces, From your Eden realms above ; And dry up sin's foul sources, By the reign of Peace and love. From the upper spheres of Wisdom, Come spirits pure and bright, To herald in a kingdom, To bless the world with light. Bright vision, when we see thee come, All souls shall childlike be ; And earth shall be the happy home Of Christ's community. S. Crittenden, New Haven
