Editorial THE REVISED NEW TESTAMENT Through the enterprise and kindness of our friends, I. K. Funk &amp; Co.. 10 and 12 Dey street, New York, we have been favored with an early copy of the Revised New Testament. In it may be perceived many changes both verbal and syntactical. But for all the more good it will do toward leading men and women to live better, more like Him of whom it so ardently treats, we have our serious doubts. True, it leads us to know of the better rendering of Jesus' words ; as for instance, ' Take no thought,' etc., we have rendered, 'Be not over-anxious regarding the morrow,' etc. What we want is a revision of men's lives in accordance with what has been long known to be the very grandest life on record — the life of Jesus Christ. What we want is a revision of men's thoughts from the death of Jesus, and toward the life of Christ — two vastly different themes. Let the death of Jesus go; but let the life of Christ grow more universally among the people. Then, regardless of verbal and syntactical revisions of the good, old book, we will have living, walking, working revisions, in the newly-inspired disciples of the Lord, to-day. Away, then, with the dead letter, in the presence of the living spirit, working among the. people. Away with all forms that only hinder the flow of the spirit, and cause false hopes by improper renderings. The only hope for the people, in salvation from their sins, is in the life, not death of Jesus. And with that, revisions of New Testaments are comparatively worthless.
