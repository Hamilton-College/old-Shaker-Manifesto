MAKE SOMEBODY GLAD Rebecca R. Pierce. On life's rugged road, As we journey each day, Far, far more of sunshine Would brighten the way, If forgetful of self And our troubles we had The will, and would try To make other hearts glad. Though of the world's wealth, We've a little in store, And labor to keep Grim want from the door, With a hand that is kind, And a heart that is true, To make others glad There is much we may do. A. word kindly spoken, A smile or a tear, Though seeming but trifles, Full often may cheer. Each day to our lives Some pleasure t'would add, To be conscious that we Had made somebody glad. Those who sit in the darkness Of sorrow, so drear, Have need of a word Of solace and cheer. SHAKER MANIFESTO. 143 There are homes that are desolate, Hearts that are sadâ€” Do something for some one, Make somebody glad. West Chronicle
