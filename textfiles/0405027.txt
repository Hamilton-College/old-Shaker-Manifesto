CHRISTIAN LIBERTY Struggle yet, thou soul in bondage, Rend thy ties, and stand thou free; Find thy fair and bright ideal In true Christian liberty. On and upward ever pressing, To enjoy still purer loves; Holy independence gaining, Which the higher law approves. Holy independence gaining, O prolong the joyous sound, Until ev'ry clime and nation With its gladness shall resound ; Until ev'ry heart shall vibrate In this universal strain, Until hearts and voices (blended) Join in Zion's sweet refrain. Julia Johnson, Hancock, Mass.
