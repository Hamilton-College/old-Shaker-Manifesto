SPONGES Dr. Bowerbank, in his work on British sponges, describes nearly two hundred varieties, and many species have since been discovered. They are found presenting an endless diversity of size and outward configurationâ€”many of them small, others of immense size and of varied colors. Some of the most beautiful specimens secrete a silicious substance which takes very beautiful forms, but is easily broken, and crumbles when dry. One of the prettiest of these is called the Glass sponge, and another is called Venus Flower Basket. Sponges are found to bear the forms of fans, globes, branches of trees, funnels and trumpets. Others are divided into lobes, like great fingers, such as 'Neptune's Glove.' One variety produces regular sponge monuments, which grow from three inches to six and a half feet on the submarine rocks. They have a narrow stalk, which at a certain height expands and gives the structure the look of an immense drinking goblet. To such a colossal vase the imagination of the sailor could give but one name, that of 'Neptune's Cup.'
