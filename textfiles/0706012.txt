Place your Affections on Things Above ISABEL E. PATRICK I am persuaded to believe this is worthy of our sincere attention. Now, while we are young and active, and have the power to please ourselves, is the time for us to decide whether we will deny ourselves of little self-indulgences— momentary pleasures — to secure an interest in the kingdom of heaven. If we resolve to follow our own inclinations, which lead into sin, the pain of remorse, instead of unalloyed pleasure, will be our portion. Hence. it should be the object of our immediate concern to travel the self-denying path that leads to heaven. Jesus said, ' He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.' I believe we shall be heirs to true riches if we take up a daily cross against the multitude of evils which beset us to try our faith ; and which, perhaps, we should not so clearly comprehend, did we not often experience the bitter with the sweet. If we endure all light afflictions, to obtain a place with the righteous, we have the assurance of immortal gain ; a treasure superior to worldly honor, wealth, or fame. To make a willing surrender of our own desires, and conform to the requirements of the gospel, wisely calculated to save us from all impurity, is a work well worthy our highest aspirations anc earnest struggles.
