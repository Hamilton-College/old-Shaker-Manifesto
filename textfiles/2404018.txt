Pleasant Hill, Ky. Mar. 1894. Beloved Editor:�As I sit at the window this holy Sabbath morn watching the beautiful, falling snow, I find myself in Zion's vineyards, gathering fruits immortal! Your well-fraught little messenger The Manifesto, is anxiously looked for and eagerly perused each month. Now, I come to Canterbury and find you and co-laborers toiling to have it in readiness. I stop and wonder if I could cast a mite that would shed a faint ray of joy or encouragement to any of its thousands of readers. We may not be able to name all the planets nor to describe their swift motion, but we can endorse a life of consecration to God, by striving to aid each other in climbing the rugged hill of Hie. A word kindly spoken, a smile, or a small act of charity or mercy has started many a poor wanderer on the highway to true felicity, who otherwise might have sunk beneath a weight of sin and discouragement. When I look through the Manifesto and find nothing in it from Pleasant Hill, an indescribable feeli#ig steals over me. Yet it seems that little more can be said; but I think it strengthens our union, and removes clouds of discouragement, making us feel more like one great household of faith. We have had one of the mildest winters since my earliest recollection. We had ice about two and one half inches thick, hence, empty ice houses. The snow now falling has covered up the green grass. We have had but little snow. On the 12th inst. we had a frightful wind storm tearing down fences^ boughs from the trees, breaking panes of glass, and taking a portion of the tin roofing from the brick Office. Some were badly frightened but no damage was done. We feel thankful for our preservation, and sorrow for those who have been less fortunate. We have warm, comfortable homes; bountiful supplies of food and raiment; and as a certain poet said; 'We have all we can ask or need to make us truly good.'�But O! that monster! Selfishness! that terrible foe to human progress; may it be crushed from our domains forever! The Believers in Kentucky generally observe the twenty-second of Feb. in memory of Washington's birthday.
