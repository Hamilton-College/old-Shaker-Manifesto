MORNING THOUGHT. HANNAH E. WILSON. What is life?- -'Tis worth so little If the earth we only see; In this sphere our days are numbered, ' Over there, ' no end shall be. Let us daily work with patience, Wisely choose the seeds we sow; That the harvest may be joyous Of our sowing here below. For we all are passing onward, Sure not of another day ; Let us well perform our mission While in earthly life we stay. Canterbury, N. H.
