FORGIVENESS. 'For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.' Matt, w., 14. The one word that cancels the despair of the world is forgiveness,� Heaven's forgiveness of earth. Blot out this word, and all hope of men is dead. All other mercy, all other grace avail nothing if forgiveness is denied. A vast volume of guilt and penalty hangs over our entire humanity which this word forgiveness alone has power to lift. God's forgiveness is real and full; legal, moral and complete. The pardoned one suffers nothing in Heaven's estimation because of previous offences. The sinner is to the divine Fa- ther as though he had not sinned. There is no trace of offensive remembrance left in the mind of the forgiving God. There is no bitter recurrence of the Divine thought to all the past, though the past be crimson with rankest guilt. There is no latent, lurking repugnance in the Infinite heart which circumstances may at any moment arouse into open and pronounced hostility. There is no concealed contingency in our Lord's forgiveness. The pardoned one may approach the Great Father's face with no painful fear that the recollection of his previous offence has preceded Mm. 'I will forgive, but I cannot forget,' is not Heaven's rule. The pardoned offence is expunged from the memory of God by eternal love. So does holy heaven forgive ; but what of sinful earth? This is the Lord's way of pardon ; what is man's ? Thus does the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit forgive us ; how do we forgive one another? To forgive after the manner that God forgives, is a superlative Christian virtue. It is'better evidence of a pure heart than ecstatic emotion, impetuous zeal, high pretension, apparent consecration or sanctification. Such forgiveness�frank, full, heartfelt and abiding, is the first-fruit and the highest proof of genuine soulcleansing. True Christian forgiveness is an actual burial of all unkind remembrance of the fault or sin committed, so that the offender is to us as though he had not offended. Napoleon said to an offending Marshal, who fell at the great captain's feet, 'I forgive you, Marshal, but nevermore be officer of mine.' But Napoleon and Christ are quite unlike. To the offending, profane, false, but repentant Peter, Jesus said, 'Feed my sheep.' Resume thy apostleship. It is all forgotten, Peter, 'Feed my lambs.' Be to my church and the world the great ambassador I meant thee to be when I called thee from thy fisher's nets. The chief purpose of my gospel is forgiveness. Go preach it, Peter ; and let my ready, free, full remission of thy weakness and sin make me dearer to thee, and thee dearer to me. Brethren, we are waiting for the opening splendors of a kingdom into which no breath, no taint of malice, envy, jealousy, or the least motion of evil feeling can be admitted. Do we not need, must we not have as a people, a general and sweeping forgiveness 'one of another' before we enter the holy land? Must not these many and bitter animosities, that have riven this people asunder into clans and cliques, and ostracized sincere and accepted children and servants of the forgiving Christ, be washed out clean by the love of God before we can join the great Anthem of the redeemed. 'If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?' 'He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until nowV This strong language comes from the lips of the mild, loving apostle, and is consonant with that other saying of John, '-And every man that hath this hope in him pnrgeth himself, even as he is pure.' And this purification includes the entire eradication of aevery root of bitterness' every root; so that no germ of evil feeling remains. 'Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which ye are also called in one body ; and be ye thankful.' Selected.
