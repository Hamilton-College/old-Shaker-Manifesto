KIND WORDS. Elder Henry, Beloved Br.--In a late correspondence.. South Union, Ky., Mar. 1891. Elder Henry, Beloved Bit.ï¿½In a late correspondence with our good mother, Eidress Adaline Wells, in speaking of the government of the tongue, she remarked, 'If one man conquers a thousand times, a thousand men, and another conquers himself, the last is the greater conqueror and has achieved the greater victory.' 'Greater than the titled hero, Is he, who himself controls.' We like the Manifesto and hope it may survive and prosper through all the perils which our standard-bearer may pass. Our faith is unshaken that God was and is the great Master builder, and that a structure thus reared, can safely ride over each storm that may come against it. Your Sister, Jane Cowan. Friend Ira:--Your pamphlets came duly to hand... Hartwell, O., April 15, 1891. Friend Ira:-Your pamphlets came duly to hand. I regret exceedingly the death of our brother, Elder Giles B. Avery. A brave, kind, wise, good man and faithful friend has gone to the reward of the pure in heart. It may be said of him as one of old, 'An Israelite, indeed, in whom there is no guile.' You and all my Shaker friends will please accept my heart-felt sympathy and love. May God perfect us in labors of love and. permit us to attain the same blessed hope and reward. 'Let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his.' I have just forwarded my subscription for the Manifesto, also for 'Life of Daniel Fraser' and 'Mother Ann Lee.' Yours, H. S. Perry.
