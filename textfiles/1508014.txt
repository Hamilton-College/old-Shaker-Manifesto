UPWARD AND ONWARD Battling in the cause of Truth, With a zeal and strength of youth ; Upward raise the banner higher, Onward urge your phalanx nigher To the centre of the strife. Strike where virtue finds a foe, Strike while love directs the blow, Where the foes of man are rife. Be your watchword Truth and love, Be your star the strength above ; 'Mid the pure remain the purest, 'Mid the faithful be the surest. Temperance your banner star; Ask not rest nor pray for peace Till the demon foe shall cease Life and all its joys to mar. Warriors in the cause of right, Earnest in your zeal and might. Joying in your high endeavor, Onward press and falter never, Till the victory be won. Shout until the field you gain, Press to those who still remain, Battling till the work is done. Selected.
