To live in a perfect world would be easy... To live in a perfect world would be easy. The problem is how to live in this world, and not be one of it; how to participate in its labors and cares, and not contract its taint of moral wrong. . The problem can be solved only in the light of Christianity, which shows us how to live in, and yet above the world; how to be citizens of Heaven and yet sojourners on earth; how to retain a devout temper of mind amid the pressures of worldly duty and difficulties. The Christian restores harmony by bringing Heaven down to earth.â€” ZiorCs Herald.
