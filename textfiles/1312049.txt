COLLECTION OF DEBTS. F. W. EVANS. All laws enforcing collection of debts might safely be rescinded. The money paid out to collect the debts of the American people equals in amount the sums collected. Why then not let the debts go and save all the Law machinery and personal vexation that attends the legal collection of money loaned ? Let each person who lends money see | to it that it is repaid or lost. Whose business is it but that of the parties interested ? If the loaning is a matter of friendshipâ€”a favor conferred, law sho.uld not intermeddle. If it be a business transaction it may safely be left in the hands of the parties concerned. The lender assumes the contingency that the borrower will be in better financial condition in the near or remote future. If he miscalculates, it is his business, not anothers. Hear what Horace Greeley says, 'I hate Lawyers ; they do more mischief than they are worth. They cause disorders, demoralize every form of equality and are the chief obstacle to good government. If A lets B have his property without payment, I do not see why C, D, F and all the rest of the alphabet should be called upon as a police force to get it back. No such thing should be attempted by Law. It is the most monstrous innovation upon man's honor ai.d . integrity that was ever forced into the commerce of the world. Let a man trust another at his own/isk. Even the gambler pays his debts contracted at the gambling table. He is not obliged to pay, but he considers them debts of honor. Abolish all Laws for the collection of debts, and thus abolish the whole credit system ; this is the only safe, true basis ; that would abolish moot Lawyers and all of the broker's trade which now controls the commerce of America.' To my mind that is good morality and sound logic. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
