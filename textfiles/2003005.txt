Dearly Beloved Ministry;--Yours of 2nd. inst. came to hand... Shirley Village. Mass., Oct. 7, 1889. Dearly Beloved Ministry ;��Yours of 2nd. inst. came to hand in due time. In reply would say that we are sorry to frel that circumstances and conditions are such that you should deem it needful to -'end out a circular of such import. We have been taught and honestly believe, that the gift of God is in the Order of God. and that each, in their Order, should W&gt;k to the Order before them, for a' true manifestation of that gift; and, that the Order, in its institution, had a nobler purpose than to gratify and sanction the cravings of the senses, especially when they conflict with the pure flowings of divine inspiration, which, to the spiritual minded, are as the lnvad ai'd waters of life! Nevertheless, as you do ask our understanding and judgment, we will give the result of inquiries made. 1st. Then, We do not think it would contribute to the spiritual gift of our meetings to introduce the Organ. 2nd. It would detract from the gift of the worshipers to do so. 3rd. If it is thought advisable, by the Ministry cf any Bishopric to use the Organ, at the commencement of worship, and they find the union of your Order in so doing, we should see no objection, if that could be the limit. We hope there are no Societies or families among Believers that would have better excuse for asking such liberties, than we should for some of ours. We do not ask it, however. Otherwise, our disapproval is, perhaps, sufficiently manifest. All of which is most obediently submitted, as the sentiment of the Societies in our case. Please accept, and extend as you feel of our Gospel love, that Zion may yet arise, and be able to manifest the beauty of a fully devoted and consecrated people. Yours very truly, Ministry of Harvard and Shirley, To Ministry of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
