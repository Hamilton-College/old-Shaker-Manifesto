ANNOUNCEMENT Ere these lines are read, there will be considerably advanced in printer's hands, a Book of Sermons by Elder H. L. Eads, Bishop of South Union, Ky. To those who know of the keen, clear, logical tendency of Elder Eads' theological writings, we need say nothing. To those who would read lessons learned and taught, by one who was almost born a'Shaker, and who has, through three-score years of faithful service in the cause of Shakerism, demonstrated in life the truths he teaches, we advise a careful reading of this Book of Sermons. The publishers, we make responsible for a fine portrait of Elder Eads, disclaiming aswÂ« would the introduction of any thing that had even the appearance of vanity. The book will be of large type, clear print, and executed in the best manner by Weed, Parsons ;gt Co., Albany, N. Y., and for sale only by the author, and The Shaker Manifesto, Shakers, N. Y. Price $1.00
