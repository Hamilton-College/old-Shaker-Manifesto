Book Table Lights and Shadows of Spiritualism D. D. Home Published by The BeligioPhilosophical Go., Chicago, 111. We have waited long and patiently for this work. D. D. Home is acknowledged as second to no one spiritualist (unless we may except Bros. A. J Davis and J. M. Peebles), in honesty of mediumship, and in anxiety that the truths of Spiritualism may be eliminated from, and exalted far above the villainous chaff of the mere sensational phenomena, which have assumed so extravagant a position under the garb of Spiritualism's name. Bro. Home has done true spiritualism a great favor by introducing to the world these ' Lights and Shadows.' He will receive the condemDation of the dishonest in the ranks of Spiritualism, even as Davis, Peebles, and their honest ilk deserve the censure of deceivers ; but such censure is extorted praise. Get the book; see what is true of Spiritualism ; see also, its '* Shadows,' and avoid them. Price $1.50, postage free. ANNOUNCEMENT Ere these lines are read, there will be considerably advanced in printer's hands, a Book of Sermons by Elder H. L. Eads, Bishop of South Union, Ky. To those who know of the keen, clear, logical tendency of Elder Eads' theological writings, we need say nothing. To those who would read lessons learned and taught, by one who was almost born a'Shaker, and who has, through three-score years of faithful service in the cause of Shakerism, demonstrated in life the truths he teaches, we advise a careful reading of this Book of Sermons. The publishers, we make responsible for a fine portrait of Elder Eads, disclaiming aswÂ« would the introduction of any thing that had even the appearance of vanity. The book will be of large type, clear print, and executed in the best manner by Weed, Parsons ;gt Co., Albany, N. Y., and for sale only by the author, and The Shaker Manifesto, Shakers, N. Y.
