PRAYER REV. GEORGE W. TIMLOW, D. D. [Contributed by Eld. G. B. A.] PRAYER BY REV. GEORGE W. TIMLOW, D. D. There are two classes of people, one saying, ' What profit shall we have, if we pray untoltim?' and the other declaring, 'The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. ' At a time when this question is much discussed, let us see what the rational and Scriptural idea of it is; for manifestly there are wrong impressions in regard to it. It is not the doctrine of the Bible nor the dictate of reason that asking, alone and of itself, is prayer. It has no real existence separate from a rightful aim, aspiration, character. One may seek for spiritual knowledge, and be none the wiser; for spiritual strength, and be no stronger; for faith, sure and steadfast, and receive nothing. He may ask and receive not, because he asks amiss. If he does not group together and observe the conditions, and all of them announced, as the law in the case, failure meets him at every step. The Apostle John gives his understanding of the question, 'And whatsoever we ask we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. ' Prayer has a place, is a factor, a means, in the great spiritual lives that have moved the world; but how absurd to say, Let us try it by itself: that is, let us use petition only. The mainspring of a watch has a very important place, but only in its relation to and connection with all the other parts of the mechanism. Affirming its necessary place and use in the watch, we are not prepared to say, Let us take the mainspring out by itself and test its power and accuracy as a chronometer. It is an error to suppose that any one can tell just what prayer is in its nature. In science, no one can tell just what any element or any substance is. He knows something, but not all about it. lie knows something of its conditions, phenomena, of its forces, something of its correlation to other things : of its absolute nature, he knows nothing. When Prof. Tyndall lectures on light, he comes to a point when lie says : ' That is all I know about it. No one can tell its cause, unravel all of its nature and mystery. ' That concession does not destroy the fact or the force of light. But it is said that prayer implies a possible change on the part of God, and that 'puts the question outside of the laws of harmony.' Suppose it true (we do not so affirm it) that prayer does imply a change on the part of God, is that in contradiction to their own scientific doctrine of forces? These same scientific men tell us that, when we pull a boat to the shore, the boat-hook at the same time pulls the earth toward us; that a grain of sand dropped affects the universe; that planets attract the sun, and the sun the planets,� that action and reaction are everywherem the whole domain of physics, and that the harmony of the universe, so far from being disturbed, is dependent upon these very conditions. . .. � . If their own laws of force are correct, then it follows that a mind operating in the line of God's own nature�having in itself qualities like those of God, as atoms have of the earth� will have an influence upon the mind of God: it will from its own laws of farce, have an influence upon the mind of God, and yet no more disturb the constancy of God's nature and plans and purposes than the influence of planets upon the sun, and of star upon star, disturb by the changes they produce the harmony of the universe, but are, as the astronomers say, the conditions that result in that harmony. Why may not the writers of the Bible apply the same law to the spiritual world that science does in the whole empire of nature? Take the law of the magnets, of which Prof. Tyndall speaks. When in a certain state, the poles attract, tend to each other, when not in that state, they repel each other. Take the divine mind and the human. May there not be conditions in which they tend the one to the other, and God dwells in the soul in consciousness, love, and power? In other and opposite conditions, may not the will, aim, desires of the person be repellent to the will of God. and all this too within the sphere of consciousness? Does life witness these facts, as science does its phenomena and laws? Is the testimony of the multitudes, that no man can number, without place and force, who say, 'We speak of that we do know, and we testify of that we have seen? ' What analogy of science controverts the doctrine, ' Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you? ' As to how far a mind, seeking and keeping the laws or divine commandments in the case, may influence the material world, we do not know. Shall we say, Not at all? Then, we are reminded that mind has sought and kept the laws of one element in nature, that it is the will, desire, prayer of mind that drives its trains night and day through the land; that is, the force of mind over matter. It tunnels the mountains, makes a dry road over the rivers, grades the uneven belling States, and opens a highway of commerce from sea to sea. Is there lack of harmony here between seeking, striving, and prevailing human minds and the purposes of God? Another element, and mind was long seeking and asking, then finding its laws. They are found and kept; and mind joins itself to iron nerves that web the land, dip under the oceans, feel as by sensation what is going on at the same time in,.two hemispheres. It controls the movements of armies, directs navigation, affects the thoughts and plans of nations, has to do in great material changes, makes history, Another item. We read the, morning prophecy of the weather. We launch out or not according to what we read. All these things�the power through steam, electricity and certainty in weather prophecy�would have been declared impossibilities or miracles a century ago. But men sought, observed obediently the laws in the case ; and we have no evidence of violence done to the divine government, or that it is in any way thrown out of joint. These and all questions as to how for mind may affect the world of matter are purely questions of evidence. The place of prayer as a factor and force in history is to be determined by the records of the past. Are the records that contain the testimony true or false? We cannot dispose of these by saying. upon a priori ground, impossible. Arago says that, outside of pure mathematics, no one should say that anything is impossible. What is great and yet unknown to us has always a phase of impossibility. Scientific men told Prof. Morse that making beats over the land at the speed of hundreds of miles per second was an impossibility. But proof of the feet became stronger than the a priori negation. Learned men once said in the British Parliament that no one could ride in cars, as was pretended, twenty miles per hour, without losing his breath. There is now considerable evidence that the learned men were mistaken. Prayer, like any other great question, may present apparent contradictions or paradoxes. So does Science. Our senses tell us that the moon moves toward the west. Science demonstrates that it moves toward the east. The sun seems to move around the earth, yet evidence comes and corrects the mistake made by the senses. In the relations existing between man finite and God Infinite, do we expect to find nothing mysterious, no seeming paradoxes, depths which reason has not sounded, and which are not contrary to, because they are yet heyond the exploration of reason? The question of prayer returns to one of fact, evidence purely, and cannot be determined by assuming what the science of prayer ought or ought not to be. Prayer, or what is commonly called prayer, is natural in the human soul,�natural not for one people, one age, but all. Tne same evidence that shows us that sight and hearing are natural to the human race, although multitudes are blind or deaf, shows to us that prayer must rest upon some universal law, gencrically if not individually present, as sight, hearing, etc., are generically, if not individually, found among all people in all times and places.
