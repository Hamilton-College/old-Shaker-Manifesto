THY WORK A constant dropping of the good Will wear away the stony heart, Where flame of fire, and deluge flood, Could not vitality impart. Continue then thy little deeds Of kindness, love, and sweet control; For greatest gifts are to the needs, And highest love is to the soul. Pray on, work on; the light is near, A perfect light and life in God ; Thou hast no earthly ill to fear, When with the truth thy feet are shod. The dawn of day that bursts in light, Is hid behind one lonely hill; The sun ascends and flees the night, That we may work with God's pure will. And where is God ? by things well seen We trace the order of his place; In male and female to redeem, And lead the chosen heirs of grace. Endued with wisdom and with love, Whose attributes they jointly share; Uplifting souls to realms above, Two powers as one for Zion care. Mary Whitcher, Canterbury, N. H.
