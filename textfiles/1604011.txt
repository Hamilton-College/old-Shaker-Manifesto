A LAST PRAYER. HELEN JACKSON. Father, I scarcely dare to pray. So clear I see, now it is done, That I have wasted half my day, And left my work but just begun ; So clear I see that things I thought Were right or harmless were a sin ; So clear I see that I have sought, Unconscious, selfish aims to win. So clear I see that I have hurt The souls I might have helped to save That I have slothful been, inert Deaf to the calls thy leaders gave. In outskirts of thy kingdoms vast Father, the humblest spot give me; Set me the lowliest task thou hast, Let me repentant work for thee. Selected.
