BIBLICAL. NO. 5. BY H. C. BLINN. Those who directed the revision of the New Testament have felt authorized to erase the 21st verse of Matt, xvii., as spurious, anc also verse 11th of the xviii chapter. Matt, xx., 16. ' So the last shall be first and the first last; for many be called but few chosen.' A very happy change has been made in this place, and the passage now has nothing to do with the condition of individuals as the words 'for many are called but few chosen, ' have been found to be an interpolation. Matt, xx., 22 and 23. ' But Jesus answerec and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Ar; ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?' The revised version now reads, ' But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? ' The remarks referring to baptism in the 22 and 23 verses are now thrown out. It is remarkable that the Bible transcribers should have been so officious as to enlarge to such an extent, upon the say ngs of Jesus, and put into his mouth what they were interested that he should say, to help establish their own peculiar theology. Matt, xxiii., 14. 'Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.' The whole of this verse is crossed out although it is said to be found in some of the old MSS. This has been read and quoted for two hundred years, and been the subject for hundreds of sermons while purporting to be the words of Jesus and written by Matthew. Mark vi., 11. 'Verily I say unto you. It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city. '' So much of the eleventh verse is ei'ased. Was it written by holy men? Peter said this much of some of the prophecies, ' For the prophecy came not in old times by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. ' But the revision corrects this for the better. ' For no prophecy ever came by the will of man; but men spake from God being moved by the Holy Spirit. ' Mark vii. The whole chapter has been subjected to a thorough ,-ifiing. Words and sentences have been liberally cast aside and still the book is made better. Mark ix., 23. 'Jesus said unto him. If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that belie veth. ' The revision changes the sense very essentially by a change of the sentence. It has been thought very important to punctuate a quotation exactly like the text, but the revisors have taken unbounded liberty and of course, in many cases, made very radical changes. The father here says, 'If thou canst do a.ny thing,' as though there might be a doubt on the point, and a comma follows the remark. Then Jesus says, 'If thou canst believe, all things are possible.' A comma follows believe. This makes a very mild appeal to the faith of the man, who had brought the child, but the revisors change the sense entirely, and make Jesus put forth, a cutting rebuke. 'And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth, ' As much as to say, Away with your doubting! Mark ix., 29. Speaking of diseases that are to be healed by prayer and fasting;�it now seems that Jesus did not advise the fasting, but said, ' This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer. ' The ninth chapter of Mark is well worth a careful perusal, as the revision has many changes from the A. V. by which a better reading is obtained. Mark xvi. From the eighth verse to the end of the chapter is considered spurious, as the old MSS. have so many different readings. This takes away nearly all that Mark had to say about the resurrection. This rejected section also contains several remarkable )assages which have been very freely used in making strong points, for still stronger sernons. Luke iv., 4. ' Man shall not live by bread ilone' the remaining part of the verse, 'but )y every word of God, ' is omitted as not beonging to the text. In the fifth verse the words, ' into a high mountain ' are left out, and in the eighth verse, 'Get thee behind me, Satan, ' has met the same fate. In the eighteenth verse, ' to heal the brokenhearted, ' is erased. This chapter has been singularly mutilated and it may take many years to reconcile such changes in the minds of some Bible readers. Luke xi., 44. ' Woe unto you. for ye are as graves.' Jesus did not say woe unto you Scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites, as these names were evidently added by some designing person in recopying the Testament. The word hypocrites is not to be found in .the whole chapter. Luke xvi., !). ' And I say unto you, make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness : that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. '� This important passage has been the subject of much comment. The revisors have changed it a mere trifle. 'Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.' This advice to make friends with the spirit of the world does not sound like the testimony of Jesus, or the apostle. A better rendering is as follows :�Make not to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, for they will fail, while ye are received into lasting habitations. This certainly must have been the spirit of the Teacher. Paul says, ' Make no provision for the flesh, ' ' Whosoevc therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. ' Too many have already tried this same thing to the ruin of their souls. Canterbury, N. H.
