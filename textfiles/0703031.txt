OUR RECIPE NOOK. Graham gems. —One quart milk and two even cups of Graham flour. Beat together so us to be smooth, and free of lumps; then turn in well-buttered and very hot 'gem irons,' and bake in a quick oven. Made in this way, they are very light, tender and sweet, needing no soda nor salt. If made any stiifer, they will not be light. Newspapers for plants. —Newspapers are a very cheap and convenient protection to plants liable to the exposure of cold air. But the advantage of several thicknesses is not well understood. They operate in the same way as forest leaves, namely, confine thin strata of air between their layers; only newspapers, being larger than leaves, hold the thin plates of air more perfectly. A large number of papers spread one above another, will afford an amount of protection from cold that will be surprising to those who have not given them a trial.
