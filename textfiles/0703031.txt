Newspapers for plants. â€”Newspapers are a very cheap and convenient protection to plants liable to the exposure of cold air. But the advantage of several thicknesses is not well understood. They operate in the same way as forest leaves, namely, confine thin strata of air between their layers; only newspapers, being larger than leaves, hold the thin plates of air more perfectly. A large number of papers spread one above another, will afford an amount of protection from cold that will be surprising to those who have not given them a trial.
