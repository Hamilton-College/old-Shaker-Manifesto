FROM DEATH TO LIFE. By Frederic McKechnie. The year is dying; the harvest is done ; The corn field, reaped, stands grey in the sun, And the swallows are gathering, one by one. A low wind stirs, but its breath is chill, It blows o'er the brow of the bleak, east hill, Where the moon is rising so ghostlystill! 'O, what Presence is this?' I cried in my dread, A Voice in the wind, blew, 'Summer is fled, And I, Death, 'Winter, am here in her stead; And the grass of the field shall fade away ; And the flower shall perish in cold decay ; And songsters cease, from the iron day. My seal shall be set on each running river, And man shall cower, and beasts shall shiver, And the kingdom and power shall be mine forever.' And I heard the Voice, but I made reply, 'That which liveth can never die; Thou shalt not triumph utterly The river that flowed, shall flow again, Heaven shall send its gentle rain, And the grass and the flowers re-clothe the plain. Though the spell thou weavest be fast and strong, And quench in silence, the sound of song, It is not for long,it is not for long. For Summer comes, and the slumbering earth Shall wake again into joyous birth, And the wide world ring with the voice of mirth. And yet again, there shall come a day, When thou, O Death, shalt be done away, And Life be ours, for aye and for aye.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
