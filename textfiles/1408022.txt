WHEN THE MISTS HAVE CLEARED AWAY. 'When the mists have rolled in splendor From the beauty of the hills And the sunshine, warm and tender, Falls in splendor on the rills, We may read love's shining letter In the rainbow of the spray, We shall know each other better When the mists have cleared away. If we err in human blindness, And forget that we are dust, If we miss the law of kindness When we struggle to be just, Snowy wings of peace shall cover All the pain that clouds our way, When the weary watch is over And the mists have cleared away. When the silvery mists have veiled us From the faces of our own, Oft we deemed their love has failed us, And we tread our path alone ; We should see them near and truly, We should trust them day by day, Neither love nor blame unduly, If the mists have cleared away. When the mists have risen above us, As our Father knows his own, Face to face with those who love us, We shall know as we are known. Love, beyond the orient meadows, Floats the golden fringe of day; Heart to heart we hide the shadows, Till the mists have cleared away. Selected.
