UNION. Mary Johnston. In Union there is Strength.' O Union thou great source of strength ever abide with us, for thou art our life, our all ! Union is the great keynote, which gives tone, life and zeal to any undertaking. Have we not realized how harmoniously we progress when all are united in heart and spirit for the interest of each other and the glorious cause in which we have engaged ? Herein lies our success or defeat. If we are caretul to cultivate this heavenly gift, we shall surely reap the increase thereof, Love, Joy aud Peace. Our journey in time is too short to admit of needless strife and discord, a contending for petty rights, which could so easily be banished by laying aside all selfish claims, aud bracing ourselves more firmly against the graud, nobh; cross of self-denial, ''in honor preferring one another.' In this we find the entrance to the beautiful valley of humility, where flowers of hearts-ease are always growing. The kind word and pleasant smile generally indicate that we are traveling to this safe retreat. We can safely say that it behooves every Christian to let their light shine in this respect. No matter how small our efforts may be to promulgate this Union, we shall realize the truth in these few lines :� 'Union brings increasing pleasure, Union gives us life and zeal, Union fills as without measure, With the joys we love to feel.' Thus the fruition of each succeeding conquest over self is plainly discernable, not only to us individually, but to all with whom we may come in contact. Kentucky's beautiful motto, k'United we stand, divided we fall,' should be engraved upou the tablet of every heart. For a house divided against, itself cannot stand, but if it is strongly united with the bonds of love and union to the Christ-life, there is nothing of earth that can prevail against that house, for it is built upon a sure foundation. The motto of our great republic, E pluribus unum, (one composed out of many,), gave rise to the term United States, denoting that we as a nation, are a United people ;� and we, as religionists, following in the wake of national reformation, style, or call ourselves, United Believers in Christ's Second Appearing. Now the question arises to every sincere soul both Christian and Anti-Christian, Are we being truly a united people? Are we harmoniously and practically uniting with God's higher attributes, blending to the angelic life of purity, and divesting ourselves of all inferior besetmeuts to obtain that celestial Paradise where all are united as one? Our Union is our strength, and if we would be strong, we must seek our union with the true vine, for Christ said, 'kI am the vine, and ye are the brandies.' 'lie thatabideth iu me, and I in him, the same shall bring forth much fruit.' So let us be wise, and not be cast forth as useless branches, but be alive, cultivating this priceless boon ; for what we cultivate will grow. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
