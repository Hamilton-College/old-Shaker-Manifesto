CLARK'S COMMENTS 'For the priest's lips should keep knowldge, and they should seek the law at lis mouth: for he is the messenger of \q Lord of hosts. But ye are departed out of the way ; THE SHAKER 315 ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways but have been partial in the law.' Malachi, ii: 7, 9. Therefore have I also made you contemptible. 'The people despised you because they saw that you acted contrary to your functions. This has happened repeatedly since, to several classes of priests. Not maintaining, by purity of life and soundness of doctrine, the dignity of the ministerial function, they became contemptible before the people: their meagre preaching was disregarded, and their persons at last cast out as a general loathing to the universe ! See what happened to the truly abominable priesthood of France and Rome, 1796â€” 8. They were the sole cause of that infidelity, that brought about the Revolution. They are now partially restored ; and are endeavoring to supply by grimace, paltry superstition, and Jesuitical cunning what they want in purity of morals, soundness of doctrine, and unction from God. They must mend or look for another revolution. Mankind will no longer put up with the chaff of ^puerile and fanatical ceremonies, in place of the wheal of God's word and worship.' This commentary was written many years ago. How true it has proved aocording to subsequent history ! What an overthrow has taken place in Rome since then, what commotions in the old homes of Christendom! They are literally passing, away. New heavens are creating to occupy their place and the end is not yet. We still look for new heavens and a new earth wherein shall dwell righteousness. F. W. Evans
