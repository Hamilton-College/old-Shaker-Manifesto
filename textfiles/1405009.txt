Correspondence Beloved Editor ;-The Manifesto is more and more interesting... Shaker Station, Conn. Mar., 1884. Beloved Editor ;-The Manifesto is more and more interesting. Much good may be gained by reading it. The article on Confession agrees with the experience of all who have proved it. Other writers are doing good by their labors of love. 'VVe should look, carefully, to the cultivation of the spiritual interests. I have observed, Avith concern, a growing tendency to give the outward too much supremacy. This is a mistake, and during my long experience I have witnessed with sorrow its fatal effects upon the soul. In the earlier part of my life I was exercised in the acquisition of outward science and know quite well its tendency when it becomes a basis of action instead of being subordinate to the highest spiritual development. I view with much anxiety any leaning toward science as a basis for true religion. Man is ever between an innermost and an outermost, and when he leaves the first for the last, he becomes divested of all true spirituality. However much he may clothe himself with the intellectualism of spirit, he remains still intellectual or animal and the Divine Spirit or religious love mature and its development is entirely lost from sight. He then goes on in his delusive idea of supremacy while he is only an intellectual man. We have thought that he was only two thirds of a man, in this state, instead of being a whole one. No doubt all outward knowledge may become useful when guided by the divine mind, but without this it will work more and more evil for humanity. This is the dark gulf that man has to pass through from ideal to essential being. We can only obtain this most desirable of all things by submission to God's order as established through the spirit of Christ. There can be no misgivings if we seek first the kingdom of God, when all that is necessary for us in the intellectual and physical will be added in due time. As I have been a partaker of a monthly feast since our paper started on its beneficent errand to humanity, I thought I would let you know how much I approve of our little missionary. Your Brother, Robert Aitken. Beloved Elder Harvey :-How about that Bible class? Have they all... Shaker Village, N. H. Oct. 1883. Beloved Elder Harvey :�How 'about that Bible class? Have they all written in defense of their faith, and are we the last to speak a good word in behalf of a cause to which we owe so much? All! believe me�Your daughter F. is more genuine in her consecrations, and more fervent in her devotions than might sometimes be apparent. If we remember correctly you placed us at the foot of the class and said that we were either the most honest, or the most indifferent to the Christ principles. ' Except a man forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. ' We understand, that no reserves of any name or nature can be tolerated in a genuine Christian, but how few Christians there are !�because ' Straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life. ' Who will ever reach this perfected state ? Be assured, dear gospel parent, th^ name of your daughter shall be enrolled with the few or the many who will know no surrender in the glorious work of conquering self. We speak not as one unacquainted with human frailties, but as one who means to find 'salvation, and will know no defeat. We understand that the religion which Jesus, the Christ, taught and lived, was a consistent one, therefore, whoever would preach effectually must reduce theory to practice in daily life, as did Jesus. The gospel which he administered was a saving grace and so apparent was this salvation to men that they acknowledged him to be the Savior of men, and all who become his true disciples must follow the pattern closely. Although 'I may not reach the height nor depth of God's great love to me, ' yet this is our faith, our strife and aim, and by our faith and our works shall we be justified. We could say much more in behalf of our beautiful gospel faith, ' our heart's dearest treasure, ' indeed, the only treasure worth possessing, but it is unnecessary.�Enough has been said to prove to you that we have no sympathy with the selfishness that clings as naturally to the unregenerate heart, as the moss clings to the stone, whether found in Shaker Village or elsewhere. It all belongs to Babylon. One phase of selfishness is just as good as another, and we do not wish for any of it. But as Heaven cannot be reached by a single bound, we are content to work out our salvation by the good old way of the Cross and self-denial, just as our Parents have done before us, with none of the modern revisions which culminate in shams; and what is more detestable than a shammy Christian? Before we close, let us say a word about our position in the class, which mortified us a bit, but did no harm, as we were sure we should not stay at the foot very long, if there was any way to get to the head. In the meantime we had one consolation, and that was, that the Teacher generally stands pretty near the foot of the class, so the place did not seem so bad after all. About being the most honest, Ave admit we like to be thought well of both at home and abroad, but we fail to see the advantage to be gained by assuming a Avorth or ATirtue not our own, although avc do hate deceit and lies ; notAvithstanding our own composition may be sumciently tinctured Avith these ingredients to render it troublesome at times, yet as a Avhole we prefer to 'be what Ave seem to be and seem to be Avhat avc really are. ' Accept the universal love and prayers of the household for our worthy gospel friends at South Union. Now, father, just place us, at the foot or head of the class according to our merits, but Ave pray you give us a place somewhere in Christ's school, and Ave will not complain but shall always hope to remain among the Avise virgins.
