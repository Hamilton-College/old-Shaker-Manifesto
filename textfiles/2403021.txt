Shaker Station, Conn. Feb. 1894. 'Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap,' that, and not something else. Let us sow only pure seed in our hearts that we may reap nothing but golden grain. 'Blessed are the pure in heart.' Purity is very essential in forming a true Christian character. Let us be pure and our reward will follow us. The heavenly joy gained by living in purity fully compensates for all crosses, trials and afflictions. Where purity is, a peaceful spirit dwells. ******* To obtain a good supply of eggs in winter, we must have young hens. Pullets hatched in April or May will prove most satisfactory. The hens must be well cared for, have a comfortably warm house, be kept clean and well arranged. Provide a bountiful supply of fresh water, accessible at all times. Variety and plenty of food is absolutely necessary. Feed regularly what the hens will eat without wasting. Ground meat, bone, boiled potatoes with wheat bran make the best morning meal. Whole grain should be the feed after the morning ration. Having adopted a system of feeding pursue it steadily or when changing do so gradually. Strive to have the best hens; there is the most profit in them. Daniel Orcutt.
