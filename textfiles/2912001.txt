The Journal of Hygeio-Therapy The Journal of Hygeio-Therapi\ The October number comes to us full of good things. The article by Dr. Gifford on 'Discouragement and the Law of Cure,' is excellent for those who are sick or well. A lesson after that order is eminently educational. Many other interesting articles are found in the same Journal till it is well filled with good things. Pub. by Dr. T. V. Gifford &amp; Co. Kokomo, Incl. In the November Magazine Number The Outlook prints a portrait and brief sketch of Mr. James Barnes, now on his way to the Transvaal as special correspondent for The Outlook. The articles from Mr. Barnes on the Transvaal War and on the problems of South Africa will undouDtedly prove as attractive a feature in this journal as have the two series of articles on Cuba by Mr. George Kennan. Another series of equal importance will be that on the Philippines by Mr. Phelps Whitmarsh, author of 'The World's Rough Hand.' Mr. Whitmarsh is now in the islands as a special commissioner for The Outlook. An article on Hawaii in its present relations to the United States, including an interview with ex-President Dolo, appears in The Outlook for October 28th, and forms the first of Mr. Whitmarsh's series under the general title 'Colonial America.'

It has secured a notable contribution for its November number from Vance Thompson, who is now in Paris, who has been over the ground especially for The Cosmopolitan and who is, undoubtedly, the most brilliant of the younger American writers. The article is copiously illustrated. There will be a second Paris Exposition article in The Cosmopolitan, for December. This one is written by the Hon. Charles A. Towne, the eloquent Minnesota Representative in Congress, and it, also, will have many fine pictures.
