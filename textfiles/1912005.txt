'NOW HAS COME THIS DAY.' Ernest Pick. Christ has been horn for us ! Oh joy of mortals who forever are surrounded by the inheritance of sin ; by evils constantly arising anew. Christ lived for us ! Establishing the Kingdom of Salvation, and giving us an example of a spiritual life never to be surpassed, the shining guide of fire and light whose radiant splendor, centuries could not diminish ; the ever fertile fountain where from we eagerly drink the water of life celestial. Christ died for us ! He gained the victory over death and vanquished all its powers. He denied his life to show the power of the .Spirit in his Almighty will and truth. Blessed he who passed all trials and temptations of life. Christ is risen for us. In joyful creation He to glory has risen, giving eternal life to all who, following him, will die in the flesh and resurge in his spirit. Alas ! In agony he left us here below in the rude embrace of earth and clay. But lo ! the waymark dreary and sweet at once, behold the cross which leads to him. To all fellow cross-bearers, love and greeting. Peace is ours. Out of the abyss of decay let us disengage ourselves, all earthly ties joyfully renounce for He, Christ, is waiting. 'This day has come now,' He said, proclaiming his kingdom, and He is waiting for those who love Him. He will be found by all who seek him. Christ has risen, let us to him arise ! Follow him, thou son and daughter of the King. He will never leave thee nor forsake thee. Peace be with you. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Greeting ! Greeting! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
