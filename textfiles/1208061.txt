Seeding a Swamp Meadow Seeding a Swamp Meadow. J.K., Carmel N. Y. : Corn is an excellent preparatory crop to seeding a newly reclaimed swamp meadow to grass. The cultivation of the corn will clean the ground and rot the sod. When the corn is cultivated the last time the grass seed may be sown on the fresh mellow soil and will soon sink into it and be covered. But the corn should be planted flat and cultivated without any hilling up. The seed to be chosen should be six pounds of red top, twelve pounds of fowl meadow grass, and six pounds of yellow or tall oat grass. Tribune Farmer.
