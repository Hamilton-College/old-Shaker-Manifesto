TRUE GREATNESS, By Belle Rullhausen. 'He that rulvth his own spirit, is greater than he that taketh a city.' The annals of time bear many records of those who have fought victorious battles, who have slain their brother-man, and have conquered nations without mercy, but few in comparison are the truly great and virtuous acts of self-sacrifice and heroism which have have been universally acknowledged. Society has too long honored the power of the sword rather than puiity of heart and integrity of purpose. He who has not moral courage enough to defend the right and battle with inward foes, is in truth a coward; though he win the plaudits of men. How very pathetic, yet inspiring are the many accounts of the great philosopher Socrates, who willingly met death, rather than yield his convictions. With what calm resignation did he endure false accusations, and when comdemned to die, his chief accuser sent a private message wherein was stated, that if he would desist censuring his conduct, he should be delivered from death; but from deep religious motives, Socrates spurned such a degrading act, and replied, 'While I live I will never disguise the truth, nor speak otherwise than as duty requires.' Only the divine, the God-like spirit could have prompted this noble utterance. Greatness depends not upon external power and affluence, but upon the conquest gained over the lower elements of our being. When virtue stands forth preeminent in the life, and all the energies of the body, mind and soul are devoted to the elevation of humanity, then do we find our God and then do realize our heaven. When we have attained full victory over self, then shall we realize the dignity of that true greatness with which all that is denominated as such by the worldlyminded, will seem as fleeting shadows.
