Book Notices American newspaper directory This immense work of more than a thousand pages will prove an invaluable companion to the thousands of newspaper fraternity and millions of advertisers. Its contents are very tastefully arranged, and no pains have apparently been spared to make it the most complete work of its kind ever printed. It is the handiwork of that enterprising firm, Geo. P. Rowell &amp; Co., New York, which firm has excited the unworthy envy and malice of contemporaries, and yet which stands A 1 with all respectable business men. We commend the same to the patron age of all advertisers. Undiscovered country The Undiscovered country has been sent us, and proves to be an unworthy novel of a very talented man, W. H. Howells, editor of The Atlantic Monthly. The Undiscovered Country has reference to the spirit world, and the theme is a mixture of love story and ridicule of Spiritualism. If the writer does not find there is more truth in the simple, scientific facts taught by Spiritualism 'than he has dreamed of in his philosophy,' then we err in judgment. Just why this.unfriendly Howells must' drag in the Shakers into so many of his stories, and placing them in so ridiculous a light before the world, we cannot tell. But certain it is that in this story, as in ' A House of Entertainment,' Shakerism appears to be ' a thorn in his flesh.' Courtesy compels us to return some kind'of a notice, but we cannot commend the propriety nor philosophy of the book.
