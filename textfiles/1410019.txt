NOTES A Christian life must necessarily be in harmony with the life of Christ. It is of little consequence cither to ourselves or others that we accept an example that we never expect to follow, or to speak in praise of a religious Teacher whom we never expect to regard :� On the other hand it is of the greatest importance that our lives harmonize with that spirit which establishes a foundation for righteousness and comes to us with authority from the Kingdom of God. Christ is, indeed our example, a divine pattern of which we need not be ashamed. He has given us to understand that his meat and his drink�his whole life,�was to do the 'will of God. As disciples, can we accept less or do less and rightfully claim a relation that should make us as one, in the spirit of the Testimony ? Christ instructed men to make the heart pure that they might worship God, as a Heavenly Father, in the beauty of holiness. He established no ritual, formulated no creed, but gave as the essential criterion by which his disciples should be known in every place, and at all times,�this new and simple commandment,�that ye shall have love one for another. in Ihe selfishness of the heart men had manifested a partial love for those who would return a corresponding regard, but to work faithfully and devotedly for the spiritual interest of others without a stipulated reward was a new feature in the religious experience,�a thorough test of the true disciple. Not by the name which has grown up around us ; not by the separation which we have accepted, and through this thrown ourselves out from the body of the world, shall we be known as the sons and daughters of the living God, but by tests far more important in self-examinu'ion and self-government which has for its guidance,�pure in heart,�merciful in spirit. A great many good things may be said and a great many wise things accomplished, and yet the actor in all this may be destitute of that spirit of purity which is so emphatically demanded to establish him as a true disciple of the great Teacher. Christ at the same time speaks of peacefulness. ' Blessed are the peacemakers for they shaH'be called the children of God.' A great many sermons have grown from these few, simple words and learned divines have made themselves eloquent in their zeal to repeat that which in reality they but feebly understood. The peacemaker and the pure in heart must walk together. The one is not without the other in the Lord. With the peaceable fruits of righteousness comes that quality of the mind which allows nothing that engenders strife. With this will be found the spirit of wisdom,�'first pure tnen peaceable and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits. ' The abnormal phase of the subject is where we find contentious and fighting Christians. If we are being crucified to the world as was the apostle, we shall have no fellowship with the inheritance of the flesh. Kindness will then take the place of unkindness and we shall learn the heavenlv lesson of governing the ton sue and keeping unspotted from the world. Without this power of Christian control over self and selfishness, without this discipline that will render the mind pure and peaceable, the prayers and psalms and exhortations Avill be of but little value. The spirit of Christ will be to those who receive it 'a savor of life unto life,' while to those who neglect its inspiration and care the ultimate is death. When Jesus found the Jews and Samaritans at variance with each other respecting the place for the worship of God, he gave them to understand that the location had very little to do with it. They might live in either city, ascend the top of any mountain and yet the only worship that would prove acceptable must be from that class that could manifest it in spirit and in truth. It must be iu harmony with the spirit of God and the outgrowth of our lives while under the guidance of righteousness. This constitutes religion and by this manifestation of the living spirit of Christ we shall stand honestly and righteously before God and the whole world.
