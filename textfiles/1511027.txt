FOR PATIENCE VINING. KATIE BOYLE. Go rest from thy toils, faithful pilgrim, For the cares of thy earth-life are o'er; Go reap the reward of thy labors, In that land where turmoils come no more. There, friends are in waiting to meet thee, 'When the boatman has ferried thee o'er ; With welcoming voices they'll greet thee, As ye launch on the evergreen shore. Thy pilgrimage here has been lergthy, And thy mission with blessing been fraught; Thou ever didst lend to the needy, And strength to the week didst impart. When battles of life waxed the fiercest, And the volunteers pressed to the front, Like many a brave, noble heroï¿½ For the vict'ry, thy strength, too, was spent. Adieu, till we meet in that country Where parting will never be more; Then welcome, and guide us, dear sister, When the boatman shall terry us o'er. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
