WHAT IS PRAYER? MATILDA J. TATTERTON. Prayer is the sincere breathing of the soul to God, and is not confined to language. It is the means through which the soul seeks the blessing and protection of God and kind guardian angels. What an example of faith in prayer, taught by our Savior when surrounded by cruel enemies. 'Father, forgive them, for they not what they do.' It is the true spirit of prayer that leads us to approach the All-wise 'Not as I will, but as thou wilt.' Until we can feel this spirit of perfect resignation we have not learned how to pray. It is a humiliating but a soul exalting gift a shield against temptation. Jesus often retired alone to the mountain, where no eye could see, no ear could hear, no sympathizing spirit respond, and poured t forth the anguish of his soul unto God, for strength to drink the bitter cup. One of the greatest hindrances to our spiritual growth is the lack of perfect honesty in our approaches to God. We draw near with our lips when our hearts are far off. When we learn to be thoroughly honest in our prayers, realizing the mockery of mere lip service to Him who searches the heart, we shall no longer complain that our prayers remain unanswered. How true the words,ï¿½ ' By prayer we oft prevail, When mortal strength [doth fail, And bring to our aid Heaven's power; Whate'er our toil and care By watchfulness and prayer We've an anchor, a safe-guard each hour.' As a little child looks to a father for strength, and yearns for the tender embraces of a loving mother, so does the soul in need, bow to the universal Father and Mother, God, for strength to hold, wisdom to direct, and for that charity, love, and care, which only the baptism of the Holy Spirit can impart. Through prayer we are enabled to find access to God. It fills the soul of the seeker after righteousness with a satisfaction no words can express. When we consider our dependence upon a supreme guidance, we pray earnestly and unceasingly to be preserved from all evil. The more spiritually enlightened the soul, the more prayerfully interested concerning the things of God. Prayer is indeed the Christian's armor, a never failing source of strength and encouragement.
