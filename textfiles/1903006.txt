COMING TO HER INHERITANCE. Alonzo G. Hollister. He will give you another Helper. John xiv., 16. Are not those who make most account of the Apostle's prohibition of wives from speaking in the church, breaking the commandment by adding to the word of God, when they stretch it so as to include all women ? Evidently, the Apostle alluded not to free women but to wives, when he said 'Let them ask their husbands in their own house ;' and when he bade the woman '�be subject to the husband, as also saith the law.' That free women spoke and preached in primitive Christian congregations, appears from the records. Thus: 'Every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered, dishonoreth her head.' 1 Cor. xi. In Acts we are told 'Phillip had four daughters, virgins, who prophesied.' In his letter to Rome, the Apostle salutes 'Priscilla and Aquilla, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,' placing the woman first. The Acts inform us that 'Aquilla and Priscilla took Apollos aud explained to him the way of God more perfectly.' 1 Cor. xiv., 3, explains prophecy so as to include all that we understand by preaching. Thus ; 'He (or she) that prophesieth, speaketh unto men, edification, exhortation and comfort.' It appears quite probable that Jezebel, spoken of in Revelation as calling herself a 'prophetess,' took advantage of a privilege accorded to free Christian women, to shed her false, seductive, and destructive influence. That women were not appointed presbyters, is accounted for on the ground of woman's position in the society addressed. The Apostle appeals not to revelation, but to the common sense of the people, the tone of which is chiefly due to custom, to confirm his judgment in relation to covering the head. Why this appeal if that decision was dictated by revelation ? Referring the matter to their judgment of what was comely, he asks 'Doth not even nature itself teach you thus?' Ch. xi., 13. This agrees with his policy of 'becoming all things to all men, that if by any means he might gain some,' not to shock their prejudices unnecessarily. Judging from reports of travelers and historians, the present mental condition of women in Eastern countries, owing perhaps to seclusion and lack of opportunity, or the absence of spur necessity, approximates rather the state of childhood, than the strength and resources of mature age. And her administrative ability is as much less developed than that of men, as there is less demanded of her. As a consequence, society in that part of the world is stationary from generation to generation, and has little if any sympathy with the restless activity of the pushing, progressive western mind. Supposing women had shown themselves as qualified, and the customs and judgment of the people had been favorable, can any valid reason be assigned why she should not have been allowed an equal share in spiritual labors and burdens ? I can see but one reason aside from custom and habits of the people, why she was not given equal authority with man, and that is this. Woman had not then attained to the complete stature of true womanhood, nor to the same level development with man on the Christ plane, by perfecting her intel- lectual, spiritual, and administrative capacity. The perfect archetypal woman, the queen of the ages and of perfected humanity, had not yet appeared in mortal form to fulfill the prophetic sign of the woman seen in heaven, the empire of religion, clothed with the Sun of Righteousness, flooding the world with divine religious light and inspiration from the holy ones. Crowned with twelve stars, signifying her royal descent, and that she bears rule in heaven and in the new earth ; standing her full length above the moon, which here represents those ordinances of the night of nature, given to rule man in his earthly state, in the absence of the Sun, which here represents the higher and Divine revelation in Christ Jesus, and his 'Helper,' the holy spirit of Truth in a feminine counterpart. Woman in this character, which is clearly foreshadowed in the signs and types of creation and of revelation, had not made her appearance when Paul wrote. Hence he said 'We see in part and prophesy in part, but when that which is perfect has come, that which is in part shall be done away.' Here he intimates that the arrangements of his time were incomplete and temporary, and therefore to be superseded by the perfect which was still to come. Now if that perfect character has come to a few, or is unfolding in the many, will not too strict adherence to the past and incomplete, shut from view the new and 'perfect' when present, and thus repeat the mistake made by Judaizing Christians in Paul's day? Do not the signs of our time indicate that a change is taking place in relation to this matter, both in the custom of our country, and in the judgment of its people? Women are advancing to the front, and showing themselves as gifted with the power of oratory and as competent to instruct on the public platform, and to inspire masses of people with holier resolves, as are their brothers and consorts. Are they not also upright aad virtuous�their motives and aspirations uplifting�and their purpose in theright firm and determined? Is not their reason, judgment, conscience, under the inspiration of pure motives and free from constraint, as safe guides to conduct as are men's? Do we not see many bright examples which prove that the childhood of the sex is being exchanged in some, for the mature and perfect character of responsible womanhood, answerable to the Creator of both male and female, for the use made of her gifts and talents? Are those gifts bestowed to play with, and amuse juvenility, or are they designed to be used in ministering to humanity's great need ? We call the Chinese fashion of children's feet on full grown women, absurd and foolish. Is it uot a greater folly, to limit the action of mind in this enlightened age and generation, to the measure and arbitrary bylaws of two thousand years ago ? The mind of woman has grown and cannot be thrust back into nonentity. For 'the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth ; woman hath compassed man.' Even in Catholic France, M. Bautain, Professor at the Sorbonne, says 'Women naturally speak better than men. They express themselves more easily, more vividly, with more simplicity, because they feel more rapidly, and more delicately. Hence there are so many women who write in an admirable and remarkable manner, though they have studied neither rhetoric nor logic, and even without knowing grammar or orthography.' In 1875, Evelyn M. Chipman won the prize in an oratorical contest between representatives of eight Iowa Colleges. Her competitors were six men and one woman. Elizabeth C. Stanton is reported as saying 'Nothing surprises and delights me so much as to see scores of young women, coming upon the woman's rights platform, and at once stepping to the front as first-class speakers.' The report adds 'The world holds no finer orators, perhaps never has held more logical and analytical thinker^ and speakers than adorn woman's platform today.' Dr. Parker says of Miss Willard, 'Woe betide the ill-equipped exegete who crosses the path of this peaceful warrior.' With great force she says, 'It is men who have taken the simple, loving, tender gospel of the New Testament, so suited to be the proclamation of woman's lips, and translated it in terms of sacerdotalism, dogma and martyrdom. It is men who have given us the dead letter, rather than the living gospel. The Mother heart of God will never be known to the world till translated into terms of speech by motherhearted women.' (Public Opinion, June, 1888.) To all of which, I say Amen. Did Jesus forbid the much married woman of Samaria, or any other woman, to testify of him? It is not long since the papers reported a case at Harvard University, wherein a prize was offered the students for the best essay on a given topic. Out of the whole number of essays presented, the prize was awarded to one written by a woman, student in the Annex. When the names of competitors were brought forward and the judges discovered the sex of the writers, they changed the reward without recalling their decision of merit, and it was given to a man, who, according to their previous unbiassed judgment was not entitled to receive it. Because why? Did not th man need encouraging, and was he not the proper sex to wear the honors of Harvard literati? Now this one-sexed truth has not been able to lift the curse but momentarily off humanity, in thousands of years trial. For man always to ride in the saddle, and woman always to trudge afoot carrying the luggage, appears like a relic of barbarism, where all advantages are seized by the strong. We put it to you, O enlightened and magnanimous ones; is it not time to abandon dykes and dams built to confine the Truth to a one-sex channel and allow it to flow unobstructed through both sexes, till all thirsty places receive ample supply ? For was not this matter prepared by Jehovah, when he decreed that 'Woman's seed' which 'is the word of God,' whose 'word is Truth,' shall bruise or crash 'the serpent's head.' Most assuredly, that word of Truth and prophecy of future conquest which is now welling up in the wise, nourishing, Mother heart of humanity, is that 'other Comforter' which Jesus promised should guide his disciples into all truth, perfect their training, and continue with them forever.
