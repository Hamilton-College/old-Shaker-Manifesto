Groveland, N. Y. Sept. 8, 1890Dear absent Editor and friend, Elder Blinn, 'We're thinking of you, as our notes we begin; Thinking how pleasant 'twould be, could you come And collect them yourself, at our own sunny home. The Community here unite in the same, And all would rejoice whenever you came. The months that have passed since you traveled this way We'll not stop to count, though 'tis many a day. Now if you'll just come when our notes become due, We'll then have new notes we can tender to you, The greatest of strikes in our town you will hear, Are the clocks, they all strike each hour of the year. Among the many Manifesto notes made manifest, one we will just now take note of; ï¿½ he reporter from Canterbury testifies to the new and cold method of preserving rhubarb in all its summer freshness and greenness. Happily we at Grovel and are among the class known as disciples of the new and better way, advocating best systems of being and doing, thinking and acting, therefore we have tested the cold water plan for rhubarb preservation, and shall hereafter renounce the old way of saving by fire. Other fruits are found to be superior by adopting the water-cure plan: peaches, plums, apricots, quinces and many more varieties preserved in this way will long retain the flavor of newly gathered fruit. Then when winter winds blow and showers of snow Go dancing through the air, You'll have fruits that are fresh your table to bless, Healthful, delightful and fair. The sweet corn culture that for many years has been the leading occupation through the fall season, will this autumn be remembered as a venture of the past, with anticipation of its future renewal, but if not practicable to continue in the corn scheme, we hope to develope a substitute of greater revenue. The multiplied and added rain-storms of the spring and planting division of the year, was the principal medium that caused the subtraction from our long-accustomed yearly transaction, (Sweet Corn Drying.) The weeds of New York State grow as rank and tall, as big and small as those we read about and are made note of by the note perfector from Enfield, Conn. We remember a suggestion advanced in the long ago by the late Henry Ward Beecher that 'constant cultivation of weeds will ultimately eradicate them.' If Beecher had been a tiller of the soil instead of an expounder of religious theories, his declaration concerning weed life would have read thus : What we cultivate will grow, Weeds or flowers we all well know. Tuesday noon of the 26th. of the past month we were favored with the arrival of Elder Giles B. Avery, Eldress Harriet Bullard and Elizabeth Cantrell of the Mt. Lebanon Society. The following evening the family were most agreeably entertained for nearly two hours with a recital by Elder Giles of their journey through sections of Ohio and Kentucky, also their visits to the Societies in said States. The account was interesting from beginning to its close, and was listened to by an appreciative audience. Thursday morning the company left here for their own home in the East. Saturday the 30th. a party of three left home on the 4-30 P. M. train for Rochester to attend the funeral of John Siddons who for many years has been a kind and valued friend of this Society. The company followed the remains to Mount Hope cemetery, witnessing the beautiful and impressive services in honor of the worthy dead Whose life in this world was ever One of beneficent deeds, Whose soul was the Soul of goodness Unclouded by forms and creeds : Whose love, was the love of giving, Not giving for worldly fame, But living, giving and doing All for a righteous name.
