Beloved Editor:—Please accept this Christmas offering from... West Gloucester, Me. Dec. 1882 Beloved Editor:—Please accept this Christinas offering from our dear Mother Anna, who has already passed beyond her ninetieth birth day. She is yet bright and happy, and intelligent. A halo of beauty is around her. Because of the cross which she has borne, and for the purity of her life. 'Many children shall arise and call her blessed.' One reason for not sending this at an earlier date, is that our good mother took her own time, and made her own scripture references, and we waited with all patience. M. A. G.
