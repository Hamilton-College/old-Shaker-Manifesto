SERENITY. MABTHA J. ANDERSON. Mount silent muse ! thy loftiest strain employ, Like Orpheus, tune to praise thy silver lute, Till nature's strongest passions, dumb and mute, Shall baffle not the soul's serenest joy. O bliss ineffable! shall sin destroy The growth that springs from love's pure root, The harmony that bears such blessed fruit, The soul to satiate, but never cloy? Look up! from sordid self and low complaining, The spring-time wakes to life earth's noblest powers; The clustering fruit hides in the cradled flowers; O'er all creation life and beauty's reigning. Take lessons in these bright and passing hours, Let good the ascendency be gaining. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
