Campanini's Advice to Singers. 'My advice to all singers is: Do not impose upon yourself and you will preserve your voice,' says Campanini, in a striking article 'How to train the voice', in the November Ladies' Home Journal. 'Good health is necessary to keep a voice in good condition. Dissipation of any kind is of the greatest injury to a voice. The vocal chords are very sensitive and susceptible, and what affects the physical condition will sooner or later affect them. What regimen a singer should follow depends upon the constitution. Some singers can smoke continuously and not suffer from the effects, while others have been seriously injured. It is, therefore, very hard to lay down any cast-iron rules and'say that they should be followed. What is poison, you know, for some, is food for others. 'Again I must urge young singers to beware of trying to force their voices; it is dangerous and means the early loss of the voice. The man who builds an organ would not think of having some one try to play on it when the reeds are not properly adjusted, and in like manner the young singer should not tax his voice unless he is prepared to stand the effort. 'Amateurs and non-professionals do not of course, require the long and rigorous training of professionals. It would be a waste of time and money, and Avhile it might be a satisfaction to the young lady or young man to have a professional education, in a few years, through lack of constant practice, he or she would probbly sink to the level of the perfunctory parlor singer.'
