A COMPLIMENT. Abraham Perkins. I hail the 'Shaker Manifesto' in its monthly orbit with anxiety, and always with great satisfaction. As diminutive as it externally appears, it is a luminary, a star in the heavens of no ordinary magnitude, which I hope may never be suffered to go down. Its light cannot be mistaken, and serves as an important missionary in the field of true Christian progress. The late addition of Society items, are of interest, and like a dessert at the feast-table. By these histories, as brief as they may be, we have epistles which serve to bring kindred souls nearer to each other, and well calculated to increase our interest in each other's welfare and to strengthen our holy union. I trust each Society of our order will be liberal in its contributions. Enfield N. H.
