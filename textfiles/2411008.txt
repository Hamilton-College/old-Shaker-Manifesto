FAITH. By Mabel E. Lane. While on the sea of life, what faith is mine, I walk upon the wave, nor fear the tide; When earth-born ebon clouds arise and hide The azure sky, like Bethlehem's star 'twill shine And lead the way to perfect light, divine. 'Tis like the form of Christ when storms betide, It whispers to the soul, 'Oh e'er abide In God, and kneel at Truth's pure, sacred shrine.' The voice of doubt speaks not of holy peace, Nor of the gifts we covet as the best. Thus while I hold this light within my breast My soul shall know no failing, but increase In that pure way whose blessings ne'er will cease, Not e'en when passing life's severest test. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
