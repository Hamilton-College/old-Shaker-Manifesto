BROAD CHRISTIANITY It is the most brilliant feature in the theological world to-day, to notice the depth and breadth now being assumed by a genuine, rational, consistent Christianity â€” that of dissolving party and churchal lines among prominent leaders of heretofore strongly biased sects. It is a very bold assumption for certain prominents of 'close communion' Baptists and 'straight lined ' Presbyterians, to declare it high time for a closer union of the churches; and that unless a fruitful move is made in this direction, churchal influences are barriers to religious progress, rather than assistants! The call is abroad, and it is a happy omen indeed, to let religion sink so much deeper than mere theology that the latter will sink into oblivion by the continued presence of a rational religion. This move certainly threatens to rob Christianity of the barnacles of sectarian theology; and making the distinctions between right and wrong no less significant, make brotherly love and union the basis of a new creation of a practical religion among men. All hail!
