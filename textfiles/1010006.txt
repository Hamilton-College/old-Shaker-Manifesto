SURE TO WIN DANIEL ORCUTT The true crossbearer is sure to win in this life of ours. If you regard the rights of others as well as your own; if you are modest and unassuming; if you are virtuous and truthful, you are sure to win, while others, with equal abilities, may fail. This is where ' the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong ;' this is what society is socking for, and it is astonishing how much people may win, who possess these qualities. The holy Savior won his bright crown only by personal exertion. Oh ! how worthy of imitation ! '' What has been done can be done again.' Only those who battle for the right, the true and the pure, ' wear the Christian's crown.' A pure life is the greatest victory on earth. ' Be wise in time that you may be happy in eternity.' Start right, and the battle is half won. A constant warfare and the victory is yqurs. Do not despair at slow progress ; little by little great things have come to pass. Life, and great things are made up of little things, and little things often lead to great results. ' Despise not the day of small things.' This earth is made up of little particles. The great ocean is composed of little drops of water. ' The sunshine of life is made of little beams, that are bright all the time.' The little bees, how much honey they gather! Be not discouraged because you are little. A little star shining brightly in a dark night may be the means of saving many a poor sailor from shipwreck ; and little people may do much good if they will try. There is nothing like trying. 'Iwill try ' has worked wonders. Bear in mind the maxim,' where there's a will there's a way.' Enfield, Conn.
