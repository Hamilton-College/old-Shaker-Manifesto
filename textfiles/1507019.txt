KIND WORDS. They never blister the tongue or lips, and we have never heard of any mental trouble arising from this source. Though, they do not cost much, yet they accomplish much. They help ones own good nature and good-will. Soft words soften our own souls. Angry words are fuel to the flame of wrath and make it blaze more fiercely. Kind words make other people good natured. Cold words freeze, people and hot words scorch them, and bitter words and wrathful words make them wrathful. There is such a rush of all other kinds of words, in our day. that it seems desirable to give kind words a place among them. There are vain words, idle words, hasty words, spiteful words, silly words, empty words, profane words, boisterous words and warlike words. Kind words produce their image in men's souls and soothe and quiet the hearer. They shame him out of his own sour, morose, unkind feeling. Pascal
