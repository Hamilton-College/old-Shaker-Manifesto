Shaker Station, Ct. Aug. 1895. Jesus said, 'In the world ye shall find tribulation, but in me ye shall find peace.' There is no shield from sin and trouble in a worldly life. Thousands are seeking for happiness and peace in sinful pleasure, but they find it not, that aching void is still in the heart. Sin promises joy, but pays sorrow. Denying self brings a peace which passeth understanding and joy never ending. The path of virtue is the way in which we should walk. Let us exemplify in daily life that which is true and virtuous. Have a noble aim in view, and strive to live up to it. Work in harmony with others and do all you can to progress in the right direction physically, morally and spiritually. It is by united effort that all progress hns been made and lasting good accomplished. 'The largest orange tree in the South is a gigantic specimen which grows in Louisiana. It is fifty feet high and fifteen feet in circumference at the base. Its yield has often been ten thousand oranges per season.' 'The largest apple tree in New York state is said to be one standing near the town of Wilson. It was planted in the year 1815, and it is on record that it once yielded thirty-three barrels of apples in a single season.' 'Cans made of paper pulp are being introduced to take the place of tin cans for containing all kinds of preserved products. The occasional cases of poisoning from canned goods is due to the contents becoming tainted through the cans not being air tight.'' Daniel Or cult.
