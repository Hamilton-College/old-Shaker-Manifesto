NOT A BAD STORY The building committee of a church recently finished in New Jersey, wanted a stone slab over the door, with the name of the church and a scriptural motto. It occurred to them that nothing could be neater than 'My house shall be called the house of prayer.' So one of the committeemen, who was in a great hurry, told the stonecutter to chisel on the slab the thirteenth verse of the twenty-first chapter of Matthew. He thought the verse ended with the words he wanted to use. The stonecutter took the whole verse from the Bible, and faithfully copied it to the end. Imagine the horror of the committeemen when the stone was delivered [ It read: ' My house shall be called the house THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 287 of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.' The stonecutter insisted that he had obeyed orders. But the committeemen insisted that the motto he had inscribed was not what they wanted, and that it would be of no particular use to them. That slab is now in the stonecutter's yard, and any body who wants it for a tombstone can probably buy it cheap. â€”New York Catholic.
