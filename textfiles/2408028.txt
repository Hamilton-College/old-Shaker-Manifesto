Making a Suburban Home FOOLING WITHOUT AN AECHITECT. The ideal suburbanite has no time to fool with an architect; he supervises the construction of that house himself, writes Robert J. Burdettein an exceedingly numerous article on 'Making a Suburban Home' in the July Ladies' Home Journal. A laudable and loving ambition, for is it not his home? The workmen are pleased with this arrangement; it takes them about five minutes to ascertain just how much less than nothing it is possible for a man to know about house building, and yet be able to distinguish an augur hole from a mortise. When he speaks of 'jice' as 'joists' they take his measure. And when he calls 'studd'n' 'scantling,' he is up to his knees in the consomme, and getting in deeper at every step. But blessed be the placid bliss of perfect ignorance, he doesn't know it. He is serenely happy. He prowls about that house getting into trouble at every turn. He falls through the first floor 'jice' and abrades his happy shins. He looks up to see what is the matter when the down-trodden sons of toil on the second floor shout 'Look out below !' and catches a hatchet-handle in his eye. He walks under the scaffolding when the plasterers are at work, and gets gouts of mortar on top of his new hat and down the back of his neckbut what of that? The mocking laughter of the busy 'mud-wasps' disturbs lim not; he joins in it, merriest of them all. Is it not his own hat and his own neck? And oh, bliss of the blistered, is it not his own mortar?
