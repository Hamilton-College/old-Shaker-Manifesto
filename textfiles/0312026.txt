ELDER RICHARD BUSHNELL He brought a glorious manhood to the strife, And gave it freely, with a noble will: He made a consecration of his life, And bade ambition's trumpet-voice be still: For he had powers that would have gain'd the fame, The wealth, the honors, that the world bestows. But better far, to him, was lot and name Among the people that his conscience chose. He came to them with zealous heart and hand, Made all their interests his absorbing care; Strong in his faitli, met persecution's band, Yet held his heart in lowly strains of prayer • The clash of elements that round him rung, Awoke his energies to fight within — To strive for conquest — while his life was young, And evermore to wage a war with sin. In thought, and power to sii'ay, he was a king; He won a royal priesthood by his zeal. His soul was gentle as an angel's wing. Yet it was keen as Truth's incisive steel. Before him, malice (supplicating) knelt, And bitter envy laid her face in dust; While bold assailants lost their rage, and felt To seek for pardon, half convinced they must. He gave forgiveness as the morn gives light; He gave his love as seasons give their fruit; He bless'd with tenderness, rebuked with might Quell'd human passions till their waves were mute. And, when his autumn crimson'd to its close, We saw the garner'd treasures he had found ; We felt his soul's unspeakable repose, And knew his spirit was with vict'ry crown'd. We '11 miss his cheery voice, and kindly smile ; We'll miss the hands whose industry we prize; We '11 call him often, in the little while That from our home to hie so misty lies. O father, as we bid adieu to thee, Our heart-strings vibrate with a plaintive swell: Our love, upwelling, gushing, warm, and free, Shall reach thy spirit wheresoe'er it dwell. What though the years made halos in thy hair, And carved their furrows on thy open brow ; They could not give thy heart one rankling care ; Thy life was true, and thou art Messed now!
