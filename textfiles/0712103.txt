Hold on, boys. â€”-Hold on to your tongue when you are just ready to swear, lie, or speak harshly, or use an improper word. Hold on to your foot when you are on the point of kicking, running off from study, or pursuing the path of error, shame or crime. Hold on to your temper when you are angry, excited or imposed upon, or others are angry with you. Hold on to your heart when evil associates seek your company, and invite you to join in their mirth, games and revelry. Hold on to your good name at all times, for it is of more value than gold, high places, or fashionable attire. Hold on to truth, for it will sei-ve you well, and do you through eternity. Hold on to virtue, for it is above all price to you, in all times and in all places. Hold on to your good character, for it is, and ever will be, your best wealth.
