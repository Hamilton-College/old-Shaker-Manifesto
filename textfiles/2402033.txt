UNNOTICED BIRDS. [Contributed by Eldress Harriet Goodwin.]Bieds of peace and hope and love Come flittering earthward from above, To settle on life's window sills And lift our load of earthly ills. But we in traffic's rush and din, Too deep engaged to let them in, With deaden'd hearts and sense plod on Nor know our loss, till they are gone. ï¿½By Paul Lawrence Dunbar.
