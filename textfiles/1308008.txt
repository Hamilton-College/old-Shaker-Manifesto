'THY WILL BE DONE.' AURELIA MACE. Is there any reserve in this ? And can 'Thy Kingdom come' unless the will of God is done ? That heavenly Kingdom which we have been so long striving to attain, and so many have fallen in the fearful struggle. Are we able to take it by violence and hold it? We believe that the Holy City, the New Jerusalem hath come down from God out of heaven, and we are privileged spiritually to walk its lovely streets. Here wrangling and confusion are very much out of place, and what would be our appearance in soiled and ragged garments ? Our spiritual robes cannot be clean and white unless we live in purity in thought, word and deed. We have been assured that there are angel bands, who march through the heavens, and surround the Throne of the Highest. How could these be held together unless there was perfect order, and each had his place assigned him and kept himself in it? Do they not resign their spirits, and say, 'Thy will be done ?' So also we must resign our spirits, and cheerfully follow that 'cloud by day and pillar of fire by night' which goes before the Chosen People, as they travel away from the wilderness of sin. 'The tabernacle of God is with man.'' Believing this, we find God in our union and joining to His saints. Separate our spirits from them and we are lost. 'He that overcometh will I make a pillar in the Temple of my God, and he shall go no more out; and I will write upon him a new name.' This promise is for us if we are worthy ; if not others will take our places. Let us reserve nothing for self, but with full purpose of heart, resolve to carry out, a perfect consecration in our daily lives, 'Thy will be done,' and realize the blessings that will be sure to follow.
