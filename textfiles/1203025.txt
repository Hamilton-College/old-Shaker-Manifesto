THE SPIRIT WORLD JOSEPH W. NYE The spirit world is not afar, As taught in ancient song and story; Alone beyond the farthest star, Lies not the realm of bliss and glory. Around us here and everywhere Though not discerned by mortal vision, Are 'angels ever bright and fair,' Celestial scenes and fields elysian. They have not goneâ€”those we call dead, And laid away with grief and weeping; As softly by their mounds we tread, We say, 'Not dead but sweetly sleeping.' Nor yet asleep ! awake, they move Among us none the less, and ever Are drawing us by cords of love, Which death no power hath to sever. Veiled by the flesh, we do not see The glory all around us beaming! The veil will drop, the shadows flee Before the light forever streaming! Then will all souls, from earthly thrall Released, forevermore be singing, And God at last be 'all in all,' His love and peace to all hearts bringing. O, triumph grand of truth and love! Then Faith beholds its full fruition, When all the earth and heaven above Will see fulfilled the Saviour's mission ! Lynn, Mass,
