EVERY YEAR The Spring has less of brightness Every year, And the snow a ghastlier whiteness Every year; Nor do Summer's flowers quicken, Nor Autumn's fruitage thicken As they once did, for we sicken Every year. It is growing darker, colder, Every year; As the heart and soul grow older, Every year. I care not now for dancing, Or for eyes with passion glancing, Love is less and less entrancing Every year. Of the loves and sorrows blended Every year; Of the joys of friendship ended Every year ; Of the ties that still might bind me Until time to death resigned me, My infirmities remind me, Every year. Oh ! how sad to look before us, Every year, While the cloud grows darker o'er us, Every year ! When we see the blossoms faded That to bloom we might have aided, And immortal garlands braided, Every year. To the past go more dead faces Every year ; Come on new ones in their places Every year. Everywhere the sad eyes meet us, In the evening's dusk they greet us, And to come to them entreat us, _ Every year. ' You are growing old,' they tell us, ' Every year; You are more alone,' they tell us, ' Every year. You can win no new affection, You have only recollection, Deeper sorrow and dejection, Every year.' Thank God ! no clouds are shifting, Every year, O'er the land to which we're drifting, Every year. No losses there will grieve us, Nor loving faces leave us, Nor death of friends bereaves us, Every year.
