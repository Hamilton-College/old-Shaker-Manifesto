West Pittsfield, Mass. May, 1896. As we look around us we are led to think of the wonderous changes two short months can make. Fields that when we last called at the 'Home Corner,' were but white, frozen plains, are now teeming with verdure. The trees have exchanged their white garments for graceful and attractive suits of many colors. The birds have once more joined usT and the twittering of the sparrows, the chirping of the friendly robin, the piping of the bluebird and sweet melodies of the oriole, are heard from trees and hedges. It is indeed a pleasant change. As the season for obtaining maple sap arrived, a season which has generally failed to receive a celebration in our locality, our young brother, Kudolph Kirsten became anxious to obtain some of the sweets, and in spite of many prophecies of failure, tapped fifty trees, and for two weeks obtained from them a good supply of excellently flavored sap, which after being duly subjected to the necessary boi ing and purifying, gave as a result about twenty gallons of syrup. Elder Louis, who has been spending a month at Florida, we were glad to welcome in our home once more, and we listened with interest to his description of the 'Flowery Land,' which has ever held forth so many inducements to the stranger, since the days when the search for the 'Spring of Immortal Youth,'' was instigated. Housecleaning is nearly completed. For several weeks the fever raged, each day finding some new place for an attack, and so continued until all places to locate itself were nearly exhausted when it moderated, and is now in a quiet state of convalescence. Brother Ira, who though constantly employed with many duties still is ever ready to do an act of kindness, has furnished us a long hose which will easily carry water to every flower garden on the lawn, thus making the task of keeping the soil moist much pleasanter.
