'THANK YOU.' IT is a lamentable fact that the word of hearty thanks is exprest by so few people. How often is it that we show some one a courtesy, do some friend a favor, only to find it past unnoticed. The intention of the recipient to say 'thank you' may be of the best, but the fact remains that it is not said. An intention is a very laudable thing, but when it remains an intention, and nothing more, it becomes the reverse of being laudable. Too many intentions die with their conception. We mean well enough, no doubt. We say to ourselves, 'I must thank So-and-So,' and our resolution is undoubtedly good. Then something transpires, the 'thank you' is delayed, and what is the result? It is never saidor, if it is said, it is said so long after the time when it should have been that the saying has lost all its flavor and acceptance. And yet these delayed 'thank you's, these unexprest thanks, this acceptance of courtesies, as our right, is fast becoming a fixt habit. It was only a few days since that a physician was askt by a friend to grant him a favor. The favor was granted, and the next day came a note of thanks. 'There,' said the physician to me, 'that is the first time in thirty years of practice that I have ever received a note of thanks from a man to whom I have shown a favor. And yet in those thirty years I have given free advice, have lent my time and my services without pay to hundreds of people.' 'Odd, isn't it, how people take as their due what they really have not the remotest right to ask or expect?' Exceptional experience? No, not at all. On the contrary, it is a most common one.
