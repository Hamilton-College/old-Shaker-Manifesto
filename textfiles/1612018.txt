With this number we close the sixteenth volume of our little monthly. For sixteen years it has traveled from city to city and from village to village as a messenger of '' good news and glad tidings,' and has told as best it could the story of God's love for man. It has encouraged the manifestation of the spirit of Christ, as we have learned it and as his own words have testified. ' By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.' Through the medium of Kind Words, from prayerful hearts, that have been received from time to time, we are pleased to believe that the good seed has been sown in many precious souls and that it will, in turn, afford a satisfactory and bountiful harvest in faith and good works, as a blessing for man and a praise-offering to God.
