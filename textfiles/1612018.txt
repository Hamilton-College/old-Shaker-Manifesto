NOTES WORK FOR THE RIGHT. During the past month, matters of deep interest in the religious world, have been transpiring, as some of the would be wise men of the church have voted to themselves a right to a heavenly habitation, and at the same time voted that a certain class, whom they love to call heathen, have no right to enter our Father's house of many mansions. Jt is an amusing instance of assumed authority, which can only end in a display of many words. The penitent heathen will probably go down to his house justified, while the Christian Pharisee stands boasting of his pious ceremonies. Churchal power as manifested in manmade creeds has no vitality which need cause the least anxiety. So long as the righteous man shall receive the righteous man's reward, names, nor sects nor parties can have but little influence in effecting a change. u A good man out of the good treasures of his heart brings forth 2;ood things' whether he be white or black, or whether he lives in America, Asia or Africa. This agitation of an old system of effete theology revives the history of a medieval age, when creedal authority determined through force what a man should believe in this world, and then assigned him a place of happiness or misery in the world to come, in accordance with their own selfish wills. The simple testimony of Jesus is far more preferable. Seek the righteousness that belongs to the kingdom of God, and make not to yourselves, friends of the mammon of unrighteousness. This religious thought of the divine Teacher, pointed unerringly to a life above the pleasures of this world, and this was the saving grace that led the sons and daughters of Belial to become the children of the living God. The growth of goodness in the mind had ever led to the same results. An Israelite in whom there was no guile was certainly on the road that leads to God, and probably quite as sure of successfully reaching the holy city as a sensual Christian might be who worshiped in some creedal church. 'If the wicked man restore the pledge, give again that he hath robbed, walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live, he shall not die.' This promise of God as given by the prophet, was a divine encouragement for every one to lead a good life, to turn from unrighteousness and learn to live with God,�forever. With the privileges of a more advanced age, we are commissioned with greater responsibilities. The light that has come into the world should be a guide in our path, and with this we should teach an exceeding righteousness, which has for TERMS. THE its foundation the cross of our Lord, Jesus Christ. It may not be within our province to say what shall become of those who differ from us in religious belief, and those who arrogate to themselves this l'ight, show very plainly what course they would take, if they only had the power to exercise it. In all confidence, however, we may accept the words of Jesus, that whoever �hall keep the commandments and teach men so to do, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Let us as the wise virgins have our lamps trimmed and burning, and keep our souls unspotted from the world, that the testimony which has been committed to our charge may not be lost through any neglect on our part. God has given to us an inheritance of which we need not be ashamed ; a new earth and a new heaven wherein shall dwell righteousness and peace. The faithful maintenance of this sacred inheritance is our crown of glory,�our happiness now and our reward of eternal life. With this number we close the sixteenth volume of our little monthly. For sixteen years it has traveled from city to city and from village to village as a messenger of '' good news and glad tidings,' and has told as best it could the story of God's love for man. It has encouraged the manifestation of the spirit of Christ, as we have learned it and as his own words have testified. ' By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.' Through the medium of Kind Words, from prayerful hearts, that have been received from time to time, we are pleased to believe that the good seed has been sown in many precious souls and that it will, in turn, afford a satisfactory and bountiful harvest in faith and good works, as a blessing for man and a praise-offering to God.
