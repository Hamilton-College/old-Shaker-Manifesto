PROGRESS: MULTUM IN PARVO J. JESSE FONDA Love is life. Harmony is heaven — only in a heavenly state of mind, can heaven come to any. Jesus' prayers brought angels to him, not to us. Jesus' merits saved him. Our merits will save us. Each soul is a manger, cradling a saviour—God in us. The blood of one cannot atone for the sin of another. Good results can only flow from being good. Every thing seems to have been formed spheroidal— having a mundane and spiritual existence — a principle to pass from one sphere to another. The highest spherical attainment culminates in the acme of wisdom — God — and is the throne, whence comes all law of heaven. Keeping the law of the sphere occupied must result in the highest happiness of that sphere. Violation of law is sin, and brings hell to the participant. The Christ follower is a progressive being, passing on from sphere to sphere. He travails, and by practical demonstrations ignites ' a refining fire' — ending in regeneration — thorough spirituality. Each stage of progression, being an advance from the one abandoned, must not only enjoy all the light that preceded it, but must combine with the new light, forming another series, and causing an iridescent atmosphere, that introduces new laws of government, expanded views of true enjoyment; new actions, thought, language — the gross having passed ' the refining fire' and appears as ' tried gold.' There are a vast number of ' hermeneutics' who desire us to adopt their peculiar ways of thinking; but it is preferable to let inspiration be its own solvent, and by fulfilling the laws of the highest sphere to which we have attained, exercise our acknowledged right to 'prove all things and hold fast to that which is good.'
