HOW TO LIVE He liveth long who liveth well ! All other life is short and vain. He liveth longest who can tell Of living most for heavenly gain. He liveth long who liveth well ! All else is being flung away: He liveth longest who can tell Of true things truly done each day. Waste not thy being; back to Him Who freely gave it, freely give; Else is that being but a dream â€” 'Tis but to be, and not to live. Be wise, and use thy wisdom well; Who wisely speaks must live it too. He is the wisest who can tell How first he lived, then spoke the true. Be what thou seemest; live thy creed; Hold up to earth the torch divine; Be what thou prayest to be made; Let the great Master's steps be thine. Fill up each hour with what will last; Buy up the moments as they go; The life above when this is past, Is the ripe fruit of life below. Sow truth, if thou the truth would'st reap; Who sows the false shall reap the vain; Erect and sound thy conscience keep; From hollow words and deeds refrain. Sow love, and taste its fruitage pure; Sow peace, and reap its harvest bright; Sow sunbeams on the rock and moor, And find the harvest-home of light.
