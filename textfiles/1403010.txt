MY SHAKER HOME. JOSEPH E. RHODES. Embosomed mid the inirplc vine, Close by a lucid, cooling stream, Sweet flowerets round my casements twine Kiss'd by the morning's sunny beam. Adown the mead the lowing herd. And in the brook the minnows play, While from each tree, some happy bird 'Pours forth its joyous roundelay; The towering elms like guardians stand, And woo me to their cool retreat; Ten thousand flowers bedeck the land, And fill the air with perfume sweet. 'Tis here ray wanderings all shall end, Contented, I no more will roam ; But pray as thus my knees I bend, God bless our happy Shaker home. 'Tis not because that home is fair, And all my wants are well supplied,ï¿½ A nobler feeling binds me here, 'Tis love refined and purified. The love of God most justly due Calls forth my warmest songs of praise, And as myself my neighbor too Must share with me that love always. 0 heaven-born love ! thy holy bliss The carnal mind can never know ; Who find the sweetness cannot miss The earthly joys that come and go. 'Tis this we call the s-econd birth Thus to be filled with heavenly love, It breaks the ties which bind to earth, And trains our souls for homes above. Angel of love, outspread thy wing, And may our numbers soon increase By those who come God's praise to sing, And join our home of love and peace. Shirley, Mass.
