He who sits and looks... He who sits and looks on the palpitating world, and feels his heart swell in him large enough to hold all men within it, is near his great Creator's standard, though he dwell outside the pale of churches, and knows not a feast day from a fast . day, or a line of Scripture even. Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
