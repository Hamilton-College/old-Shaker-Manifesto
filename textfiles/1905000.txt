PRACTICAL COMMUNISM. Antoinette Doolittle. The Apostle Paul�one of the greatest expounders of primitive Spiritualism�said, 'There are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit.' He recommended the exercise of all spiritual gifts ; but pointed to Faith, Hope and Charity, as the most enduring, and exhorted the people to covet the best gifts: Charity in his estimation was the greatest of all. If Charity means the covering up and hiding many sins, then the people of the nineteenth century possess it to a large degree; but if it be love that worketh no ill to a neighbor, or to any human being, we are left to judge by fruits manifest, that there is a great deficiency ; and is a most needed gift at the present time, to teach us how to be just to ourselves and to others. We have many learned teachers and philosophers in our day, as wise as ancient sages. People listen to finely framed speeches and theories, but they lack salt�the saving element,�and many want stronger proof of the reality of spiritual things. The dry husks of theology do not feed and satisfy the immortal part, and they ask for bread� living bread. They desire to know if God lives to-day, and is a rewarder of those who seek Him; if the creating, vivifying Spirit that gave form and action to the inner and outer worlds�the all-wise Father and loving Mother�can be approached by finite beings now, and by what media. Evidently the spiritual waters are moving and a power is at work to bring order out of the chaos now existing in what may be termed spiritual Babylon, where confusion of ideas, and confounding of theological tenets, serve to darken counsel, and exclude from many truth-seeking souls, the practical religion of the lowly Jesus, and his baptized followers. There are upheavals and convulsions in society, in every department of life, civil, social and religious. Plunderers of the national treasury, are found in the capitol of the United States ; and many of the first trusted officers of our civil government, have proved themselves unworthy the public confidence reposed in them. And it is said, by those who ought to know, that it is barely possible under the present system, to impeach a high official, or for an honest man long to exist as an honest man in the city of Washington, society is so perverted. In large cities, rings are formed millions strong, and so firmly welded together, that it remains to be seen whether there is legal power sufficient to break them. Craft and cunning to a large degree, have taken the place of justice and honest labor. In the social and domestic relations of life, bonds which in the past were thought to be almost invulnerable, are now severed as if made of straw. Old theologies are trembling; they have been weighed in the balance of truth and are found wanting of saving power and life-giving energy. They do not supply the soul needs, which are as real as those of the body. When we are in need of temporal food, theories and shadows do not suffice ; we want something tangible to our senses, that we can grasp, eat and digest, that will invigorate and strengthen the physical system : So is it in a spiritual point of view. We who are solving the great problem of community life upon a religious basis, toiling with our hands that we may eat the bread of industry, and planting vineyards, and under the blessing of God gathering fruit therefrom, feel a deep interest in every reformatory movement that tends to practical Christianity wherever it may be; and our earnest prayer is, that the Christ Spirit may descend upon, and abide with the people as a purifier, and dethrone the man of sin that has so long claimed a seat in his temple. We pray that the churches may become so pure that the waters of life may issue from their thresholds, and that the spiritual tide may rise higher and higher. If God be our friend and protector why fear to trust Him? Why not bring all the tithes�without reserve�into the great temple of truth, throw open the windows of our souls and let the sunlight of heaven shine in ? and learn to be true to ourselves and just to our neighbor ; be what we would like others to think we are ; then it will matter little by what name we are called. When the churches are thus prepared, those who gather to them will be elevated to communion with saints. Society will be purified�regenerated�gross sensuality, intemperance, monopoly and war will decrease, and we shall have a clearer moral atmosphere ; there will be fewer assas.^ins and thieves,�pri-ons and dungeons, crowded with felons,� and criminal courts open to convict more, while executioners are waiting to send many to untimely graves. All who judge truly, see that crime is not decreased in this way, but in effect it is demoralizing. We need a revival as deep and soul stirring, as on that memorable peutecostal day, when the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the believing Jews who were of oue heart and mind, waiting and watching for the promised Comforter�the quickening Spirit�that would lead them into greater degrees of truth. The spiritual power was so great, that it not only shook the house wherein they had assembled, but their souls and bodies were effectually shaken ; for the baptizing spirit that was sent unto them, convicted them of sin, and taught them that selfishness, and the lusts of the wTorld were incompatible with true Christianity, and must be relinquished, if they would inherit Christ's kingdom, and reap life everlasting. They were directed by the Christ Spirit, to go and sell their private selfish possessions, and form a community home upon the basis of virgin purity, non-resistance, love to God, and to their brethren and sisters. They did not spend their energies in reasoning against the Spirit's call ; but Paul-like, were straight-way obedient unto the heavenly vision, avjd gathered into communistic relations, and .shared together, rich and poor; ate of one bread at one table. Was not that the communion of Saints in very deed? They were not satisfied to put the new wine of the kingdom into old bottles in the Jewish synagogues. The spirit called them to come out and be separate, to organize upon a new foundation and form new relations ; not for the purpose of destroying the law and the prophets, but enable them to drop the weaknesses and imperfections of old institutions, and make room for new laws given by a higher teacher than Moses. That revival was out-wrought in life practice, and did more to convict the unconverted Jews, than thousands of sermons would do, unaccompanied by works. And such a revival in our midst today, would be more effective in lessening crime, than all the criminal courts and capital punishment. If the question be asked, 'How shall we obtain this heavenly baptism?' It is held in reserve for those who are tired of serving earthly idols, and are willing, by the aid of spirit power to break them in pieces. Firstly, elevate labor, and make it honorable by taking part in it, and helping to bear the burdens of life in every department; let honest labor take the place of fashionable stealth; and tear down the partition walls that have been reared between the rich and poor, without reference to virtue and integrity; let all gather where they have strewed, reap where they have sowed, and enjoy the blessing of 'life, liberty and happiness.' Let woman who through long centuries in the past, has given her best and noblest powers of mind and body, to fascinate and serve man, cast off her shackles�break the bands that have held her in servitude so long, and lift her heart above idolatry and self-pleasing, into the arena of noble thought and action ! Let her come forth and represent herself�express her own ideas, if she have any, in her own way, though simple they may be, and unlike the learned and eloquent speeches which fall from the lips of men who have drawn their inspiration chiefly from books and colleges. This should not be woman's aim, but to reach the heart's affections through divine love, and stir the soil therein, and quicken the germs of the spiritual nature, should be her chief object. And let those who still feel that their highest duty is to bend over the cradle, and make market for soothing syrups, quietly rest in seclusion, trusting to fate and the popular opinion of by-gone ages, i. e. 'to keep silence, and learn of their husbands at hame.' And those who feel that they have a higher mission to perform, will see the need of placing their feet upon true principle and lifting their hearts above a cold world's scorn, trusting God's ministering angels to aid them while on their errand of love and mercy to humanity, and especially to their own sex, who are ignorantly or wilfully on the highway to ruin. If in virtue's name we plead the cause of the down-trodden and oppressed, and raise a high standard of moral purity, and seek to gather the lowly and uplift the fallen to that standard, and hold them if possible, by the hand of love until a change be effected, and they are secure from temptation, we shall not only feel that there is rejoicing with the angels in the heavenly world over such a saved repentant soul, but our joy will also be replete. Nor would we ask for a brighter star to gild the crown that may be ours in the heavenly home, when the shadows of earth shall pass from our sight, and the sun go down to rise no more to us on this side the river.
