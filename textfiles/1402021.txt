THE COVERED BRIDGE. BY DAVID BARKER. Tell the fainting soul and the weary form There's a world of the purest bliss, That is linked as the soul and form are linked, By a Covered Bridge with this. Yet to reach that realm on the other shore We must pass through a transient gloom, And must walk unseen, unhelped and alone, Through that Covered Bridgethe tomb. But we all pass over on equal terms, For the universal toll Is the outer garb which the hand of God Has flung around the soul. Though the eye is dim and the Bridge is dark, And the river it spans is wide, Yet faith points through to a shining mount That looms on the other side. To enable our feet in the next day's march To climb up that golden ridge, We must all lie down for one night's rest, Inside of the Covered Bridge.Selected.
