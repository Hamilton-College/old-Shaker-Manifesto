The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for Dec. is largely the Messenger of sorrow which will reach the homes of a large class of the readers of the Journal. The first mentioned, is the death of Prof. Nelson Sizer, the President of the American Institute of Phrenology. It is said of him 'So remarkably tender, subtle and electric were his feelings that he could call forth a tear or a smile in quick succession. He will be missed in all lands by all classes. The untimely death of Henry George has been the sorrow of thousands of his friends. 'Pure in motive, high minded, absolutely devoted to the service of his fellowrnen, he has fallen battling against the tyranny and corruption of one-man power.' The great Journalist, Charles A. Dana has also past beyond time. His whole life has been in the interest of humanity and he is said to be 'the greatest all around newspaper man America has ever produced.' The duchess of Teck or Princess Mary endeared herself to the hearts of the English people and few have workt so hard so indef atigably and unselfishly as this noble woman has done for years. An article bearingjthe name of Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher, is also found in this number. These several notices are all illustrated with portraits of the individuals which will make the Journal one of special interest. Much other valuable reading will also be found in the Dec. number.
