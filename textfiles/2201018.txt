Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Average of Weather at Mt. Lebanon. November. Thermometer. Bain. Snow. 1890. 36.36 15-16 in. 12 in. 1891. 35.98 3 in. 1 in. Geo. M. W. Dec. 1891. Since so many are responding to the earnest invitation to send Home Notes, interesting brevity becomes us all: so I add my rose-leaf to the brimming glass knowing as of old, that it will not overflow. Since last writing our weathers here have changed; more clouds out and fewer in. Gentle and dashing rains have added to our water supply and still more would be beneficial. In our home, blessings have followed sacrifice, for our dear Eldress Ann is restored again to as good health as her advanced age will permit, and she is still among us, a ministering angel of love, blessing and peace. Sister Fannie Tyson, who removed from the North Family into the Church Family during the recent changes, is another of our home blessings, an exemplification of the beautiful fruits of the spirit; while our dear Eldress Dorothy, successor to Eldress Augusta, and our loved companion from early childhood, is a treasure. We have also many more in our home whose light is quietly yet steadily shining out over the sometimes troubled waters of life whose aid has guided us over many reefs and breakers, and with such strength have we not the hope to say A Happy New Year to all.
