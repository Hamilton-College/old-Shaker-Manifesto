Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly The Christinas number of Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly is brimful of attractive articles and entertaining stories for the festal season. The number opens with a Christmas story by Frank R. Stockton, entitled Old Applejoy's Ghost; which contains a particularly clever idea workt out in Mr. Stockton's wellknown pleasing manner. It is illustrated with three full page drawings by George Wright. This is followed by the second paper in the magazine's important series on Andrew Jackson, and his times and compatriots, taking up this month Andrew Jackson as a Mili- tary Commander, written by A. Oakey Hall, and containing portraits and views and an excellent picture of Jackson spending Christmas Day, in 1814, by H. M. Eaton. Hunter MacCulloch contributes an entertaining paper on The Music of Christmas time, which is made particularly interesting by the insertion in the text of reproductions of the music of some of the old time songs and carols. Famous Ranchos of the San Gabriel Valley, writ ten by Beatrice Bellido de Luna, has many fine illustrations. Perhaps the most important article in the number is one on The Baptists, in which General T. J. Morgan, Corresponding Secretary of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, describes the history, growth and creed of that religious body in this country. It is the first of a series of articles on the Religious Denominations of Amer ica. There are other interesting articles; sev eral short stories in addition to the one by Frank R. Stockson, contributed by Amelia E. Barr and Margaret E. Sangster; poems by Ella Wheeler Wilcox and Minna Irving; an attractive department for the boys and girls, etc., etc.â€”Frank Leslie's Publishing House, New York.
