Letter Box Dear Editor;—I enjoy reading the letters in... Enfield, N. H. Dear Editor;—I enjoy reading the letters in the 'Letter Box' and have, wished there might be more written by the numerous children of our household. I am going to school now. Our schoolhouse is surrounded by beautiful maple trees. Our term includes sixteen weeks. My studies are Reading, Spelling, Grammar, Geography, Anatomy and Arithmetic. I like geography and anatomy better than all the others. My home is in a beautiful green valley, partly surrounded by high mountains. At the foot of the valley is the lovely lake Mascoma; it is five miles long and one mile wide. I love my pure religious home where so many kind friends love and teach me how to be good. I hope to become a true woman like the kind Sisters who take care of me. Isabelle.
