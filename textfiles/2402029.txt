Union Village, O. Jan. 1894. We had a delightful visit from Elder Joseph Holden of the Mt. Lebanon Bishopric, which gave us great comfort. He arrived on Dec. 3rd and departed for Mt. Lebanon the 11th. His visit was very highly appreciated by every one at Union Village and we shall, I trust, retain his ministration of the necessity of maintaining union, Christian order and discipline. Our winter so far has not arrested the growth of the grass, wheat or barley. Christmas sent the mercury up to 10 deg. in the shade. We enjoyed Christmas very highly. An inspiring meeting at 9�30; a Christmas dinner and a very pleasant Social in the evening, constituted the order of the day. It was insisted, both on the Sabbath and Christmas, that no hard feelings nor lack of brotherly love should be permitted to reign in heart or family after the Christmas-tide, and I judged by the friendly feelings in our Social, that this good proposition had been well accepted. The Brethren and Sisters were in attendance from the other families, both at our morning service and in the evening Social. Sisters Anna Mills and Eebecca Armstrong arranged the programme, and it was a great success. The girls and boys acquitted themselves splendidly, and the music rendered by the choir was excellent. The mildness of the winter is quite a saving of stock feed. We depend on the sale of stock for a living, for grain is so low as to be scarcely worth raising. Our school, (co-educational) re-commences on Monday, Jan. 1st. (2nd Term.) Elder James H. Richardson called on us for a few hours, from South Union. We had a very good time with him in a meeting on the evening previous to his return. Ruth Terry lives here in the Office. She is a young Believer and is about two years old. In general she is quite a good child, but occasionally,�well you ought to hear her hold forth. I guess she will come out all right. If she don't, it will not be because she is not smart. Every day I live I am more and more astonished that Believers will use animal food. Mirabilla Dictu! If we had all the money for all the meat we have eaten in the last hundred years, each Society might have twenty-five acres under glass and raise all the tropical fruits,�oranges, bananas, pine-apples, dates, melons, yams and almost everything else. We might travel quite around the world and preach the Gospel to every nation, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. But I fear we shall leave these blessings to another, and God grant, a more worthy generation. I herewith bespeak for the Editor, publishers and readers of The Manifesto, a very happy New Year. O. C.
