Union Village, O. Aug. 1895. August comes in cool and pleasant, and the farmer having his harvesting and threshing done is ready for his fallow ploughing; and the gardener, is bringing in his crops, for the table, and the cow boy supplying the milk and butter: and caretaker of the fowls, adds the eggs and broilers, and the mechanics are in their cool and airy shops, and last though by no means least, the pure, neat, true and faithful Sisters, add their part as the comforters and beautifiers of the home. 'Home sweet home, there's no place like home,' wrote a richly gifted soul, and surely, 'be it ever so humble,' there is no place on earth so sacred and so richly cherished as the home. Even when considered as a temporal, earthly abode only, there clusters about it some of the tenderest emotions of the human soul. But when viewed in the light of permanence and perpetuity which the idea of a THE MANIFESTO. 215 home in the hearts of its occupants presents, the sentiment is enlarged a thousand fold. And such is the object and such the labors of our Shaker homes; the building, in union with the pure and true, homes for both time and eternity. Property may be destroyed, the unfaithful to his trust, the physical senses decay; but a home in the hearts of the pure and loyal can never fail. Watson Andrews.
