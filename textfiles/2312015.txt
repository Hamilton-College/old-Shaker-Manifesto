While there may be a great many things... While there may be a great many things on the pilgrimage of life that would seem to demand our special attention and proffer an inspiration for more loving care of our physical, moral and spiritual interests, in the brotherhood of man, there may be, also, a few things claiming a still more direct consideration, as they may be absolutely necessary for our present prosperity. Possibly some of these near and dear accompaniments may be quietly laid aside without doing violence to the saints of the past or even retarding the march of those who are now moving toward the 'Holy City.' The good apostle Paul did not hesitate to make reference to forms once valuable, but now of less value, as he passes on to that which is of more vital interest. A speculative theology may awaken a pleasurable interest in some persons, and afford them all the satisfaction that their minds may demand, and to this class a visionary heaven far beyond the most distant stars, is of more consequence than is the heavenly state which we should enjoy and which Jesus has said should be present with us on the earth. An ideal class of human beings, having wings like eagles, may be of entrancing interest to the mind of some, while the sons and daughters of God upon the earth are carelessly passed as we walk on the outer edge of the King's highway. A close relationship with God will help us wonderfully in entering that heavenly kingdom, where the will of man comes in pleasant harmony with the will of the Father. The first sermon in the New Testament, will in its simplicity help us to lay a foundation for action, and if carefully impressed upon the mind, can not fail to lead to paths of righteousness and peace. The cry of the Baptist,ï¿½'Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,' comprehends in its fullness the whole work of the regenerate man. It is the Lord's path, and the path in TERMS. THE MANIFESTO. 285 which the Lord will walk, and as it is a straight path, man cannot otherwise than walk correctly while in it. Hence, Jesus subsequently said to his disciples, 'Strait is the gate that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.' It was Father James Whittaker who expressed this beautiful thought, 'God's way is as straight as straightness and as pure as the heavens.' Those who enter into the Lord's strait path can not fall very far into unrighteousness without being assured of the fact. Darkness will be sure to overtake them. As encouragement to the disciples, Jesus was led to say, 'I am the light,' and indeed, he was the light of the Lord's path, in which the sons of God must walk, if they would find eternal life. Of what consequence is a life on the earth, unless it shares the blessing of God's light, and is made able to lead others into the same beautiful path of light. The man who assists in making the Lord's path straight, is at the same time making his own path straight, and that very effort forces him 'to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.' What a responsibility this imposes upon the mind, and what an invaluable treasure it proffers to the willing soul. To live righteously and to live godly or like God, is living as we think God would like to have us live. Is it any wonder that Col. Ingersoll holds up the Christian in burlesque before the world, when the world-wise Christian is so unlike the representative of God which was given by Jesus the Christ. To live righteously, certainly, is to live according to the best light which has entered our souls, and in failing to do this we establish the fact before the children of this world, as well as before those who profess to walk in the light, that we are among those who know the Teacher's mind and neglect to do it. There is nothing connected with the term righteousness, that need embarrass the most simple mind, and those who are anxious to do right so far as God has given them understanding, are under the divine protection, and being led by the spirit of God can not otherwise than become the sons and daughters of God. Religion, with this gift to do right because it is right, is the all in all to the honest heart, but religion with a flourish of antiquated dogmas that are of the dead past, is of the least value for any present or future good.
