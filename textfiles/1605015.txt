CHARITY Could I command, with voice or pen, The tongues of angels and of men, A tinkling cymbal, sounding brass, My speech and preaching would surpass ; Vain were such eloquence to me, Without the grace of charity. Could I the martyr's flame endure, Give all my goods to feed the poor� Had I the faith from Alpine steep To hurl the mountain to the deep� What were such zeal, such power to me Without the grace of charity! Could I behold with prescient eye Things future, as the things gone by� Could I all earthly knowledge scan, And mete out heaven with a span� Poor were the chief of grief to me Without the ohiefest�charity. Charity suffers long, is kindCharity bears a humble mind : Ilejoices not when ills befall, But glories in the weal of all; She hopes, believes, and envies not, Nor vaunts, nor murmurs o'er her lot. The tongues of teachers shall be dumb, Prophets discern not things to come, Knowledge shall vanish out of thought, And miracles no more be wrought, But charity shall never fail-- Her anchor is within the veil. The Catholic.
