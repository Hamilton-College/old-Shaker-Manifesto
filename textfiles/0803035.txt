Introduction of the Potato Sir Walter proved to be one of the greatest benefactors to his own country, and eventually to the United States, by the introduction of the potato, in the year 1584. The root was first planted on Raleigh's estate at Youghall, which was afterwards sold to the Earl of Cork, and the person who had the management of the estate, mistook the flower or fruit, as he called it, for the valuable part, and on tasting the potato ball pronounced it a pernicious exotic. Sometime afterwards, on turning up the earth, it was discovered that the root had spread largely.and in considerable quantities; and from this source Great Britain's potato supply commenced and then gradually the cultivation was extended through North America. The potato is supposed to have been a native of Mexico.
