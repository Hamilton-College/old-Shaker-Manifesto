Elder Henry:--I am glad that there is a day of rest... Shaker Station, Ct. Apr. 1891. Elder Henry :ï¿½I am glad that there is a day of rest when we can think of our duties to absent friends and have a little leisure to attend to them. I feel to bless the labors of all who assist in keeping the testimony burning through the pages of the Manifesto. Such a bright, clean, inspiring little paper cannot fail to make a mark. My conviction is that our testimony is destined to work as leaven in the.minds of the children of men, and that it is already doing so. Our testimony through the agency of the Manifesto llnds an extended circulation, and will work in the hearts of many. 1 believe we are working with God and must do our present duty as it arises, and leave the results with Him. For these reasons I feel to support the Manifesto. Your Brother, T. J. Stroud.
