THE SWALLOWS. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. Called the community swallows: because they build their nests in communities, joined together, made of clay and mud. I counted eighty of these nests under the eaves of our barn sixty feet long on one side. These swallows are pretty birds, not so much on account of their plumage as in their dornestio habits. They are about the size of the English sparrow-imported-brown on their backs and their breasts white. They make their appearar ce annually about the first of May, and leave us about the 20th or last of August, and seem more numerous than when they came. What a paradise this world mi~ht be if the human race would keep the law of nature in the reproduction of their offspring as well as these swallows; and is it so, that the human race are the only cxception who do not keep the law of reproduction?
