HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF MT, LEBANON, N. Y. NO. 4. 1785. After the building of the house of worship the exercises became more uniform and regular and the marching and dancing were more moderate. Previous to this there was not much order observed among the Brethren and Sisters, in the occupation of a special place, but a Christian care was taken not to trespass upon the privileges of each other. The meetings on the Sabbath were generally in the Church, and open to all who wished to attend. The Believers occupied a standing position, and arrauged in ranks, with the Brethren on one side of the central line of the room and the Sisters on the other. The first ranks at the head of the meeting were separated about four feet, while at the other end they were some ten feet apart. The many violent manifestations of power which had attended the religious exercises of the Believers before the forming of the Community, had become less frequent and gradually faded away. This public service of which we have been speaking was attended by the several families except those in the Church. This family held their meeting in the afternoon, but did not admit any persons who were not members of the Community. The exercise known as Square Order was introduced at this time by Father Joseph. It was a matter of much earnest exertion for the Believers to perfect themselves in this form of worship. Forms that had been laid aside, were occasionally revived, as some one or ones were moved by the inspiration of the hour, and in this revival they shared the ministration of the divine spirit. In 1774 the Square Order was omitted, and in 1776 all exercise in time of worship was discontinued during a term of two years, and by the advice of Father Joseph a season of rest followed. The time in worship was now occupied in exhortations to live 'soberly, righteouï¿½ly and godly in this present world.' On many of these occasions the assembly would unite in singing one of the solemn eongs and then retire. It was a remarkable change to bring about in so limited a space of time, and is a manifestation of the union and love that pervaded the order. During this period of five years the religious services were of a very solemn character. The revival gifts had ceased; no general exhortations were given, and if any word bearing upon the life work of the Believers was spoken, it was the gift of the presiding Elder. The early Believers in their seasons of revival were not particular as to the time when the assembly of worshipers should be called together, but accepted any time during the day or evening, when it was most convenient. Living as they did in different parts of the town or state, this was the only way that could prove satisfactory to them. But after the organization of the Society more system was o! 'served and regular hours appointed for every meeting that was to be attended. For several years a meeting was held in the early morning, in which speaking, singing and other exercises formed the order of the service. In 1798 the Square Order was again introduced and at the beginning of the year 1800, the meetings assumed a much more active form. The gift of exhortation was encouraged, and the spirit of praise and prayer found expression in many honest and faithful souls. The year 1805 is made memorable on account of ihe wonderful work of the Lord that came to the people of Ohio and Kentucky. Three missionaries were seut from the Church, Benjamin S. Youngs, John Meacham a:ul Issachar Bates, to preach the faith that had been received by the Believers. The journey of more than a thousand miles was made on foot and attended with many privations and hardships. The Brethren knew they were under the blessing of God, and that a fruitful prosperity would attend all their labors of love for God and his people. It was a great sacrifice for the family to make and the farewell of the Brethren was one of deep sorrow, commingled with joyThe letters that were subsequently received from the Brethren, gave an account of the great revival and of present progress of faith among the people. Hymns were composed in the spirit of the work and sent to the Believers in New Lebanon. They were read and circulated and sung. Zeal awakened zeal and the life of the gospel was manifested more freely among the people. In the summer of 1807 the singing of hymns was fully established in the Church, and the worship now consisted, especially, that at the close of the day, in singing a hymn, and the exercise in the Square Step. Exhortations were frequent and a great change took place as the worship became more actively spiritual and less formal. A hymn entitled 'Gospel Trumpet,' was composed and formed quite a promiuent feature in the hour of worship. More active exercises were introduced and the solemn songs, without words, were laid aside. In 1810 the singing of short songs or those having only one verse was introduced. Words were also selected from the exhortations made in time of worship, and these were arranged to music and used with much satisfaction. 1 his soon led to the writing of anthems of various lengths, which in many instances took the place of hymns, as the introductory siuf ing for the season of vvorship. Some elementary lessoos in music were taught, at this date, as but. very few peisons had any knowledge of the rules of music. All the songs and tunes were learned by the ear and re- tained by the memory. After the more universal introduction of hymns and anthems, with music attached, it became quite a labor to learn and to retain all that were brought forward. Visitors to and from- New Lebanon, also became interested to learn one or more new hymns or anthems, to take to their own homes. In the year 1815 an anthem was written and the music attached and then sent to the Believers in Ohio. This was the first instauce where an anthem set to music had been forwarded to a western Society. The knowledge of music gradually increased in the several Communities and in 1819 an exchange of several pieces was made between the Society of New Lebanon and Union Village. No singing schools had been established and but few of the singers engaged in the study of music. The round notes, only were used, but by some were considered very obscure. In the course of eight or ten years, a great improvement was made in the writing of music and the round notes were thrown out of use. The Community at Harvard, Mass., suggested the using of letters for uotes, and this manner was adopted. The various length of the notes were designated by capitals, italics, etc. This was soon followed by another degree of improvement, in the use of small letters, and by attaching brevitures and other characters to indicate the length of the notes. This system originated at New Lebanon. The modes were used as formerly written until 1835, when there was a thorough reform made in the system of music, which was generally adopted by the Believers. A small work was published in 1833 entitled, 'The Rudiments of Music.' It contained 158 pages. In 1842 a music book was published by the Society of New Lebanon. The Society at Enfield, Conn., rendered much assistance by the writing and publishing of articles on the science of music. By the use of the letters of the alphabet, it was thought unnecessary to retain the staff, and that gradually was thrown out of use, and by the year 1858, it was rarely used in any of the communities. We now return to the form of worship as used in 1817. It required great care to retain the forms of exercise, to walk or to march in a body, across the room, and to keep a regular step and correct time, was a work of much anxiety. A programme of the leading hymns and anthems to be used during the week wa3 brought forward and read in the meeting of Sabbath, P. M. The selection was made by the Elders of the family, or by any of the interested singers. Several forms of exercise were introduced from time to time, but did not long continue in use. In 1822 more freedom was given to the speaking, during the hour of worship which proved both pleasant and profitable. Sometimes the whole family would march into the highway and while in the enjoyment of some beautiful songs, pass on to the Center Family and share with them a union gift. In 1827, a new spiritual wave passed over the Community and gave life and zeal to the season of religious service. Gifts of repentance, of love, of simplicity and of new songs abounded. It was a baptism of gospel fire, the good effects of which lasted for several years. In all of the beautiful gifts there was, however, a measure of sorrow, as it had the effect of throwing off the dying and dead branches, which at one time were so promising of life. In 1837 a new era commenced as the windows of heaven and the avenues cf the spirit world were opened. Gifts of visions, of revelations, of inspiration and of spiritual songs were among the heavenly treasures that were showered upon the Believers. Messages were spoken and written, and the number of inspirational Hymns and Anthems, largely increased. This manifestation of the spirit, made its first appearance, among the children, in the Community at Watervliet, N. Y., while they were engaged iu religious devotion. Some of them passed into a trance state, and became wholly unconscious of all external surroundings. The visionary sight which had opened their spiritual eyes, unfolded most beautifully the invisible things of God. In this new life they were attended by spirit guides, and taken from place to place as one would be while on the earth. The attendant, spirit guide would, sometimes, hold conversation with those in the body auj ask and answer questions through the oue that was entranced. Persons falling into this visionary state or accepting any form of inspiration were from this time designated as ''Instruments.' This work soon manifested itself iu an older class, and young men and young women were baptized into the new element of spiritual life. The work began to assume varied and strange forms, and was looked upon with surprise and astonishment by more mature minds. Tht influence had come among them, as an uninvited guest, but had earned on its introduction, a most cordial welcome from every person. The gifts and exercises attracted the attention of all and captivated the feelings of the whole assembly. (TO BE CONTINUED.)
