SHIRLEY SHAKERS. The Community Celebrates the 102nd Anniversary. ON Saturday the Shaker Communities of Shirley completed 101 years of existence, but the day was not observed by any public manifestation. Sunday, however, at the Community's morning devotions, Elder John Whiteley made a brief allusion to the fact, and spoke a few words specially appropriate to the interesting event. The thoughts of all the Community went back to the stormy times of 100 years ago when the little band of Believers were just growing into prominence. The names of the leading lights of the Community in the past arose before the mind's eye; then their thoughts drifted to the little cemetery on the hillside, 'Where the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.' THE MANIFESTO. 273 The past has for these earnest, industrious, honest and simple-minded people an irresistible charm. Noble men and women rest in their soil, who gave up the baser forms of life for the more serious and higher form of existence. Actuated by a desire to follow more closely in the footsteps of the carp -nter of Nazareth, they left the world and its allurements and joined with fellowmen in a simpler and purer life. On Sunday, the Shakers looked with pardonable pride on the past and not without hope to the future. True, time has somewhat thinned their ranks, and men hnd women, to-day, do not readily volunteer to assume the obligations of Shaker life, yet in spite of this the future is not without encouragement. The industrious and frugal Brothers and Sisters of the past, built up a strong and noble family; they grew from almost nothing to comfort and contentment, if not to affluence, in spite of opposition and persecution. Today, the Community, while smaller than thirty and forty and fifty years ago, is strong in the faith, has thousands of broad acres and no incumbrance. All that is needed to give the family the strength former days is willing hands and faithful hearts. When men and women pause and think, when they will compare the life of the city, or rather the struggle for existence in the cities, with the quiet, peaceful and contented life of the Shaker Communities, the revival in Shakerism will commence and they will gladly throw aside the baser passions and become believers in a faith that tends only to elevate and ennoble. The Shirley Community has made all preparations for the winter. The harvest has been bountiful and well cared for. The apple crop, now one of the most important to the Community, has been good, and in addition to the 1500 barrels shipped to England and to the West, a large quantity were ground up into cider, which has been boiled preparatory to being used in the manufacture of their famous Shaker apple sauce. The Community will commence the manufacture of this famous sauce within two weeks and will have a large quantity made and ready for shipment before Thanksgiving day. So well established has this product become, that the market is now usually larger than the product. ï¿½Selected.
