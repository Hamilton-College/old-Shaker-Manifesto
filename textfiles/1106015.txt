Our Present Issue EDITORIAL NOTES. Will be found a very valuable and thoughtful one. Freighted with so many wholesome truths from so many of our foremost and valued contributors, we sail among the seas of error and reason courageously. Ponder well, friends, the beautiful logic of him who writes ' Soul Travel,' it is worth the time, and will not soon be forgotten. What will the people think now of what constitutes a Christian's 'Willing Obedience?' t And we wonder how the people will regard our old pioneer and battle-axe —who stands so straight for progress, as almost to appear to lean to the other side ! Brave Elder Evans — not afraid of progress though approaching his four-score years ! Nevertheless, we have heard of successful 'Hatching chickens by machinery.' We wonder did Newton, Herschell, Mitchell, or Proctor ever pay a prettier tribute to 134 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 'The Solar System,' than has our talented Shaker Girl? 'The root of all evil' leads to the consideration of evil ways of getting filthy lucre; and bids do so no more to everybody. Our music is a familiar tune, applied to original words by some of our Mt. Lebanon brethren—how admiringly it applies to the words ! Sing, friends, sing it. Elder Joseph Brackett gets a benefit in this number; and he is worthy of it. We ask especial attention to our cover, as we have only the most reliable firms illustrated thereon, and they can be relied on. After reading this number, friends, pass it to your neighbor—let the good things move broad-cast.
