TRY AGAIN Toiling pilgrim, art thou weary? Doth the path of life seem hard? Are the gleams of hope and courage From thy spirit now debarr'd ? Hath the prayer to Heaven directed, Fail'd to bring thv spirit gain ? Yet, if thou art still protected, Never flinch, but Try again. Have the foes thou wast contending, Over thee some vict'ry gained ? By a dark'ning cloud impending, Hath thy star of guidance waned? Does the binding cross of Jesus Cause thy lofty nature pain ? There 's a balsam for thy spirit, Flinch not, then, but Try again. Mark thy friends who now surround thee, Seeming most like angels pure ; Have they passed these youthful conflicts, Having nothing to endure? Know, my friend, when thou art tempted, Those before have felt the same, And with courage to thee whisper, ' Never flinch, but Try again.' Try Again ! blest words of courage, What a radiance they impart! When the soul, though met by Failure, Clasps their virtues to the heart, Then, with ' Onward ' for thy motto, ' Upward,' for thy constant aim, Thou canst bear aloft the bannerâ€” ' Never flinch; but Try Again.'
