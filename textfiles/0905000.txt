PHILANTHROPIST Cecelia Devyr 0 straggling heart, be strong, be strong ! And angel hosts will comfort thee ; Each jmlse that throbs against the wrong, Shall yet beat high in victory. Were not the prophets ever stoned? Were not the messengers reviled ? And yet the earth in error groaned, And writhed in anguish wild ! The martyr's spirit is not killed — Though cruel racks his flesh have torn,— His mission still must be fulfilled, His mantle must be onward borne. God knows the earth's great sins and needs; Through human hearts His aid must flow ; He marks the true, unselfish deeds, He bids the noble impulse glow ! To speed His holy work is thine ; To sow the seed, 'mid storm and rain ; E're long the harvest fields will shine, To bless thee for thy toil and pain. 0 ! Prophet heart, be strong in love, That swells from fountains bright clear ; The angel bands from heaven above, Unite with angel spirits here. All dark, and drear, thy path may be, Yet thou art light to the oppressed ; And for thy labors given free, Thy soul shall find eternal rest. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
