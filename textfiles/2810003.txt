OUR OLIVE BRANCH. IN Eunnymede township, one mile from Ashton station on the Sugar Belt Railway, lies the splendid domain of the Shaker colony known as Olive Branch. To call it a farm would belittle the place in a section where farms are so small as here, for it contains nearly seven thousand acres, of which 154 THE MANIFESTO. sixteen hundred are enclosed with a substantial fence, and arrangements are about completed for fencing as much more. If all the 'doubting Thomases' in Florida would visit Olive Branch, their opinions as to the capacity of soil for producing stock, cereals, fruits, vegetables and cane would change materially, or at least be modified, as their land is but a fair sample of what may be found in any portion of Osceola county. The writer recently inspected the place through an invitation from the business manager, Mr. Benjamin Gates, and came away convinced it only needed the patient, intelligent industry manifested here to make farm life not only a delightful, but a remunerative occupation. In the grounds connected with the house and business office are orange, peach, apricot and persimmon trees with a large number of flowering plants. It seems to be the policy of this community to unite the beautiful with the practical; so you find here fruit trees, vines, shrubs, tropical foliage plants and flowering bulbs all in one group relieving the lawn from that stiffness noticed in public parks. An irrigating plant supplies the five acres immediately adjoining the house. For field crops they are this season growing Irish and sweet potatoes, cane, velvet beans, cow peas, beggar weed, rice and pumpkins. All of them look well, the cane being remarkably good. Living largely, but not exclusively on vegetable food, the garden is always a feature in a Shaker community. I noticed remarkably fine tomatoes,, okra, beets, spinach and turnips. Most interesting of all to visitors is the pinery, which is now buddings blossoming and fruiting. The plants are uniform in size and fruiting well. While not as large a pinery as some others in the state we have visited, for health of plants and general neatness of the grounds it has no superior. The design of the community has always been to make cattle growing the great industry, and for this the place is admirably fitted. It has numerous lakeswith abundant water for every pasture. Stockmen who have had cattle on this range claim it is one of the best in Florida. At present there are about nine hundred head of cattle in the portion enclosed. With the additional pastures to be enclosed this fall they can carry 2,000 head. It is a fact that the revenues of the place now make all the improvements, and that it is not done, as many claim, with assistance from kindred associations north. Under the able management of Mr. Benjamin Gates, and his aids, Andrew Barrett and Brother Egbert, Olive Branch will soon become a landmark in Florida, an experimental station without state aid. There are no secrets here. Success is obtained and made possible by brains and muscle. A pleasant and profitable day it was we spent at Olive Branch, and to Sis ters and Brothers we tender our sincere thanks. ï¿½Selected.
