THANKFUL HEART Oliver W. Holmes wrote the following oft-to-be remembered comparison. ' If any one should give me a dish of sand, and tell me there were particles of iron in it, I might look for them with my eyes, and search for them with my clumsy fingers, and be unable to detect them; but let me take a magnet and sweep through it, and it would draw to itself the almost invisible particles, by the mere power of attraction. ' The unthankful heart, like my fingers in the sand, discovers no mercies; but let the thankful heart sweep through the day; and, as the magnet finds the iron, so it will find, in every hour, some heavenly blessings; only, the iron in God's sand is gold.' The same thought is applicable to our little paper, the Shaker and Shakeress. Let the vain, the worldly, or the sensual person look upon its pages, and they appear barren as the desert wastes. But let truth-loving, truthseeking souls, whose desires are unfulfilled, behold the same pages, and they bloom like a garden in spring ; they blossom the promises of immortal fruit; they gleam with unpolished jewels; and they hold the ' pearl of great price'—the virgin pearl. They speak with the voice of home love — the home and the love whose foundations are deeply laid, and whose perfection shall be the blessing of eternity. Fast and far may our dual sheet speed to the hearts that aspire to be pure; for they shall see the work of God wherever it is wrought. Cecelia Devyr, Mt. Lebanon
