FUTURE OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT. [Contributed by Sophia Wayne.] Such, then, are some of the causes of the great theological changes the world is passing through. What is to be the outcome? Is religion dying? No more than it means death for the life within to burst the chrysalis, to take to itself wings and be at home in God's upper sunshine and air. No more than it means death for childhood to put away childish things and enter man's estate. A grander faith in God, a larger trust in man, a higher type of religious thought and life, a nobler outlook for the futureï¿½these are some of the things it means. It is not faith, but the lack of it, that is displayed by those who dare not fearlessly face the search for truth and take the consequences of investigation. The real infidelity to-day is to be found with those who stand with back to the sunrise and see no reality except in the shadows of the night that is passing away. God is in the power that is wheeling the earth into a new day; and that day is one of such promise as the weary old world has never seen, M. J. Savage.
