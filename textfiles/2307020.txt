Canaan, N. Y. June, 1893. So much rain has greatly retarded the season's work; but, notwithstanding, our gardens are looking finely. Peas, onions, tomatoes, and other plants are growing vigorously. Every opportunity for outdoor work has been zealously improved by Sisters as well as Brethren, and it seems as though Nature was putting forth extra exertions to make up loss of time. Our cherry trees, which last year blossomed full and bore nothing, are quite full of green cherries. We hope to secure a good crop this year. The Psalmist said, 'I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread;' and we believe by faithfulness, carefulness, prudence, and economy, we shall have sufficient for all our physical needs. Jesus said, 'Take no thought of what ye shall eat or drink, but seek first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, and all these things shall be given you.' And this we know by experience to be true. All who turn to Zion for the resurrection life of Christ, are freed from all burden concerning temporalities. A beautiful home wherein every need is supplied is already prepared for all such, besides affording abundant opportunities for ethical and spiritual development. Surely we are blessed an hundred fold; and for all these blessings the Lord shall be praised. In our last evening meeting our Elders, Brethren and Sisters, united in sending their kind love to our good Editor for his THE MANIFESTO. 169 consecrated labors. We bless every faithful burden-bearer in Zion. We are deeply interested in the Manifesto, it is a gem we would not willingly part with. Emily Offord.
