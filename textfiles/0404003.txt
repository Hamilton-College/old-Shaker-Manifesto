APPROXIMATE NEW EARTH Extract from report of Overseer of the Poor in Vineland, N. J., 1869 : 'With a population of ten thousand, no citizen of Vineland, has, for the period of six months, required relief at the hands of the Overseer of the Poor, and our poor expenses are a mere trifle. ' During the entire year there has been but one indictment, and that a trifling one. ' We have no need of a lire department. We have no debt. Our taxes are only one per cent on valuation. 'The police expenses are seventy-five dollars a year.' Well done for Vineland. Let other Towns emulate Vineland in this respect. We may then hopefully look for the time when there will be no poor, no police, no indictments — except by conscience — no doctors, no lawyers, no sickness, death, nor pain. In place thereof, industry, co-operation, and one perpetual in- heritance in the new earth of the meek. Elijah Myrick
