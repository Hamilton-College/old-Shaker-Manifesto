If the glory of this world wanes, we see another glory... If the glory of this world wanes, we see another glory pertaining to a world, of which this is but a shadow, rising and becoming visible to our spiritual senses. Sorrows will cease in the good time coming, when light shall comprehend or banish all works of darkness from human souls ; remove the cause, and the effect will cease. Then pain, hatred and strife will give place to the pleasure that flows from pure love. May we realize the importance of giving our thoughts to God : For surely ' it shall be well with the righteous, and ill with those who transgress God's laws.' â€” Cliarlotte B.
