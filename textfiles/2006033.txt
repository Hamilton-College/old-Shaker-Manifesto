It teaches that if we pray earnestly with a meek and humble spirit we receive the blessing. As 'every good and perfect gift is from above,' we should look to no other source for these treasures. God's greatest gift to us is the Holy Spirit from which we learn to do his will. It is often called a lamp to guide us in the darkest hours of temptation and trial and if we follow in the path to which this light directs we shall find the road which Christ's true followers mutt tread. 'Knock and it shall be opened unto you ' Whut thought can be more cheering to the weary pilgrim than to know that the gates of endless glory and peace are open to those that fear God and keep his commandments?Hancock, Mass.
