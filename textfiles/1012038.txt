DOING GOOD ' We all might do good, When we often do ill, There is always the way, If we have but the will; Though it be but a word Kindly breathed or suppressed, It may guard ofi some pain, Or give peace to some breast.' We all might do good In a thousand small ways, In forbearing to flatter. Yet yielding due praiseâ€” In spurning ill humor, Reproving wrong done, And treating but kindly Each heart we have won. We all might do good, Whether lowly or great, For the deed is not gauged By the purse or estate ; If it be but a cup Of cold water that's given, Like ' the widow's two mites,' It is something for heaven.'
