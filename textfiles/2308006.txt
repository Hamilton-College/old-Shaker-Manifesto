TOIL ON. Lucy S. Bowers. Toil on O soul, toll on for truth and right, Thy vision true and clear as cloudless day, Toil on, thy tho't and purpose firm alway To reach the summit of faith's glorious height. Put to the plow thy never wearying might, Again, yea and again renew thyself and pray; The good God sendeth knoweth no decay, His beauteous bloom Is fadeless as his light. Give to the heart that yearneth for thy care, Nor from the wayward one tura once aside, All that thy spirit loveth for thy share Give unto others, it will help and guide; And thus toil on, O soul, live, do, and bear, With Christ in thee thou wilt in Christ abide. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
