The Children's Grotto WOODEN SWEARING The Sabbath School in Rockville was assembled for their monthly concert. The lesson was about swearing, and when the children had repeated their verses, the minister rose to talk to them. ' I hope, dear children,' he said, that you will never let your lips speak profane words. But now I want to tell you about a kind of swearing which I heard a good woman speak about not long ago. She called it wooden swearing. It's a kind of swearing that many people beside children are given to, when they are angry. Instead of giving vent to their feelings in oaths, they slam the doors, kick the chairs, stamp on the floor* throw the furniture about, and make all the noiso they possibly can. 'Isn't this just the same as swearing T said she. ' It's just the same kind of feeling, exactly, only they do not like to say those awful words ; but they force the furniture to make the noise, and so I call it wooden swearing,' I hope, dear children, that you will not do any of this kind of swearing either.' It is better to let alone wooden swearing, and all other kinds of swearing.â€”The Little Christian.
