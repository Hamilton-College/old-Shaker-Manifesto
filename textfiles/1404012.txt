TRIBUTE OF LOVE, Praise and Thanksgiving. AURELIA G. MACE. Deak Brethren and Sisters, Gospel Fathers and Mothers, in Love, Greeting :� You whose spirits are replete with that perfect love which casteth out fear. In you is found that charity which never faileth, binding up the broken-hearted, strengthening the weak and comforting ' the afflicted. In you is found that power which healeth the sick of sin, casteth out the spirits of evil and givetb sight to those who are blinded to their own best interests. By giving up all, you have received all. For every sacrifice that you have made of selfish pleasures, an hundred fold of spiritual blessings has filled your cup to overflowing, and the pathway in which you walk is leading you nearer and nearer to the fountain of all good, nearer and nearer to God. A few short years here, in which to teach your disciples and followers to do as you have done, to live as you have lived, and then the real home in the Heavens of Glory is opened unto you. ' They are slipping away,�these sweet, swift years, Like a leaf on the current cast : With never a break in their rapid flow, We watch them as one by one they go Into the beautiful past. ' And one by one you go, beloved, into the beautiful future, into the home of the redeemed, a home that you have made your own by a travel of soul away, far away from sordid passions. Redeemed from all that is not of God. Like the lake in midsummer when the air is still, so is the redeemed spirit. Like unto the tree clothed with the blossoms of Spring, and like unto the tree laden with the ripe fruits of Autumn, so is the redeemed spirit. Like unto the grandeur of the eastern clouds when the sun is rising, so is the redeemed spirit. In the school of Christ you have been disciplined ; by the fire in Zion you have been tried, until like the gold of Ophir you are purified; and now, saith the Spirit, ' Ye shall walk with me in white, for ye are worthy. ' From this high estate, let your blessing descend like the dew of Hermon into the hearts of your faithful children. Let your mantles rest upon those who follow in your footsteps, and you shall be more than satisfied when the books are opened, and your eyes behold the record of those whom you have led along in the highway of Holiness. And I will sing,� 'Let my name be recorded In the book the Angels keep, Where each act is rewarded, And the seed I have sown I shall reap. So when the Angel reaper cometh And the harvest time shall be, I shall find in my Father's house There's a mansion reserved lor me.' West Gloucester, Me.
