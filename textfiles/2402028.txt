Watervliet, O. Dec. 1893. Beloved- Eldeb Henby;ï¿½As we are holding our Christmas to-day, we have a little to contribute to The Manifesto. We have enjoyed a very pleasant time for which we are very thankful. Santa Claus came in all his glory with a Christmas tree loaded for the children which they as well as all the Brethren and Sisters seemed to enjoy. While we were partaking of our breakfast we also listened to some beautiful songs, contributed by the Brethren and 46 THE MANIFESTO. 47 Sisters. Several of the Brethren assisted in the kitchen by washing dishes and doing other duties, through the day as an aid to the Sisters. When it came noon we all sat down to an excellent dinner for which we felt very thankful to the good Sisters. While at the table we thought of the poor and how thankful they would have been with even the half that was before us. We have a great deal to be thankful for when we think of those who are so destitute, and some even starving for the want of proper food. We passed into the meeting-room at 2-30 p. m. and had a beautiful meeting. The spirit of good was manifested by all present, and peace and union reigned through the whole Society. At 6-30 we held an entertainment and listened to some vocal and instrumental music which was furnished by those in our home. We will now close by sending our love and blessing to all the Societies in the second coming of Christ and by wishing all a Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year. Henry jr. Fredrick.
