Nicholville, N. Y., Feb. 20, 1877 Dear Friend Briggs : To you, as the publisher of The Shaker, and to the united societies of Shakers, I do hereby tender my heartfelt thanks for the official monthly, called The Shaker. * ** * I have carefully read every number of the last year, every article therein, by which I have obtained a more thorough knowledge of your moral and religious positions as a Christian community than I ever had before. In 1829, I was a member of the New Hampshire legislature; and one Saturday, after adjournment, myself and two others,—John Kent and John Peavey of Barnstead,—walked from Concord to your place, a distance of twelve miles, and tarried in the society until Monday, attending your meetings on Sunday, and were treated as kindly as if members of the society. There is no other community of worshipers of God whose character for honesty, sincerity, and uprightness stands so high in the estimation of the public of the nineteenth century, through the length and breadth of our land, as does that of your people. Free from the abominations so common in the world, satisfied to labor in your modest, unassuming methods, which are very worthy of imitation. There is an economy in your system that all should know of; and that is that your earnings are not expended for useless ornaments of dress and buildings, so common for show, but without benefit. Had I known as much about the Shakers years ago as after reading last year's volume, I can hardly tell you what the consequences may have been. I am very happy to realize that there are such good people in America as the Shakers ; and in my eighty-ninth year I happily, thankfully subscribe myself your well-wisher, while wishing the utmost God-speed to The Shaker.
