CARE OF GRINDSTONES. The following rules should be observed in the care of grindstones. 1. Do not waste the stone running it in water, nor allow it to stand in water when not in use, as this will cause a soft place and consequent uneven wear. 2. Wet the stone by dropping water on it from a pot suspended above the stone, and stop off the water when not in use. 3. Do not allow the stone to get out of round, but true up with a piece of gaspipe or 'hacker.' 4. Do not leave the stone out of doors in the wind and weather, as this hardens it and makes it less effective. 5. Clean off all greasy tools before grinding, as grease or oil destroys the grit. 6. When you get a stone that suits your purposes, keep a' sample of the grit to send to the dealer to select by, as this is the way you can always secure one that suits. Mechanical Journal.
