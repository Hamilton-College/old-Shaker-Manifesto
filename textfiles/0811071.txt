BOOK TABLE The Types of Christ . THE S85 form, beautifully covered, and is being sent from this office, post paid, for seven cents. The Central Bishopric of our Church give this little work the most encouraging approval, and wish that the limited number of copies may have the widest circulation. We should be glad to receive orders for the same; and hope wherever the pamphlet goes, great good will accrue. Brethren, Friends, Inquirers, shall we hear from you? Treatise on the horse and his diseases R. J. Kendall, M. D This is a .small, but comprehensive work upon what its title appertains. It is full of information, giving numerous illustrations of the horse's appearance in various kinds of sickness, lameness ; and showing by the teeth, an infallible rule in finding the age of the animal; also giving twenty pages of valuable receipts for cures, 'and a complete glossary describing the medicines recommended. We have the opinion of Chauncy Copley, our best authority on the horse, that 'the book is a valuable one, well worth the money.' Its price ^s within the reach of the poorest farmer, and is worth the consideration and reference of those in better circumstances.
