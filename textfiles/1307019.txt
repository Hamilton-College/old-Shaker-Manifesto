EXPERIENCE. M. J. TATTERTON While meditating upon the happiness enjoyed in living the true Christ life, the idea occurred to us that we might perhaps do a little good by writing our thought upon this subject. Having been nurtured from infancy under the holy ministration of Christian teachers, our soul over flows with gratitude ; we are led to exclaim,â€”Blessed relation which has always been ours to enjoy ! As we grow to understand more and more the depth and breadth of pure and jindefiled religion, how highly we value the means of grace within our grasp ; would that all others could be blest with the same knowledge and surrounded with the same strength. We have had no personal experience in what are termed the sinful pleasures of the world ; but judging from a knowledge of our inheritance, they are sensual and full of vanity, leading the mind afar from holy and noble purposes. It is enough for us to accept the warnings given by those who have had (his experience, and as we understand, obey; thus preserve the purity of soul which it is our sweet privilege to cultivate. 0 that we might be able to impress some little one with the unspeakable beauty and loveliness of the virgin character! thus engage the faculties so inclined to earthly loves and selfish pleasures, in the pursuit of spiritual graces. The question sometimes comes to us, Where is the power to convict souls of the inestimable value of a privilege to preserve soul and body unspotted from the world ? Have we sufficiently wrestled in prayer for 'the knowledge of the Lord to cover the earth' that the many whom circumstances bind to worldly relations, the many who are needy, watching and waiting, may feel the drawings of the Father, receive a baptism of the Holy Spirit, and become virgin sons and daughters in the Lord's House ?
