Religio-Philosophical Journal The 'Religio-Philosophical Journal' in speaking of itself ay-s,'Truth wears no mask, bows at no human shrine, seeks neither place nor applause; she only asks a hearing.' The Journal is an independent and uncompromising exponent of the spiritualism of to-day. Its field of labor may be a little less than that mentioned in the Bible,'twelve thousand furlongs square,' as it becomes an advocate in an 'Open Court' and introduces us to 'The Transcendental Community at Brook Farm.' Published in Chicago, 111. by B. F. Underwood.
