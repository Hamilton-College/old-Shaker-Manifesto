TRUST IN GOD. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. O'er the suntipped hills gleams a promise bright, In letters of gold it is cast: It telleth of hope and trust in God, That the storm will not always last. Tho' clouds may threaten, and muttering winds Defiantly sweep o'er our souls; Far sweeter is the calm with peace for a robe, We may wear when the storm backward rolls.
