OUR MANIFESTO. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½I herewith enclose a poem by J. G. Clark, an inspired man, and a bright star preparing to take his plac? in a constellation of the New Heavens now in process of formation. Our Manifesto has done a great deal of good, and we all bless it. I have a great interest in its publication. Let its pages sparkle with living, practical faith, that inspires hope and brings into operation the life essence of that love that knows all humanity as related to the divine, and realizes that what is for the benefit of one soul or part of humanity, if based on the eternal principle of right, will equally benefit every other part. The principle of Justice is applicable to every department of human existence ; and when brought into operation and practiced in accordance with the Golden Rule, we shall have the Millennium. The life principle of Shakerism is in the every day practice of the living faith of Mother's gospel. Which gos pel is imminently adapted to the life that is; even more so than to the life to come. And should be applied in all our relations to each other; especially as pertains to the things of this world. If the gospel of Christ and Mother, is just something to look up and forward to, as only to be attained after the body is laid aside, we certainly shall miss a great deal of good while passing to that stage of our development. A thorough knowledge and understanding of our basic principles, and of their practical application is very essential. A principle that cannot be put into operation in all our relations to our fellow men, and especially as pertains to the trade and traffic in the things of this world, would seem to me not worthy our attention. We talk a good deal about principles, but a definite statement, of how, what, when, and where, is or should be our practical standard. This would be very interesting reading. As they, (the principles,) are unalterable and never change, should we not be able at all times and in every place to discern them? When this is not the case is it not because of a beclouded understanding, which comes from the non-practice of the same ? If the principles of our gospel were 58 THE MANIFESTO. definitely stated, and their application denned, in every department of our order, in temporal, as well as spiritual things, we should have a straight line, and the square of truth could always be applied, to bring us to that straight line. We could then stand before the world, without any doubts, or caviling, a United body of Believers, Shakers, our practice conforming to our preaching, and to our holy faith. Our life practices, internal and external, would in a more emphatic manner be the exemplification to the world of the living faith that is in us. This would show, in our relation to each other as Brethren and Sisters, perfect equality. Practical equality would bring the square of truth to apply to all our possessions, and to our opportunities. I love the faith of the gospel, especially the spiritual part when applied to our every day relation in our Communal home. Our life must rest upon a spiritual principle, and that principle is as eternal as the law that governs the movement of the stars in their course. Who will give us, through the pages of the Manifesto, a definite and plain statement of our faith and principles, and the practical application of the same as applied by the square of truth. Let the trumpet sound. In kindest love, Daniel Offord.
