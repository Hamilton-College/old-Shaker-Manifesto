And if one wing be maimed or shot off, the bird flutters to the ground and cannot fly. We also have two wings on which we fly to heaven ; the one is faith and the other works. But we can only fly thither with two, and if we try with one we fall to the ground, and flutter and crawl there like a maimed bird.'
