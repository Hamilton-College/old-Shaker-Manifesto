LABOR Christ has come to seek and save that which was lost. The Gospel is a work of redemption for poor human souls, willing to give up every thing to obtain its blessings. Persons coming here, seeking salvation, should be informed what they are expected to do. They should learn that we, as a people, are not idle, and that this is not an idle place; that to gain salvation, we have to work for it, both in temporal and spiritual things; not by acting according to the dictates of our own wills, working at this or that thing as long, or as short as we choose, thereby creating confusion generally ; but by being obedient, not merely to our Elders, but also to those who have any business in charge, and by showing faithfulness in whatever we may be called to do. Thus, we not only find satisfaction, but also gain knowledge of what there is within us, which is just what we need. The evil elements in our hearts are touched and stirred up, and we can see where the battle-field is, and what we have to contend against. By confessing our past sins and putting them away, determined not to yield to the tempter any more, we have one point gained. This enables us, in a degree, to break the chains that bind us to earth, and by watching the workings of the enemy within us, and resisting him, we gradually rise out of the lower sphere into the higher â€” from the natural into the spiritual life.
