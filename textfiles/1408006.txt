The Theology of the Future. OLIVER PRENTISS. The humanity of to-day, compared with the humanity of our earliest acquaintance, three-quarters of a ceiitury ago, clearly demonstrates that the world moves. Men, that were men then, would be mere children now. With increased facilities of intercommunication, we have increased mental expansion. However beneficial the Theologies of the past, in their time and season, they cannot be the Theology of the future. To enable humanity to increase with the increase of the age, liberation, from prenatal and early educational] proclivities, is Sine qua non. Diversity of minds and diversity of conditions require diversity of instrumentalities. With some, the sledge hammer of the Iconoclast alone suffice, others, the gentle hand. In the Theology of the future, the vicarious will not be found. Religion will be practical. The Sovereignty of Individuality will be the cardinal plank. Each Individual will stand, in form erect, before the Burning Throne, in his and her own soul. The Sanctum Sanctorum will not be desecrated with thoughts impure, nothing that will not bear the scrutiny of angels, in and out of the body. Is such condition attainable? Such condition is we think attainable. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
