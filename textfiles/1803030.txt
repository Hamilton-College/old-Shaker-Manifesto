HOT BOILED MILK There is no better or healthier drink than hot or warm boiled milk. Even in the best hotels it is sometimes difficult to get boiled milk. In restaurants it is seldom given without a special order. In many private houses the article is practically unknown. In many houses where they pride themselves on their good coffee only cream is used in the mixture. Coffee with cream is delicious, and the lovely color it takes on as the thick yellow substance drops down into it is a joy forever. But it is, alas ! indigestible. I believe that many of the people who have decided that they cannot take coffee would find themselves nourished and strengthened, without injury, by equal parts of well made strong coffee and hot boiled milk.
