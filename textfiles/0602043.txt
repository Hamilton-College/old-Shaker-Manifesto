A fly was captured and put upon a leaf, which instantly closed, and on reopening, it was found that the fly was completely dissolved. A bit of beef was consumed in the same way. The leaf was then fed with cheese, which disagreed with it so much that it eventually killed it. 'Dr. Hooker explained that the plant's action was precisely similar to that of the human stomach.'
