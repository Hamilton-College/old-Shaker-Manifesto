WAITING Leakn to wait- -life's hard lesson, Conned, perchance, through blinding tears, While the heart throbs sadly echo To the tread of passing years. Learn to wait- -hope's slow fruition; Faint not, though the. way seems long; There is joy in each condition, Hearts through suffering may grow strong Constant sunshine, howe'er welcome, Ne'er would ripen fruit or flower; Giant oaks owe half their greatness To the scathing tempest's power. Thus the soul untouched by sorrow, Aims not at a higher state; Joy seeks not a brighter morrow- - Only sad hearts learn to wait. Human strength and human greatness Spring not from life's sunny side ; Heroes must be more than drift-wood, Floating down a waveless tide. Selected.
