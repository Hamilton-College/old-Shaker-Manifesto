Shaker Station, Ct. May, 1895. 'Every man that hath this hope in him, (that is the hope of being like Christ,) purifieth himself even as He is pure.' Let us hope on and hope ever. Let us be strong, be brave and manly, believing that, 'He doeth all things well.' Let us be sure we are sowing good seed in the heart; sure that we ought to do just what we are doing, and all will be well with us. In forming a true Christian character, purity is the chief corner stone. Let us be virtuous and heavenly joy will flow into our hearts. Impure people poison their associates by evil examples and are moral ulcers and plague spots. Let us shun the malaria of vice as we would a pestilence. How sweet are the hours spent in God's service. 'Good thoughts are blessed visitors, and should be heartily welcomed and much sought after. Like rose leaves they give THE MANIFESTO. 139 out a sweet savor if laid away in the jar of memory.' 'A friend in need is a friend indeed; but a friend, indeed, is never in need.' 'The first Bible printed in America was in 1663. It was translated by John Elliot into Algonkin language for the Indians. At the sale of the Brinley library in New York, March 1879 an Elliot New Testament brought $7.00. At the same sale a Bible of 1663 sold for $1,000. At an auction in 1884 a Bible of 1685 brought $950. The Bement copy of the Elliot Testament of 1661 sold in London in 1820 for less than a dollar. The same copy at a sale in New York in 1890 brought $610. The total amount of Indian Testaments and Bibles of this period now known to exist is 125.' 'The Chinese not only cultivate their land, but all of their lakes, ponds and marshes are gardens in which aquatic plants, suitable for food are largely raised. Among these the water chestnut is preeminent and is said to be of a very palatable and wholesome nature.' Daniel Orcult.
