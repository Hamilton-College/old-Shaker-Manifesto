EQUALITY. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. God's ways are equal- -man's ways are unequal and the end of all reforms is to bring about an equality ot the human race and place them on the level of love where God made them in the beginning. The distinction between the rich and the poor has been charged to God, but this is false. It originated in the wickedness of man and woman combined. It never emanated from God. God's ways are equal. Man's ways are unequal and selfish in the extreme. God's law is the lav/ of love and kindness, and good-will to all the human race. Man's ways are full of hatred, envy, strife and contention, which never came from God, but is of the wicked one. God is infinite, and we cannot go where he is not. We cannot get away from Him, and I would not if I could. I want to love Him more and serve Him better than I ever did. Yea ! I want to love Him more, with all my heart, soul, mind, might and strength, and my neighbor as myself. 'On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.' It is said on good authority, that the licentiousness of man and woman, at the present day, are greater than they were in any preceding age of the world ; and more aggravating, because committed under greater light, and who can deny it? Is it any wonder that the world is ripe for destruction, and the calamities are pressing hard on every hand ? What is the 1'emedy ? Alas ! only one ! Put away the cause and the effect will c?ase. If this is not done speedily, the Avorld is doomed to destruction, and no power on earth can save it. North Union, Ohio.
