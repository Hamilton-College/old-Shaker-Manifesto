HELP ONE ANOTHER. By Rev. Geo. F. Hunting. ''Help one another,' the snowflakes said, As they cuddled down in their fleeey bed. 'One of us here would not be felt One of us here wouldjquickly melt! 'But I'll help you, and you help me, And then what a big white drift we'll see.' 'Help one another,' the maple spray Said to its fellow-leaves one day; 'The sun would wither me here alone -Long enough ere the day was gone; But I'll help you, and you help me, And then what a splendid shade there'll be.' 'Help one another,' the dew-drop cried Seeing another drop close by its side; 'This warm south breeze would send me away And I should be gone ere noon to-day; But I'll help you, and you help me. And we'll make a brook and run to the sea!' 'Help one another,' a grain of sand Said to another grain just at hand; 'The wind may carry me over the sea, And then, oh what will become of me? But come, my brother, give me your hand, We'll build a mountain and there we'll stand?' ***** And so the snow-flakes grew to drifts, And grains of sand to mountains; And leaves became a pleasant shade, And dew-drops fed the fountains.
