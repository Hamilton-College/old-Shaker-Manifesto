WINTER RULES Never begin a journey until the breakfast has been eaten. Never take warm drinks and then immediately go out in the cold air. Keep the back — especially between the shoulder-blades — well covered; also the chest well protected. In sleeping in a cold room, establish the habit of breathing through the nose, and never with the mouth open. Never go to bed with cold or damp feet; always toast them by a fire ten or fifteen minutes before going to bed. Never omit regular bathing, for unless the skin is in an active condition, the cold will close the pores and favor congestion or other diseases. After exercise of any kind, never ride in an open carriage nor near the window of a car, for a moment. It is dangerous to health, and even to life. When hoarse, speak as little as possible until it is recovered from, else the voice may be permanently lost, or difficulties of the throat be produced. Merely warm the back by a fire, and never continue keeping the baok exposed to heat after it has become comfortably warm. To do otherwise is debilitating. When going from a warm atmosphere into a colder one, keep the mouth closed, so that the air may be warmed by its passage through the nose, ere it reaches the lungs. Never stand still in cold weather, especially after having taken a slight degree of exercise; and always avoid standing upon ice or snow, or where the person is exposed to a cold wind.— Albany (W. Y.) Argus.
