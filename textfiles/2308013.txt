Still, as the spiral grew... 'Still, as the spiral grew he left past year's dwelling for the new, Stole with soft step its shining archway through, built up its idle door, Stretched in his last found home, and knew the old no more. Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee, Child of the wandering sea, cast from her lap forlorn. ***** Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul! As the swift seasons roll. Leave thy low vaulted past Let each new temple, nobler than the last Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, Till thou at length art free, Leaving thine out-grown shell, by life's unresting sea.'
