Losing friends Never cast aside your friends if by any possibility you can retain them. We are the weakest of spendthrifts if we let one friend drop off through inattention, or let one push away another, or if we hold aloof from one for petty jealousy or heedless slight or roughness. Would you throw away a diamond because it pricked you ? One good friend is not to be weighed against the jewels of all the earth. If there is coolness or unkindness between us, let us come face to face and have it out. Quick, before the love grows cold ! Life is too short to quarrel in, or to carry black thoughts of friends. It is easy to lose a friend, but a new one will not come for calling, nor make up for the old one when he comes. Never harbor animosity toward a friend for a mere hasty expression. Forgiveness is a god-like quality, and a true friend is so scarce that he should not be repudiated on slight grounds; but those who injure you from 'malice prepense' should be shunned as you would avoid a tiger.
