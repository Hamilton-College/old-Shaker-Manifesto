The Children's Grotto Fun and Noise Sometimes Proper — My Dear Children :—I have been persuaded for years that there is a hilarity in the com- position of young people while they are growing, which aches to come out; and that if it does not get vent in the proper place, it will bring distress on older and more sedate people at an improper time. I think you have a right to be noisy at times and in proper places ; but accept a hint from me; and out of respect for your superiors and seniors, try and have the overflow of youthful glee and noise take place where it will not disturb the older people, and be sure to refrain from being ill-mannerly in places sacred to quiet and religious purposes. We older people are too apt to forget we once were young and noisy, and needed a great de'al of forbearance ; but when we think of it, we will know it was so. But you can do a great deal to make older people better pleased with you, than making the earth quake with a racket of noise too much of the time. Not long ago there was a prediction that a certain city would be visited by an earthquake, so some careful parents sent their boys a long distance into the country to visit some friends ; but some things happened shortly after, and you can imagine what they were, which caused the country friends to write : ' Send us on the earthqaake, but come and take your boys home ! ' An earthquake rather than noisy boys !
