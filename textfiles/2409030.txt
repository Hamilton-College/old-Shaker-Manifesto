THE MOUSE'S PROMISE. A mouse fell into a beer vat, poor thing, and a cat passing by saw the struggling little creature. The mouse said to the cat: 'Help me out of my difficulty.' 'If I do, I shall eat you,' said the cat. 'Very well,' replied the mouse; 'I would rather be eaten by a decent cat than drowned in such a horrible mess of stuff as this.' It was a sensible cat and said, 'I certainly shall eat you, and you must promise me on your word of honor that I may do so.' 'Very well, I will give \ou the promise.' So the cat fished the mouse out, and trusting to the promise she dropped it for an instant. The mouse darted away and crept into a hole in the corner, where the cat could not get him. 'But didn't you promise me I might eat you?' said puss. 'Yes, I did,' replied the mouse, 'but didn't you know that when I made that promise I was in liquor?^ And how many promises made in liquor have been broken! ï¿½Selected.
