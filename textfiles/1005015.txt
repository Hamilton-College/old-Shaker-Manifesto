EXAMPLER — REDEEMER A dear friend of ours, a Rev. D. D. neighbor, recently sent us an affectionate note in which this remarkable passage occurs: 'You see Jesus, the exampler, may you come to know Jesus Christ, the Redeemer!' Well, friends, are we not really on the right road to this knowledge ? It is, however, an indisputable fact, that the sectarian world, too generally, has overlooked the necessary gradations unto the Christian Redemption ; and most assuredly fails to see that the redemption of the Christ is attainable only, through following the life example of him who became Christ, by reason of his excellent life. The Revelator saw a multitude of ''the redeemed;' and they were ' Virgins,' as was Jesus; 'undefiled' with lusts; 'who had come up out of great tribulations, and had washed their robes, making them white, 'in the life of the Lamb' — Christ. We cannot think it an open question: ' Can we be redeemed without following the example of Jesus Christ?' We believe this question is closed by the answer: We must live like the Christ before we can know of his redemptions. Is not this true ?
