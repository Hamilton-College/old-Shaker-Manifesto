PERSEVERE. Brother ! choose the path of duty, Keep the path, and have no fear; Life will show thee all its beauty, If thou wilt but persevere. When dark clouds are hanging o'er thee, And thy way seems dim and drear, Think of heaven that lies before thee, Work for God, and persevere. Grieve not, if thy lot is lowly, And thou toilest year by year; Has not God made labor holy ? Do thy best, and persevere. Art thou statesman, artist, poet, Hold thy own vocation dear, By the love of virtue show it, Help thy brethren, persevere ! God has given to all His creatures Duties, loving, true and clear; Every state has noble features, Choose thy own, and persevere. Make each day in life a witness, Spreading tidings far and near, Of the glory and the fitness Of the watchwordï¿½Persevere. Guardian Angel.
