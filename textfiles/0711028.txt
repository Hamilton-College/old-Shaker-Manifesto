Composition Composition.â€”Here is a composition written by a boy of South Danvers, Mass. Let timid contributors to The Shaker take courage. Let us hear from you. ''South Danvers is in the United States. It js bounded by Salem and reaches to Middleton. Its principal river is Goldthwaite's brook, which empties into Salem harbor. Its principal lake is the mill-pond, which is dry in the summer. Its principal productions are leather, onions, the South Church and George Peabody. South Danvers has many religious sects, among which are the Orthodox, who worship their minister; the Spiritualists, who worship everything; and the Unitarians, who worship nothing.'
