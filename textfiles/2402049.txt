'Leisure Moments' with its nearly four hundred well filled pages of short, interesting and profitable articles, will be all this and much more to those who possess it. Read what is said about being Content. 'One man can not do everything, be everything, nor have everything. We have, each of us all we can attend to, to do our own business; why should we envy others their talents, their work or their wages? 1'hey have their duties to do, and to their own Master they �stand or full. We have as many talents as we shall improve, as much prosperity as we de serve, and all the responsibility we shall wish to answer for in the day of judgment.'

The Springfield Republican has had a unique history among New England newspapers. In the whole country pei'haps there is no other journal published outside of the great cities which is so widely copied or wields so strong an influence. The story of its early days, when Samuel Bowles was at its head, Dr. Holland its literary editor, and 'Warrington' and Frank Sanborn were writing letters from Boston, is told in an interesting way by Mr. Clarence E. Blake, in his article on Springfield, in the January number of the New England Magazine. The New England has published few articles on New England towns more valuable or more beautifully illustrated than this on Springfield.�Warren F. Kellogg, 5 Park Square, Boston. The Columbia Desk Calendar, which is issued annually by the Pope Manufacturing Company, of Columbia Bicycle fame, is out for 1894, much improved in appearance. It is a pad calendar of the same size and shape as those of previous years, having a leaf for each day, but its attractiveness has been heightened by the work of a clever artist, who has scattered a series of bright pen-drawings through its pages. It also contains, as usual, many appropriate and interesting contributions from people both bright and wise.

The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for January presents in its first pages i\ character study of Prof John Tyndall in which Dr. Beall explains many points of great value to students of Phrenology. The veteran phrenologist, Dr. J. L. Capen, contributes some very original and surprising views on the organ of Weight which will excite interest if not controversy. Prof. Sizer continues his elaborate series, How to Study Strangers, and in this number, discusses Quality, with many illustrations. His phrenological delineation of the celebrated reformer, Lucy Stone, is especially sympathetic and closely analytical. It will be read with profit and pleasure. Mrs. Charlotte F. Wells gives an account of George Combe's remarkable experiments with the daughter of Prof. J. J. Mapes, which deserves very particular mention, as it contains certain proofs of phrenological principles which will satisfy the most incredulous and exacting investigators. The editorial features are unusually strong, and a published letter from the eminent scholar, Joseph Cook, on the value of Phrenology, will command wide attention. The other departments are replete with good things. Price, 15 cts; $1.50 a year. Address Fowler &amp; Wells Co., 25 East 21st Street, New York.
