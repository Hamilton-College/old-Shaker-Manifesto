The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for January presents in its first pages i\ character study of Prof John Tyndall in which Dr. Beall explains many points of great value to students of Phrenology. The veteran phrenologist, Dr. J. L. Capen, contributes some very original and surprising views on the organ of Weight which will excite interest if not controversy. Prof. Sizer continues his elaborate series, How to Study Strangers, and in this number, discusses Quality, with many illustrations. His phrenological delineation of the celebrated reformer, Lucy Stone, is especially sympathetic and closely analytical. It will be read with profit and pleasure. Mrs. Charlotte F. Wells gives an account of George Combe's remarkable experiments with the daughter of Prof. J. J. Mapes, which deserves very particular mention, as it contains certain proofs of phrenological principles which will satisfy the most incredulous and exacting investigators. The editorial features are unusually strong, and a published letter from the eminent scholar, Joseph Cook, on the value of Phrenology, will command wide attention. The other departments are replete with good things. Price, 15 cts; $1.50 a year. Address Fowler &amp; Wells Co., 25 East 21st Street, New York.
