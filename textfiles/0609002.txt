IS WOMAN ANY LONGER RESPONSIBLE? RUTH WEBSTER Ever since Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, woman has had to bear the reproach of leading mankind into sin. About one hundred years ago God raised up a woman, and endowed her with wisdom to bring forth a testimony by which mankind might be led out of sin. Many thousands have realized its efficacy. Henceforth, let every one who continues in sin after hearing the gospel testimony, bear the reproach himself, and not cast it on woman. ]f mankind had been as ready to have been led out as into sin, long, ere this, lewdness would have ceased in the land, and long since, war would have been no more.
