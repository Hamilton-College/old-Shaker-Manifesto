Dependence F. W. EVANS 'If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.' If the individual souls of Abram and Moses sought after God as a divine director of their souls, through invisible agencies, or mediators, called the Lord, or angel of the Lord, when those men had become the head of a body composed of like-minded individual souls, that body could well say, by its mouth-piece, 'If thy presence go not with us, carry us not up hence.' The same is equally true of our organized body. The life of God in the human soul is the one thing needful to preserve from evil and to empower the soul to be and to do good. Consequently, every true member of such body should pray that the visible head and lead of such body be led by the Holy Spirit of the hrAible church in the spirit world.
