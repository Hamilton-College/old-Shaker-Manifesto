Health Hints . â€” Gentian root is said to be a tobacco antidote: Buy two ounces or more of Gentian root, coarsely ground. Take as much of it after each meal, or oftener, as amounts to a common quid of 'fine-cut.' Chew it slowly and swallow the juice. Continue this a few weeks and you will conquer the appetite for tobacco. To stop a flow of blood, take the fine dust of tea, or the scrapings of the inside of tanned leather; bind it upon the wound closely, and blood will soon cease to flow. After the blood has ceased to flow laudanum may be applied to the wound. Due regard to these instructions will save agitation of mind running for a surgeon, who probably will make no better prescription if present than this.
