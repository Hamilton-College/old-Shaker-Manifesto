Celery for rheumatism Celery for Rheumatism. â€” Celery cooked is a very fine dish, both as nutriment and as a purifier of the blood. Rheumatism is impossible on such diet. Cold or damp never produces rheumatism, but simply develops it. The acid blood is the primary cause, and sustaining power of evil. While the blood is alkaline, there can be no rheumatism, and equally no gout. Cut the celery into inch dice ; boil in water until soft. No water must be poured away unless drunk by the invalid. Then take new milk, slightly thicken with flour, and flavor with nutmeg ; serve up with diamonds of toasted bread round dish, and eat with potatoes.
