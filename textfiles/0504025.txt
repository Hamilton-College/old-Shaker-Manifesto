SOLICITATION The joys of earth I would not seek, That transient pleasures give; I ask a spirit low and meek, That in the truth would live. I crave not worldly honor, fame, Or glittering golden store ; But I would win the Christian name The cross our Saviour bore. Nor do I ask to be adorn'd With laurels, won by strife; But only seek to be enroll'd, Within the book of life. I ask, that pure angelic love May find in me a place, The spirit of the heavenly dove, The power of quick'ning grace. That I may be a vessel pure, Fit for the Master's use ; The burning fire of truth endure, Its radiance diffuse. And ever seek to bear aloft, The banner of sweet peace ; That hung'ring souls may gather oft, To share its rich increase. Rhoda R. Hollister, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
