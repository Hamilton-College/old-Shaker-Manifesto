The GOOD, The TRUE, The BEAUTIFUL O. PRENTISS The ancient Greeks, who did much to lift humanity from its primeval barbarism, found it all the way an up .grade. Hence this Motto— Ohalepa ta Kala—in our language The Good, the True, the Beautiful are difficult of attainment. The gospel of our blessed Mother Ann, with the Order established by Father Joseph and Mother Lucy and ably sustained by their devoted successors, enables us to give practical demonstration of the fact, that the Good, the True, the Beautiful are attainable. We see it cropping out in our dear Gospel Relations. And in proportion as we have an eye for the beautiful, become dematerialized in our soul states—all earthly influences left behind—we behold The Good, the True, the Beautiful—nothing less. Mt. Lebanon, iV'. Y.
