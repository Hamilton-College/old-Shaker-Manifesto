CHRISTMAS, 1885. ASENATH C. STICKNEY. ' And I say unto you that many ahull come from the East, and from the West, and .shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven,.' Matt.viii., 11. Ye have come dearest friends, As the Savior declared From the East�from the West� To a mansion prepared, Where the faithful, the loyal May hope to sit down With the fathers and mothers Of saintly renown. As vre look o'er the house-hold Convened here today And fancy how d stant Our native homes lay, Some queries like these, Link themselves into rhyme; What led you my friends To leave country and clime? Fathers, or mothers, Houses, or lands? But to win for the spirit Its higher demands? What caused you to leave Worldly honor or fame Profession or station, A title, a name, If not that the soul might Its ransom secure By seeking the real, The lasting, the sure. And shunning alike, The false, the impure. Ye unwritten miracles !� Naught hut a God Could lead you thus wisely To seek one abode ! The small voice of conscience, The power within Has marked as your destiny,� ' Freedom from sin ! ' Behold here a group from A far Western land Another from Scotland! From England, a hand And one from the North,� That cold realm of the snows Called Canada East ;� All engaged in one cause. While miles, miles away from The North Eastern coast, Have journeyed two sisters Who've counted the cost! But most, represent the free States of our Union Where the ' Eagle of Liberty Spreads its broad pinion, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey New Hampshire Vermont, Massachusetts, IoAva, Here join heart with heart In holy endeavor, And here may they stand, Firm and loyal, forever. Thrice welcome ! each one, To our chosen communion ! Go! bless all at home, And hallow our union. And now, if all records stand Squared by the truth, If all debts are cancelled With age, and with youth, We may in the fullness Of freedom rejoice, And give to our gladness A tongue, and a voice,-That the birth of the Spiritual era, whose dawn Dating centuries back, To us is come down. In divineness of purpose Its power shall reach Through the ages to come, By divineness of speech. And let us rejoice that A Christmas is here With blessings uncounted To crown the old year And our home whose broad circle Embraces the whole, Where the sunshine of mercv Illumines the soul.� Let our pledges renewed For the New Year, become One in faith, one in purpose, In bapt'sm, one.� Canterbury, N.
