SAFELY ANCHORED. By Ada S. Cummings. [ Written for Brother Samuel Kendrick.] All was quiet in the Harbor, Evening shades were close at hand, Where the ever restless waters Beat upon the silv'ry sand. And the sun was slowly sinking 'Neath the cloud's resplendent rim, When a barque from life's long journey To the port, came sailing in. Now throw out the anchoring hawser And make fast the sturdy barque, Which has stood through storm and danger, Out upon life's ocean, dark 1 For unto the port of Heaven Comes the craft, all safe at last; Oh how grandly o'er the billows Has it rode thro' tempest's blast! Thus, within the twilight's gloaming, Many ships come sailing in; Sailing in from storm and danger, There a place of rest to win Where the wicked cease from troubling And the weary are set free. Safe, within the golden harbor, Where the many mansions be. There, beneath the glimmering shadows Of the sunset's borderland, THE MANIFESTO. 89 Where the ever murmuring waters Beat upon the shining strand ; There, our barques will some time anchor To the moorings on the shore, Where the beacon from the Lighthouse Sheds its rays forevermore. There the weary sailors gather When their sun sinks in the West, And the Captain,Christ, our Father, Gives to them their well-earned rest. There they dwell beside the river, Safe within the port of Love, Firmly anchored to the Haven, In their happy home above. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
