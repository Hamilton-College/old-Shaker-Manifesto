LESSONS FOR EVERY DAY. Geneveve De Graw. Renew thy covenant each day, That right within may bear the sway, Renew thy pledge to keep God's word, Renew thy faith in Christ thy Lord. Forget thyself and selfish will, With deeds of love the moments fill. Renounce the false, strive truth to know : Look up, not down, where'er you go. In wisdom's path move ever on, Work righteousness and good will come. Strive for the wealth that's not of earth, Secure a fame of holy worth. Profess but little, much more do; Through prayer and grace thy strength renew. Seek from the realms that are divine A holier atmosphere than thine. Bear not false witnessï¿½it is sin; Adhere to truth without, within. Condemn all errors of thy own, For every wrong haste to atone. To Cassar render what thou should, And unto God give all that's good. Serve well the principles of right, In all that's holy take delight. Shun all appearances of wrong, Let virtue be thy theme and song. Give honor where is honor due, Thus prove thyself disciple true. Act not from motives that are vain, That unjust credit thou may'st gain. Remember every thought and word Some unseen angel doth record. Of thine own merits never boast, Thou art but mortal frail, at most. The greatest skill thou mayest show Can never cause one plant to grow. If precious gifts to thee are given, Know well they come fron.' God in heaven. In all humility of soul Surrender to our Lord the whole. Of envious strivings pray beware; Ne'er sow thy field with baneful tare, Good seed to srw awaiteth thee, Sow such and rich shall the harvest be. A harvest fraught with precious sheaves Of ripened wheat. Not falling leaves, With courage toil, though you're alone, Until the Master calls thee home. Live to do good more than to please ; Follow, each day, what God decrees ; Redeem thy soul from all that's dross, Accept with grace thy Savior's cross. Be patient; God w!:o placed thee here Will ne'er withdraw his love so dear. Be patient God's own time abide; Thy life, thy all in Him confide. Be not in haste, but learn to wait; A minute cannot worlds create. All seed must have its time flft grow, E'ei its existence we may know. Live thou for God's most holy cause, And work for heaven's highest laws, Let wisdom to thy spirit come And pray 'God's will on earth be done.' Sonyea, N. Y.
