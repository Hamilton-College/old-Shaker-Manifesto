What would our children have said? 'WHAT straits are the most perilous?' asked the Sunday school superintendent, and a little boy spoke up promptly: 'Whisky straights I ' and the boy was right. THE son of a coffee and spice dealer was asked at school where coffee came from, and the reply was: 'Father said I musn't tell, and he'll lick me if I do.' 'My little boy,' said an evangelical caller in Tennessee, 'have you got the gospel here?' 'No, we haven't got it here, but they've got it awful bad down in Memphis I' A LITTLE boy, the son of an orthodox Presbyterian in this city, recently listened attentively to some conversation in regard to Jesus having been a Jew. At last he could stand it no longer and broke out with 'Well, I don't see how that could be, when God, His father, was a Presbyterian.' WILLIE, aged ten, and Jemmy, aged six, were playing together. One of them was minutely examining a fly. 'I wonder how God made him?' he exclaimed. 'God don't make flies as carpenters make things,' observed the other boy. 'God says, let there be flies, and there is flies.' THE grandma of a little four-year old had been telling her one day not to say people lied, but rather that they were mistaken Her grandmother, to amuse her, told her a bear story, which was a tough one to believe. After she had finished, the little girl looked up into her face and exclaimed: 'Grandma, that is the biggest mistaken I have ever heard.' A MINISTER in a country church in' Scotland stopped in the course of his sermon one day, and thus addressed a boy who was somewhat deaf: 'Are you hearing, John?' 'Oh, yes, sir,' was John's prompt reply;' I am hearing, but to very little purpose.' A great many folks, young and old, might as well be deaf as to attend church and yet not hear the word. Those whose hearing is defective are not the only ones who hear to very little purpose.
