Cleanse first that which... NELLIE M. Houghteiling. ' Cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. ' Matt, xxiii., 26. Oir Savior perceived that the Pharisees were impure within and having a semblance of purity outside; he could see their desire to appear well before men, while their hearts were full of hypocrisy and deceit. They were like many professed Christians in this day, who have an appearance of piety, but who do not possess any of the real substance of a religious life. Christ also said: 'Take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them, ' Matt., vi, 1, which implies that we are to improve every little opportunity for doing good in a quiet prayerful way, though others may know nothing of these little deeds of kindness ; yet for each we have our reward. The cleansing work should begin within which will help to reform our outward habits; and if true, every thought and desire will be pure and our aspirations will be for purity of spirit. One who makes merely a profession of religion and has not the real substance; when temptations and trials come their professions amount to but very little : while one whose purpose is fixed to serve God can stand firm and true though surrounded with many difficulties ; each trial seems to bring them nearer to God, giving them greater trust in his wisdom and care. Canterbury, N. II.
