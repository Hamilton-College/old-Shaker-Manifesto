We have need to watch very carefully... Text: Watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation. Mark, xvi., 38. We have need to watch very carefully. When we are tempted to do that which is wrong we can pray to God for aid, and if our prayer is sincere He will be sure to give it to us. Sometimes when we have done wrong a great many times, we feel as if we would not try to do right any more. But it is because we have not been prayerful and watchful enough. If we set a careful watch upon our motives our Heavenly Father will give us strength to do right. So let us all continue watching every day lest our feet stray into wrong paths, and pray for that grace which cometh down from on high to strengthen our efforts for the right. Hancock, Mass.
