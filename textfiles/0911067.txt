TRUST Abraham Perkins Enfield, N. H. 1. Bless us through all cares and burdens, O'er the stormy sea of life; 2. Weak and frail when strength is greatest, Then but little we impart; 3. Precious, faith which hath preserved us, By the mercy of our God; Stay us Lord in our affliction, Help us in the glorious strife. When our off'rings are most perfect, Feeble is the human heart. Never can our souls reject it, Never slight the living word. Though the way be rough and thorny, Flowers often hidden be, Still we ask thy kind forbearance, Till we are made strong and free, Unto Thee, O Heavenly Father, Life and strength we will renew, Perilous the road we travel, We will ever trust in Thee. Lord, Thou art our sure defender, Center all our hopes in Thee. What the trial, what the conflict, We'll be loyal firm and true.
