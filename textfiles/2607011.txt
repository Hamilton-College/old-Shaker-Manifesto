Sabbathday Lake, Me. June, 1896. The beautiful month of June has rolled around with its warm days and bright sunshine. May was cold, with very little rain and the hay crop will no doubt be light as the grass, at this writing, is indeed very thin and short. Many of the farmers in our vicinity are planting large fields of fodder corn to feed their stock on another winter. Some of the Brethren have recently completed sawing about sixty M. shingles, while others were engaged on the farm and garden. Sisters have about 1000 ft. of sweet peas now under cultivation. On the 5th inst. the Brethren and Sisters of this place visited the 'waste places of Zion' and made them beautiful by picking up and taking care of the debris and at noon we had a fine picnic dinner, served under the shady trees at the North end of our brick dwelling. This had been THE MA NIFtiS TO. 117 planned as a Decoration day celebration, but the rain prevented, thus the postponement. We are anticipating a pleasant visit with good Father Abraham Perkins and our beloved Editor of The Manifesto Elder Henry C. Blinn. Ada S. G'ummings.
