Who Were They? â€” Who was Samson? A man of great physical strength, whose beverage was water, and his food vegetarian. Who was Daniel ? A wise and good man, whose drink was water, and his food vegetarian. Who was John the Baptist? The mightiest man born of woman, whose drink was water, and his food vegetarian.' So says one of* our temperance journals.
