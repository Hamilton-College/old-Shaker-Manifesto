Hancock, Mass. Sept. 9, 1891. Dear Editor;ï¿½With a soul full of appreciation and thankfulness for the luminous little monthly magazine that comes to us laden with riches, and sheds its radiant beams of light on the pilgrim's pathway, we take our pen for the purpose of adding our mite to the department of the Home Notes. Thoughtful remembrances and kindest wishes are tendered to the faithful band who so patiently toil to interest and instruct the many readers, while breathings of prayer ascend to the Father above, that he may continue to bless and prosper so laudable an enterprise. We recently had the satisfaction of entertaining for a few hours a company of devoted, worthy Sisters from the North Family of Mount Lebanon. Harvesting, cutting and drying of apples, canning of fruit and attending to other needful duties is the present occupation. Apples and pears are more plentiful than we had anticipated. Plums few or none. Oats a good crop. ^ Potatoes yielded well, but show signs of decay. Our little blackberry patch that looked so finely in the spring, gave us the nice product of sixteen bushels of rare sweet berries. 'Dr. Kaime finding a flower under the Humboldt glacier was more affected by it because it grew under the lip and in the cold bosom of the ice, than he would have been by the most gorgeous garden bloom.' In like manner we are surprised, ami record with great pleasure the fact that we gathered this season, from a tree grown in our Office garden, a bushel of good peaches. Such an incident has not occurred in this, section of country for several years. Br. Ira we are sorry to say, is not improving in health as it is desirable that he should. He now expects to make a trip as far south as New Jer- sey, by advise of his Physician. Being unable to make the journey alone, two Sisters will accompany and remain with him. God grant that he be restored to health and comfort. J. L. S.
