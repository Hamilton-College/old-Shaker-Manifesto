WHERE IS THE CROSS OR SELF-DENIAL? Mary Whitcher. If works of all around me Were perfect, good and right, And I were treated kindly Without a scowl or slight,ï¿½ If food and drink and clothing Were ample and to spare, Why should I not be loving Having no cross to bear? But is our goodness tested In such an easy way, Or do we need the trial That's common day by day? The fitfulness of children, The vanities of youth, The tempest of a manhood That's battling for the truth? Ah more, the change of fortune, The highest hope cut down, The poor and faulty equal Or greater in renown. All trials ours, borne patient, And Christian love bestowed On all who're traveling with us And have with us one God. Canterbury, N. H.
