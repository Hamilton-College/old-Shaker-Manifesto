NOT DEAD. Composed for, and read at the funeral of Brother Daniel Fraser, Oct 10., 1889. Annie R. Stephens. Passed from our mortal vision, Stamped with the seal of death ; Not dead,�but, in homes Elysian Breathing immortal breath. 'Not dead,' I hear him saying, 'For in these realms sublime, To those who truth obeying, Death, is life's blossom time.' The floweret of the Summer Lies cold in Autumn's tomb ; But soon the soft May breezes Revive to bud and bloom. And thus the spirit groweth Through all life's toil and pain; Its essence upward goeth, To bloom in Spring again. So our beloved hath left us; Yet mourn we not in grief; The angels have bereft us, To claim the ripened sheaf. Yea, ripened by the doing Of deeds of godliness ; By duty's path pursuing That leads to righteousness, No good thing ever dieth; And they who rise from loss, Will find earth's struggles brightened By the halo of the cross. The tribute that we bring thee Our heart's affections hold; Through all thy life there runneth Bright threads of living gold. No lowly one benighted, But felt thy pitying love ; Each cause by justice lighted Thy voice was strong to move. No monument we rear thee, No costly work of art; Thy works and life endear thee Unto each loving heart. Blest is the soul that giveth Its all in sacrifice ; Not dead,�that spirit liveth In Heaven's own Paradise. Not dead, but only drifted A little farther on, To where the vale is lifted In the Summer Land of song. I catch the strains of gladness, Rung from the harps of gold, Released from mortal sadness, What glories now unfold. 0 spirit clothed imn ortal! Yea, pure and holy one, Gained is the pearly portal, Thine are the laurels won. Hearken, sweet angel voices Float down from azure heights ; 'Not d^ad, his soul rejoices In heaven's eternal light.'
