Editorial. In the preaching of Shakerism... In the preaching of Shakerism, which is only another name for Christianity, we can have no other object than to preach the whole truth as God has permitted it to shine into our souls. Every moral and every Christian Society has a measure of influence bearing upon this same question, and all are more or less anxious, when directed by uplifting inspirations, to have the good prosper and maintain an ascendency ovei every low estate. When Jesus remarked that 'the truth shall make you free,' he was the messenger of an inspirational influence that should from that day hold permanent possession of the human mind. , Whatever may transpire in the world to allure man from the principles of righteousness, or to engulf him in the vortex of sin, there has ever been a light from God, revealing the power and glory of a better life. We are ascetics in any other sense than that which occupied the mind of Jesus, where he says, 'Ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.' This declaration of Jesus must find a resting place in the heart of every one who believes in the mission of the Christ. The life of the. world is the life of animal generation, a place not in the least above that upon which Adam and Eve lived during their Edenic visitation. The amalgamation of the life of the world with that manifested by the cross of Christ has been the superlative desire and the untiring effort of every form of pseudo Christianity. To force this upon the mind of man that he may be held by the influences of a sensual world has been the priestly influence of every credent church. 'Wars and rumors of wars' have been heard at every point of the compass, and with the poison of asps under their tongues, a stream of private or public persecution, has in the name of religion, been a plague spot on the earth and an affliction to all dissenters. The opening of a church service was recently made by reading a portion of the sermon on the Mount. It was beautiful beyond expression and breathed an inspiration so lifegiving that one might be transported to a realm where God-men or good men dwell in peaceful prosperity. It requires no studied effort to accept the ministrations of that life which was above and in advance of the world. It was the embodiment of goodness�one with the Father� and kindly permitting us the privilege to share in the same great blessing. A man on the earth, 'tempted in all points as were his brethren' and yet a living example of a present resurrection, in which all must participate if they would be among the members of his church. A freedom that is wrought out through the acceptance of this truth, must permeate the whole being, and make of every recipient of this divine favor, a man or woman of God. We can see no inducement for those who accept the cross of Christ, who know that they can, by faithfulness in the truth, obtain the promised reward, to anticipate or even to hold in possession those treasures which savor of selfishness or which lead to a life-in the world. Better say with the, apostle, 'God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus, the Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.' Gal. v., 14. Here we have a Christian testimony that gives forth no uncertain sound. Through this comes a freedom which the truth only could establish in the mind. As it made the apostle a free man, a son of God, so in like manner, the growth of the same divine truth in the soul will make of all others, free men and sons and daughters of our God. We have no occasion to say that this is like 'our testimony' for it is the testimony which the gospel of Christ came to establish, and becomes our treasure by accepting it into our daily life, and by establishing it in the kingdom of our God by practical righteousness.
