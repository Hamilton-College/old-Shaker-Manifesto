Sanitary. SALT AS A MEDICINE. [STAINBACK WILSON, M. D., ATLANTA, SA.] We are very apt to seek some far fetched cure for our bodily ailments, and to overlook the simpler remedies, quite as effective it may be, which are to be found even in the humblest household. Common salt is one of the specifics for various diseases, which many lose the benefit of because they are not aware of its value. For sore or inflamed eyes, wash them in a weak solution of salt and warm water. This is also useful to remove the inflammation caused by extraneous substances in the eye. For sore throat and a hacking cough, take one salt-spoonful of salt, two tea-spoonfuls of vinegar, to half a goblet of cold water (icedwater preferable;) sip this frequently and relief will be felt at once. This same preparation will remove nausea, and settle the weakest stomach. It is also be eficial in attacks of colic. Nothing is more useful in sickness than a small flannel bag filled with salt. For toothache, colic, or diseases requiring warm applications, it is invaluable, as it retains its heat a long time ; and it is greatly to be preferred to hot, wet emollients, which soon get cold and uncomfortable The bag and all can be put on a tin pan and warmed in the oven ; but it is better to rip a small hole in the bag, and empty the salt out into the pan to heat. After it is hot it can be put back with a large spoon, and the hole sewed up in a moment. We have recommended this to several of our friends while they were suffering severe pain, and we have had the satisfaction of knowing that they experienced almost immediate relief from it. We knew it prescribed years ago for a case of severe colic. The effect was magical; and ever since the saltbag has held an honored place in our domestic pharmacy. A mixture of ice and salt, in proportion of one to one-half, applied to the head frequently gives instant relief from acute headache. It should be tied up in a small linen cloth, like a pad, and held as near as possible to the seat of the pain. A tea-spoonful of salt, dissolved in water, and taken every hour or two, beginning six or eight hours before a chill, will often prevent it, in intermittent, or what is known as chills and fever.' I once succeeded with this simple remedy in an obstinate case, where quinine, arsenic, and all the ordinary means had failed. Woman's Work. PRECAUTIONS AGAINST DISEASE. Never enter a sick room in a state of perspiration, as the minute you become cold your pores absorb. Do not approach contagious diseases with an empty stomach, nor sit between the sick person and the fire, as the draft from the chimney leads the contagious influences in that direction. Always let the current of air be from you to the couch of the sick, not from the couch to you. The air of the sick chamber should be kept so fresh that there will be no perceptible difference upon coming into it from the outer air. Catholic. TWO POPULAR DELUSIONS. Among the beliefs prevalent with the laity these two stand prominently forwardï¿½that fish is a brain food of great value, and an exceedingly good diet for invalids, and that ice is always pure, no matter how filthy the water from which it was formed. Nor is it at all certain but that the profession has held, at different times, these same^sadly erroneous beliefs ; indeed, it is feared that some even yet cling to the fish as an article of diet especially created for the sick room. The truth is that fish, as a brain food is worth no more, nor as much, as many other foods, and, as an article of diet for sick rooms, in the majority of cases, is absolutely injurious. Relapses have been caused frequently by fish when given after fevers and nervous complaints. Loss of weight followed a fish diet, and very promptly. It should be stricken from the diet card for the sick rooms. To convince the average man that ice is or can be filthy is a hard task. But it can be done, and the people should be taught that ice may be as unfit for use as water, and for the same reason, that freezing does not remove all impurities, nor kill disease germs. It is true that some of the frozen matter is eliminated in congelation, but not all. The fact should be proclaimed that ice from stagnant pools or water that contains refuse of any kind, is not fit for use, that it may breed disease and death. Health and Home.
