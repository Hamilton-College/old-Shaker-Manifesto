C. of Cabp Culture is an illustrated pamphlet of 100 pages from the pen of Milton B. Peirce. In (his he gives an interesting history of the peculiar industry among the Chinese, as related by the early French missionaries. He also writes of the care and expense which the ancient Romans gave to this very commendable form of procuring a supply of food for the table, and then writes of what has been done at a more modern date. ' The Carp is an Asiatic fresh water fish and has been cultivated in Austria more than six hundred years. ' The flesh is said to be white and of the finest flavor, A carp at three years of age will weigh from four to five pounds. The pamphlet tells the whole story of pond mak ing and fish raising, with every step carefully explained, so that any one can intelligently enter the business. Published by A. I. Root, Medina, Ohio Price 50 cents. We now learn that the Shakers in White Water* Ohio have commenced the raising of carp. They have seven ponds which as a whole occupy some ten acres. Already they are disposing of the little fish at $15.00 per 1000. We wish them the best of, success. ' We are raising carp fish but no swine. We think it more profitable and more honorable. Come over and we will give you a four pound fish for your dinner.' Isn't that nice ? We would have it like the dinner that was served on the shore ot the sea of Galilee. And to make it still better, there will be no swine there. The Shakers do not eat either the fat or flesh of swine. The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health. March. Contents. Pro.

The quaint poem, of the title page of which the above is a transcript, appeared nearly half a century earlier than Paradise Lost, and it is intrinsically probable that it would have fallen under the eye of Milton; in any case there are striking points of re semblance between the two poems, and many have supposed Milton's immortal work to have been inspired by the former. Only two copies of the work are known to be in existence previous to the issue of the present edition, one being in the British Museum, the other in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The copy in the British Museum was purchased at a noted sale of old books in 1819, by Baron Bolland, who notes upon a blank leaf that it cost him 2U. 17s. 6d., (about $110.00). Some years ago a gentleman of Virginia, Mr. J. L. Peyton, sprung from the old English family of that name, made an accurate transcript of the copy in the British museum, preserving even the quaint spelling, punctuation, capitalizing, and italicizing of the original. This present edition is printed without alteration. Apart from its presumed connection, with Paradise Lost, the poem has very considerable merit of its own, and is in every way a literary curiosity.
