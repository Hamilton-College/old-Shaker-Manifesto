In Memory of Sister JOANNA VINING Our loving Sister pure and free, Now dwells in realms of light; As true, as truth itself, was she, To principles of right. She bore the cross, now wears a crown; Her works have stood the test; Been weighed, and is not wanting found; Her peaceful soul is. blest. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. H. R. Agnew.
