THE HARVEST PERIOD The millennial age, or thousand years' reign of the saints, upon earth, with Christ, is the harvest age of the race, in which time, be it longer or shorter, the Everlasting Gospel will be preached to every creature, and all souls will enter the judgment— a new probation for their final order. It is the transition period of the race, from their natural life, to the spiritual. It is the disciplinary stage, for the final rest — the glorified state of all who receive the merciful offer of Christ, in his anointed messengers, and volunteer to follow his self-denying footsteps, to life everlasting. Its duration may vary from 7 to 70 or 100 years, according to diligence and faithfulness, after the work is begun. These messengers, or rulers — for they sit upon Thrones of Judgment, and reign with Christ — are beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and the word of God. This signifies, they have ceased to follow the lead of their own self-will and wisdom — the head of the earthly man — and have submitted their necks to the Gospel yoke, whereby Christ has become their head. They are slain to the worldly, or selfish life, by the cross of Christ, and by the sharp sword of the word of God, sitting upon purified human tabernacles, likened to white horses. Their carnal pleasures, likened to flesh, from whence they arise, are given to the fowls of the air and beasts of the desert, to whom they properly belong. Thus they are put to death, flesh-wise, and quickened spiritwise, and bear witness for the Truth, as Jesus* did, by dying as he died, to a self-pleasing life, and living as he lived, a life of Righteousness — daily rising from the dead, by walking in newness of life.
