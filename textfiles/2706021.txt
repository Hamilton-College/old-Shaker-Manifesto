Of all negatively disagreeable qualities, indifference is the most trying... [Contributed by Amelia, Tait.] 'Of all negatively disagi-eeable qualities, indifference is the most trying, for the victim of its cool disregard is not only hurt by it, but futhermore is made to realize his own nothingness in a way which not even true humility accepts ï¿½willingly. Our own trials and pleasures are so interesting to ourselves that we can not quite understand why they are of such small consequence to others, and then we make the fatal mistake of letting them obscure our perception of what we in our turn owe. There are, it is true, many selfish, selfindulgent natures to which the blessing of giving is quite unknown but which demand an inordinate share of attention. We all know them, and after a while we avoid paying the heavy taxes which intercourse with such people so heavily imposes. But it is not of them and their boundless egotism that we are speaking, but of our obligation to the dear every day and all day friends whom we love, but whom we sometimes forget to cherish. We must not be too busy to say a kind word of sympathy when little pleasures or little trials come, for if we can not help in any other way, our readiness to feel with them is welcome and appreciated.'
