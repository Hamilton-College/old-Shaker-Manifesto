SPIRITUAL EDEN Geo. Albert Lomas. ±31 James G-. Russell We are told of a blest spirit land, Where flowers eternally bloom, Whose 'evergreen shores' whose angelic band— Will greet us beyond the cold tomb. We arp told of its cities of light, Whose streets are all paved with gold, Whose inmates are clothed in purity bright, where none suffer hunger nor cold.
