WHAT FOODS ARE MOST ECONOMICAL! With an advance of 20 to 100 per cent., and more, in the price of staple foods, the above is now a most important question to over 40 millions of our people, and one of much interest to seven or eight millions more. Probably there are not two millions who take no thought or care as to the cost ;&gt;f their daily diet. Meats, flour, potatoes, cornmeal and rcilk are the main articles of sustenance for the great masses. Fish, rice, beans, and oat-meal (recently), with lesser amounts of some other articles, are consumed; but these altogether do not, we judge, constitute one-tenth of the food of the entire people, perhaps not more than five or six per cent. Dried or smoked beef, ham and cheese rank high, but dried fish outranks all others. The nuitritive value of dried codfish is remarkable, and it deserves special attention, 100 lbs. of it supplying as much nuitriment as 341 lbs. of beef! It is cheap and abundant everywhere, because very portable, and easily kept. It yields labor-sustaining aliment at from one-third down to one-ninth of the cost of beef in different sections of the country. It is easily digestible, and if properly freshened and cooked, it can be made palatable and acceptable to a very large class needing to practise economy.â€”American Agriculturist.
