BE YE PERFECT. ANNA ERVIN. There is nothing so much effects the minds of people generally, as to see religion embodied, and acted out by those who profess to be the people of God. The gospel then presents itself to their consciences in a living shape, and carries with it an influence that is irresistible. 'Be ye therefore perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect,' is one of the commands. And are there not elements in our natures out of which human perfectability may be formed? And although we are conscious of being very distant from that perfection, does it follow that this condition is unattainable ? Even though a life time may intervene, if we comprehend that by discipline and culture, by the Spirit of God, by the teaching and example of the Master, it is attainable, then we have all needed encouragement for effort. God is infinite fullness, and will he not inspire the soul with hope in the certainty of attainment? All we do is developed from the mind. Is it not then of vital importance that we allow nothing to gain the slightest hold of the mind which we would shrink from seeing carried out in the actual conduct of life ? Actions are the unerring tests of the tone and quality of the mind. Hence only such mental or spiritual states should be festered as will yield the fair fruits of noble human lives. Enfield, Conn.
