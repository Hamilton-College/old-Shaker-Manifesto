I WILL BE GOOD. Lucy S. Bowers. How much there is embodied in this simple sentence if the sentiment therein contained be conceived within an earnest and meaning heart voluntarily and iirmly adhered to. How much cf evil might be averted. Oh that the whole world might form and actuate this beautiful and sacred, yet simple resolve. But, what is it to be good? When the great ocean-waves lay quietly upon its bosom, and the ship sails along undisturbed, leaving in its wake a stream of rainbow-light, does it test the seaman's skill ? If he cowardly deserts the burning deck, or seeks to flee the wrecking craft regardless of the safety of his passengers and crew, is that true manliness ? does it indicate courage ? Does he who runs from battle, or seeks shelter within some secluded spot, manifest patriotism, or, with any thought of fortitude euJist in the cause? or when retired upon the camping-ground is real character exhibited ? We think not. When we dip the oars of circumstance into the shining waters of life, and the tide of condition runs smoothly, our real worth and capabilities are not tested ; but, if amid the turbulent storms of trial we ride safely aud direct our course wisely, we shall triumph in the pleasure and victory of noble action. To be truly and positively good, is to maintain the power of right doing in the face of all contrary and opposing influences ; to resist temptations wheu they are presented ; to bear with patience the vexations and crosses that appear in our way. It is easy and pleasant to sing of pain, sorrow, or triumph, when no cause for them exists ; occasion makes the man, not the want of it, without it he is not proved. Dr. Chapin said, 'Goodness consists not in the outward things we do, but the inward thing we are. To be is the great thing.' True, but the exterior will indicate the interior. Innocence and ignorance are sometimes miscalled* goodness. The child's mind wholly undeveloped, its character totally unformed, and education but slightly begun, argue no proof of its divinity ; it is simply a negative being, until the realities of its oncoming years stamp their impress and make it what it finally becomes. At one time Jesus said, 'Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of heaven.' These words appear to refer, first, to those of tender years, before their course was turned the downward way, and their lives ripened in sin, they might be led in righteous and heavenly ways, and their faculties trained for goodly purposes. The Chinese spoke with wisdom when he said, 'As the twig is bent the tree's inclined;'' and again, his words may have been to those of mature yet childlike, simple and teachable minds, who had conquered the vain ambitions of their inward beings, acknowledged the folly of pride and vanity, and brought into subordination the evil passions and propensities of their natural lives. Gold is not pure until refined, neither is the human mind until cleansed by the spirit of Christ. On the mount it was said, ï¿½' Blessed are the pure iu heart. Blessed are the peace-makers,' those who maintained harmony when combativeness was aroused ; and they shall see God who neither taste nor handle the unclean thing ; not the frail infant, the imbecile, ignorant nor negative, but the thoughtful comprehensive and responsible being, who knows God and evil apart; who maintains the standard of right as revealed to his or her inner consciousness. Let uone be too great or too proud to make known their good, wise and lofty intentions, and when failing in their actual and continual fulfillment, be not discouraged, but press for the goal of perfection. Laurels are not won without conflict, nor crowns without crosses, nor clean raiment without toil. It is an all glorious achievement to be really good. Tennyson accepts the truth in these words, ' Howe'er it be, it seems to me 'Tis only noble to be good ; Kind hearts are more than coronets, And simple faith than Norman blood.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
