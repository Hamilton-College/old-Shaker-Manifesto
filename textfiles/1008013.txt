Elder G. A. Lomas: Kind Friend... Arkansas, Rich Mountain Unitary Home, Rich Mountain, June 29, 1880 Rich Mountain Unitary Home, Rich Mountain, Ark., June 29, 1880 Editor Manifesto, Shakers, N. Y.. : Through the kindness of unknown friends we are in receipt of the Manifesto, from whose treasured pages I am beginning to learn that the underlying principles of this faith have been treasured plants in the garden of my heart since early boyhood. For notwithstanding the mental bias my early religious training subjected me to, my parents being Baptists of the old school, I could never reconcile my views of true inspirational teachings to such seeming inconsistencies of their faith as that which when carefully investigated, made God Father and Son of Himself, as, also His slayer, to redeem man from that depraved condition into which his Creator purposely plunged him, that he might enjoy the honor of man's redemption. It seems quite clear to my mind from the accounts given by Jesus of Himself, that He is represented under two distinct characters, first, His individual character, as a natural man (the Son of Man), and second, His official character as a physically sound man, who being free from the contaminating and corrupting influence of disease was morally sound in His spiritual character; 2 Cor. vii and 1. And hence a properly qualified representative of the Christ. From a slavish fear of thi3 Jesus, prejudicial to the interests of the Rabinical creeds, the people put the man Jesus to death. Nevertheless, as the mantle of Elijah descended upon Elisha, even so the Christ, the Holy Ghost. The righteousness of the children of light, even the Son of God, rested upon the true believers of the doctrines taught by this Jesus, or all, who, like him, take up their cross, crucify self, and thus follow Him in the resurrection to newness of life. But we see that creedists desiring to make a scape-goat of-Him, to bear the sins and suffer the penalties which con science in judgment daily imposes, desire to deify Him, that in His death, the stern sentence of violated law in them might be revoked. They are willing to be borne away to the realms of perfect bliss in some remote local region or the air, provided all necessary sacrifices for sins can be made outside of self. This is that class of ' believers,' many of whom seek shelter from the bleak winds and pelting storms of the world's wintry seasons, in Shaker families, receiving abundant sustenance from Shaker tables, but with the return of spring, turn again to the fleshpots of Egypt.' Your principles are new to most people here, yet your papers are read with interest by those to whom we lend them. We hope to see you expand in this direction until you reach us. W. A. J. Beauchamp
