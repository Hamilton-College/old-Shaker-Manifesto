NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. May 10, 1890, The hills and valleys of Lebanon are at this time, all clothed in beauty. The scenery of our mountain side viewed from the summit is grand. We have had a very favorable spring for getting in crops; just rain enough to keep everything in a fine growing condition. Some very warm weather which gave everything a good start, then some cooler to toughen and make it pleasant for the teams. Spring grains are looking splendid; and the garden vegetables are coming up finely. Nothing more essential to the comfort of a family, especially of the vegetarians, than a good garden and an abundance of fine fruit. With fresh vegetables, and all the small fruits in their season, with the substantial grains, prepared without extracting therefrom the bone and muscle forming material, give us a diet richer in nutriment and far more in accordance with angelic life, than is a diet composed of fish, flesh and fowl. I hope my young friends, who are laboring to develop the angel within them, will try it. But you must not forget the preparation of the whole grain. This is the secret of satisfaction on a vegetarian regime. Those who use exclusively bolted grains, must of necessity eat meat, or feel dissatisfied. I have learned one of the causes of the lack of enterprise in making public improvements, or private improvement when exposed to public view; it is this; the more improvement the greater the tax, the larger the tax the more exertion to raise the money to pay it. Is it not absurd that we should be fined for beautifying our premises, or the public highways? But this is a fact. A neighbor of ours, bought a few acres of bare land (of us,) some years ago, beside t^e public highway; the tax on it was some two or three dollars. The fence was rather poor and the land needed some draining. Phis man had worked hard and faithfully to buy the land and to build him a house. Recently he has put up a very nice house, drained the land and put up a good fence ; immediately his tax is raised many fold. I have heard that there are those who actually let their buildings run down, and the fences on the highway become dilapidated just on purpose to avoid the increasing tax. Until this system of taxation is changed for a better one, public enterprise will be decidedly lacking. I am happy to know, there is a mighty effort being made to effect a change, and that will give to every one the full reward of his labor. To-day we introduced one of our number to our friends in the spirit worldï¿½Sister Olive Walker. A peace-loving, scrupulously clean, and a very unselfish spirit. What a glorious institution is that which is called death. To those who wear out by honest consecrated labor devoted to righteousness, it is a glorious resurrection; but those who rust out in selfishness, will find a field of labor to pass through they were not expecting. Let the music roll. In kindest love, D. Offord. South. Family. May, 1890. Be. Henry Maktle is setting out some fruit trees and he tells us he is very anxious to look out for the next generation. This is the time to work and we are all very busy now. Our little family have planted eight acres of potatoes, just west of our dwellings and the wood-chucks are so plenty that the boys are setting traps to catch them. This morning ''Shades of Luben' told us something beside a wood-chuck was to be looked after. Is it wicked to kill? Eldress Anna has been weaving long mats, from pieces of old cloth, but old clothes come to an end and so did the weaving. Of course we are cleaning house and white-washing walls. We do not like to tack down carpets, but prefer large new rugs, as did the first Believers. S. A. C. Enfield, Conn. May 5, 1890. Lovely spring has again returned, and is bringing its beauties forth. The cherry and plum trees are in full bloom. The garden is also in a prosperous condition. As I sit by my window I can count fifteen rows of peas, twelve rows of onions, three rows of spinach, and one row of radishes from two to four inches high. Potatoes are coming up rapidly. It is a busy season for all who are able to work, both Brethren and Sisters. The renovating of buildings has progressed well so far. Without notice we found one of our cellars with three feet of water in it. An Edson pump was applied by three men fours hours, and pumped out fifteen thousand gallons of clear water. It was then found the well had received an accession, water flowing in at a rapid rate about two feet from the top. Whether this is a living spring or merely surface water is at present undetermined; if the former it might be utilized to raise our cream without ice, although we were fortunate in filling both ice-houses in March. Our busy Brethren find it a vexatious delay to stop in their great hurry to make a drain; it may eventually pay for all the trouble however. Man should subdue the forces of nature to make them serve him. Isn't that his destiny ? 'Happy the man who foils an envious elf And turns the darts of spleen to serve himself.' We are selling our cream to the Somers' Creamery; have had a twelve can Cooley creamery for the past year, the past month have added another of six cans to supply present needs. M. Witham. No time to lose now. Nature is springing to her work, and so must we. Day by day brings with it the round of duties that do so much to sweeten life. Let us plan to till less ground and do it better. Do no more than we can do well. Thrift comes from just that kind of work, so let us do our best. Weeds grow just where we don't want them. They live on the food of plants. If the land is rich, they draw hard on it with their rank growth. Plant food costs a great deal of time and money. We bny it at a high cost. We must not be robbed of it by plants that we do not want. Tares, whether in the field or in the heart, are the most easily subdued when they first spring up. Grass is the great crop with us. More grass will keep more stock, more stock will give us more plant food, more plant food will keep up the land and give us some crop to sell. Fowls should not be fed day after day en the same diet. To keep them in the best condition requires a change. They will eat nearly all kinds of food and there is no reason why their tastes should not be consulted, especially as they thrive best on a varied diet. D. Orcutt.
