Correspondence. Greetings to our precious little craft, its kind Pilot, and crew... Pleasant Hill, Ky. May 26, 1895. Greetings to our precious little craft, its kind Pilot, and crew. Recently through the kindness of Elder A. G. Hollister, I was the recipient of a number of valuable tracts, so clearly exemplifying the life teachings of Jesus, the Christ, that it is surprising that people seeking truth and salvation from sin, can not see it. Of coarse it means a daily sacrifice and constant prayer, yet thousands have lived it, and do now, I trust, and are numbered with the hundred, forty and four thousand virgins, who are redeemed from the earth. That virgin life ! so singular to the majority, even though it was lived by our Savior and who even declared that except we forsake the relations of the flesh, father, mother, wife and children, we can not become one of his disciples. Upon this principle the church of Christ is founded. It is the communion of our Lord, where all of our possessions belong to the Lord, in which we can have no selfish interest. In obedience to this system, our Church has prospered in all temporal and spiritual blessings. The Church was to be the home of those who were convicted of the sins of the world. It was free for the rich and poor; children were to be cared for in the admonition of the Lord. The selfish and ignorant wonder at the choice that the Believers have made. Their sense is wholly absorbed in the duties of a husband, a wife 154 THE MANIFESTO. and children. We have the record that Jesus was tempted in all points as were his brethren, and is it reasonable to suppose that his disciples will escape, the same trials? 'Be of good cheer,' said he. 'I have overcome the world.' And the overcoming of the world is to forsake the relations which form it. Your Sister in Christ. Nancy L. Rupe.
