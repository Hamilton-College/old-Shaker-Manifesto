CONSECRATION MARIA WITHAM. ' From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. ' Therefore from the heart proceeds that fervency of spirit by which we worship God in sincerity, and truth. A perfect consecration to his will is the distinguishing characteristic of the true followers of the Master, and is calculated to inspire the soul with heavenly and devotional feelings at all times. Those who have consecrated themselves in the morning of life to become stars of the first magnitude, have a present joy, the depth of which cannot be found by those who are worn down in the service of a worldly life. But Christ has said, ' I am the way, the truth, and the life,' and to the consecrated soul he is the light that is never darkened, and a fountain of wisdom to those who step out of self-life into the Christ-life and live consecrated to his blessed cause all through this earthly career. It has been said, and will always be true, that God's ways are above our ways and his thoughts above our thoughts. And the consecrated soul who has given his heart and treasure into the divine keeping thereby secures the divine favor, and seal of approbation. Enfield, Conn.
