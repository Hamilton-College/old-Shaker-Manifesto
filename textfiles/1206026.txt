It is quite probable that... Otis Sawyer It is quite probable that the following item may interest some of the rea.lers of the Manifesto. In looking over the Record of Deaths in this Society, I was surprised at the great age to which so many of our departed friends had attained. The demise of Richard Donovan on the third of November 1881, completed a list of two hundred, dating back to 1790. One hundred of them were over seventy years old when they died. Thirty, seven were from eighty to ninety, and thirteen were from ninety to ninety seven years old at the time of their death. The average age of the two hundred is 62 years, 9 months, 6 days and 2 hours. If there is any other Society of Believers, or a Community in the land that can present a death rate like that during its existence, I would be pleased to see it reported in the Manifesto.
