SOW WHAT WE WOULD REAP LARZ ERICKSON It appears to be one of the most difficult accomplishments for us to acknowledge our faults, just as they are. We seem ever determined to make our own side of the case appear better than we would look upon the same in our neighbors. If we would dear with other's faults as we would deal with our own, or have others deal with our own, it would result in a blessed experience. We know we do not like that others should speak evil of us, yet are we as careful not to do so by others ? If we have any reasonable anticipation of a residence with the redeemed, we had better learn to practice the habits of the redeemed here, and strive for the highest good and welfare of our fellows, by the most charity, forbearance and forgiveness of their faults. But we can never approach the condition of the redeemed, if we make the best of our own faults and the worst of those of our associates. If we do not like to be faulted, let us get thoroughly rid of a faultfinding spirit. If we sow words and deeds of kindness, we will rejoice in the time of our harvest. Let us think of this, and let us sow love and respect, ceasing to sow evil and entertaining malice, and just as surely we will reap the rewards of our sowing. Perhaps there are but few who would willingly reap what they carelessly sow, therefore, let us guardedly sow only the good and reap the heavens. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
