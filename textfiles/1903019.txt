WILL YE ALSO GO AWAY? Mary Johnston. In the gospel of St. John how vividly is the scene presented to our view, of our Savior pleading with his brethren in the synagogue at Capernaum to accept the way of life. He freely offers the Bread of Life, 'Not as their Fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead,' but says 'He that eateth of this bread shall live forever.' At this point we find great unbelief, and contention ; but He does not cease to proclaim that the infinite power of God can accomplish all things and shows what is needed is greater faith and a deeper baptism requisite for the soul's redemption. As these great truths, at this time, were by many, taken in a literal sense, they were indeed, 'hard sayings' and knowing their hearts of unbelief, lie said, 'No man can come unto me except it were given him by the Father.' At this time many were his professed followers, perhaps attracted by the loaves and fishes, as many are in this day. As the spirit quickeneth, consuming the dross, they cannot stand the refiner's furnace, and like the Israelites of old, seek to turn back to the flesh-pots of Egypt. But in all this backsliding He wielded the sword of truth even down to the twelve, for one of them proved false, and in auguish of soul asked, Will ye also go away? AH through the subsequent centuries this great question has stood out in bold relief equally as important as when asked at the first secession of the Primitive Church. The past has spoken for itself. The present and future lies within our power to prove which it shall be. Which? Are we as his followers to-day accepting or rejecting the eternal truths that are so conspicuously breaking upon the spiritual horizon, declaring that progression is the only means and hope of attaining true happiness. Some day sooner or later, all have to decide this weighty question, and may all hearts as quickly respond as Peter's, which the song poet so beautifully expressesï¿½ 'In quick response my heart replies, Lord, whither shall I turn ; Thou gavest to me eternal life Thy saving power I've known, 0, Thy saving power I've known.' Those who have fell and possess this saving Power, did not attain it merely in moments of emotional ecstasy, when the popular voice chimed its approval, and everything seemed attuned to the harmonious chords of the spiritualized feelings. Not so, but rather when iu the wilderness of trial and temptation, and through the thorny pathway of the realities of life ; by persistently bearing a daily eross against all the propensities of an evil nature. Each battle that is won in the conflict of right over wrong fills the soul with increasing joy and peace iu having obeyed superior convictions. In the elements of Nature, some of the most beclouded days are often followed by others in as great contrast ; so it is with Christian pilgrims, storms of sorrow may almost overwhelm the soul, but if it is rightly anchored in the cardinal virtues; Faith, Hope and Love, they shall surely behold the glorious dawn and cheering rays of Heaven's blessing. Sacred history teaches that success consists not in the many, but in the devoted few. Gideon's army gives a striking example of the unselfish and sincere, who had their trust placed in God. Thus the three hundred Gideonites were victorious over the one hundred and thirty-five thousand Midiauites. Does not the continuance of the present church depend upon the faithful efforts of each individual member in cultivating greater self-denial, and in all sincerity of heart striving to propagate the principles taught by our gospel parents, Christ and Mother. Thus giving an affirmative answer in thought, word and deed to our Savior's important question, Will ye also go away? All who are thoroughly iu earnest in advocating the great Cause, will know eveu as Peter did, wherein lies this saving Power ; that it is, 'Not by might, not by pcwer, but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts.'
