Sabbathday Lake, Me. Jan. 16, 1891. Cold weather is a constant visitor here. The Mercury has been 10 degrees below zero. We harvested 122 tons of ice in four and one fourth days. This supplies our family and also two of our neighbors who carry on dairy farms. The ice was eighteen inches thick. Our aged brother Thomas Noyes who has reached the age of 11 years, is now very sick with a severe cold, threatened with fever, and all are anxiously praying for his recovery. What could we do without our brother Thomas! He came into this Society about thirty years ago, and has always been faithful and consecrated. He is much loved by every one, for a more pleasant, genial person it would be hard to find. For years he has tended our grist mill, prepared and brought in the wood for the family dwelling and cooking departments, also built the first fires in the morning half of the time. Our venerable brother Samuel Kendrick says: he has not been so well since his trip to the Granite State but his cheerful appearance bespeaks the contrary. We are drinking the bitter cup with our Brethren and Sisters in other Societies, that our good Elder Giles has passed away. He has gone, like Jesus, to prepare a place for us. A. S. C.
