The above is the average temperature of the outward atmosphere, sent by our observing Brother for the Home Notes; yet lower still runs our spiritual thermometer, since the icy breath of the great destroyer has swept over our home and laid low in the mother earth our loved, our faithful shepherd, Elder Giles. God grant' 'Though the winds may not be tempered to the shorn lamb,' he may give the lamb extra courage to bear it. A. J. C. North. Family. Jan. 11, 1891. We have now got fairly started in the New Year. The Old, passed out in grief, the New came in with affliction and mourning. Still, we have very much to comfort us, and a great deal to be thankful for. It was my privilege to attend the funeral of Beloved Elder Giles, at Watervliet; what a contrast between the condition there one hundred and six years ago, and now. Then they had little room in their houses but an abundance in their hearts. They now lack neither in hearts nor houses : but something is wanting, not only at Watervliet, but throughout Zion. May the Lord who knoweth our needs, hasten the time when they can all be supplied. There is a great difference between the practices of a people and the vital principles that sustain the spiritual life in the body. Sometimes it would almost seem that the habits and practices of the early Believers were looked upon as vital principles on which the life and permanency of our gospel institution depended. There ought to be wisdom in our enlightened day, to discern between practice and principle; and whether our prac tices are in accord with, or in violation o: gospel principles. If we come to a knowledge tliat our practice violates principle's essential to our salvation, either spiritual or physical, we ought to possess enough of the power of self-denial to cease such practices, and not go blundering along, stumbling at the cross. The older Believers were all in the practice of shaving, and for many years no one could find a union to the body of Believers unless they conformed to this habit. Any one allowing his beard to grow, was as effectually shut out of union, as if he would not confess his sins. Shaving was looked upon practically as being essential to salvation: the wearing of the beard, as a violation of gospel principle. Shaving was the universal practice in all England and America a century ago, and I can remember that only forty years ago any one wearing his beard was accounted as crazy. All Believers conformed to this practice of the world: and in that particular, took no heed to Rom. xii., 2. Salvation and protection from the power of sin and self-indulgence that leads to sickness, disease and death, physically or spiritually, should be our constant aim. The human race to-day need physical salvation; they need bodily health and strength as a basis upon which to build the kingdom of heaven upon earth. Jesus in all his ministration recognized this, for he spent a large part of his time in healing the sick. Some very good people and professing Christians have thought and taught that the gospel had little or nothing to do with the life that now is, it was only to prepare people for the life that was to come. 'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, (in our bodies) as it is done in heaven:' in purified spirits. This is the great day of judgment and no soul in Zion should rest till he feels the judgment work going on in his soul. Search out the causes that produce evil effects and good effects. By the cross and self-denial put away the evil, and by strict obedience to faith, in the spirit of prayer, cultivate the good. We have had a fine spell of winter weather and have improved it. Now it is raining, and the sleighing is fast running away. A good time to look after tools and machines and have them ready for use when spring opens. Let us all be found faithful; be up and alive, prepared for each season as it rolls round. We shall then have more time to cultivate brotherly and sisterly love. D. Offord. Hancock, Mass. Dear Editor: In our locality we are realizing the benefits of a good old fashioned winter. The earth is slumbering under a heavy covering of snow, and the ponds and reservoirs wear a coat of ice some eighteen inches in thickness, of which our Brethren have secured a good supply for future needs. We think the Knickerbocker Co. will not be necessitated to come to Berkshire for ice this season. In contemplating the changing events of time, these poetical lines occur to mind. 'As time rolls on new things we see Which seldom with us do agree; Its now and then a pleasant day 'Tis long a coming, soon away.' We find, however, exceptions to this, for we enjoyed a very pleasant Christmas and in our morning service realized that fulness of blessing, which Christ is ready to impart to the sincere seeker after righteousness. The New Year came to us with a beaming face, but our hearts had been made sad by the unexpected announcement of the death of a loved Father in Israel, Elder Giles. Who can estimate his worth or fill his vacant place? We mourn with those who mourn, and mingle our tears with those who weep. On the 8th. inst. a company of us were privileged to accept a kind invitation that had been tendered us by our Mount Lebanon friends of the First Order, to make them a visit. The day was beautiful, but cold and the cordial welcome we received, the hospitality, kindness and attention shown us by all,' was duly appreciated, and will ever be gratefully remembered. J. L. S. Enfield, Conn. We should not be easily discouraged We would always be down in the valley of despair if we did not constantly exert ourselves to rise; it is only the faint-hearted who are kept down. Truly noble minds overcome all things, but it requires effort. Perseverance is essential to success. 'Joys and sorrows alike are sent To give the soul fit nourishment.' Let the winds blow cold and chill as they may, we can still cherish the warm sunshine of God's eternal love in our hearts, and bend willingly to the duties that lie in our pathway. We should be social and spiritual beings, and we must benefit others all we can, for we shall be sure to receive as much good as we give. Poultry is a subject which will never be exhausted by those who like the business, but how to make it pay is a question that everyone is not able to answer. Economy is one of the foundation stones on which to build success. There must be a close attention to details, a constant looking after the little things which seem at first almost too insignificant to notice, if one would be successful in poultry raising. A little neglect here and there, too much food to-day, and not enough to-morrow, count for a good deal in the long run, and always on the wrong side of the balance sheet. Warmth and cleanliness are as essential as food. Success in poultry means hard work and plenty of it, with a good deal of judgment. D. Orcutt. Harvard, Mass. Jan. 7, 1891. Dear Editor:�-Christmas has come and gone, and with it we have had some sorrow mixed with our joy. The sad intelligence of the death of our beloved Elder Giles, swept over us like a thick fog, almost paralyzing the body as well as the spirit. An acquaintance of thirty-two years, while residing in the same family at Mount Lebanon, taught us to love him as one of the dearest of gospel fathers. Our Christmas was made pleasant by a beautiful meeting, and many of our loved ones from beyond the river came to greet us with messages of love. Santa Claus did not forget to make us a short call, and the family were interested to see what he had brought. The story was told at about 2. P. M. when many were made glad. We are just finishing the cutting of 100, 000 ft. of lumber. Our stock of fine wood for 1891 is nearly all hauled, preparatory to sawing. This evening we had quite a surprise. After a gentle tap on the door, in walked our school teacher, Frances Dempsey, with a beautiful banner awarded the school for the besi attendance of any school in the town of Harvard. This has been the talk of the little ones ever since it was presented. On the 3rd. inst. a large company went from Harvard to attend the funeral of Br. Lorenzo Prouty, in Shirley. Our Sisters are busy making baskets and other articles for the summer trade; so you see, we are, like the busy bees, improving each shining hour. With hearts full of affection, we bid all our gospel friends, Many Happy New Years. A. B. Groveland, N. Y. Jan. 9, 1891. Eight days of the last decade of the nineteenth century have passed; the only century we have personal experience with, and we wonder just now what the last ten of the coming one hundred years will bring to life and prove to man. Vast truths will be unfolded in the spiritual, physical, scientific and political worlds truths unseen and unheard-of by earth'i inhabitants of yesterday. The wonderful to-morrows! how fathomless, without center or circumference. The yesterdays were mighty, the to-days still mightier, the to-morrows will be the mightiest of all. Sunday, the 4th. inst., 'Memorial Services' were observed by the Society in honor of our departed Minister, Elder Giles B. Avery, whose beautiful life was feelingly recalled through the hymns and speaking, all expressive and in harmony with the occasion. We have read with interest the leading article in the recent Manifesto 'Woman's Mission,' by Eldress Anna White, and we wish every reader on this broad planet would read and study it with eyes and ears open: also 'Reminiscences,' by the earnest Earnest Pick was perused with equal gusto; while we were reading the spirit side of said article we earnestly wished that the venerable prophet Elder Frederick W. Evans would catch an inspiration to take the first train bound for Western New York, locating his headquarters at Sonyea, Livingston Co., N. Y. We are fully persuaded that great benefits might be derived in this town and surrounding country by a few lectures from the inspired evangelist, orator and preacher. The ice harvest is great, and ice the very best, while the laborers are many and engaged the whole day through securing the frozen mass which measures nine inches thick. For the blessing of ice we are thankful, For all other blessings also; Each day is a day of thanksgiving As journeying onward we go. G. D. G. Union Village, Ohio. Dec. 1890. Deak Manifesto ;�We are now having a Southern Ohio winter. Christmas was a joyful pleasant time all day. We had a very good meeting and the singing was more than usually inspiring. Little gifts were changing hands and the sentiment in their presentation was, 'Peace on earth and good-will to men.' [See angel's song in the fields near Bethlehem; Luke ii., 8-14.] I read ten chapters in St. Luke on Christmas morning. In the evening we had a pleasant Christmas social. Eeadings, Recitations and Dialogues; the best singing I have heard for a good while. Recess. Candy, cakes, lemonade, popcorn, peanuts, etc., etc. Everybody pleased and satisfied. We had a good dinner on Christmas, but O this thing of slaughtering the poor turkeys to satisfy the appetites of the larger animal man. Bad business this. It will not always do for Shakers, eh? [Guess not. Ed.] However, we did not mean any harm if we did make graveyards of our stomachs. So 'Eise Peter, kill and eat and call not thou unclean, that which God hath cleansed.' [Peter did not have any turkeys. Ed.] Still after Peter's 1800 years experience I am sure he would preach a vegetable diet, both for health and purity's sake, if he was now on earth. We held Sister Malinda's funeral on the 26th at 2-30 P. M. Nine or ten persons spoke and all very feelingly. I never attended a more edifying or spiritual funeral. We have made nearly four miles of good fence this year and have thoroughly repaired our Laundry. Twelve hundred fruit trees which we set out this year are nearly all nourishing. Elder Joseph stands this climate a great deal better than the piercing winds of New England. School closes to tide over the Christmas holidays and to break up a monotony in the pupils. Begin again on Monday after New Year's day. Are putting up medicine again and this finds work for all ages. O. C. H. Sabbathday Lake, Me. Jan. 16, 1891. Cold weather is a constant visitor here. The Mercury has been 10 degrees below zero. We harvested 122 tons of ice in four and one fourth days. This supplies our family and also two of our neighbors who carry on dairy farms. The ice was eighteen inches thick. Our aged brother Thomas Noyes who has reached the age of 11 years, is now very sick with a severe cold, threatened with fever, and all are anxiously praying for his recovery. What could we do without our brother Thomas! He came into this Society about thirty years ago, and has always been faithful and consecrated. He is much loved by every one, for a more pleasant, genial person it would be hard to find. For years he has tended our grist mill, prepared and brought in the wood for the family dwelling and cooking departments, also built the first fires in the morning half of the time. Our venerable brother Samuel Kendrick says: he has not been so well since his trip to the Granite State but his cheerful appearance bespeaks the contrary. We are drinking the bitter cup with our Brethren and Sisters in other Societies, that our good Elder Giles has passed away. He has gone, like Jesus, to prepare a place for us. A. S. C.
