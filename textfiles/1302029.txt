The great desideratum for our paper... The great desideratum for our paper is to heighten and make solid, spicy and unanswerable its tone. It should contain the most searching, clear, sound ringing tones of any in the Universe. Let us strive for this-. We certainly have access to the most abundant fountain of noble truths from which to store a periodical, on moral, religious and highly spiritualized subjects. G. B. Avery.
