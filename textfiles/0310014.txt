Extract from Richard W. Pelham's letter of Jan. 10th, 1873. And now as it is appointed for all men once to die, and whereas I being about seventy six years of age, and weakened by disease, am approaching the end of my days on earth, I leave this my dying testimony. To wit, That the Revelation of the Gospel of Jesus of Nazareth and a second Revelation of the same Gospel through Ann of Manchester is the power of God unto salvation from sin; that having lived according to this revelation over fifty-five years it has saved me from sin — saved me from all criminal imperfection. It has given me power over all flesh, all lust, all hatred, all anger ; over all that is of the world ; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye and the pride of life ; over all murmuring and complaining, all unreconciliation of spirit, and my soul is filled with peace, filled with gratitude and love to God and to all humanity. Ho! every one that thirsteth come — come to the overflowing fountain of God's impartial Love! Amen.
