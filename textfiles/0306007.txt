Danby, Vt. March 8,1873 I like the independence and nobleness of the ' Shaker and Shakeress.' Of course, I do not Bee the exact application of some of your peculiar principles. I cannot appreciate every identical tenet of those with whom I come in contact; yet I feel that the spirit of kindness, manifest in the ' Shaker and Shakeress,' toward those who honestly differ with it, is a high recommendation of those who conduct it. And, as an exponent of Shakerism (I use the term in its noblest sense), I think it carries an influence upon its very face recommendatory of its high purpose and aim. Certainly, it is not so much what we believe as what we do, that commends us to the kind regards of the good in all communities. Belief is not a matter of choice, but of evidence. We must needs believe, when the evidence of a fact, or proposition reaches our comprehension. Consequently, belief, or disbelief, does not determine the moral character of a human being. With best wishes for your health and prosperity, I remain, with great respect, A. S. BAKER
