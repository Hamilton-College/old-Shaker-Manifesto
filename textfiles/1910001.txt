LIFE'S JOURNEY. Orren N. Haskins. What is life? A mystery sublime, A form and existence, a spirit divine ; Outreaching all knowledge that we can control, We're here for a purpose, a body and soul. Life's journey though transient is fraught with delight, Its visions all brilliant with beauty and light; With cheerful endeavor we enter the strife, And enjoy our existence in this sphere of life. Life's journey though dotted with pleasure and pain, Has much that invites us onward to gain; Inspired with the beauties of everything new, We're anxiously looking for something to do. As we enter the field of labor and toil, Whether mental or physically tilling the soil, All manual labor whatever it be, Has always been health and interest to me. Surrounded by guardians who're gentle and kind, To aid and direct through the journey of time; We shun many evils we meet on the way, If we are but careful their voice to obey. What comfort and peace as we journey along, Our souls reaching upward, our hearts growing strong; 0 beautiful home with the pure and the blest,� A heaven on earth a home of sweet rest. 0, who would exchange a life that is pure? Or who would not crosses and trials endure? Than dwell in the homes of gloom and distress,� [blest. O give me the home with the pure and the O lovely companions, ye heaven-born few, I'm thankful I've spent my life here with you ; Come ease or come pleasure, come sorrow or pain, My heart's entwined with you to ever remain. The pathway of life is quite rugged we know, And sometimes grows rougher as onward we go; But keep the eye single for truth and for right, We'll press through the darkness and land in the light. Though many may miss and get on the wrong track, The soul that's in earnest will never look back, But onward keep moving as true as the clock Till firmly established as truth and the rock. And when life's journey is finished and gone, And we are at peace with ourselves and each one; We'll count o'er the blessings of life and its joy, When there's nothing of earth our peace to annoy. And then if the angel of truth can record, Well done, come and enter the joy of thy Lord; The battle well fought and the victory is won, Come in faithful servant, thy work is well done. Then what of the struggles and toils of this life, They vanish in haste like the dews of the night; All earthly afflictions disappear as a scroll, And leave just the spiritual body and soul. Away on the wings of victorious love, To rest in tne mansions of Heaven above; Leave a life here ob earth for a life there in God, With Father and Mother the Christ and our Lord. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
