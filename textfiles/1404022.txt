SCIENCE AND SPIRIT. PLETUS FIELD. Science scans all that is seen below From fragrant flowers to stars that glow; From the sparkling rill on the mountain's side, To the ocean deep, with its swelling tide. From the ether blue to the sun that shines. Brave science says that all are mine; I trace the veins of the rolling planet, And read her age in the solid granite; I explore the paths to her wondrous depths, And expose her fossils that for ages slept. I analyze earth, sea and air, An.l .solve deep mysteries everywhere; I unfold creation's wondrous plan, And read her secret laws to man ; I take my stand on the hill of fame, And fearless sound my wondrous name. I, says the Spirit, hail from above, I bring to mortals light and love; [ melt the heart so hard by sin, I let celestial life come in; I reach the conscience, wake the soul, I make the wounded spirit whole; I lead the soul to the Christ divine, I make that soul the sun outshine, I whisper to the inner man; I show to him redemption's plan, I set an Order here below, And all who will to that may go ; Confess their sins and be forgiven, And find the virgin path to heaven; Oh science with all your pride and strife, You ne'er can tell the source of life; You may stand and boast on the hill of fame. But on souls redeemed I will write my name. South Union, Ky.
