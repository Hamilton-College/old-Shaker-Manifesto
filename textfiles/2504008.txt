BEST GIFTS. ilThey that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever.'Dan. xii., 3. Canterbury, N. H. 1892. Fairer than rubies and richer than gold, Are the gems of Christ's kingdom I see, Wisdom for service, and pow'r to uphold Are gifts most attractive to me. Clothe and bedeck me with beauty and grace To win precious souls to God's way; To lead in the light of his glorious face, His will all my life shall bear sway.
