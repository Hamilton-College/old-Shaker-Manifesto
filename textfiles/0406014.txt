The earth is thine, O Lord! and all that is contained therein... The earth is thine, O Lord! and all that is contained therein; notwithstanding thou hast given the possession thereof to the children of men. We heartily pray thee to send thy Holy Spirit into the hearts of them that possess the grounds, pastures, and dwelling-places of the earth, that they, remembering themselves to be thy tenants, may not rack and stretch out the rents of their houses and lands; nor yet take unreasonable fines and incomes, after the manner of covetous worldlings; but so let them out to others that the inhabitants thereof may be able to both pay the rents, and also honestly to live, to nourish their families, and to relieve the poor. Give them also grace to consider that they are but strangers and pilgrims in this world, having here no dwelling-place, but seeking one to come, that they, remembering the short continuance of their life, may be content with that which is sufficient, and not join house to house, nor couple land to land, to the detriment of others ; but so behave themselves in letting out their tenements, lands, and pastures, that, after this life, they may be received into everlasting dwelling-places: through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.' Liturgy of Edward VI
