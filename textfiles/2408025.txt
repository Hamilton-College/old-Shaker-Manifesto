HEALTH. By Lucy S. Bowers. A peakly brow that tells of holy thought; A ruiy cheek, and eye with sparkling light; Strong, well knit nnns thitt love to do the right; A heart that times life's motion as it ought, And crimson blood from healthful substance wrought. Free lungs that heave with pure air day anil night, These make of mortal life a sweet delight. Health, priceless health, a boon from heaven brought. In sacred writ, we learn that God made man In his unblemished image, strong and whole But sin, usurping power, has marred the plan, Destroying many a beauty of tlifj soul. But God has yet dominion, and we can Through righteousness, regain the perfect goal. Mt. Lebanon., N. Y.
