In Memory of Sister CATHERINE VAN HOUTEN. By H. R. Agnew. Again we've assembled in presence Divine As befitting the theme of to-day; One more of our circle is taken from time, Nor would we the summons delay. Affliction severe has sorely oppressed, Tho' attendants endeavored to soothe; At length death has quietly caused its arrest, And time's troubled waters made smoothe. Our Sister's long suffering has made her more dear Our sympathy deep to the last; Love and kindness bestowed by friends ever near While the vale of the shadows she passed. In the high path of virtue, her own daily choice, The pearl of great price she has won; And we've no cause to mourn but with her we rejoice That peaceful transition has come. With those whom she suffered and toiled here in time She has met, to be parted no more; The turmoils of earth are all left behind And she rests on that beautiful shore. With her it is well, Heavenly Father, we pray, Aid us in thy way to press on; Open fountains of life, give us bread for the day; [the strong. Send strength to the weak and comfort Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
