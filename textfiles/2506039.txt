JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA. By Will Carlton. 'And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.'Matt. He stood beside the gate to know His triumph or his doom: 'What didst thouforme, there below?' 'I gave The Prince a tomb: I found Him 'neath the foeman's tread; And soon, from strife apart, I pillowed soft His bleeding head, And staunched His wounded heart. From hills of pain, His form I bore To chambers cool and deep; With whitest robes I clad Him o'er, And left Him there asleep. Although, when morns had numbered My Guest had gone away, [three, Yet still, I come to beg that He Will shelter me for aye.' 'Behold, good Heart, in joyful bloom, The seeds so humbly sown: Thou lendest to The Prince a tomb He gives to thee a throne!' Every Where.
