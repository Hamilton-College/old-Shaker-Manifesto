Narcoossee, Fla. Feb. 1898. The incoming year has dawned upon Florida with brighter hopes than was at first expected. Not only has Florida overcome the recent disaster of the freeze but at this early date almost everything denoting a visitation from Jack Frost has been removed and the farm and garden have again been planted. The crops are looking well. The orange groves which have been the main dependence of income, was not so badly injured as at first reported. In some sections of the town of Narcoossee the groves received no perceptible damage, while others show it in a small degree. One writer says we can balance our accounts this way,'From five to seventyfive per cent of the foliage is hurt.' This shows that the frost came in waves. It struck some locations heavier than others. THE MANIFESTO. 45 If the farmer and gardener can not pile up money as fast as he can at the north, he is able to make for himself a good comfortable home. The greatest of all gains made by the people of this state is seen in their temper and in thought. Experience has brought to them the full conviction that they can live for themselves. There will be no such time of general depression as we have experienced Our self-confidence has been restored and without arrogance we stand on our own feet. We have had at our home for the past three weeks our Br. Francis Pennebaker of Pleasant Hill, Ky. His general health has not been so good as he would wish and he comes to obtain more health. So you see, Florida has some advantages. We hail the New Year! We need only play our part. Florida will do the rest. Please say that the Mercury in time of the freeze indicated seven degrees below freezing. Andrew Barrett.
