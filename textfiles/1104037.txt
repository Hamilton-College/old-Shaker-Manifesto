THE REVISED NEW TESTAMENT Shall we have a Cheap Official Edition? —• The Help of our Readers asked to secure it. It is believed that the English Oxford Press (the official publishers) would be willing to issue a cheap popular edition of the THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. New Testament, provided they can be convinced that the demand for such an edition in this country is great enough to warrant it. To test the extent of this demand our readers are requested to send at once to I. K. Funk &amp; Co., 10 and 12 Dey street, New York, their names, stating how many copies they are willing to take for themselves and friends, provided the price per copy be not more than 25 cents, postage free. These would be the official copies, printed in Oxford, England, from the original plates, and would be delivered in America simultaneously with the high-priced edition.
