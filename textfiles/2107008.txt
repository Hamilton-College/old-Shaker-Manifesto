Thomas J. Stroud, My Dear Friend:--Some months have passed... Birkdale, Southport, England. May, 1891. My Dear Friend :�Some months have passed since I received your letter announcing the death of Elder Aitken, which was a shock to me, but no calamity to him who had lived on the narrow isthmus between the visible spiritual, and the invisible. It was a mere step from the one to the other, a step I am glad to know he took without pain. You were also kind enough to send me the life of Ann Lee and other literature, historical and explanatory of the Shaker system. For these, I thank you very much, and they must in some degree be my apology for not writing to you sooner. To read them with the care they demand, and think over the incidents in Ann Lee's life and work needs much time, concentration of mind and development of spiritual insight. My life is so occupied that I have needed much space to adequately study the Shaker principles and the order of their solution in the world. Before they can be remotely understood, as it seems to me, one needs to have made some progress in spiritual growth and to have realized that the Christianity of the creeds is merely a crude method of discerning the facts of that transcendent philosophy of the spiritual nature of man and the universe. The churches mistake the husk for the fruit, the shadow for the substance. Faith must be progressive, as the Spirit is ever learning; the churches are solidified into dead dogmas, into stupefying ceremonials, and into rigid doctrines. The materialistic bent of the age is due entirely to this, for the churches have stifled the Spirit, and become wholly corporeal, external and mundane. It was an immense effort for a woman to protest against this tendency in the eighteenth century, and in the midst of our Lancashire laboring population. This I can understand better than some people, for I live not far from Manchester, and am a native of Lancashire and familiar with the ideas of its inhabitants. To-day there are the types of the gross and unspiritual beings who persecuted and mocked Ann Lee so long ago. I am sure she was led of the Spirit to the New World'. Here she would have made no permanent Society. True it is yet, of us, ithat a prophet has no honor in his own country. It was necessary for the Shakers to establish themselves in a region where new spiritualism could take root and grow. That has happened, and I believe the future will see a great development of the Community. You have so many advantages that the world lacks, that your progress appears to be inevitable. You have the calm which controls all things, material, mental and spiritual; the world lives in a state of terrific agitation, and consumes itself for want of repose. You are honest in your dealings; the world is a conspiracy of the fraudulent, and business is mere brigandage. You live healthy lives, producing the necessaries and natural embellishments of the human lot; the world is insane in the research for the superfluous, the meretricious and the artificial. You thrive; the world grows poor in the midst of its illusory riches. Clearly the advantages are all on the side of the Shakers from a mere earthly point of view. But you have other advantages the world know not of, namely the intense conviction of the truth of man's spiritual nature ; that is life, wherever we may be, here in the visible world or beyond,�its absence is death, indeed. I have only been able to read the books you sent me at intervals; They have interested me very much and I shall continue to study them ; for I am convinced that stupendous changes are at work that will revolutionize the lot of mankind here on earth, and in that supreme change, the teachings of Ann Lee and those who continue her teachings will have a great part. It does seem extraordinary that the regeneration of the race shall begin by stopping generation after the physical order, and to the bulk of men and women it is incredible now, but the light of the spirit appears to indicate that such must be. I have had peculiar experiences with regard to the operation of the spirit, and this enables me to study your system with a clearness and a sympathy that few can feel. I am convinced, too, that woman has yet to play a supreme part in directing the spiritual path of man. She has gifts which men know not. As a friend of your cause, will you favor me with further information? Believe me sincerely your friend, and pardon my tardy reply. William Garret Flynt.
