Narcoossee, Fla. Sept. 1897. During this month we have been so blest with showers that they have modified the heat, and even those not working under shelter ha ye been measurably comfortable. The pine-apple harvest is finisht and we are resetting more slips and shoots for the harvest of another year. We have secured five tons of good hay, which is needed for the horses and oxen. The sweet potatoes that were planted the 3rd of June, are now ripe for use. The cost of raising these, is about the same as would be the white potatoes at the North. Tomatoes furnish the best crop during the winter, and we are now preparing the land for the coming winter. Every month brings a little change for the better in our new home, and at the close of five years, the time given to us to make a home, we shall look upon the work of our hands and be satisfied. Our stationary number still holds to the mystic seven. Our beloved Sister Elizabeth Sears entered our home just five months ago. She is one of God's noble women, and our doors are open to as many as may wish to come, who can make the same sacrifice, by living the same life. In our new home we find it is a constant toil, filled with the spirit of perseverance. Decision and energy may be good in undertaking a great work, but in most cases, quiet perseverance must step in to complete the work. Our good Sister Nancy is trying to take a new lease of life by holding to the higher thoughtï¿½there is no disease. Andrew Barrett.
