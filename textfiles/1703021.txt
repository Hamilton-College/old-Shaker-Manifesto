ON THE WAY. The object of my life is to attain the highest degree of perfection, to cultivate the deep emotions of my soul and mind, so as to feel that my duties to humanity and to God are above my own selfishness and pleasure. This is my precious ideal. The surest, shortest way I have found at last to realize it, is to be true to the precepts of the gospel, to be true and obedient to the substance of itsteachings. I have read many chapters of the Gospel very diligently, over and over again, and as much as I understand it I will be true to it. This will be my guide throughout my earthly life, because my life is concentrated on the principles of the gospel. To be true to the gospel, means to follow the footsteps of Jesus Christ, to live as pure as he lived, to be ready to suffer and die in the body for the sake of truth and universal happiness. To crucify in our own hearts, the lower elements of the world with all its bad habits, its narrow egotism, ambition, affections and lusts. After the lower propensities are trodden down under the feet, the pure, unstained heart can be filled with righteousness. There can be sown in it seed that will bring, forth fruit worthy to live and to struggle for. Again, I sustain that only through simplicity and strict obedience to the gospel; the gospel that embraces the highest moral principle of life.
