Hail the new year Florina Harding O king ye bells! ye merry bells, Thy harmony we love full well; We know the joy thy music tells, And welcomes in the glad New Year. O ring ye bells of love and cheer, Let roll thy echoes far and near; O welcome, welcome, welcome here The grand, the bright and glad New Year. O chime ye bells, O chime again,— Until we learn thy joyous strain; Let peace on earth, and union reign Throughout the happy, coming year. We'll strive the seed of good to sow,— The way of life, the erring show; Thus friendship's links will stronger grow, Throughout the glad and bright New Year. The errors that have dimmed the past, We'll from our vision ever cast, And with a courage that Will last, We'll toil throughout the coming year. ^Redemption's hill though steep to climb, We'll strive to reach while here in time; And step by step those heights sublime, We'll gain some bright, some happy year. As tender buds in spring expand, Well nurtured by a Father's hand; So will our souls in grace expand, And grow throughout the happy year. Then ring ye merry, merry bells, Thy harmony we love full well; Still louder let thy music swell, And welcome in the bright, New Year. West Pittsfield, Mass.
