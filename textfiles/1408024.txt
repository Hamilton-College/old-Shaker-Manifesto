BETTER LATE THAN NEVER. Life is a race, where some succeed, While others are beginning; 'Tis pluck at times, at others speed, That gives an early winning; But if you chance to fall behind, Ne'er slacken your endeavor, Bear this wholesome truth in mind. Success is better late than never. If you can keep ahead, 'tis well, But never trip your neighbor; 'Tis noble when you can excel By honest patient labor : But if you are out-stripped at last, Press on as bold as ever; Remember though you are surpassed, 'Tis better late than never. Ne'er labor for an idle boast, Of victory o'er another, And while you strive your uttermost, Deal fairly with your brother. Whate'er your station, do your best, And hold your purpose ever ; Arid if you fail to keep abreast. 'Tis better late than never. Choose well the path in which you run, Succeed by noble bearing, Then though the last, when once 'us ..won, Your crown is worth the wearing. Then never fret, if left behind, Nor slacken your endeavor, But always keep this truth in mind, 'Tis better late than never. ï¿½Anonymous.
