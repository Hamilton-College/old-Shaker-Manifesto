Sonyea, N. Y. Oct. 9, 1891. This, the most brilliant of autumn mornings since summer flew away, calls our attention to signing October notes, one of our favorite duties of the day. Never within our remembrance have we noted such an extreme scorcher; as the fall days advanced, the mercury ascended till the nineties were reached in the shade; one shower during thirty days freshened the parched atmosphere for a few hours, but 'Burning Sun' soon swallowed the rain drops and left the dry old world to return to the dust of the earth from whence it came. Our farmer champion Paul K. Kingston can display the largest and longest ear on record. It measures eleven inches in length and eight in circumference, this mammoth ear is an ear of western corn raised for ensilage, the present yield amounts to thirty tons to the acre, the stalks are from fifteen to sixteen feet high forming quite a verdant grove. A new ensilage machine for cutting the corn was recently obtained and is to-day in full operation, performing the work successfully. The potato harvest was finished Saturday the third inst., two hundred and nineteen bushels were grown on two thirds of an acre, the entire crop is free from every sign of decay, the dry season has proved favorable for the preservation of the Irish vegetable, valued by 'all kindreds, all colors, all nations and people.' Monday the twenty-first ult. the family commenced cutting and drying sweet corn, the harvest continued till Saturday, P. M. the twenty-sixth, when the laborers completed the drying and they viewed their work and found it good and they rested on the twenty-seventh day. The past week has been devoted to gathering winter apples, and fall ones and all that have fallen, the gathering has shown a greater supply of the unlooked for article than the inhabitants a mouth previous dared hope for. Apple drying is now the chief occupation. While the apple bee hums and hums away, providing good food for the long winter's day. G. D. G.
