Kind Sister Edith:--Your letter of the 25th. ult. came... Enfield, N. H-, Jan. 1,1890. Kind Sister Edith :ï¿½Your letter of the 25th. ult. came safely to hand in due time, for which I sincerely thank you. I perceive by the tenor of your communication that you have enlisted in the gospel of Christ's second manifestation, which is a gospel of peace, love, and purity. I heartily congratulate you on starting in the noblest and most glorious work that was ever revealed to mortals. 'By the way,' you speak of loyal souls in the gospel work; they will surely win the victory. The foundation principles of the new creation, are not in harmony with the principles of the old creation. Therefore those who come out from the old, into the new, do forsake the principles of the old, which are inherited, by every individual. The kingdom of Christ is free from all unrighteousness, and those who dwell therein, forsake the principles of evil in every form. As the Order was established in the days of the Apostles, a Community of interest was one of the foundation pillars on which the church of Christ was to stand, and here was where the work of self-denial came in, no one saying that aught of the things he possessed were his own. There are few persons, so careless or indifferent, as not occasionally to look forward to the time, when they shall become religious ; although they neglect God, and disregard the duties of religion at present, they hope to serve and obey God before they die. They consider not, that by a continuance of evil practices they render it almost impossible to attain to any love of virtue ; that by forming habits inconsistent with purity in the early period of their lives, they expose themselves to the almost certain hazard, of never acquiring one pious sentiment, however protracted their existence in this present world. We are creatures of habit, if we wish to be found in old age, walking in the paths of wisdom and vir-, tue, we must yield ourselves to the counsels of religion in the days of our youth. Those whose declining years are dignified by virtue and purity, are for the greater part, those who sought wisdom early and found her. If we cannot resolve to be good 7ioiv, how can we hope for the resolution hereafter? If passion exerts so strong an influence at present how can we expect that long indulgence will lessen its power? If we neglect to form habits of virtue when everything invites and assists us, in this important work, how can we trust to that period when, to the labor and difficulty of acquiring new principles, will be added that of undoing all that the former years of our lives have effected. With these few lines I tender you my gospel love and well wishes. John Bradford.
