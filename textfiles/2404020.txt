KINDLY REMEMBERED. Henry Mantle, Born 1809. By Sarah Collins. We have met to-day with hearts bowed down; not with weight of woe, nor with anxious feelings in regard to our good Father Henry. With him it is well. Prayerful, thoughtful, reverential feelings are ours. When congenial friends leave us, it is hard to sever the tie that must be broken, as we lay these forms away. But 'Every hour that passes slowly, Has its task to do and bear, Luminous the crown and holy, When each gem is set with care.' The spirit of the Lord rested upon our brother; he was in truth, godly. The life of Christ exemplified itself in him. Tlie early Believers bestowed on him a mantle that could never fade. His continuance in well-doing brought to him glory, honor, and immoi'tality. Our brother's name was given to his ancestors in the old world, as they were an order of officers of William the Conqueror. These officers wore mantles. In the old and new world these mantles of fidelity have been faithfully worn though viewed in different aspects. It is well with our brother as his last days were joyful, his hope of the future grand. We have met to adore him for his good 98 THE MANIFESTO. works and to commemorate his virtues. To bless his beautiful spirit, to reverence and extol his name; also the blessed temple though it must return to dust. A wise, peaceful spirit dwelt within this house of clay, a cultured mind adorned it. Through his long life of eighty-four years he was governed, guided and led by the Christ spirit. All through his early life he was associated with the noble ones of earth who have long since passed away. The glory of heaven was revealed to him even in childhood. We must remember the thoughtful, studious youth he once was, the religious man and the wise veteran who rejoiced in a 'green old age.' We have lost a prize, have lost a scholar, but let us hold fast to his good examples. Let them ever be before us. Be humble, meek, mild and forgiving as he was; love true religion, repel infidelity; carefully watch and fervently pray. He was loved at home and to him there was no place like home. His ideas were liberal, his principles good, but with care he kept out the party spirit that would tend to confusion; ever holding fast to his early teaching. He was a wise and prudent leader, and his career has been a successful one; in some respects unparalleled. 'Greater are those who govern themselves than those who rule nations.' If we can compete with his good example in this we shall not be found wanting. What we thoroughly learn we shall surely remember. It is well with Father Henry; his life was well spent, his pilgrimage on earth prolonged. The time came for him to go; being aware of this he said,ï¿½'I don't think I shall ever feel well again now, I want to go right along, just step over.' His prayer was answered, his mission fulfilled. The few days of confinement that were his were quiet and subdued; no struggle, no excitement; peace reigned, a beautiful sleep followed. 'Homeward serenely he soared with God's benediction upon him.' Reluctantly we lay him away and with a sad satisfaction bid him adieu. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
