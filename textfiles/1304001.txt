SUPPLICATION. BY MOTHER, HANNAH GOODRICH. [The following hymn was contributed to the Manifesto, by Eldress Anna Ervin, of Enfield, Ct. who has preserv ed it for many years, in loving remembrance of the author.] O Lord of everlasting light, Thy mercy I implore, Protect my spirit in its flight, When time shall be no more. Support me while I drink the cup, With patience clothe my mind; To meekly fill the measure up, Our Parents left behind. In Thee my confidence I trust, In Thee my hope I place, And though a feeble worm of dust, I feel thy power and grace. And while I suffer here on earth, I feel an inward joy, That I can walk the narrow path, Which will all sin destroy. Let murm'rings and all complaints, Escape me never more, But meekly with thy precious saints, This valley I'll explore. Give :ne the patience of a lamb, The meekness of a dove, In resignation meek and calm, I feel our Mother's love. In thisfpoor tenement of clay, The love of God has dwelt, The purest light of gospel day, This feeble heart has felt. I've seen the glory and increase, The gospel spread abroad, The church arise in power and grace, The glorious work of God. I've seen the glory of the lamb, In female form arrayed, Crowned with a royal diadem, By Christ in wisdom led. Who on the Mount of Zion stands, Redeemed from nature's fall, Ordained to keep the sheep and lambs, That God by faith shall call. The gospel path of purity, The Father now has shown, The righteous Prophets could not see, To angels 'twas unknown. What glorious things I have beheld, Beneath the gospel sun, Now let my soul with thanks abound, When time shall cease to run. With Simeon I now can say, Let me depart in peace, Because mine eyes have seen this day, Redemption's work increase. Thy blessed sin-destroying power Through every nerve has run, Now let me in this trying hour, Say, 'Lord, thy will be done.' Canterbury, N. H.
