Temperance. THE COST OF SALOONS. Not less than 80,000 go annually to a drunkard's grave from the homes of this land. The waste of life wrought every five years by our 200,000 saloons, is equal to the destruction of life by both armies, during the entire war of the rebellion. 500,000 drunkard-makers are able to accomplish more than four time their number could with shot and shell. To realize the relentless cruelty of the liquor power go to the dishonored homes, read the haggard faces, hear helpless children crying for food, see them stricken down by infuriated fathers. Witness the ruin of youth, and their utter degradation. Alas, how true and terrible is this indictment of the saloon, which transmits to our children a heritage of distilleries and breweries and chains to society, paupers, criminals, idiots and insane. More than 30,000 children in Chicago are addicted to the use of strong drink. Clinton B. Fish, in the Pioneer.
