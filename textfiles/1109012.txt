EDITORIAL NOTES 'WANTED.' From the many communications reaching this office, and the headquarters of this Bishopric, the suspension of our little messenger — The Manifesto — is looked upon unfavorably. It is not yet, however, decided either to suspend or not to do so. In retiring from the editorial chair, we would previously make the proclamation of ' wanted :' an Editor for The Manifesto ; one surrounded by such spiritual influences as to make the task an easier one; one devoted to the upholding of the fundamental principles, read by every one, as discriminating the original Pentecostal Church from its worldly and unfriendly surroundings, and these principles, Celibacy, after the Christ pattern; Brotherly Love and a United Inheritance after the same example ; Non-resistance, in households and in nations according* to the same rule; and an eternal CD J advocate of Christ's resistance, within Himself, against worldly ambitions, political honors and emoluments, and to grow in unspottedness from ALL THAT IS WOKLDLY AND UNCHRISTIAN ; one who will serve without pay; bear meekly all criticisms, worthy or unworthy, merited or not, with that perfect Christian suavity that turns the other cheek oftentimes, without murmuring. But little ability and less learning according to the letter are required ; but any enthusiastic man or woman, he or she living according to the above stated principles of the Shaker Church, and desiring martyrdom in the cause, will be gladly heard from at this office. ^V
