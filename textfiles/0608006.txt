ESTABLISHMENT OF HARMONY THOMAS PAINE The height of development is harmonyâ€” a diffusion of ideas, without being met by the spirit of opposition, saying, you can go no farther, for the spirit that stirs up thought is accounted the devil's platform of labor. When harmony is established, a just judgment of all the elements that afflict and bless man is arrived at; evil takes the negative platform, and goodness is the predominating result of a term of schooling, in all the branches of godly forethought and purpose, to make man a self-reliant and responsible agent, sent out, after repeated changes, to do the work of world redeeming, becoming like unto Gods, knowing the exact path of duty, and the full and complete law of love. ' One by one fall ancient errors, Reared by might and propped by wrong, And earth wonders, when they perish, That they stood the test so long.'
