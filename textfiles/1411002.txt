MY MISSION. ASENATH C. STICKNEY. 0 what is the mission appointed to me As the days come and go, and the swift moments flee ? It is, Live to do good wheresoe'er is your call, And give to the household your services all. Ah, this is the 'mission appointed to me, As the days come and go, and the swift moments flee. Go strengthen the feeble, encourage the strong ; Be thou as a light, a joy, a new song ; Seek only the wisdom which comes from above ; First holy, then peaceful, abounding in love. Ah, this is the mission appointed to me, As the days come and go, and the swift moments flee. And do not your alms to be honored of men, Was the Savior's injunction so simple and plain ; But give to the needy, thus lend t� the Lord ; For these ye have always, and ye have your reward. Ah, this is the mission appointed to me, As the days come and, go, and the winged moments flee. Like the diligent coral beneath the deep sea, Toil thou for the future ; though hidden may be The structure you build, by devotion and care,� If founded in virtue its worth will appear. Ah, this is the mission appointed to me, As the days come and go, and the winged moments flee. Canterbury, N. H.
