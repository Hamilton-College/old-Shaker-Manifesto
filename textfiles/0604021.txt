LIFE'S SEASONS AMELIA CALVER On noiseless wings, time glides along No hand can stay its rapid flight; Life's brilliant spring will soon have flown, While toiling summer's just in sight, And ere we garner autumn's store The wintry winds around us roar. Carefully then, the good seed plant; And wisely prune the growing vine, Likewise in storing, prudent be; And ripened age we'll peaceful find. Each stage of life, if wisely spent, Rears for the next, a monument.
