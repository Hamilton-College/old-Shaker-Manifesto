SUN-RISE. EDITH D. CASWELL It was my good fortune not long since, to witness a most glorious sun-rise; and although this is by no means a rare opportunity for early risers, yet, my attention was unusually held to the phenomenon. As I observed its slow but sure ascent above the horizon I thought thus : 'This glorious sun but symbolizes the testimony of truth which I, with many other companions, have been early blest to understand. A testimony which in spiritual power and brightness, by far exceeds yon rising sun, whose beams will one day illumine the darkest portions of the moral and religious world. A testimony which has power to justify the good, or condemn the bad. 0 that I may be as steady in my upward progress, as fixed in holy purpose, as the sun appears, to me, in its courseâ€”that I may fully perform the mission to which I have been called is my prayer; and here, let me pledge before God, that I will never yield the strife against evil, nor cease to watch and pray till I rise in purity to my heavenly home ; where my freed spirit shall shine by the light of truth, as clearly as the sun, which so enchanted my vision. Canterbury, N. H. 32
