CONTENTMENT CATHARINE ALLEN Why murmur, though the talent's small That God hath given thee ? Or why repine ? It is the lesser lights, that make the larger stars appear So brilliantly to shine. 'Tis God who made them all, The large ones and the small ; Arid gave to each an orbit and a space to fill, And steadily through rolling years they keep their course, Performing each its'partsin His creative will. 'Tis thus I'll run the race that God hath marked for me, Content and thankful be, To do with patient heart and willing hands, The little things which he requires of me. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
