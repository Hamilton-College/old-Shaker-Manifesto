Idolatry BY ELIJAH MYRICK Would men draw down the smiles of heaven, let them convert the lavish, sinful expenditures on the dead, to the comfort and elevation of the ignorant and poor; turn all the Mt. Auburns and Greenwoods into homes of industry and comfort, or into grain fields for their support. Such institutions for the dead have wrought an unworthy reformation (?) by setting up the image of the beast, caste, in place of the beast sect, which made the churchyard their burying place. How aptly does the saying of Jesus apply: 'Let the d,ead bury their dead.'
