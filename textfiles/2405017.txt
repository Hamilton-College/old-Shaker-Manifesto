Enfield, N. H. April, 1894. 'Sijbing-time and robins have come.' The season is about a month earlier than usual, and unless the spring is cold and backward, there is prospect of an early harvest. The maple harvest is finished, and we have had about five hundred gallons of syrup from our two orchards. Our contract for corn-planters is about completed, and we have orders for twenty-five extra machines. The next large job of work is a yard full of lumber to be sawn and stacked. In our Saturday evening service, many of us were surprised by the announcement of Elder Abraham's resignation from the Eldership of the Church. It was also announced that, of choice, he would spend the remainder of his days at the Society in Canterbury. To many who have been blest with his care and ministration since childhood, the change seems but one degree short of a visit from the 'Angel Reaper.' However, we find a great source of consolation in the fact that he is still spared to us; and though we may not be blessed by the benediction of his presence, still we feel assured that his love and interest for the people in this part of the Lord's vineyard will never wane. He leaves us loved by those who know him; respected by acquaintances, and honored by all. We know that he goes among those who in years gone by have been cared for and loved by him, and we feel assured that his declining years will be spent in the peacefulness and quietude his long term of service so well merits. Our service on the 8th inst. was an ovation of love and kind remembrance, botli old and young presenting many tributes of love and respect. Elder William Wilson succeeds Elder Abraham as first Elder in the Church. Sister Julia Russell, who is first in charge at our Infirmary, met with an accident a few days since, by falling and breaking her wrist. We hope for a speedy recovery for her. G. II. Kirkley. North Family. April, 1894. In attending Easter service with our Church kindred, the many recitations bearing on the subject of the bodily ascension of Jesus, brought to mind the text, 'Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness.' Qualities of nature achieved by doing good works that resurrect from the soil of sin into an atmosphere of active goodness,ï¿½these unite souls to Christ and to their fellow beings by principles of holiness, and become to awakened souls as the voice of the risen Christ, asking for greater activity and for 'patient continuance in the way of well doing.' Since writing our last Notes heralding the news of excellent health, almost every member in the family has been stricken with a hard cold and in some cases quite sevei'ely hit. If a vegetarian diet will aid in fortifying the physical structure against colds as well as against other distressing afflictions which flesh is heir to, would it not be well to heed the injunction, Be temperate in all things? and thus help to bring about the full resurrection of our being from all things that bring disease to mind, soul and body. Our sugar harvest is small compared with former years. We tapped but five hundred trees, preferring not to hire extra help. May we all, like the budding foliage and the merry summer birds, be filled with renewed life unto God, and sing songs of praise to both divine and human powers of good. George II. Baxter.
