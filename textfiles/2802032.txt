The Outlook Several illustrated articles of more than ordinary interest are to be found in the Magazine Number of The Outlook for January. Among them is the first installment of Edward Everett Hale's James Russell Lowell and His Friends, which has portraits of Lowell, Emerson and Longfellow, of singular beauty, and unknown to the general public. This series of articles by Dr. Hale will be the most prominent feature in The Outlook for 1S98, just as Mr. Justin McCarthy's Story of Gladstone's Life, now exciting so much attention in its book form, was in F97. The other notable illustrated features are The New York Public Library, by John S. Billings, the Director of thf Library : The Picturesque in American Life and Nature, by Charles Dudley Warner, as interviewed by Clifton Johnson; and Stoyd (tlie Swedish system of manual training,) by W. S. Harwood. With this number begins the publication of Dr. Lyman Abbott's series on The Life and Letters of Paul, ihet delivered as addresses at Plymouth Church, Brooklyn. The fiction of the number is supplied by a short story called Billy-Boy, by William Canlon, author of the charming stories in W. V., Her Book, and The Invisible Playmate; while a most amusing sketch called Little Students in Giiggsville, by the Rev. Uriah X. Buttles, adds to the entertaining element. ($3 a year.
