GOD OF THE MARTYRS. By Cora C. Vinneo. God of the martyrs, lend thine ear to-day, While we approach Thy throne on bended knee, And ask for strength that comes alone from Thee. O God, we' ve felt the pain that made us pray! We've felt as well Thy love without delay, Like balm that gushes from the wounded tree. Help us to live in sweet sincerity,ï¿½ We all are martyrs in our humble way. We ask for power to be true and good. Give us O Father, sight to plainly see The place that brightened where the martyrs stood Where last they gave their holy vows to Thee. Give us the seal of love that made them calm, To find in trembling flames the healing Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
