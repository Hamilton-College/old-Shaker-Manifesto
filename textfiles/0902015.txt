Christian Progress The Shaker Manifesto is much pleased because the Boston Investigator—rational- istic—has pronounced Shakerism a form of primitive Christianity. The Investigator applied that epithet simply because the Shakers live in a community in very much the same way the early Church lived, in view of the supposed near Jiteral Coming of the Lord. But even if the Investigator had meant that the Shakers were like primitive Christians in their purity, we ask, Does Christianity make no progress in history ?• Must the advancement be downhill so that we must ever look backward for purity ? We much prefer to look forward and to be able to say: This is the Christianity which shall prevail in the future, rather than: This is past Christianity. We clip the above from the New Jerusalem Messenger, of which we have had many good words to speak. We are sorry our contemporary is jealous of us, particularly when we are praised for our Christian tendencies, by so radically an infidel sheet as The Investigator. But amid our sorrow, we will render to it corroborative and com- forting answers. 1. Certainly, Christianity does not make much noble progress in history ; it progresses carnal, flesh-loving, selfish men and women, while they yet live on earth, into sinless, angelic, Christlike individuals —the progress being in the individuals more particularly than in the system. 2. Nay, the advancement is uphill, forward, ascending and eternal for aught we now know. 3. 'We,' too, ' much prefer to look forward and be able to say:' This is past Christianity, present Christianity and most assuredly, this Shakerism is '' the Christianity which shall prevail in the future!'' Permit me to correct you, friend Messenger'. The Investigator did not ' pronounce Shakerism a form of primitive Christianity ; ' but it did say: ' Shakerism is primitive Christianity,' for which we render it our thanks.
