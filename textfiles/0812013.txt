GIVE US A HEARING If those sincere religionists, whom we 80 largely respectfor their sincerity, would but give us a hearing before they refuse us recognition as Christians, or other than unreasonably fanatical in our testimony, we should be greatly relieved from temptations to become impatient; while they could not better evidence the Christian characteristic of forbearance. Tell us, dear friends, wherein our testimonies or lives differ from the same of Jesus, or those taught by the little, model Primitive Christian Church? You ask why we deal with institutions, considered sacred by your churches, as unchristian institutions? with marriage, the private family, personal property, etc. ? We have only one answer to these questions: Because we nowhere find any of these in Christ. Jesus not only remained a celibate virgin, but taught this as right for His followers, and for all who would be chil- dren of the Resurrectionâ€”which He wa3. Are we too stringent then with ourselves in our abstinence of marriage ? or was Hk too stringent? Some of his immediate disciples were married mea ; Peter for instance : but after his conversion to Christ, he 'led his wife as a sister,' no more as a wife. Paul, while permitting marriage, which as a follower of Christ himself, he had no right todo, yet lived above marriage. As did the early disciples with their 'possessions and goods/'we aim to do like them, not only because they did, but because it is less selfish and most right. Do we preach or practice peace any more radically than did Jesus? Who then will blame us for our unwillingness to fight? Hear us, friends: We have done with Marriage, War, Private property, politics, and the bad and good of selfish lives, just as Jesus did. If we claim him as a leader, and to follow him, can we do differently? And are you as willing to give us as much credit for so doing, as you extend to Him of whom you also profess discipleship?
