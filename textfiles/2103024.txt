Groveland, N. Y. Feb. 1891. We are reminded by the coming of the new month that new notes are wanted to supply the new pages soon to be read by various ages. The saw mill that has been closed for a long time is again in full operation. Good sleighing has renewed the logging enterprise,'much to the satisfaction of many who were deprived last winter of mill work owing to the absence of snow. Wheat and other grains sown last fall are thriving grandly, far beyond the anticipation of the sowers who went forth the past season to sow the seed for future need. Our winter has been interspersed with sunny days which call to vision the good time coining, when we 'shall walk through green pastures by the side of still waters.' Where grows the willow fresh mid bright, Where sere and withered leave* its beauty cannot blight. While many inhabitants of this and neighboring localities are visited with the Russian la grippe of last winter, our Society thus far has not been disturbed by its ugly presence, though a few have proved the disadvantage of a slight cold. Brother Clark Coburn who has been disabled for the past nine or ten weeks from mingling in the burdens of life, is now improving under the skillful management of Dr. Helen I. Woodworth, Physician and Surgeon of Nunda, Livingston Co., N. Y.. Dr. Woodworth is a near and dear friend of this Community. Br. Frederick I. Stebbins, a member of this Society, but whose present abiding place is Rochester, N. Y., spent Sunday the 8th. inst. visiting his community home and friends. Br. Frederick has a little daughter residing in the family, the youngest of our thirteen pupils. G. D. G.
