MORAL CHARACTER. MATILDA J. TATTERTON. There is nothing which adds so much to the power of man, as a good moral character. It is more than health or happiness. It dignifies and exalts in every condition of life. Such a character is more to be desired than fame or renown. It makes a man free and independent, a man's moral character influences largely his manners towards others, and if he possess the self-respect that comes from following convictions of right, efctsily becomes a power for good. Strength of character is not mere strength of strong feelings. It is unyielding resistance to whatever would disconcert from without, or within. Character is eternal, hence, the necessity of commencing in childhood, being constant in youth, devoted in manhood, thus wisely maturing in age, a character free from all blight. Finally in thought and act, so live that daily growth of soul and body, may ever tend in the direction of perfection. Canterbury, N. H.
