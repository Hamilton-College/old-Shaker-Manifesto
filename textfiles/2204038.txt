New England Magazine A HUCKSTER OF RELIGION. 'Talmage, to-day, employs very nearly the same methods as those employed by Beecher; but one must not for a moment place him on the same plane,' says Walter Blackburn Harte in the March New England Magazine. 'In spite of his occasional sensationalism Beecher was in earnest; he did not flinch from uttering his convictions, though perhaps the opposition he encountered in orthodox quarters imbued those convictions often with a militantism they could have dispensed with. Talmage is a mere poseura mouth- He is a shepherd whose work in the Lord's vineyard, and the sensational, Sunday papers, makes one wonder whether the Lord is fully cognizant of his self-called servant. Talmage is a huckster in emotional religion; a man whom Barnum (who was not such a great humbugas he claimed to be, giving, as he did, everybody the worth of his money) could have claimed, and perhaps did, as a brother.'
