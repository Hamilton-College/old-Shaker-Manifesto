A MOMENT'S REVERIE. H. H. 'When from active scenes turned aside, and reflection Presents to the mind shadows passed down the years Of hopes and of promises, friendships worth tasted, The book of life opens, mid doubting and fears. I read on its page how in foul and fair weather My outward bound vessel cleared each rocky coast; How grandly, how proud, thro' rude tempest she bore With my trusted Pilot e'er true to his post. [me, I read, while in sight of the shore just receding, The perilous journey yet scarcely begun, That assailed, still defiant, as bold, self-reliant As the undaunted eagle that soars to'ard the sun. O'er the turbulent ocean of sin, pain and fretting, With Thee my Commander, my Pilot, I'll go; Where from the wretchedness of vain regretting, Serene words of virtue I'll evermore know. To more glorious life a bright future is dawning, And may this my voyage the prelude now be, That home from the contest I'll come with rejoicing From earth's gloom and shadows forever set free. Tho' night time of darkness, and doubt yet o'er take mei Unwavering trust in this Pilot of mine Shall bear my heart upward and beckon me onward, Till affliction and trial my soul shall refine. Each sensuous pleasure, each inward foe vanquished, My tranquilized mind new delights entertain; No tortuous paths now my feet more shall tread in, Safe anchored within my good Pilot's domain. Mt.
