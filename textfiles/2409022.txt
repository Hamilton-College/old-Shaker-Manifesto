Alfred., Maine. Aug. 1894. Since writing Home Notes two moons have waxed and waned. July with its extreme heat so hard for humanity but so good for the corn, and now comes August with the New England weather extreme. The night of the 10th brought frost on the low ground. , The Brethren have finished the hajing and report 15 per cent less than last year, from the last year's drouth on the grass roots. We had corn on the table the ICtli which is early for this section. The Bivt'iren tried spraying the potatoes with the Bordeaux Mixture to protect them from rust, and up to date our potato tops are green, while our neighbors' are rusting badly. We look at things differently. Ii I should ask our children wliat was the most important thing that happened in the last month, they would say their excursion to Portland and the Islands. Some twenty-five of the younger portion of our Society with a few older ones, went to Portland the morning of the 9th and had a sail on Casco Bay. We landed at Peaks Island, where we spent a few hours, and then returned to Portland where the purchases made were too numerous to be recorded in the Manifesto. Then came our ride home in the evening on the P. and E. road, all glad to reach our quiet Shaker Home. Fannie Casey.
