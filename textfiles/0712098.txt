Trouble. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, mankind make their own troubles jit is not in the nature of things that it shoulc jbe otherwise. And yet we might be the mos happy people that the sun shines on, ifw pleased. Life would run smoothly in th '•rooves if we would only let it; but we are e not content to do so—in fact, contented Avith 1 nothing! From the cradle to the tomb we c re continually fretting about something, v We are living at altogether too fast and too ^ eckless a rate. We innate the balloon beyond its capacity to bear, and then wonder hat it collapses, and we get a fall. Contentnent—to let things take their course—is a ondition we have yet to learn. But how an we expect to be free from the trouble, so ong as we are seeking for it! We are much ike the son of the Emerald Isle, who was ' niver at peace widout he was at war wid omebody.' We constantly make trouble— get into hot water—and then grumble. But he world wags on just the same, and will unto the end, although we hasten our end by constant restlessness.
