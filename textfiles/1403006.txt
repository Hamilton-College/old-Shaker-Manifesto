TESTIMONY OF AGE GIDEON TURNER. These verses brother Gideon asked to have read after he hud passed away, for said he, ' I shall want to be remembered; I have ever loved this precious saving gospel. If my words can do but little good, they will do no harm.'-G Those youthful days which God did lend to me To be prepared for age, are gone, I see; Xow age with much infirmity appears,ï¿½ A few turns more will finish out my years. My eyesight, memory and hearing fails, And weakness o'er my natural frame prevails, This native body to the dust will go, Which is a fact that every one must know. But though my da&gt;sso swiftly glide along, Yet in my faith, in spirit, I am strong; In my declining years I plainly see There's still a precious gift of God for me. The ways of God are equal, just and true, To faithful souls it is forever new; Both old and young may share the heavenly prize If they are patient, humble, meek and wise. The work of God has been my soul's delight, Fifty four years I've striven with strength and might To keep the gospel in its purity, AVhich was the gift that Mother gave to me, And in return, as Mother often said, My soul has thrived on pure and living bread, And though this body turns again to earth My soul will sing the songs of joy and mirth.
