She can take the fullest advantage of a perfect educational plan by which she can educate her daughters or sons at the best colleges in the country free of charge, and now the Journal has arranged it so that she can buy her bookseven a single book at a timeat prices heretofore obtained only by large buyers. There comes to us from this magazine a very artistically gotten-up illustrated booklet of ovei'250 pages, called '5000 Books,' which serves as an easy guide to the best books in any department of reading. This guide is very well done. The best literary experts of New York, Boston nnrt I'hiladelphia were engaged by the Journal to select the five thousand books which it presents as the most desirable fora home library, and their work has been admirably carried out. Very clear, explanatory comments are given by these men of books, and besides there are given not less than 160 portraits of leading authors. No book will, perhaps, do so much to extend good reading as this guide, so carefully gotten up, so beautifully printed, and so generously offered, free of any charge, by the publishers of The Ladies' Borne Journal. '5000 Books' is unquestionably the best and easiest guide to a wise selection of books that has been issued for a long time.
