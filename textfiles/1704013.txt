MIGHT HAVE BEEN GEORGE COOPER I might have been more patient- - Ah ! would the angry word Upon my lips had perished, LTnuttered and unheard! Some heart would now be lighter To wend its toilsome way; Some life would be more cheerful, More sunshiny to-day. I might have been more kindly- - Hovr trifling is the cost Of simple deeds of goodness, Whose power is never lost! The golden moment vanished, And never to return; The glory of bestowing, Too late, too late I learn! I might have been more loving To those who hold me dear; What little deeds, neglected, Had soothed their pathway here ! The hasty word or action That pained a gentle heart, Ah! will its mournful memory From out our life depart? 'I might have been ! '- -sad burden Of life's remorseful song, Within the heart forever Its haunting echoes throng. Oh, youth, upon the threshold, To this sweet lesson bow : For deeds of love and kindness, Life has one season- -Now! Selected.
