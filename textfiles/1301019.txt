How many good resolutions are formed, and how few are kept. New Year's day often rules the year. Begin right. As you turn over a new leaf in the volume of the yeafs, turn over a new leaf in holy living. One sinful deed will stain your consciences. It will be a bad start. It may wreck your immortal souls! Don't yield to sin. 'A sin stained conscience is an unpleasant companion.' Beware of the first stain. Constant, self-denying struggles will adorn your souls with purity. 'Shun the appearance of evil,' is good advice to follow. ''Each day is a little life in itself.' Grow into a beautiful life. Be virtuous to-day, and to-morrow, be virtuous then, and'by the. year's end, you will have accomplished what would surprise you to contemplate, if the work was set before you at the beginning of the year. Each day pertorm good vows. Gain all the soul wealth you can. Day by day, every day well spent will insure you a Happy New Year. Your Brother. Daniel Oreutt
