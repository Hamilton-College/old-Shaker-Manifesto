Oh, lead me, Lord... Oh, lead me, Lord, that I may lead The wandering and the wavering feet; Oh feed me, Lord, that I may feed Thy hungering ones with manna sweet. Oh strengthen me, that while I stand Firm on the rock, and strong in Thee ; I may stretch out a loving haad To wrestlers with the troubled sea.
