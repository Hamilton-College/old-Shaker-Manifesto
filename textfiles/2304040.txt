Poet's Number of Vick's Floral Guide PANSIES. . This group of pansies is especially fine. The pansy, though an old fashioned flower, never seems to lose its popularity. The sentiments that we have learned to connect it with have brought it nearer to heart and home than any other blossom. This Poet's Number of Vick's Floral Guide also contains many valuable hints to the horticulturist, on the laying out of flower beds, illustrated by diagrams, the planting and sowing of perennials and annuals, the cultivation of shrubs and bulbs, etc. We earnestly recommend it to the attention of all who have time to improve their hearts and minds by the development of a refining and elegant taste. We have had proof positive by the flowers we have raised from seeds furnished by the genial publisher, that the brilliant chromos that adorn his work are far from being overdrawn or too highly colored. The utilitarian will find pages and illustrations devoted to luscious fruits and succulent vegetables, from which an appetizing odor seems to rise as we turn the attractive leaves. The 18!);J issue is called the Poets' Number because it is filled with appropriate quotations from prominent authors, making it of great interest to all. Five elegant colored plates, with lithograph covers, descriptions ol newest and best vegetables, all for only 10 cents, which can be deducted from first order. The publishers are James Vick's Sons, Rochester, N. Y.
