LITTLE MEN AND WOMEN Can you put the spider's web back in its place, That once has been swept away? Can you put the apple again on the bough, That fell at our feet to day? 99 THE MANIFESTO. Can fou put the lily-cup back on the stem, And cause it to live and grow? Can you mewl the butterfly's broken Â¦wing, That was crushed by a cruel blow? Can you put the petals back on the rose? If you could, would it smell as sweet? Can you put the flour again in the husk, And show me the ripened wheat? You think that these questions are trifling, dear, Let me ask you another one : Can a hast}' word ever be unsaid, Or an unkind deed undone? Woman's Journal.
