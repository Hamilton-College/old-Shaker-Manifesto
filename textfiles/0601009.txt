A PROPHECY WATSON ANDREWS The pentecostal wave, many fold redoubled, shall again descend and sweep with giant force throughout the world. No sect, party, scheme nor combinations will avail to quench its fires, nor turn its resistless tide one tittle from its course; but onward, ever onward, o'er thrones and kingdoms it shall roll, when wrong of every name and nature — princely, priestly and pecuniary — shall be swept from the earth. Other Pauls and Peters shall arise on whom the cloven tongues of fire will again descend, and burning words in thunder tones shall leap from off their glowing altars, and set a waking world on fire! Repentant cries shall break the midnight gloom, and tears like rain-drops lay the rising dust. Oh God! be mine so to live now, that love and not repentance shall then melt my soul to tears.
