MORNING GLORIES. After holes have been made about half an inch below the ground two or three seeds can be put in one hole and covered. As they grow they should have strings or frames to climb upon. These flowers open in the morning and close as soon as it grows warm The seeds are black when ripe and the seeds should not be picked while green. If a person takes good care of morning glories they could have them year after year as it is no great trouble to take care of them. They should be kept in a damp state and I have been told that as they need more water than other flowers that they can bear a great deal of water but not too much. E. B. K.
