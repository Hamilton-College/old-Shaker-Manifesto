BEST THOUGHTS OF BEST AUTHORS Among all the other virtues, humility, the loveliest, is pre-eminent. It is the safest because it is always at anchor; and that man may truly be said to live the most content in his calling who strives to live within compass of it. —Ricliter. While a man is stringing a harp, he tries the strings, not for music but for construction. When it is finished it shall be played for melodies. God is fashioning the human heart for future joy. He only sounds a string here and there to see how far his work has progress. — Beecher. The sublime is the temple-step of religion as the stars are of immeasurable space. When what is mighty appears in nature, — a storm, thunder, the starry firmament, death,— then utter the word ' God ' before the child. A great misfortune, a great blessing, a great crime, a noble action, are building-sites for a child's church.— Riehter. Though thou see'st another openly offend, or even commit some enormous sin, yet thou must not from thence take occasion to value thyself for thy superior goodness ; for thou canst not tell how long thou wilt be able to persevere in the narrow path of virtue. All men are frail, but thou shouldst reckon none so frail as thyself.— Thomas a Kempis. Running water is sweet. It is your tight tank that gets slimy, and putrid, and unwholesome. He who opens his eyes to see the wants and woes of other people, and goes to work to relieve them, will somehow insensibly forget to make a fuss about his own trifles. —(Jongregationalist.
