EVERY DAY. Elizabeth Akers Allen. Oh, trifling tasks so often done, Yet ever to be done anew! Oh, cares which come with every sun, Morn after morn, the lomj years through! We shrink beneath their paltry sway,� The irksome calls of every day. The restless sense of wasted power, The tiresome round of little things, Are hard to bear, as hour by hour Its tedious iteration brings ; Who shall evade or who delay The small demands of every day? The boulder in the torrent's course By tide and tempest lashed in vain, Obeys the wave-whirled pebble's force, And yields its substance grain by grain; So crumble strongest lives away Beneath the wear of every day. Who finds the lion in his lair, Who tracks the tiger for his life, May wound them ere they are aware, Or conquer them in desperate strife, Yet powerless he to scathe or slay The vexing gnats of every day. The steady strain that never stops Is mightier than the fiercest shock; The constant fall of water drops Will groove the adamantine rock; We feel our noblest powers decay, In feeble wars with every day. We rise to meet a heavy blow� Our souls a sudden bravery fills� But we endure not always so The drop-by-drop of little ills ; We still deplore and still obey The hard behests of every day. The heart which boldly faces death Upon the battle-field, and dares Cannon and bayonet, faints beneath The needle-points of frets and cares ; The stoutest spirits they dismay� The tiny stings of every day. And even saints of holy fame, Whose souls by faith have overcome, Who wore amid the cruel flame The molten crown of martyrdom, Bore not without complaint alway The petty pains of every day. Ah, more than martyr's aureole, And more than hero's heart of fire, We need the humble strength of soul Which daily toils and ills require;� Sweet Patience! grant us, if you may, An'added grace for every day!
