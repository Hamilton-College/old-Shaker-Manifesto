SHE RATTLES THE SHAKERS MRS. HARTER [From Seymour Times.] BY If Jesus our exemplar be, How few true followers we see ; None with Him are life partakers Except it be the modest Shakers, Who live content with no estates, And are like Him strict celibates, But whether that be more divine, Remains unproven we opine. Now let us pause and reason here, To make the subject still more clear, Whether God, the wise Creator, Really was an earnest Shaker ? A Shaker god could have no heart, In making man a counterpart. And why should he His mind perplex, With fashioning the fairer sex ? If when He bade the man to take her He had replied ' Nay, I'm a Shaker,' The whole creation would have failed Had Shakerism then prevailed, And where, O where in earth or heavens, Would now exist dear Elder Evans? He'd not be here to teach reform For none of us would e'er been born ; Nonentity would be our doom And nowhere our eternal home. 'Twas well for woman and her maker, That the first man did not Shake-her, But if that be religion true 'Twas just as needful then as now ; All nature's demonstrations prove That God created all through love, And love attracts and correlates And through this law God procreates ; Then why condemn with such persistence The law that gives us our existence ? Nay, do not nature's God demean, By calling His just laws unclean. Where unperverted nature leads, The highest happiness succeeds.
