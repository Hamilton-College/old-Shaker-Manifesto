Shaker Village, N. H. L. Shaker Village, N. H. Dear Sister Mary;â€”I thought some of the other girls had written to you, so I thought it would be nice for me to write and tell you low much I loved you, and what a good sis;er I think you are. I wish I could grow up and be as good as 90 SHAKER MANIFESTO. you are, then I should be happy, and all the little girls would love me too. I thank you very kindly for that pretty card you gave me. I think it was very pretty. All of the children send their love to you. Yesterday it snowed. I am glad it is winter. I love winter because it snows. I am trying to be a good girl. Don't you love to have some one to write you? I love to have some one write to me. Last summer I had two gardens to pick flowers from. I love flowers. Good by, from your child, [Age, nine years.]
