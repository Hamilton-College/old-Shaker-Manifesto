Sabbathday Lake, Me. March, 1899. Makch came in like a lamb, but no doubt we shall hear the lion's roar before he goes out. Thus far some of the days have been very fine. We have commenced our spring work in the greenhouse; seedsowing, etc. The Brethren have lately put a No. 2. Baby Separator into our cow-barn and this will lessen the dairy work to some extent. They are getting over 32 gallons of milk per day. The Separator cream tested 32 per cent butter fat, while the old creamery cream tested 22 per cent. General Eepairs is stopping with us. I notice the window blinds, of one house and then another, missing and find on inquiry they are undergoing a reformation of a new coat. So are many of the rooms in the brick dwelling, also sleighs, wagons, etc., which have been in with the Oeneral and come out looking quite new. Our deserted Village, the Poland Hill Farm, has at last been sold to the Kicker Brothers, who will soon turn it into a very beautiful place which their guests will enjoy visiting. The family have been afflicted with much sickness the past month, which was a great hinderance to our fancy basketwork. Nearly all have had La Grippe in one form or another, but at last all are safe and that is much to be thankful for. Ada S. CumniinffS.
