LONGFELLOW'S CREED My work is finished; I am strong In faith and hope and charity; ForI have written the things 1 see, The things that have been and shall be. Conscious of right, nor fearing wrong; Because 1 am in Jove with Love, And the sole thing I hate is Hate; For Hate is death; and Love is life, A peace, a splendor from aboye; And Hate a never ending strife, A smoke, a blackness from the abyss •• Where unclean serpents coil and hiss I Love is the Holy Ghost within; Hate the unpardonable sin, L, Who preaches otherwise than this Betrays his Master with a kiss.
