Migration and transmigration is the spirit that inspires people of to-day whether political, agricultural, scientific or spiritual. All are on the 'qui vive,' as unsettled as the waves of the sea. The religious element is all in a foam. Even the Shakers are affected with the mania. One family after another is seeking other quarters or regions. The South family of Canaan formed the introduction; next the Center family became non est; and now the North family of Canaan are vacating and casting their lot with the people at Enfield, Conn. What next stands on the program of revolution? This is tMount Lebanonurrent at Mt. Lebanon. A like tidal wave has swept over communities, and some of these have become extinct and others stand on the verge of an avalanche. Our founders predicted seven essential changes would take place among us in spiritual degrees of evolution. The spirit world appears to be aroused with various aims for the improvement of mankind. The Lord of all who reigns above, Does, from his heavenly throne, Behold what children dwell in love, And marks them for his own. Then let us strive while here in time To make our birthright sure; That we may dwell in realms sublime Among the just and pure. Calvin G. Heed. South Family. Mar. 1897. Dear Editor:�I can not 'blot myself quite out,' so thought I would write some news,� Spring is coming, 'tis almost here, The birds will sing and give us cheer; Trees will blossom, flowers bloom, Filling the air with sweet perfume. Lambs in the meadow, far away, Will leap and bleat and skip and play, While in the kitchen just below, I'm making cake and kneading dough. But my occupation will soon change, in this place, and other business must be lookt after more closely, as we can not yet live without the 'mighty dollar' and must obey the injunction, 'keep out of debt.' We still find time to read and write, as we do not wish to be behind the times. The Christian Herald and Ladies' Home Journal are our good old friends, and we have been interested in reading a brief ac58 count of the life of Maceo, hero and martyr who was at last betrayed by Zertucha. Deliver us from traitors,�from one who violates his trust. When the millennium is fully ushered in, fighting will be no more, and the truly good and loyal will have peace and joy. Lord, hasten the day when revengeful, grasping natures will have an end. This is an individual work and what people want they willingly suffer for. If the gospel work is the object of life, they will do the work it requires. They will gather the fruits of the Spirit,�'love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance.' 'My brain power may be very small, No matter,�it is mine, And from the hand of nature's God, I caught the spark, divine. And be the talents one or ten, Committed to my care;� He only asks that worthily 1 use and prize my share.' Sarah A. Collins. Shakers, N. Y. March, 1897. The poet Longfellow in his poem 'The Builders,' beautifully illustrates the unity of all the forces that emanate from the Divine mind. 'Nothing useless is, or low; Each thing in its place is best, And what seems but idle show, Strengthens and supports the rest.' The faculty that is termed the sense of beauty manifests itself in various forms to different minds. To some the beauty of flowers is the ideal to which they are attracted; some, of which our poet is an example, see it illustrated in varied forms and none can be rejected that tend to unify and exalt the life, bringing it nearer that universal mind, which from the crude material, is developing the beautiful and true. We can not but realize the unequal balance of life's necessities, when with the appalling famine in India our western farmers quote corn at eight cents per. bushel and are using it for fuel. When will the balance be adjusted? Echo answers, When? We can only realize with more clearness our own blessings and give our sympathy to the suffering altho unable to render them tangible assistance. To be able to view the problems of life seriously, does not imply that we should look1 at them with a sense of gloom and be misanthropic, but while realizing them in their importance take a cheerful, prospective view of the situation and look up through the clouds, to the sunlight of heaven. But with the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars that were recently spent on a dress ball in New York, the flaunting of such immense wealth in the face of gaunt poverty, rousing passions that will only give might the power to grasp it regardless of laws divine or human; to see the multitudes who are so absorbed in the rush after wealth as to give no thought to the many moral and social problems of life that are calling for adjustment, causes us to have serious thoughts as to the result. Hamilton DeGraw. East Canterbury, N. H. March, 1897. With the coming of spring, comes s.mie very pleasant anticipations. We are thinking of the maple syrup harvest, altho we may not be able as a Society to enter into its manufacture. We are thinking of the return of the singing birds, as their presence exerts a salutary influence upon a great many minds. We are thinking of milder weather, after a long, northern winter and of the flowers that will very soon bud and blossom to our very great pleasure. Already the days have increast in length (March 8,) two hours and thirtyone minutes, which blesses us with so much additional light; and light adds much to the life of the world. When this number of The Manifesto reaches its readers, the day's increase will have reacht not less than three hours and forty minutes and the sun will shine upon us so early as twenty-nine minutes past five, in the morning. Before that date reaches us, we are promist more snow-storms, more high winds and more rain, with an accompaniment of colds and coughs. As they can not all come on any one day, we must devise plans for our personal protection. We will think kindly of the winter that has given us a liberal supply of snow, and made many hearts glad, and has also frozen the water in our lakes some sixteen inches, so that our ice-houses have been filled with an article of the best quality. Henry C. Blinn. Narcoossee, Fla. Feb. 1897. We have made for ourselves and others a happy little home, from which will pass the testimony of everlasting truth. We have not been dilatory in sowing the seed, and have distributed many of our publications to those who are interested to read them. About 100 rods from our dwelling is a house that was formerly owned by a family of Swedes. It is now rented to a man, a leader of a Society of celibates. He has several followers, and is expecting others. They are strictly non-resistant. It is astonishing to see the rush of people to the shores of Florida. Many who have good, comfortable homes in the north are leaving them for the sunny south. We have been fighting pine trees and palmetto roots for two years, and we think we are coming out on the right side. One year since we planted three acres of sweet potatoes. We have sold 100 bu. at forty cents per. bu. and shall sell as many more at a later date, and still have enough left for our own use. We sold 100 pineapples at fifty cents each. From the same piece we sold considerable garden produce. We had a slight frost, which did some injury, but by building fires on the lot we saved most of our property. We planted two acres of northern potatoes, and th ese are doing nicely. We now have 600 peach trees, and about one third of these will bear fruit. 100 orange trees are growing, but we must wait a few years before we can gather much fruit. We also have 00 guava bushes. We are intending, by and by, if prosperity attends us to put up a dwelling near Alligator lake, some two miles distant from our present location. That will be a much better building spot and may be better every way. We have just put up a Fairbank's wind-mill and a 5000 gal. tank for irrigating and also for domestic purposes. A pipe passes 150 ft. into the lake and this gives us the best of drinking water. In our Sunday service we sometimes read from the book of 'Living Witnesses.' Some of our neighbors from our other house attend religious service with us and we sing or speak as imprest by the good Spirit. Andrew Barrett.
