'PRENTISSIANA.' In the days of spiritual manifestations among the Shakers, when the Eternal Parents bowed the Heavens and came down to give humanity a lift to higher forms of thought and action, the Eternal Father said to us: ' Salvation is comparatively cheap. It can be obtained by honest confession and obedience to the order of the gospel.* But to enter the mansions of my Eternal Brightness will cost the soul all the sufferings it can possibly endure.' At any — at all costs— I'm in for the mansions of Eternal Brightness. ' I'll kiss the rod that's sent of God, (The rods are not all smooth either.) Be patient, meek and humble, No heavy stroke shall me provoke, To murmur, fret, nor grumble.' And when liberated from all lower influences ; when I can ascend to the Good — the True — the Beautiful; standing upright before the Burning Throne of God in my own soul, with naught to offend in all the ' Holy Mountain,' in the mansions of Eternal Brightness, with kindred souls, my dear, gospel relations, like kindred drops will mingle into one,be all one; sisters and brothers, I'll own 'tis cheap enough. Amen ! Hallelujah !
