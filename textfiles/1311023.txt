To remove paint from old doors... To remove paint from old doors, etc., and to soften putty in window frames so that the glass may be taken out Avithout breaking or cutting, take one pound of pearl-ash and three pounds of quicklime ; slack the lime in water, then add the pearl-ash, and make the whole about the consistence of paint. Apply it to both sides of the glass, and let it remain for twelve hours, when the putty will be so softened that the glass may be taken out of the frame without being cut, and with the greatest facility.
