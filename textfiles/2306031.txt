'I wosdee if this is the same world I started in' said one, when life's inevitable changes disturbed her daily routine; and closer still would be our comparison, for to-day we would wonder if this is the same world we lived on a week ago. 'Then we could only say, The earth's a field of mud,� The sky's a waterspout.' Now the sky is guiltless of a cloud, and a new life seems infused into all creation. Sowers and planters are out in earnest, it being the first opportunity to work the soil this spring; and they know of a truth that 'If we sow no seed in Spring, we shall look in vain for Autumn fruits.' 'The seasons come and go, to teach men gratitude,' and what numberless other lessons we learn by their ceaseless routine. We plant and sow to the best of our ability, hoping and trusting that the harvest may be sure; but ere the fruition of our hopes, we know not what element of nature will come as a destroyer, or who may be the reapers of what we have sown. If in material things we are so trusting, ought we not thus to toil for the inner life? We may often fail to reap where we have sown, but would it not seem sadder still, to fail of a harvest, because we had not sown. On the 19-20 ult. eastern New York experienced the wildest storm known in this locality for years. It was not a cyclone which comes and goes before you are aware, but wind, sleet and rain which lasted twenty-four hours; the last twelve being the worst, during which time even our large brick building shook. But when we came to learn of barns being blown down, horses, cattle and sheep killed, houses unroofed, etc., in the towns about us, we were again reminded, how cosily we were located among the hills; for though we thought the wind terrific, it did not assist the Brethren in the least, to remove an unsightly shed by the tannery, which a pressure of work still keeps standing. So though our village is so located that we must climb or descend a hill to reach it, we have our advantages, and as we look at the beautiful pictured landscape about us, we are glad of the sunny days in life, which cause us to forget the storm. Amelia J. Calver. Center Family. May, 1893. Foe the last few days we have had delightful weather, in marked contrast to last week. Commenced gardening on the 9th inst. Sowed parsnip, onion an 1 beet seed for a beginning; farmers planting potatoes; oats, I think are mostly in tlie ground, some of them are up, nicely. To-morrow we intend to have our first meal of asparagus, it has grown nearly or quite twelve inches to-day. Trees are very late in blooming, not a blossom to be seen as yet; the buds are about ready to burst and in a few days, probably the trees will be in full bloom. I was about to say, health of family pretty good, but on second thought am sorry to say, several are on the invalid corps; we hope this beautiful weather will bring us all health and strength. We are glad to hear through the medium of the Manifesto, of the prosperity of our Brethren and Sisters throughout Zion, hence we contribute these lines for the general good. Timothy Rayson. North. Family. May, 1893. We are very much interested in the 'Home Notes'' column, and like to be there in evidence when we can. We do 144 THE MANIFESTO. not mean willfully to neglect any duty, great or small, and we believe it is our duty, as it is our interest and our pleasure to fill our little medium of gospel intercourse, The Manifesto, with such words of encouragement and union as we have, for our gospel relation everywhere. We are full of courage and hope for the future of Zion, are proclaiming the testimony with firmness and confidence, are full of thankfulness for what the gospel has done for us, are keeping good gospel union, and are happy and thankful Zion travelers. The visible result of our missionary effort is small as yet. 'We are somewhat disappointed, but not discouraged. It gave us an opportunity of spreading a knowledge of our faith, and opened a very interesting correspondence with a few. We have not lost hope of gathering some. In any case the effort will not be lost. Some good will be done. We believe it is our duty to try to gather and save souls. We must be alive and active. We do not intend to stagnate. It is our duty to preach the gospel, keep the faith, live the life, and be content to leave the issue with the Author of our being and of our faith. The season being so late makes us exceptionally busy just now. We have been cleaning up premises generally, as we love to have temporal as well as spiritual things in good gospel order. Sisters are as busy as bees, house-cleaning, raking lawn and grass plots, laying out flower beds, etc., and this year they have offered to relieve the Brethren of the care of one of the strawberry beds. Thank God for good zealous Sisters! Brethren are short handed, and the question arose, Shall we hire an extra hand? We decided to hire no more help, but plant and sow only what we could care for with our present help. This is a wise decision. Work for the season has just been laid out and the gift of the Elders is to have everybody interested and make every one comfortable. To this end we have just adopted the plan of rising, for this season of the year, at five a. m., breakfasting at six, doing such chores as are possible in the meantime. The milking to be done alter breakfast. We have been in the habit of rising at 4-30 a. m. and milking before breakfast, but it has frequently been a hurrying time to get through and in the house in time for breakfast. We hope the new arrangement will enable us to commence the day more pleasantly for all. May 12th, just commenced putting in grain. Cows just out to pasture, but very short feed yet. Delightful weather the past three days. Walter S. Shepherd. Shakers, N. Y.. Second Family. May, 1893. On what topic can we write that will be of interest to all concerned? is a hard question to answer. Surely, if we write for Home Notes we must write of home and home surroundings, whatever they may be; and as the weather, if fair and pleasant or the opposite, has an influence on home and individuals, so will the weather always come in for a share of attention; and as we write from Maine to Kentucky, it gives us a chance to see the extremes of the elements. We at present have an abundance of rain, and though the grass is green, warm weather is yet afar off. It is a poor time to get in crops. Still we were fortunate enough to sow all our oats in April. Have planted a few early potatoes, peas, &amp;c. in the garden for family vise. We are always sorry to chronicle illness, while we feel it is a sin to be sick, especially when we are well. If that be the case we shall have to confess, and try to get well. We have had many cases of La Grippe in our Society, and a few cases of measles. We hope and trust all will get well and none of the cases prove fatal. Let us so live that when our time comes we may be prepared to obey the summons. Isaac Anstatt. THE MANIFESTO. 145 North Family. May, 1893. In recording Home Notes for the month, the very pleasant one is remembered of receiving as a present for our library, a copy of Canon Farrar's 'Life of Christ,' from our dear friend, J. G. Toepper of Washington, D. C. It is an illustrated work of seven hundred and sixty-five pages, and will be a companion to Munkacsy's 'Christ before Pilate,' of which we have a very fine copy three feet by two mounted and placed in the entrance hall of our home at the north. We can affirm by personal knowledge that the efforts of those here who minister the testimony of the higher life in our meetings for spiritual communion are successful. We have been greatly blest by the outpourings of the spirit that we have felt in those seasons, proving conclusively that there are those here who have come up through ^leep tribulation and are in truth virgin souls. La Grippe has been placing its grip upon some of the household, but it has been bidden to depart to the desert with the rest of the evil conditions. We are favored with plenty of moist weather at present, retarding farming operations somewhat; but trust it will be all right if we patiently wait. Hamilton DeGraw. West Pittsfleld. May, 1893. Deak Editor:�So much to interest, instruct, and fill our minds with high and holy thoughts do we find on the pages of each issue of your excellent publication, that we can not fail to realize our obligation to respond occasionally to the call for Home Notes. May came to us in a tearful mood and continued to weep almost incessantly the first week of her sojourn here, but now she is radiant with smiles and appears in her true colors. Vegetation is full of life, and the earth is donning her robe of emerald green. Our live stock consisting of one hundred and fifty head of cattle and fifteen horses, have nearly consumed our large supply of hay�there will be only about twenty tons remaining. In some former seasons there have been seventyfive or a hundred tons to carry over. Water-pipes, that Rip Van Winkle like, went to sleep last Decenber, have awakened, and so far as ascertained are mostly in sound condition. Considering the backwardness of the season,'farm work is progressing finely. Fire wood is mostly prepared for another year, lumber sawed and put in condition for seasoning. Some repairs are being made; at the office the walls and woodwork of each hall have been given a new coat of paint, which brightens and improves their appearance wonderfully. The brick dwelling is being renovated by the aid of paint and varnish. The kitchen and all rooms in the basement, with some others, are being thus renewed. The floor has been relaid in the large dining room, making it seem more cosy and pleasant when the family meet there, which is one thousand and ninety-five times a year. Notwithstanding all this pressure of home cares and responsibilities, Br. Ira is also conducting repairs at the grist mill. New steel beams are being put in the basement to support the weighty machinery, in place of the large timbers which have done service there the past twenty-nine years, and had begun to decay. A new brick blacksmith's shop is to bo erected over there the present season, on the corner where the old wooden shop now stands, and is to be 30x50 feet and roofed with slate. School opened for the summer term on the 24th ult. with a lower number of pupils than usual. Julia L. Street. Shaker Station, Conn. May, 1893. 'Put on the whole armor of God,' and keep it on. This is wise counsel. In the race for eternal life faithful crossbearing is requisite. Nothing truly noble 146 THE MANIFESTO. is gained without work, persistent, persevering, patient work. 'No pruning, no fruit; no battle, no victory; no cross, no crown.' No difficulties too great to be conquered. No danger in the path where Jesus leads. If we would shun sin, we must shun all that leads to sin. There is no better way to bear our own trials and afflictions than in trying to give comfort and joy to others. Sometimes a word of warning, caution or entreaty saves a soul from spiritual ruin and death. We must wear in eternity what we weave in time. Where purity is, a quiet spirit dwells. It is best to lay out some course of religious reading that will give us food for thought and serious reflection. We must feed the soul as well as the body, or we shall fail to reach the heavenly abode for which we are striving. * * * * If we have choice poultry we should give them choice treatment. So long as the poultry must be confined the greater part of the time, they should be fed regularly three times a day. When poultry get no attention they soon get so that they are not worth looking after. When breeding fowls for profit, we should breed what the market demands. The profits in poultry, as in everything else, depend to a great extent on proper management. Daniel Orcutt. South Family. May, 1893. Sow in the morn thy seed, At eve hold not thy hand; To doubt and fear give thou no heed, Broadcast it o'er the land. Thou knowest not which may thrive, The late or early sown, God keeps the precious germ alive, When and wherever strown. We are promised seed-time and harvest although at the present time the cold, wet weather does not give promise of an early spring, yet we believe our toil will not be in vain. The garden vegetables which were planted two weeks ago are peeping out of the soil. Peas are doing well in spite of the cold winds and rains of the past week. On the 6th inst., a white frost appeared, however we think the buds on the fruit trees which are nearly in bloom will not be damaged by it. A life experience fails to recall a season in which the cherry trees did not bloom by the 6th of May. Apple trees are usually in full bloom by the first week in May, but this year seems to be that May will be deferred until June 1st, when a great change will take place in the weather. Early potatoes usually planted by the 20th of April, are this year only just about ready to go into the ground. Can any one remember an equally late Spring? This being the year for us to expect a supply of apples we are quite hopeful, as last year they were few, and very poor. Grass fields are looking well, and the beautiful shade of green that meets the eye on every hand is delightful to behold. Our meadows are quite well supplied with water just now, as small lakes are visible everywhere. The house-cleaning department are desiring more sunshine for their accommodation, as their work is much retarded by such cold winds and pouring rains, but patience and perseverance willovercome all obstacles, and house renovating will be accomplished sometime. �Health, the greatest blessing we can desire, now prevails with our family, thanks to the giver of every good and perfect gift. Maria Witham. Ayer, Mass. May, 1893. I indokse the worthy sentiments of our good and worthy Elder Isaac Anstatt. The harvest is great and the laborers few, and this calls for a strong faith and a greater testimony. In days long gone by it was this strong faith and trust in an Almighty Power, that doeth all things well, that drew souls by the power of faith and conviction to see and to know the principles of truth. The Believers in Christ's Second Appearing became a strong power among mankind, and the blessings of heaven rested upon them, and the gifts of the THE MANIFESTO. 147 spirit were the food that fed the immortal part. O that this same faith may be revived and the same trust in prayer bring again those Pentecostal days, when strong and powerful minds will be gathered to the faith. I envy no quality of mind, nor genius, power, wit or fancy, as I do a strong religious faith in the true principles of righteousness. Faith is an emanation from God and is manifest through the moral and spiritual faculties. Faith like love casteth out fear. It is faith that says, 'Our Father who art in heaven, Thy will be done on earth.' O that our eyes may be open to see and to know the worth of this strong and noble faith. What peace of mind it will bring,�what consolation it will bestow. It will bring to us the same increase that it did to our fathers. Spring is with us. Our garden is ploughed and some seed is in the ground. Potatoes are being planted on the farm. Andrew Barrett. Shirley, Mass. May, 1893. The season is very backward. Peas put in about a month ago, give little promise of being ready to pick on the 7th of June, a thing that has been done in Shirley. We are having colds here to some extent and are looking for more genial weather with anxiety. The swallows have come, and shortly the bobolink and oriole will try to make us glad. Have we not enough to make us so any way? Gloom and despondency will not help us, so let us enjoy the good of to-day, each day for itself; and live hopefully, thankfully, and trustingly for the morrow. John WMteley. Canterbury, N. H. May, 1893. If steady, unbroken progress is the endeavor of every Christian, it is especially so for us who profess to follow Christ in the full regeneration. We, Brethren and Sisters, are called to a much greater soul work than we are apt to realize. Every member of the household residing within the walls of our Zion home, should at the present time especially look well to the foundation on which he stands, and upon which he is building. Unless the fruits of our daily lives are such as will merit the blessing of God we shall sooner or later be branded as unprofitable servants. Mother Ann, Father William, Father James, and all the other honored witnesses of God's last dispensation, proclaimed on the housetops that we as a people are called to build up a spiritual temple, in whose hearts God might come and dwell. There is no comparison between a beautiful home with conveniences for all possible material comfort without spiritual life, and the humblest dwelling where peace, harmony, and the love of God reigns, and where whole-souled selfabnegation excludes every vestige of selfishness. That we may all be induced to weigh ourselves in the gospel balances, making up light weights before we are weighed in those balances by God and found wanting, is my earnest and wrestling prayer. Our spring work has begun by vigorously taking hold of plow handles in our gardens. We are also beginning to think of our Hamamelis business for the season, and of our spring medicine Sarsaparilla. In this connection we refer to a recent pleasing incident; viz., the arrival at our office from the last Mechanics' Fair held at Boston of a beautifully executed Diploma, awarded us for the general excellence and utility of our handiwork, exhibited last fall at the fair. On reading the discriminating tribute of the judges of the fair we were induced to look up with some degree of interest a previous Diploma which was awarded us by the judges and committee of chemicals of the Mechanics' Fair held in Boston in 1847, for our Compound Concentrated Sarsaparilla, prepared by our late much esteemed brother, Dr. Corbett. I ought to say that this carefully prepared medicine of superlative excellence still stands at the head 148 THE MANIFESTO. and is far away up over the like preparation that finds a ready sale in these days of indefatigable advertising. At the present time it is not the best, but the best advertised which secures the patronage of unwary sufferers from ills that unhealthy flesh is heir to. Albert Evans. North Family.

Had Home Notes been written one week earlier we should have said,�winter lingers and spring is nowhere. Now, at this date, May 12, summer is here, with thermometer at 110 deg. However, our weathers are so very freaky, it may all be what one little one styled a ' 'pop'' by the time it is printed, and we be left to wonder if the tiny life germs of the vegetable kingdom can possibly develop in such cold, uncongenial environments. Under these and similar conditions, the promise that 'Seed-time and harvest shall never fail,' is our star of hope. Two hundred feet of rubber hose have been in use to convey water where pipes were frozen in dairy, kitchens, and toilet rooms. Some have thawed voluntarily since the advent of a warmer atmosphere, so those who are expecting to dig more or less this summer, to lay more tubing, will be grateful for so much assistance from the elements. The maple syrup harvest proved an average one and very nice. We have broken our record for good health which prevailed through the cold season. Nearly every one has participated, to some degree, in a disease which has made sneezing and coughing continually heard in the land; weak knees, aching muscles, and a general feeling of collapse, lias been the complaint. If the same amount of union could only be as apparent in a good cause, we might see the effect of concerted action, to our profit. A deal of kindness and patience was shown by those who cared for the afflicted. 'Angels in the way,' are all such, as really as when life's little day hath ebbed out, and we meet for the last memorial meeting to speak good words. Why do we not speak them now, and why do words that censure find utterance, so much more easily than those that commend? This is a subject worth studying, for we all want to bear good tidings, as messengers of love in God's house, and there is ample chance for all, however cramped by circumstances, if we bear in memory the following comforting lines. 'A smile can glorify a clay, A word new hope impart; The least disciple need not say I have no alms to give away, If love be in the heart.' Mary Ella BriggS. North Family. Mav, 1893. Combined with the arranging of this number of our Home Notes, is the wish that we had more varied and interesting items to line into our meagre compilation of home doings; variety of topics being the spice of social intercourse, as are a variety of subjects the relishable spice of literature, but with the grand truth ever before us, ''A contented mind is the richest of gifts,' and having passed triumphantly through the severe winter without any serious results either to person or property, we have abundant reasons for expressing thankfulness to both seen and unseen powers of protective good; living with such cheering realities we believe can but be conducive to mature good results. All nature gives ample evidence of growth, ever new, yet ever of the same basic life-giving elements; and from its voluminous life we can cull many a lesson teaching us to do likewise, pass from sameness into newness of growth, of progressive thought. THE MANIFESTO. 149 'Ever changing, ever aiming Toward a higher, better life; lnver learning, ever earning, Is the good Believer's strife.' Practical faith in a regenerative Divinity, prompts personal effort to benefit our fellow beings by continual works of righteousness ; thus finite minds blend in unison with the Infinite. Having a year's supply of wood housed and our maple harvest over, lands are being prepared for the receiving of grains and vegetables. Our winter Dairy has been quite satisfactory, supplying us with an abundance of butter and cream for home use, besides furnishing some two hundred pounds of butter for sale. Each faithful worker in the Lord's vineyard shares our best love and good wishes. George H. Baxter. Sabbathday Lake. May, 1893. As I take up the pen preparatory to writing notes for our beautiful little messenger, I pause and think; what is there to write about? and the good responds. 'Why not enumerate some of the many blessings which we are daily sharing? Surely goodness and mercy have followed us all the days of our lives or since dwelling in the house of God with the faithful followers of Jesus the Christ. We realize in the fullest sense the hundred-fold blessing as we look upon the faces of dearly loved fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers, and do not feel that we have lost anything in separating ourselves from natural ties. We often sing the beautiful refrain: 'O, I thank God for you, my brethren and sisters, My soul overflows with the love I can't express. For you I've forsaken all kindred ties the dearest; Through you I've the promise, full recompense to share; And where you go, I'll go, your people are my people, Your God shall be my God and your interest my care.' It seems good to look upon the sparkling waters of Sabbathday Lake once more after the long time it has been so quietly enclosed in ice, which left the 4th inst. Br. Pliny says the loons came in the next day after the ice left. Just now ploughing and some planting is being done but it is still cold and the ground too wet for much farming. Sisters have not done much on their flower gardens except to sow the Sweet Peas. If we venture out, the wind rises and the rain comes pelting down, thus ending fur the time being all out of door exercises, but we are hoping soon to have brighter days. The summer term of school is already in progress. Sixteen pupils, thus far giving the best of satisfaction. Ada S. CumminffS.
