Sabbathday Lake. May, 1893. As I take up the pen preparatory to writing notes for our beautiful little messenger, I pause and think; what is there to write about? and the good responds. 'Why not enumerate some of the many blessings which we are daily sharing? Surely goodness and mercy have followed us all the days of our lives or since dwelling in the house of God with the faithful followers of Jesus the Christ. We realize in the fullest sense the hundred-fold blessing as we look upon the faces of dearly loved fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers, and do not feel that we have lost anything in separating ourselves from natural ties. We often sing the beautiful refrain: 'O, I thank God for you, my brethren and sisters, My soul overflows with the love I can't express. For you I've forsaken all kindred ties the dearest; Through you I've the promise, full recompense to share; And where you go, I'll go, your people are my people, Your God shall be my God and your interest my care.' It seems good to look upon the sparkling waters of Sabbathday Lake once more after the long time it has been so quietly enclosed in ice, which left the 4th inst. Br. Pliny says the loons came in the next day after the ice left. Just now ploughing and some planting is being done but it is still cold and the ground too wet for much farming. Sisters have not done much on their flower gardens except to sow the Sweet Peas. If we venture out, the wind rises and the rain comes pelting down, thus ending fur the time being all out of door exercises, but we are hoping soon to have brighter days. The summer term of school is already in progress. Sixteen pupils, thus far giving the best of satisfaction. Ada S. CumminffS.
