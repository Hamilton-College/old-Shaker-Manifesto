What is the bearing of a daily cross... What is the bearing of a daily cross to the wearing of an eternal crown? What are sufferings here compared to n joinings hereafter? What is the toil of to-day when we think of the rest of to-morrow? What the grief of to-night, when joy expectant cometh with the morning? What is death now, in anticipation of immortality? Trial, pain, labor, sorrow and death all 1 ave their opposites, for the law of compensation is immutable. A. W.
