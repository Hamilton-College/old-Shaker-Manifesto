As you can not throw a ball against a wall... As you can not throw a ball against a wall, even in the darkest night without being hit by its rebound;ï¿½so you can not project the most secret hatred toward another without sooner or later receiving the rebound rudely against yourself; of the curse you sent from you. Your ignorance of this will not sci'een you one bit as to results. Oliver C. Hampton.
