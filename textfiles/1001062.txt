Pray and watch PRAY AND WATCH. The body of our prayer is the sum of our duty; and as we must ask of God whatsoever we need, so we must watch and labor for all that we ask. Every petition to God is a rule for our life; a precept for our conduct; perpetual monition to duty. By what we require of God, we see what he requires of us.-Jeremy Taylor'.
