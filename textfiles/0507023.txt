Spirituality. The Apostle Paul said: ' To be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.' Those words are as true to-day as when spoken. So far as the mind expands to receive wisdom and knowledge from the Divine Source, so far does the soul incline to heavenly things, to drink of living waters, and to receive the treasures of immortality. Life, light and love abide with the spiritually minded. In true consecration there is peace which the world cannot give. Earthly things, however beautiful they may appear to the outward senses, perish with the using, and pass away. Heavenly things abide forever.
