A Tribute to the Memory of Sister Eliza Abbott. Ada Cummings. Just in the early dawn of day An angel came unseen And bore our loved one far away To groves of evergreen. We heard not a sound of his footsteps fleet, Not a gleam of his robes saw we, The sufferer hailed his coming swee They sped out silently. The hands whichfourscore years hare toiled We folded on her breast, A peaceful calm came o'er her face Which tells of heavenly rest. We gently lay the body down With tender thoughtful cave, And turn our eyes to God above Where loving angels are. A mansion of eternal rest She claims in yon fair land, She goes to meet the loved and blest, Of Heaven's happy land. A glimpse of that bright holy port We feign would catch to-day And see the joy, the love, the crown, Our loved one shares alway. We're told that all is summer there, That rest and peace sublime Eeigns throughout the kingdom fair In that sweet heavenly clime. And would we share that blest abode A home beyond the skies? We too must pass the pearly gate To enter Paradise. Rest on in peace ! good faithful one Thy years of toil are o'er. Rest on in joy! thy work is done. We see thy face no more. West Gloucester, Me.
