TO THE MANIFESTO. REBECCA A. SHEPARD. Dear little Manifesto ; How could we give thee up ? Even if there were no other reason, than to continue the sweet interchange of thought and feeling among the different Societies of Believers, the universal Brother-hood. I love to read it and enjoy communion in its pages ; I love to see the varied expression of sentiment among our Brethren and Sisters. Is it not a bond of union among ourselves? And then added to this, is the one paramount reason, why we should send out the precious gospel truths, which we believe to us are Godgiven. The world at large are needy of them ; and our God '' will not hold us guiltless, ' if we refuse to disseminate them. Some of the words of an ancient missionary hymn are brought forcibly to mind, viz : ' Shall we whose souls are lighted,� By wisdom from on high, Shall we, to men be-nighted, The lamp of life deny? ' O nay, God forbid ! We must 'send out our light.' Then go forth, dear MANIFESTO, and bid the gospel kindred to let their light shine abroad ; say to them do not ' hide it under a bushel; ' but send it forth to the needy and op- pressed. Surely, we feel it is a blessing to us, ought we Jhen, to cease our efforts to dispense it to others? Shall we not rather make some sacrifice, in order to sustain the dear little u Herald of Truth?' I am willing for one, I think, to sacrifice all personal feelings, and contribute my '' mite ' to help sustain thee ; and bid thee 'God-speed' in going forth to the needy abroad, laden with the blessed gospel truths. Go and carry them far and near ; and may the blessing of the Lord attend the writers word; for we know '' though Paul may plant, and Apollos water, God giveth the increase. ' Do we not, each one of mature age certainly owe our efforts, even though they are small, to further the cause of God ? owe it to the human race? And the Sister-hood, to our own sex? We certainly are for 'Woman's rights,' in the best, truest sense of the term. Shall we not then, use our best endeavors to spread the gospel of truth and freedom abroad in the land, the glad tidings that have brought a blessing to us? Thou Herald of Freedom, go and make manifest these things ; teach our race of a higher, purer life, awaiting them,�a nobler existence. Canterbury, N. H.
