Cement for joining metals with nonmetallic substances Cement for joining mentals with nonmetallic substances.â€”To obtain a cement suitable for joining metals and nonmetallic substances, mix liquid glue with a sufficient quantity of wood-ashes to form a thick mass. The ashes should be added in small quantities to the glue while boiling, and constantly stirred. A sort of mastic is thus obtained, which, applied hot to the two surfaces that are to be joined, makes them adhere firmly together. A similar substance may be prepared by dissolving in boiling water 2J lbs. of glue and two ozs. of gum ammoniac, adding in small quantities about 2 ozs. of sulphuric acid.
