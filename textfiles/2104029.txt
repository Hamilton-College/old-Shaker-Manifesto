OUR SORROW. Maria Witham. 'God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.''1 There is muck of sadness and heartpain which is keenly felt when those we love and reverence are called suddenly and unexpectedly from our midst. We may deplore sickness and disease upon ourselves, but this may be borne 'with fortitude if we can see health smiling on the loved countenances around us. Disappointment comes in many forms, and brings its own peculiar smart. But the sorrow deep and lasting that has come upon us. Death has swept from us the walls of strength and power that could illy be spared. While engaged in our daily pursuits, we are startled at the fall of one, then another, loved and beloved from among us. Truly, ' 'Thou hast all seasons for thine own O Death !' We murmur not, it was the commission of a higher power, and we are led to think more of the world where death does not invadeThrough all the heavenly country sowrow and sighing will flee away.
