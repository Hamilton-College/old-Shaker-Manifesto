SELF-DENIAL. J. F. Butler. According to the word and testimony of Jesus Christ, the work of selfdenial is a Christian duty, Matt, xvi., 24, and it is to be exercised in regard to every forbidden indulgence, however pleasant, or presently profitable. He that breaks his own will in everything, and resolutely resists his natural reluctance to prayer and gospel obedience, loves humility and every good work, shows more power than another who can do it with more ease, with this faithfulness we are led to believe that God is well pleased, and will reward us in his own good time by giving us grace to do all these things with a willing heart. But first we must be made truly sensible of the deep corruption of our hearts. See Rom. iii., 23. Then we may use the more violence in prayer and general effort; but if we pray only, and do not resist quickly the propensity of our hearts toward evil, there can never be such a thing as making progress at all. Since the stubbornness of the flesh requires that prayer and conflict go hand in hand, and as one writer truly observes, ''ï¿½Efforts to obtain righteousness are to be made in faith.' Heb. xi., 6. The same is a 'fruit of the spirit, and the gift of God.' 'It purifies the heart, overcomes the snares and temptations of the wond, is productive of good works,' even so, God is faithful to his promises, faithful indeed that calls, warns, and moves our hearts by the promptings of his blessed spirit. O that we were faithful also, punctual and immediate to follow in all things wheresoever he leads. Alfred, Me.
