CHARITY. Charity, chief among the heavenly graces. If there is a people that should disrobe themselves of all self-righteousness, should it not be Believers in Christ's second coming? Principle is the only enduring rock; the voice of Grod in the soul, the only divine voice, the only chart that never leads astray. Why should we with-hold from erring ones the voice of love, a look of tenderness, a word of kindness, a tear of sympathy? These are priceless blessings to the needy and down trodden, and they cost nothing. They are like the dews of heaven upon the parched earth and all those that extend these divine offerings to the sorrowing heart, will beautify and elevate their own souls. North Union, Ohio.
