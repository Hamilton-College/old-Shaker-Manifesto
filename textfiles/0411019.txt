THE RIVER I'm descending the banks of a beautiful river, That flows by the storm beaten island of time ; And I'm watching the waves with their unceasing quiver, That ripple and dance on its bosom sublime. And I'm watching the life-boats, just crossing the river, That follow each other and all disappear, While above the strange music that swells there forever. The call of the boatmen distinctly I hear. I am thinking of friends, who've passed over the river, Those near ones, those dear ones, so blessed to me, Did feelings of dread seize their spirits ? Ah never ! 'Tis the Kiver of Life to those who are free. I am thinking of those who've passed over the river, Whose vestments concealed the dark spirit within ; If true hope was theirs, as an anchor? Nay never I 'Tis the River of Death to souls hid in sin. And, I ask, do I fear to pass over the river? Should the boatman soon call, could I readily sa3% That my soul is prepared to meet Father and Mother? Or would I ashamed and abashed, answer Nay ! Sometime I shall go to the banks of that river, And I shall return from its brink nevermore, Its tide may run cold, yet my soul will not shiver. There's sunshine and rest on the opposite shore.
