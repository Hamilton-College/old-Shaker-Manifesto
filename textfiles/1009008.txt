GOVERNMENT O. P. ' I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts. I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a people.' In the outside world, where sons of Belial roam at large, an armed police is needful for the preservation of order. In Zion —in every branch of Zion— it is the province of the chosen representatives of the divine law-givers, clothed in mantles paternal and maternal, to call the attention of novitiates to the laws written in their hearts. This involves no infringement of individual sovereignty. Every son and daughter of Zion, seeing that the common good, and of course their own good, requires it, sacredly and cheerfully observe the sacred law.
