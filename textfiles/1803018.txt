WHAT HATH THE STRUGGLE AVAILED? Cora C. Vinneo. My heart was weary with sadness, My hands were tired with toil, My eyes saw no sunshine of gladness, My feet trod on rough, sandy soil. I sat alone in mj chamber, While thoughts dark and lonely assailed, And I put to myself this question, What good hath the struggle availed? What bliss hath it brought to my spirit? What clouds hath it chased far away? What reward do my toilings all merit? What gifts will my labors lepay? As I sat alone in my chamber This answer o'er others prevailed, If any wise lesson's been taught thee, Thus far hath the struggle availed. The gayest of hearts oft need sorrow, And tears that are holy must flow, But joy waits the glad coming morrow, And sunshine resplendent will glow. The hands that are weary with toiling, Though oft to the cross they are nailed, [thee, Will accomplish some righteous deeds for Some good that thy works have availed The darkness that rests on thy vision Comes only from shadows within ; Lift up the thin veil, and the sunlight With the glory of peace will shine in. The eye is the light of thy being, Keep its sight to God's blessing unveiled, And then thou wilt see that thy struggles Have many rich conquests availed. Did you say that your feet walked the lonely And rough thorny pathway of woe? There never was yet a road, only That grew thornless roses, you know. If the goal of the blest is worth gaining, Why murmur at trifles you meet? Why don the dark grave clothes of mourning Because the rough thorns pierce your [feet? There is no royal road to progression, There is no starlit pathway to bliss, There are many rewards for true labor; But the sweetest are only in this ; Work nobly and truly for others, [failed, Thougli oft you have tried and have Then, each diligent earnest endeavor Will prove what the strife hath availed.
