A DREAM. By Anna B. Goepper. Not long since, returning from the Office on a gloomy evening, after having spent a pleasant and profitable visit with Elder O. C. Hampton, (He should rightly be named after Gladstone, 'the grand old man,') I sat down in my old arm chair to reflect upon our conversation. By and by the clock on the bureau struck nine, and being somewhat weary I rose to retire, and as usual, I knelt down and prayed, making new resolutions on this last night of the old year for the next day and for the .New Year. I had a singular, beautiful dream which I consider worth relating. Suddenly the sky turned a peculiar blue, the sun shone out in almost dazzling brightness and the trees, thick with green foliage were filled with songbirds of every conceivable shape, plumage and color. Honeysuckles and brilliant, crimson flowers, and gracefully waving vines grew in profusion all around and the air was rife with their fragrance. The roses were blooming and the lillies bending low, daisies, white as snow, pansies, gold and purple and on their leaves bright drops rested which a fountain threw around with a melodious, cool sound, rising up and falling gaily all the while. I sat among the flowers, wondering how the buds could know what form and hue to grow and when to burst forth into blossom, when a wild strain of music floated on the air, music sweeter than the birds warbled, or the fountain played. Among the lillies and tulips, whose colors were that of the rainbow, were forms of rare beauty, and the sunlight softly rested on each divine face. They were all Shaker Sisters, but I only recognized one, that was Sister Emily Hampton. I was so overjoyed at seeing her that I burst into a flood of tears. She smiled, and laid her hand in blessing upon my shoulder, while in her other hand was a large crown of pure, white lillies. I could hear her say very distinctlyï¿½'For if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.' I called aloud for Sister May Ruth for I wished she might see Sister Emily, also, in her vision of loveliness, but the moment I spoke those lovely beings all vanished and Sister Emily with the rest, but before she passed from view she waved her hand gently and smilingly bade me 'wish the whole household a happy New Year, but remember me to Elder Oliver.'
