VALUE OF AMMONIA Ammonia will remove finger marks from paint, where there would otherwise have to be a good deal of scrubbing with soap, which takes the paint oft too. Ammonia is useful to wash all the brushes that are used in a household. Nothing will cleanse greasy sinks, pans or scrubbing brushes so well. A teaspoonful in a basin of water will make hair brushes beautifully white. Take care not to let the back of brushes dip below the surface ; rinse them with clear, warm water, and put them in a sunny window to dry. A small bottle of ammonia is also useful for the wardrobe. Wet a little sponge with it and you can take out most any spot.
