THE MODEL PRAYER. By Lizzie D. Horton. WE may define the beautiful prayer of our Savior, as the true model of prayer. 'After this manner,' he says,tracing the lines on which we should frame our petitions. The words so wonderfully and beautifully combined, counteract the selfishness with which we often express our desires and heighten our aspirations, to comprehend the welfare of the whole world. One grand feature of this prayer, is the word 'our,' which sets aside the ceremony of the priest alone in the holy place and the people in the outer court and illustrates the one faith and one baptism through Jesus Christ, and the worship of one God for all nations, that with one voice in public praise and private prayer, we worship our heavenly Father. 'Which art in heaven,' implies that all our aspirations, desires and affections, should ascend above the earth. In the words,'Give us this day our daily bread,' we are taught to recognize our dependence upon Divine guidance for all our temporal and spiritual needs. Linkt with this invocation we pray,'forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,' asking also for deliverance from evil; not to be saved from the consequences of our sin, but to be kept free from the indifference in which all failure originates. If we pray sincerely and in our daily lives we hallow his name, and subject ourselves unto his truth, wre shall be establishing within and around us the kingdom of Christ. East Canterbury, N. H.
