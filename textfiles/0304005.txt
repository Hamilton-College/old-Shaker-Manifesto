LINCOLN A writer in the New York Times, alter a careful reading of Lamon's Life of Lincoln, makes the following deduction : 'Mr. Lincoln was an infidel â€”positive, absolute, thorough. He was entirely without religion; and not only without religion, but without any faith upon which religion of any kind could be founded. He believed in none of the doctrines, or even the facts, upon which the Christian religion rests. The man who was always the champion of the poor and the oppressed, who was ever ready for personal self-sacrifice, whose famous Gettysbur^ oration breathed the ven^ essential spirit of the enthusiasm of humanity, had no faith at all in any divine revelation, none whatever in the Divinity of Jesus Christ, none, consequently, in the authority of his teachings.' If some of Mr. Lincoln's devout friends had known all this five years ago, they would have looked upon his tragic end in the light of a dispensation. After all, it seems that all the Christian virtues may be linked with unbelief and paganism, for undoubtedly, Lincoln was a kind-hearted, generous, benevolent man.
