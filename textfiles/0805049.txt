Keep Borax in the House In the laundry it is economical, as it saves both labor and soap, and is really cheaper than the latter. For blankets and other large articles it is especially valuable, and in all cases the use of a little borax will save half the labor when articles are much soiled. It is perfectly effectual in driving away red ants, cockroaches, etc., if sprinkled around on pantry shelves, or put in small quantities on paper and placed in the runways of the insects. Borax is also of great value for toilet uses. For removing dandruff and cleansing the hair it is unequaled. It is also a good remedy for rough face and chapped hands. Its application to wounds, sores, bruises, sprains, etc., proves very salutary and is often the only remedy required, even in severe cases. Indeed, borax is one of the best remedies for many ailments in our whole hygiene, and for that reason alone it should be kept ready for use when wanted. There are many other uses for borax which I need not specify, but those I have mentioned aro alone enough to satisfy any family of the value of the article.â€” The People
