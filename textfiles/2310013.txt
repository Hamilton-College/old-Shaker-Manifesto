It is questionable if any religionist of the present day can state more concisely and more clearly the position that a Christian mind should occupy, than did the good apostle when giving instruction to the Brethren in Corinth. It was the life interest of Jesus and his early followers, to become spiritually-minded men, although surrounded by the cares and burdens that are consequent upon a life in this world. This Christian experience soon afforded them the privilege of being able to express themselves Avith a bold assurance relative to their power of gospel protection, as they walked among the children of men. Life to them was very much as life is to us. There was no roseate path in which to walk that should lead them to their anticipated spiritual home among the pure in heart. Thorns and thistles were as common then as now, and the anxieties arising in regard to the accumulation of earthly goods were quite like those which are experienced to-day. This became, at one time, ,so pronounced, that Jesus carefully advised hia brethren not to be over anxious about what they should eat and drink, nor concerning the clothes which they should wear. Eatinoand drinking and even the clothing may occupy, at this day, the greater part of the time of both saints and sinners, very much to their spiritual loss and to their ability to do good, and the occasional ministration of a Teacher like Jesus would prove quite beneficial. The life of self-denial into which the disciples had been called, was away from that of the world, and under the discipline of the cross of Christ. They had learned the value of a Christian experience by 'living soberly, righteously and godly in this present world.' This was the key to that success which afforded them an overcoming power and enabled them to walk uprightly among men. It became their THE MANIFESTO. privilege as men of God to do God's will in all things, and to accept the blessings which grew out from this new order- of life. They had learned that 'to be spiritually minded is life and peace, but to be carnally minded is death.' Have we not learned that same lesson, and also learned that these spiritual attainments are the legitimate fruit of a well-ordered life? 'Yea, and we have learned that to be spiritually minded is indeed a great attainment. It is the new baptism into the life of God. It is the entering into the resurrection order; that order into which Jesus had risen, as he says :� 'I am the resurrection.' Into this life of spirituality and into this order of the resurrection, the Christian disciple must find his place, or he is quite sure to enter the ranks of the carnally minded, and follow after those who throng the broad way. Baptized into a spiritual resurrection, how can the disciple avoid putting off the former conversation that belongs to the old inheritance, and then learn as did the apostle to have our conversation honest before men, and then rais^e it to the spiritual standard in which we now profess to live. Too much care can not be exercised over the language that we use. Careless words and slang phrases are becoming so common that it is only by a daily discipline that one can .avoid their use. Although we may not accord any very great degree of spirituality to King David or to many of his psalms, yet even here we may learn a lesson of which we need not be ashamed. He says,�'Because thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.' It is for this same reason, for this gentle,,loving kindness that our conversation should be concerning the new heavens and the new earth wherein the spirit of righteousness and peace should ever dwell.
