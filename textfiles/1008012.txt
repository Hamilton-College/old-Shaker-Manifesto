Elder G. A. Lomas: Kind Friend... Titusville, June 28, 1880 Elder G. A. Lomas : Kind Friend :â€”On turning backward the leaves of memory, I find that my subscription for the Shaker has expired, and I hasten to renew ; feeling that I cannot be content to dispense with the monthly visits of that dear little pamphlet, containing as it does so much of the ' spirit of true religion ;' so much of ''peace on earth, good will to man ' and woman. This is the fourth year it has been a visitant in our family and each number seems to be an improvement on the last. A good example of the great '' law of eternal progress ' which I as a spiritualist believe in. Every year for the last five, since I read Charles Nordhoff's 182 THE SHAKES MANIFESTO. book, I have had a desire to visit one of your societies and become better acquainted with your mode of life. After meeting Elder Frederick Evans at the Lake last September, andliearing him explain some of the points of Shaker belief, I have had a still greater wish to know more of your social life by actual acquaintance, which is the only reliable information those in the outside world can gain of you. I was in hopes then to have visited you soon, but circumstances do not seem to favor me yet. ' But we know not what a day may bring forth.' I wish to say here how much I was pleased to see how grandly and nobly you and your societies also, stood by D. M. Bennett all through his unjust imprisonment and persecution. I thank you all kindly for it in the name of humanity and liberality. Enclosed please find subscription in stamps. Most respectfully, Mrs. L. T. R. Aikin
