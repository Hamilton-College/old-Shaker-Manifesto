SOLILOQUY. By Mary B. Sprague. 'TXT^HILE seated in our pleasant, quiet room one Sabbath afternoon inV V tently reading from our little messenger of light and truth, The Manifesto and meantime realizing how clearly my duty was portrayed on its simple pages, I queried whether there were not among its readers in the wide world some others who, like myself were touched by its message of truth. Are there not some, I soliloquized, who are prepared to forsake the world, to leave its turmoil and strife, which renders life so miserable? And would they not do so if they only know how to take the first step toward real happiness? Let me assure you dear readers that there is a band of devoted Christian workers in this land of religious liberty who can give you the key to solid happiness: whose whole interest is enlisted in promoting peace on earth by exalting in daily life the practical purity which the Savior taught. Permit me therefore to reiterate the question? Are there not some souls who are willing to engage in a cause by which one may become spiritually elevated? Who from the requirements of its noble, yet humble position, are able to help lift others out of the thralldom of sin, which has such a strong tendency downward? I seem to hear one reply; 'I would�but�;' Another; 'I cannot�because;' The third; 'I surely would�if;' Ah me! how similar are these excuses to those made in the days of our Savior. Luke ix., 59-62. You perchance, may think such very close questions, and such as do not concern any one outside of yourselves. To some extent I know that one is allowed to be master of his own business but fully understanding as I do, the natural resistance to such intrusion, I yet avow, that my heart is so filled with love for humanity, that I would be happy to persuade even one of my fellow-kindred to enter the same self-denying way which I once loathed. Yea, I would entreat all who have not known and felt the true love of God to the extent that it saves from sin daily, to accept the means right speedily whereby this love may be secured. I was once an alien, a wanderer in darkness but after receiving and obeying light, found God's forgiving love and through prayer and supplication was finally led to a Shaker Community. Here I learned, as I had never learned before, the way to obtain that rest and peace for which my soul had fasted and prayed. That peace which is promised to all who 'bear the yoke' of Christ which I can assure you by experience is easy, while the burden becomes light, as I put Christ fully on. Having come into possession of peace of mind consequent upon surrendering all to God's work, as preached through his Christ it has created within me a desire so to act as to help some other one into the same happy condition. For this very reason I invite you to investigate the life and principles 32 THE MANIFESTO. of the Shaker or Millennial Church. If consistent so to do, make us a visit, thus learn for yourselves the blessedness of seeking to create heaven upon earth. I am not very far advanced on life's journey but far enough to feel the necessity of improving time unto God. Our Savior prayed,�'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as in heaven.' Mark vi., 10. Was this prayer to be only a dream for the future? Nay, my friends, it is a possibility of the present. I am witnessing its fulfillment daily and long to tell the glad story, that the 'salvation of the Lord may cover the earth, even as the waters cover the sea.' I appeal to your hearts while I say : Ye sin-sick, ye truth seekers, ye who hunger and thirst after righteousness and can not obtain present salvation, know that there is a way opened, through divine revelation, upon the earth, where the will of God is made manifest in purity and truth, through human agency, even as it is in heaven.
