Alfred., Maine. June, 1893. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½Last month there was so little of interest to write for Home Notes that I thought I would not occupy the space in our valuable little monthly messenger that would be better occupied by others. When I saw there was not space in the last number for the piece of music I was glad that it was not my scribbling that shut it out. The June Manifesto was very interesting. We were especially pleased with Elder Isaac's article, 'Halt and Consider.' It is a true blast from the gospel trumpet. May it cause us to consider well how near we are living the Christ life in this day of his second appearing. If we are living to please ourselves rather than for the good of humanity, not so did our Mother or the worthy founders of our Society live. I believe that every true and earnest worker in Zion feels as does Eld. Isaac, that it is time to awaken, and come forth and proclaim the mercy and goodness of God. Father James said that where the testimony was permitted to die out, there the life and power of the gospel would die out also. May this never be the case with us. Br. Benjamin's 'Journey to the Land of Canaan,' was a very interesting one. May it be many years before he journeys to that other land of Canaan. I presume the experience of all the Eastern Societies is much like our own; a wet, cold May which very much delayed getting the seed into the ground. Yet it was got there and has come up, and the weeds have come up with the good seed, which our workmen are removing with their hoes, for we can not afford to let them grow together till the time of harvest. Our fruit trees bloomed fairly well and the grass never looked better. Fannie Casey.
