FISHING. Alonzo G. Hollister. Jesus compared the reign of the heavens to a net cast into the sea. Men do a great deal of fishing in the sea, and all the fish tliey take out of the sea, are rendered incapable of propagating their kind afterward. Uo those who argue that the world will be depopulated if the gospel of Christ prevail, which is the gospel of virgin purity and continence, also object to fishing iu the sea for the same reason ? Do they have any fears that the sea will become depopulated, by all that men can do, or that the fish thereof will not fulfill the purpose of their creation ? If not, then is the fear that the gospel of virgin Brotherhood and Sisterhood will run the world out proved a selfish fear, and objections based thereon have not the least foundation in principle. Jesus said he would make his disciples 'fishers of men.' All the fish which his fishermen take and prepare as subjects for the heaven of eternal life, can no more propagate a carnal, worldly offspring, for they have become eunuchs, spiritually speaking, 'by means of the kingdom of heaven.' Will the earth therefore cease to be peopled? It* will if God so designs, and men cannot prevent it. If such is not the design of the Author of the gospel, no more fish will be inclosed by the net than are required for the Lord's use, and there is no more danger that the earth will become depopulated thereby, than that the sea will be deprived of all its fish by fishing. A net allows little fish enough to keep the sea stocked, to pass through. It is the animal or psychic man that propagates animal life, and while employed thus, he can receive only a rudimental knowledge of spiritual laws and principles. Not till he is ready to seek and practice the truths of the higher, spiritual uses of life, will these rudimental knowledges germinate as seeds and grow into a preparation for the gospel net. Until such is the case, he is not wanted. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
