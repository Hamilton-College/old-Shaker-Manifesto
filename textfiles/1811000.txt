SPIRITUAL LIFE. Giles B. Avery. Disuse would congeal the life-blood of the heart, and dry up the arteries, the rivers of spiritual life. Stagnation would curdle the blood in the veins! Precisely so the sources of spiritual life ! The exercise and proper use of the spiritual powers in the service of God, is the primary source of their life. The spiritual heart must pulsate with inspirations,�its life-blood. The spiritual arteries,�rivers of the waters of life, mutt be unclogged, that the life currents may flow on to the veiaous system�the little rills of spiritual love, sympathy and interest, that permeate the whole tissue of the soul's structure, and give it vitality, and round up its form, giving it Gospel grace and beauty. But, the interested may inquire, How is this life to be attained ? Man can only plant, till and water, and operate to keep in circulation what God hath provided ; it is God who giveth the increase. This is true, but God hath presented to souls garners filled with spiritual provisions sufficient for both present and future spiritual needs. Man has but to exercise his powers to appropriate their stores ; and this duty is not a mystery, except to persons, who, by confining their interests and attention to material things, have become oblivious to spiritual conditions, who take little thought and concern about their soul's welfare, and exist, in this present world, a product of material combination, as a plant is a product of the soil. But, that spirit who is alive to the sympathies that unite soul to soul, and the soul of man to his Creator, reaches forth its spiritual hands in prayer, to grasp after soul food ; it pours out its yearning desires in positive flows of hungering, to the powers above, as the ocean's waves kiss the shore when driven by a powerful wind. Yet, the conditions needful to obtain the answer to prayers, are, to live daily iu firm obedience to known laws of righteousness ; thus living, the soul floats upon the rivers of the favor and power of God. But, man has extensively used his reasoning powers balefully, or neglected to use them at all, and, instead of applying himself wisely to appropriate the bountiful provisions God hath bestowed, has starved his soul in the midst of boundless spiritual providences, for lack of exertion to utilize and elaborate God's blessings, has wantonly wasted them, by disregarding the laws of simple use, or poisoned them with adulter- ous influences and impulses contradictory to spiritual truth, until soul life pulsations cease, and all the little rills of spirit life are dried up, their channels empty as the storm spent cloud, perhaps, dusty as the burning desert. But what is spirit life ? What are its resources? The present state of mankind in the worldly order is such, that, to the multitude, a soul life is almost an anomaly. Spirit! What is it? Is there a human spirit that exists when the physical body it once inhabited is laid in the tomb ? These are even questions in the minds of millions ! But this is an abnormal condition of humanity, a disease,�the fruit of transgression of the laws of our being. The normal state of the human family niaiutains as real consciousness of spiritual, as of material existence, and is as really cognizant of the presence of the angel throng, who people the eternal worlds, as the earthly man is cognizant of the myriads who inhabit the domain of earth, and, in this normal spiritual condition, the spirit man would be as conscious of its relations to God, and as open to communications from Him, through mediating intelligencies ; therefore, the present state of masses of the human race, who are so blind to even an existence of the spiritual body, after the death of the physical, is the result of the sins of the race against the laws of God, producing a moral and spiritual atrophy, a paralysis often terminating in soul death. The soul of man is an effluence from the All Father and Mother of the Universe, an etherial idiocracy, the vital life of which is the inspirations of the Father and Mother God. This is spirit life, and its resources are the wellsprings of Divinity. To draw soul life inspirations from this fountain, s^ouls must live so purely, so strictly in the light of truth, as to keep a relation to, and knowledge of, the gift of God, as Jesus suggested to the woman of Samaria, at Jacob's well; thus, 'If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee 'give me to drink' thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.' 'And whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst' (for sinful pleasures) 'but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life.' And Jesus further gave the Samaritan woman to understand that the formal worship of tljio sinner, should cease from Samaria and from Jerusalem, thus. 'But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth ; for the Father seeketh such to worship Him.' Thus, 'to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.' And souls who so live as to keep their joining to the Divine life, will not be found faltering by the Gospel way-side, uor halting between two opinions, whether to serve God or Mammon ; they will not be circumstantial travelers in the way of God, that is, conclude to try to go in it if all the circumstances of surrouuding conditions and influences are favoring their journey ; if persons in whom they are greatly interested are firm in faith, true in principle, steadfast in righteousness, but if not, conclude to go back to the beggarly elements of the world with them. Zion's pillars of strength, Heaven's benefactors, the Saviors that the proph- et Obadiah declared 'should come up on Mount Zion, to judge the House of Esau, (a figure of those who sell their birthright inheritance to the blessings of God, for carnal pleasure,) these are souls who stand for truth like a rock in the midst of the sea, whom no waves of opposition, no fawnings of carnal affection and weakness will turn away from Zion's pathway. When the faith of the Believer is firm and unshaken, when his obedience to the Gospel principles is true and persistent, his spiritual status will be wholesome, then the power of God will be his savior and redeemer from all temptations and weakness of the fleshly life. The gospel of Christ is a call to repentance, to a reform of life, a new and true life ; but those who reject this call, there remains no open door of hope for salvation, redemption and Heaven. Mt.
