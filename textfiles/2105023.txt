Sabbathday Lake, Me. April 18. Editok of Manifesto:�The usual routine of our home has been much broken for the past month. On the 14th of March, Sister Lavina Mclntire fell and broke her hip. After suffering severe pain for three weeks and four days she passed over the Eiver, Wednesday morning 8th hist. Gladly doth her soul surrender, 'Not my will, but thiue be done,' Was her last sweet prayer, so tender, Uttered at life's setting sun. One by one our friends are leaving, For their homes on yonder shore. One by one their souls immortal Dwell with angels evermore. The snow has nearly all disappeared. A few patches of white are seen, telling of the cold season that has just left us. At present it is mud, mud and some rain. We are glad that spring has come and:� We welcome the springtime the green on the hills The glad bursts of rapture, in far woedland rills The soft gentle showers, the loud dashing rain; Indeed we are happy to greet them again. Our teams have hauled 121.960 ft. of logs from the woods besides the usual supply of fire wood which the Brethren are at present employed in sawing, using a portable engine. Should you come to our home you would find us with our hands at work, and we trust that our hearts would be to God as taught by our blessed Mother Ann Lee. A. S. C.
