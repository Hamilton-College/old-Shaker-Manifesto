The Virtues of Borax. â€”The excellent washerwomen in Holland and Belgium, who 'get up' their linen so beautifully white, use refined borax as a fine washing powder instead of soda, in the proportion of one large handful of powder to about ten gallons of boiling water. They save in spap nearly one-half. All the large washing establishments adopt the same mode. For laces, cambrics, etc., an extra quantity of the powder is used; for crinolines, requiring to be made stiff, a strong solution is necessary. Borax being a neutral salt, does not in the slightest degree injure the texture of the linen. Its effect is to soften the hardest water, and, therefore, it should be kept on every toilet table. To the taste it is rather sweet; it is used for cleaning the hair, is an excellent dentifrice and in hot countries it is used, in combination with tartaric acid and bi-carbonate of soda, as a cooling beverage. Good tea cannot be made with hard water. All water may be made soft by adding a teaspoonful of borax powder to an ordinary sized kettle of water, in which it should boil. The saving in the quantity of tea used will be at least one-fifth.
