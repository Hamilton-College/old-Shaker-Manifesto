TESTIMONIES. 'The Spirit of Christ is a tender spirit, and we ought to be, careful not to grieve it.' Iu speaking of the youth Father James said, 'You are the branches of a good tree, and I can see the branches flourish and grow. Remember you are not the root, but the branches. It is my privilege to speak against all evil, and when I cannot speak against it, I will breathe against it.'� John Warner. In the winter of 1788 two Brethren and eight Sisters residing in the town of Harvard, Mass., went to Watervliet, N. Y., to see Mother Ann and the Elders. One sleigh accommodated the whole company. Deep snow drifts in some places and the ground quite bare iu others, made the journey long and wearisome. In some instances most of the company would leave the sleigh and walk a short distance, but the meltiug snows of one day would so wet their garments that they became very uncomfortable, while on the next day their garments would be so frozen as to prevent them from enjoying much satisfaction on the trip. They arrived at Watervliet before the rising of the sun, having for the last twenty-four hours interrupted their journey only to feed their horses and to partake of some refreshments provided for the company. Klder Calvin Harlow met these friends from Harvard, and falling upon his knees, said,�'Dear friends, I have been praying for you all night.' When they reached t'.e house iu which Mother Ann dwelt, she opened the door and came out to see them. 'You are the \~ery ones,' said she, 'that I have borne on my heart and soul all through this night.' Mother Ann aud the whole company th?,n kneeled aud returned thanks to God for their preservation. Jemima Blanchard of Harvard, Mass., who was one of the above company, related these circumstances. At a time when some teachers were to be sent out on a mission, Mother Ann said to them,�'Take your swords and be sure that they have two edges, lest after you have preached to others, you then become castaways.'
