Washing floors Washing Floors.—Floors should never be flooded with water, as is the too-common practice. Use as little water as practicable. Avoid hot soap-suds — it softens the boards and renders them rough ; disintegrates the grain of the wood, causing splinters. Oil (or if desirable on old floors, paint) and wipe them with a wrung-out mop in warm water, and your floor will be smooth and hard, and last longer than if drenched with water, or the frequent use of soap. Save your floors, your soap, your muscles and your feelings.
