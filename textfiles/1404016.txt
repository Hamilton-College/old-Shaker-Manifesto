WASTE NOT THY LIFE. Waste not thy life on doubts and fears, But do the work before you, As though there were no future years To cast a shadow o'er you. The past is gone, and let it go, Now is the time to labor; Work hard, and if thou canst, bestow Help on thy needy neighbor. O'er ills which may thy path beset, When thou hast lost thy power, Thou hast no time to fume and fret While youth is still thy dower. The sun will shine and clouds will come, And nature alter never, Long as this earth remains thy home, So do thy best endeavor. Fear not thy fate�fear not to die� For how canst thou arrange it? The end was fashioned from on high, No power on earth can change it. Work while 'tis day, cast fear away, Till comes life's peaceful even; Let conscience guide thine acts alway, And leave the rest to Heaven. Francis S. Smith.
