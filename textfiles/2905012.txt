Sabbathday Lake, Me. April, 1809. The robins gave us a welcome concert on the first inst. Although they made their appearance on 'All Fools' Day,' their notes were the welcome announcement of spring to us who have been surrounded by the drifts of snow for the past months. An old orchard which has stood for scores of years is now being laid low, and the gnarled trees that for a century, at least, have furnished the tables with the nice, spicy apples, are soon to be converted into fire-wood. We are glad to see the unsightly place cleared and to feel that new fruit trees are soon to take the places of the old ones. On the 8th inst. the family were surprised to find radishes on the the table, which were grown in the greenhouse in 40 days. Work in that department is pressing, just now. The hum of the wood saw has already commenced. Logs at the mill will soon be made into lumber. While the Brethren are thus employed, the skillful fingers of the Sisters are busy fashioning the pretty boxes, brushes and baskets to sell during the summer months. Housecleaning and culinary work also need immediate attention and there is no place for a drone in our hive of busy bees. 'O friends whose hearts still keep their prime Whose bright example warms and cheers, Ye teach us how to smile at Time, And set to music all his years.' Ada S. Cummhif/s.
