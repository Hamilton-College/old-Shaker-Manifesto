Making And Using Manure .—No man is a truly successful farmer who allows his land to grow poor while he is cultivating it. He may make money for the time and put it in his pocket ; but he does so at the cost of his successors. He takes something from the soil and gives nothing in return. This cannot be continued without beggary of both land and occupant. Writers and speakers tell of the 'inexhaustible' fertility of the West. I never hear that word without being annoyed. We might as well say that we can consume a part and still have the whole: not only that, but keep on doing so for an indefinite term of years, and still have the whole remain to us. This mistaken idea of an inexhaustible soil has already cost the West a great sum of money, and will inevitably cost many millions more. Much has already been done to put an end to this ruinous system of forever taking from the soil and putting nothing back. Much remains still to be done.— Tribune.
