WHO IS A CHRISTIAN? Alonzo G. Hollister. Whoever does the character-forming works of Christ. ' He that believeth on me, the works that I do, shall he do also, and greater.' What is the baptism of Christ ? It is a baptism of the Holy Spirit and sufferings which attend bearing the 'Cross of Christ, whereby his followers are crucified to the world and the world to them.' In Christ, there 'is one faith, one Lord, and one baptism. ' John testified, 'I indeed baptize you with water, but he that cometh after me, shall baptize with the Holy Spirit, and with fire.' John was not a Christian in the sense of being a follower of Jesus. The least in the kingdom of heaven was greater thau he, because he was not in the kingdom, and he never entered it while in the body. An Apostle tells us, 'Jesus baptized not' with water, 'but his disciples did,' while they were not yet baptized with Christ's baptism, and had many things to learn. Jesus was baptized with the Holy Spirit and something was added to his life when he came up out of the water at the baptism of John. After his occultation and reappearance to his disciples, he said to them, 'John baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit in not many days.' Acts i., 5. The Holy Spirit illuminates the understanding. It was the spirit of Truth, the Mentor that led and instructed them as a mother does her offspring. It brought their previous knowledge of, and talks with Jesus to mind as occasion required, and enabled them to perceive spiritual meanings previously hid, as appears in their testimony, and sudden change in attitude toward their persecutors and the world. But that was not the completeness of Christ's baptism, which removes all sin and conflicting desires. Does water baptism wash awray sins ? Is it more than of a type of spiritual cleansing, and sign of submission to the society which requires it? If not, it cannot be the essential baptism to a Christian life. A type cannot be the substance which it only figuratively represents, and all contention about the form in which' it is administered, what is it but contending over a shadow, while the substance is lost or evaded. Only the waters of spiritual life, can wash away sins, and only the fire of the daily cross and Divine life, can take the nature of sin away from the heart. 'The day is revealed by fire, and fire shall try every one's work.' 'He is like a refiner's fire.' 'He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.' The sous of Levi were the appointed ministers of Jehovah, and teachers of the people. ''Our God is a consuming fire' to whatever is contrary to the spirit of holiness. How great the transformation needed, from death in Adam to life in Christ, before as sons and daughters of his love, earth's children are created anew in his likeness. Jesus said, 'I came to throw fire on earth, and how I wish it were already kindled.' The baptism of fire is a baptism of suffering, and is alike for all. When James and John petitioned to sit, one at the right, and the other at the left of Jesus in his kingdom, Jesus asked 'Are you able to drink of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?' Again he said, 'I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened (lit. pressed) till it be accomplished.' Neither of these expressions referred to water baptism which had occurred long before. The baptism of fire began with the cross which he bore from the period of the descent of the Holy Spirit, until upon the last instrument of mortal hate and torture, he pronounced, 'It is finished,' and breathed out his spirit. ' Are you ignorant that as many as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death? We were buried together with him through baptism into death, that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, thus we also should walk in newness of life.' Rom. vi., 4. The last sentence dL&gt;closes the character of the death referred to : viz. death 10 all that is opposed in us to the new life. 'For he who died, died once to sin, but he who lives, lives to Goa.' 'He whs obedient till death of the cross.' 'For though he was a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.' He died to deatli, and to its cause, that death should no longer hold sway over him, 'Who has left us an example that we should walk in his steps.' Hence it is evident that the real Christian baptism both illuminates the understanding, and brings death to sin and sinful desires�to the old man�to 'The carnal mind, which is enmity against God'�to that mystery of lawlessness, 'which is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be'� to 'the man of sin,' in whom every sinner holds partnership. And though one may be partly enlightened by a holy spirit, and become a learner for a season before receiving this baptism, as in the case of the first disciples, we believe nought else than this can make one a Christian of the pattern of Jesus Christ. Nor can anything short of this, destroy the life of sin, so that the new and resurrection life can be possessed in lieu thereof. 'Who is sufficient for these things?' All they who will bear the cross of Christ until it is worn out. They will know by experience the death of the cross, and the life of the true resurrection. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
