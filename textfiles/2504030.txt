The very difficulties of life... 'The very difficulties of life, of which we are so apt to complain, are converted into the means of that discipline, that self-improvement, which is the great end of life. Let a man's present desires be met and satisfied without any exertion on his part, and he will be content to remain as he is. Progress is the child of struggle, and struggle is the child of difficulty.'
