Beloved eldress Antoinette; I have been reading... Washingtonville, Pa. Oct. 11, 1884. Beloved Eldkess Antoinette ,ï¿½I have been reading your excellent communication in the 'Manifesto' for August last, to a ' Sister Mary, ' in which you ask, ' How can we (Zion) direct our efforts and use our ability in a spiritual and temporal point of view to the best advantage, in building up and sustaining the one great cause, for which we have pledged our all etc. ' ' If an ' outsider's ' opinion is of any value I would say by continuing steadfast in the faith whereunto you are called in the Gospel. Giving no rest to that spirit of indulgence which clamors to be ' let alone, ' which is at ease in Zion all the time. Thousands, like myself bless your testimony. Frederic Heaton.
