Some men die not... Some men die not; the grave's abyss Is never deep enough to hide Their grandest acts, whose light shines on Like beacons on a mountain side. The deep pulsations of their lives Throb on, and on, through ages vast, As ceaseless as a river's flow, And Time and Death's eclipse outlast.
