Sarah F. Wilson, Dear Friend;-- For the past few weeks... Healdsburg, Sonoma Co., Cal. Sarah F. Wilson, Dear Friend ;ï¿½ For the past few weeks, I have been sending to your address the 'Signs of The Times,' and being anxious to know if you receive them regularly, I wTrite to enquire respecting it. I hope that you have received them all, and that you have found them interesting. Doubtless you .have noticed that one especial object of the paper, is to call its readers to the subject of Christ's second coming. The l&gt;ible abounds in prophecies and promises relating to this event, really there is nothing in the Bible more definitely promised than this. Jesus said, 'I will*come again.' John, xiv. 3. Now if he should come in our day, how important that we should understand about it. To be sure we cannot know the day nor the hour, for Jesus said so, but in the same connection he says that we may know when he is near. Matt, xxiv., 36. xxxii., 35. If you desire the paper longer, I will be pleased to send it for a time, I send them free, only actuated by a desire to place before others, what to me seems of great importance. In your perusal of this paper you may have noticed subjects which are of special interest to you, if so I should be glad to send you reading matter upon them. If it would not be asking too much, I would like you to send me the names of those of your friends and neighbors whom you think would be interested in reading of this kind. Respectfully, Mrs. M. A. Winkler.
