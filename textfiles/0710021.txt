LET US GO UP AND TAKE THE CITY James G. Russell Enfield, N. H. 1. Let us go up and take the City, Let not our zeal and courage wane, Nought shall impede our 2. Let us go up and take the City, It is the strong in faith who win None are entitled 3. Let us go up and take the City, We will sing praises as we go Bearing aloft the progress upward, God will be with us to sustain. We will not flinch, tho' overcomers, Bearing the stains of guilt and sin. Washed in the pool of gospel banner, Ensign of victory o'er the foe. When we have passed the great the conflict, Knowing our cause is just and true true repentance, Clothed in the virgin's blest attire, glorious ordeal, Proven our right to joys of bliss, Victry is ours, if we are valiant, Every evil to subdue. Safely we'll pass all scenes of dauger, Watery floods, or flames of fire. We will rejoice in our salvation, Dwelling in peace and righteousness.
