THE LAND OF BIMEBY. S. W. Foss. To settle bills now is too grievous a pull, And indeed it is useless to try, For some day they'll all be receipted in full, In the beautiful land of Bimeby. There our vessels from Spain with its goldburdened prow, Will come into port high and dry, For the ships that won't land in the harbors of Now, Will unload at the docks of Bimeby. The marvelous land of Bimeby, the wonderful land of Bimeby, We'll eat honey and milk, dress in sealskin and silk, In the far-away land of Bimeby! And the land of Bimeby is just over the range, Just beyond the horizon, they say, Where you never are troubled by absence of change, Nor met with 'I promise to pay;' In the banks of Bimeby your notes never mature, Nor o'er taxes nor rent do you sigh ! For all men own the earth by a title deed sure, In that glorious land of Bimeby ! In that beautiful land of Bimeby, in that prodigal land of Bimeby, We will all have our fill and no man bring a bill, In that beautiful land of Bimeby ! Oh, we do some small things in this cold land of Now However we struggle and try, Where we all have to live by the sweat of our brow, But we'll do the square thing in Bimeby. We have hard and peculiar temptations to cheat, And a predisposition to lie, But the chaff will all be winnowed out of our wheat In the beautiful land of Bimeby ! The millennial land of Bimeby, the Arcadian land of Bimeby, We'll make no more plaints and will all live like saints In the jolly old land of Bimeby! Yes, we're going to be good�ah, I see that you smile� But pass our pet weaknesses by, Just let us run on our old way for a while, We are going to reform in Bimeby. 'You don't like our actions?' we've heard that before, Don't look with such critical eye, We are crooked sticks now, and unsound at the core, But we'll all be straight timber 'bimeby.'' In the bright phantom land of Bimeby, in the mystical land of Bimeby, You will marvel to see what fine saints we will be In that wonderful land of Bimeby! Western Ploughman.
