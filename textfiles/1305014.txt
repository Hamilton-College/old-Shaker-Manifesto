A MORNING THOUGHT. FLORA WILLIAMS. 'The goodness of God leadeth to repentance.' Rom. ii, 4. As we opened the Bible to select a text for our morning exercise, this passage attracted our attention and we were particularly impressed with the idea that it was the goodness of God and not the fear of an over-ruling Power that leadeth the soul to repentance. We are reminded of the experience of Peter, He had sadly sinned, denied his Lord and Master ; but the Lord turned and looked on Peter and he ''went out and wept bitterly.' That look could not have been one of hatred and scorn but rather a recognition of Christian love and forgiveness. Behold, how great was the repentance of the Prodigal Son ! How sweet the humility of his confession ! 'Father I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.' Was not this humble confession and repentance wrought through the goodness of God? '-For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.' Let us then through the 'goodness of God that leadeth to repentance,' enter these cleansing waters which will THE MANIFESTO. Ill render us holy and acceptable as members of that glorious Church not having 'spot or wrinkle.' Then shall we be able to fully appreciate the beautiful sentiments of the little hymn wp sometimes sing ; 'Blessed fruits of sweet repentance, Grown while stricken 'neath the rod ; Blessed lessons of instruction, Sent to lead us home to God.'
