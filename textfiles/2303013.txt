OUR BABYLON. James G. Clark. [Contributed by D. Offord.] Oh the bowers of Babylon are rare, And the tinkling fountains play Over gardens hung in the drowsy air, Where the careless youth and maiden fair Are dreaming the years away; And the kings of Babylon are bold� For the realms before them fall� And they rule the world from thrones of gold, While the people's lives are bought and sold Like the herds in the butcher's stall. Oh the towers of Babylon are strong, And their dungeons damp and deep, And the rich rejoice in the reign of wrong And the princes join in the reveler's song, While the toilers work and weep; But stern and still, like a troop of fates, Round the city's roar and din, The invading host of the conqueror waits, In the midnight hush outside the gates As the feast goes on within. Oh the walls of Babylon are high, And their arches grim and low, And the birds of commerce scream and fly, While the proud Euphrates wanders by In its dark, relentless flow; But the river that rolls in Mammon's pride Shall the people's servant be� By the toiler's will shall be turned aside, And the channel surge with a grander tide Than the pulse of1 the Persian Sea.
