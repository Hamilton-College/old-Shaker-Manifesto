FOR WILLING HANDS. By Elder Henry C. Blinn. SO long as there are children and youth, there evidently will be no lack of work for willing hands and Christian hearts. If love is to be the redeeming advocate that shall save souls from the many low estates, it must work where it can become effectually recognized. The testimony of Jesus, the Christ, as we understand it, is the embodiment of all the gifts and graces which should adorn the mind. The injunction which was given to the disciples to 'go forth into all the earth and preach the gospel to every creature' has a significance as full and as broad as the command itself. Everything must come within the boundaries of the mind; and be readily comprehended or it fails to produce the desired results. The words must be easily understood, or a mysticism will soon ruin their force. As all undevelopt faculties are characteristic of childhood, a man's age is determined by this fact, rather than by the number of years he has past upon the earth. If he is to be led on to a higher life, it must be through the culture of all the faculties in their respective orders. Good manners must come first as a necessary preparation for the more advanced moral education which at its best serves only as a teacher to bring the life to Christ. The sensualist must repent,�change his mind and walk circumspectly before he can be able to walk with God. The self-conceited must learn to love his neighbor as himself or he would be inclined to pray,�My Father who art in heaven, instead of�Our Father, as was taught by Jesus. The beauties of neatness AUGUST, 1897 must b e preacht to those who are predisposed to slovenly habits as a part of the foundation on which to build the more exalted work of Jesus the Christ. To be chaste and to be pure seem like a pleasant association, opening to us a harmony that can not be obtained by a neglect of either. If the highway to the Kingdom of Heaven begins at the lowest strata of human minds, and every one who turns his face and directs his steps toward the Holy City becomes a fellow-pilgrim, then we can see why some are drawn to benevolence, others to order or prudence and those more advanced in the regenerating life of the Christ to a baptism of the Holy Spirit and of fire. Jesus in one of his remarks has said;�'It is not given to all men to receive these sayings,' Perhaps he thought they had better be educated first in good manners, in civility or in the elementary work of the Mosaic Law. We well remember a visit we once made to a Theological Institute by invitation of a young friend who was preparing for the Ministry. After he had given us an introduction to the Bishop and to several of his fellow-students, we past on from room to room till we reacht his own private apartments. Here we rested for conversation. It was his home and the place where he retired for communion with the spirit of his God. Here he was silently being molded by the influences and conditions that were with and around him. At some future day, after his Greek and Latin and Hebrew were committed to memory, he would go out into the world to repeat them to other minds, and with them he would give all the chaotic and undisciplined forms of life in which he had lived. We wondered ! Everything was in confusion. A regard for order or even for rules of propriety were entirely ignored. His apology for a bed occupied one corner of the room, while his wardrobe, more privileged than his bed, was only limited by the four walls of the apartment. The legitimate use of the broom or brush, if they were there at all, had been sadly neglected. We could but feel sorry for the young man as well as for those to whom he was to be an apostle. He was now spending his months and years learning to repeat a form of prayers and to become skilled in certain ceremonies of the church and also in developing himself into a stumbling-block as a Christian, by the cultivation of these slovenly habits. Side by side these conditions are to pass with this student through all the walks of life. Attaching themselves with the same tenacity to the mind, they are reflected alike upon every company, whether at his home or in the church among those who have come for divine worship, which should be in the beauty of holiness. The spirituality that could rest satisfied in the ministration of such an element must, indeed be very crude. When we speak of the gospel of Jesus, the love of God to lost souls,�that to be made partakers of its divine beauty, we must bear his cross; then there are but few who realize the depth of its spiritual meaning. We say that sin must be washt away; but what is sin ? There may be a list of trespasses which the disciple is expected to guard against, for Paul has said that a transgression of the Law is sin, and as the disciple of Jesus we sin and come short of the glory of God if we fail to repent,�to change our lives, to become new creatures by which every habit and practice may be brought under gospel inspection. We must live soberly, righteously and godly. The gossiping busy body and mischief-maker must give place to the loving peacemaker, indolence to industry, and slatternly conditions of the mind to neatness. These are the elementary lessons of the seeker after righteousness, as preparatory to the entering upon that more exalted state of spirituality ;�purity of heart. Like all the developments of life, righteousness is seen in every phase, from the first germ to that of the Angel sphere. It is sometimes difficult to reconcile our minds to the many incongruities that present themselves under the guise of redeeming influences while the mind is callous to the refining process which it is said shall work like the refiner's fire and like fuller's soap.
