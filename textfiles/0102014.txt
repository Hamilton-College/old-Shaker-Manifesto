A Concise Statement {Concluded.') They that believed in Christ's gospel, and were obedient to that form of doctrine which was taught them ; by denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts; and became entirely dead to the law by the body of Christ, or power of the Holy Ghost, were in the travail of the resurrection from the dead; or the redemption of the body. So that they who took up a full cross against the world, flesh, and devil, and who forsook all for Christ's sake, and followed him in the regeneration, by persevering in that line of obedience to the end, found the resurrection from the dead, and eternal salvation in that dispensation; but as the measure of that dispensation was only as water to the loins, the mystery of God not finished ; but there was another day prophe- sied of, called the second appearance of Christ, or final and last display of God's grace to a lost world: in which the mystery of God should be finished as he has spoken by his prophets since the world began : which day could not come, except there was a falling away from that faith and power that the church then stood in; in which time antichrist was to have his reign, whom Christ should destroy with the spirit of his mouth and brightness of his appearance : which falling away began soon after the apostles, and gradually increased in the church, until about four hundred and fifty-seven years from Christ's birth, or thereabouts, at which time the power of the Holy People, or church of Christ, was scattered or lost by reason of transgression: and antichrist, or false religion became established. Since that time the witnesses of Christ have prophesied in sackloth or under darkness; and altho' many have been faithful to testify against sin, even to the laying down of their lives for the testi- mony which they held, so that God accepted them in their obedience: while they were faithful and just to live or walk up to the measure of light and truth of God, revealed or made known unto them, but as it is written, that all they that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution : and so it has been, and those faithful witnesses lost their lives by those falsely called the church of Christ: which is antichrist; for the true church of Christ never persecuted any; but were inoffensive, harmless, separate from sin : for the true church of Christ taking up their cross against the world, flesh, and devil, and all sin, living in obedience to God, they earnestly contend for the same. Therefore it may be plainly seen and known, where the true church of Christ is : but as it is written, antichrist or false churches should prevail against the saints and overcome them before Christ's second appearance, 2 Thess. ii, 3. Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first; and that man of sin be revealed, ths son of perdition, Rev. xiii: 7. And it was given unto him to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds, tongues, and nations; and this is the state Christ prophesied the world of mankind should be in, at his second appearance, Luke xvii. 26. And as it was in the dayofNoe, so shall it be in the days of the Son of Man, verse 30. Even so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed : plainly referring to his second appearance to consume or destroy antichrist, and make a final end of sin, and establish his kingdom upon earth: but as the revelation of Christ must be in his people, whom he had chosen to be his body, to give testimony of him and to preach his gospel to a lost world. 4th. The fourth dispensation or day is the second appearance of Christ, or final, or last display of God's grace to a lost world, in which the mystery of God will be finished and a decisive work, to the final salvation, or damnation of all the children of men : which according to the prophecies rightly calculated, and truly understood, began in the year of our Saviour Jesus Christ, 1747. See Daniel and the Revelations. In the manner follow- ing, 1st. To a number, in the manifestation of great light and mighty trembling by the invisible power of God, and visions, and revelations, and prophecies which has progressively increased, with administration of all those spiritual gifts, that were administered to the apostles at the day of pentecost : which is the comforter that has led us into all truth : which was promised to abide with the true church of Christ unto the end of the world, and by which we find baptism into Christ's death; death to all sin, become alive to God, by the power of Christ's resurrection which worketh in us mightily; by which a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto us ; and woe be unto us if we preach not the gospel of Christ. For in finding so great a salvation and deliverance from the law of sin and death in believing and obeying this gospel which is the gospel of Christ, in confessing and forsaking all sin and denying ourselves and bearing the cross of Christ, against the world, flesh, and devil. We have found repentance of all our sins; and are made partakers of the grace of God wherein we now stand : which all others in believing and obeying, have acceptance with God, and find salvation from their sins as well as we; God being no respecter of persons, but willing that all should come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved. Thus we have given a short information of what we believe of the dispensations of God's grace to mankind, both past and present: and in what manner the people of God have found justifi- cation or acceptance with God, which was and is still in believing and obeying the light and truth of God, revealed or made known in the day or dispensation in which it is revealed: for as the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness or live in any known sin against him; so his mercy and grace is towards all them that truly fear him, and turn from all their sins, by confessing, forsaking, and repenting, which is the way and manner in which all must find the forgiveness of their sins, and acceptance with God thro' our Lord Jesus Christ, or finally fail of the grace of God; and that salvation which is brought to light by the gospel. But to conclude, in short, as we believe, and do testify, that the present gospel of God's grace unto us is the day which in the scripture, is spoken or prophesied of, as the second appearing of Christ to consume or destroy antichrist, or false religion, and to make an end of the reigning power of sin (for he that commiteth sin is the servant of sin and Satan) over the children of men : and to establish his kingdom, and that righteousness that will stand forever: and that the present display of the work and power of God, will increase until it is manifest to all; which it must be in due time: for erery eye shall see him ; and he will reward every man according to his deeds : and none can stand in sin or unrighteousness, but in that righteousness which is pure and holy; even without fault before the throne of God which is obtained by grace, through faith in obedience to the truth of the everlasting gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, in denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts; by confessing all sin, and taking up the cross of Christ, against the world, flesh, and devil.
