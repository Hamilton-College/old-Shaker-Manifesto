SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL Prof. John Nott has proposed that some formula be printed as a warning to school children not to abuse their eyesight, and posted in front of every book, as follows : ' Caution.- -Reader, your eyesight is worth more to you than any information you are likely to gain from this book, however valuable that may be. You are, therefore, earnestly cautioned- - 1. To be sure that you have sufficient light, and that your position be such that you not only avoid the direct rays upon your eyes, but that you also avoid the angle of reflection. In writing, the light should be received over the left shoulder. 2. That you avoid a stooping position and a forward inclination of the head. Hold the book up. Sit erect also when you write. That at brief intervals you rest the eyes by looking off and away from the book for a few moments. And you are further cautioned TO AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, BOOKS AND PAPERS PRINTED IN SMALL TYPE, and especially such as are poorly printed; also to avoid straining or overtaxing the sight in any way. All may need to be reminded of the great importance of thoroughly cleansing the eyes with soft, pure water both morning and evening.' Popular Scientific Monthly.
