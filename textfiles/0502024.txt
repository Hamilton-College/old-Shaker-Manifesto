Keeping Meals Waiting. Little things often interfere with our comfort very much, and one small annoyance is for men to delay coming to dinner when called. Sometimes they have an hour or more of work which they will do before quitting and then they go to the house to find the dinner cold, and the cook discouraged. Nothing is more disheartening to a tired woman than a table f ul of dirty dishes ornamenting the table an hour and a half later in the day than usual. Punctuality is a virtue, that men should learn, if they are in the habit of being uncertain about coming to their meals. Any woman worthy the name of housekeeper will be regular with her meals, if it lies within her power to have them so.
