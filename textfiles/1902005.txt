Correspondence. To Frederic Evans:--For many years, I have know of... Lodi, Cal.. Nov. 1888. To Frederic Evans :�For many years, 1 have kuown of your order and its good work in behalf of the needy human family, and have had a personal acquaintance with a number of most estimable men and women both, who at some time in their lives were members of your society Prior to my coming to California, about twenty two years ago, 1 met some of your New Lebanon family, and somehow have the impression that you were one of the number. But, be that as it may, I was deeply interested in your society, and particularly because its founder was a woman ; and earnestly wished for an opportunity to visit your place and become better acquainted with the practical application of its principles, which I understood somewhat. But the opportunity never came, and I drifted off thousands of miles away from any organized body of your people. But in all these years, T have never relinquished the hope entertained of visiting your family some day, and the intimate acquaintance of one of your family at Watervliet has perhaps tended to keep alive that early desire. She was then known as Cornelia Rogers, now Mrs. Powers, a widow, and her visit to my home at this time is the immediate cause of my sending you this letter. We have been, for some days, engaged in earnest conversation regarding your people, and the beautiful work of love and charity which you have been doing, in your own quiet way ; and it has led me to address this appeal to you to make an effort to establish one of your families on the Pacific coast; and why not in California? I have been, since a mere child, a school-girl in my teens, working for the betterment of society, for the emancipation of women, for the redemption of mankind from the fruits of sin, and the servitude and degradation resulting from false teachings, ignorance and superstition. During all this struggle, I have ever felt that your order, and similar associative efforts, have been potent factors in accomplishing much of the results of liberalism which have come to the world the past thirty years. And nowT I think your work should take a wider range, and the influence for good which I know has radiated from the several families you have founded in the Atlantic states, should be exerted in this new and prolific field of the Pacific. So forcibly am I impressed with this idea, that I would even undertake a journey to New Lebanon to confer with the Ministry upon the proposition, if desired ; or�what is better still�I would take great pleasure in extending most heartily to you and as many of your people as you might send out here to California, my humble hospitality, and such knowledge as I have of this wonderful state and its unparalleled resources should be cheerfully imparted to you. I will be very glad to hear from you in regard to this matter, and to know if my impressions meet with any response from you. There is a vast field in California for just such kind of work as your self-sacrificing people can do ; particularly amongst the young; and, as there is not now, to my knowledge�and 1 doubt if there ever has been�one of your order west of the Rocky Mountains, it would be a great satisfaction if I should be one of the humble instruments to induce you to establish a family on this coast. You will confer a favor upon me by sending me a copy of the Life or history of Mother Ann, and I will remit the amount for the same, when I write again. Hoping to hear from you soon, I am, very truly yours, Laura de Force Gordon.
