AID THE ACCOMPLISHMENT For a few months, at least, politics will force themselves prominently upon willing and unwilling ears and attention. We only care to have the best man elected, and believe the country will not go to perdition if either candidate should be chosen to the presidency. But we are glad of one feature in the canvass—that of selecting two high-minded men as candidates—ones who have tried to do duty as they understood duty to be, and thereby have been the means of shutting off any probability of those slanderous indulgences which have so frequently been participated in by the contending parties. We hope editors will readily seize upon the occasion to keep their issues free from such personal abuse, as to make their periodicals the vehicles of respectability, and not corrupt the sensitive minds of young and old in the families where they enter, with unnecessary and unwholesome vulgarity.
