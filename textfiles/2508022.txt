Union Village, O. June, 1895. May came in hot and dry, and continued much the same throughout the month, affording little encouragement to the gardener. Asparagus and rhubarb afforded but scant supplies to our table. June has done better, copious showers bringing forward vegetation finely. Peas, asparagus and new potatoes, have appeared during the past week upon our well supplied table. Berries, and later a fair crop of cherries have added their crimson beauty and luscious juices to the feast. Corn is growing finely; wheat is almost ready for the reaper, and our crop of barley is already cut and thrashed. Situated as Union Village is, in one of the richest if not the richest valley in the world, it seems almost superfluous to say we have an abundance of the fruits of the earth. 'Our peace is like a river, and our fountain of blessing full and runningover;'' individual happiness however depends upon the degree of health, wisdom and consecration of the individual. If I had taken as much pains in writing my last home notes as in this, the type would not have made me say, 'snug days and wintry ways,' instead of 'sunny days and windy ways,' as the manuscript was intended to read. But 'the most uukindest cut of all,' is the 't'orceful dreams,' whatever they are; even the critics declare they can not imagine. But 'fearful dreams' anybody can uuderstand, having had them when living a sinful life; but a 'forceful dream 'is surely a new invtntion. IHifnon Andrews.
