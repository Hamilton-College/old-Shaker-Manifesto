What Cheer? BY E. H. WEBSTER There's a light streaming forth from the east, That gilds the horizon afar, And says to each suffering heart, Look aloft to the blest morning star, There's a promise of day in its beams; There's a promise of freedom and right; There's a promise of peace on the earth, And the triumph of love over might. There's a joy for the clean and the pure; There's a rest for the weary of sin. There's a peace for the conqueror of self, And its seat and foundation 's within. There's a love for the trusting and frail; There's a tender, compassionate heart, That weeps o'er the sinner, and cannot assail, Nor add to its suffering smart. There's a light glowing bright in our heart, For our Father, who led us this way; There's a love, ever warm in our breast, For our Mother, our comfort and stay, Who suffered and toiled to spread the pure faith That shines on our every-day life, And lightens and cheers its thro' sorrow and toil To faint not, nor sink in the strife. There's a gratitude due to our King, For all of his infinite care; There's a duty we owe to our Queen ; A loyalty everywhere; To honor their cause, in word and in deed, And light up the temple anew; And worthily walk in their footsteps, so pure, And oil in our lamps oft renew'd. There's a question will come to each soul, When eternity opens its light; There's a sorrow will over us roll, If we keep not our lamps burning bright. Let us banish all discord, and work while we can, And lighten each burden we may, While joyfully walking in duty, and nse The straight and still brightening way.
