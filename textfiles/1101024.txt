HAPPY YEAR Once more we come, wishing all a Happy New Year ! Happiness consists in doing good at the expense of self and selfishness, and this self-denial will ever make heaven on earth. We come to the people anew, teaching unpopular, unpalatable truths â€” but truths none the less. If Shaker teaching represents the Christ of olden time and now, how far off from Christ are the popular churches, and their numerous following? We wish a Happy Year in the reintroduction into the churches of the ancient sacraments. We wish a Happy New Year of Jesus' life; of Paul's life; of each and every Apostle's life of the Christ of old.' Not only in the form of Monks and Nuns; not only in the name of Celibates; not only as apostles of Peace, of Brotherhoods and unworldly named institutions; but let us have a Happy New Year in the resurrection of Christ in Spirit, wherein ' the old' selfish world and ourselves will have departed, and we shall be ' new creatures ' indeed, and new in Christ's life, and after his pattern!
