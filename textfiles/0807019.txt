OUR BANNER Millions of dollars are spent by the Churches annually to farther sectarian principles ; and much sincerity of honest belief, is manifested by church goers, through their strong desire to promulgate their especial creeds by giving largely for missionary purposes. Ours is a Church doctrine having no sectarian ends to accomplish other than . to invite, persuade and induce all who are able, to live like Jesus. We thus may find genuine association with every honest professor of Christianity, who, yet unable to live so self-denyingly and unworldly, is yet glad that others are able, and who feels a pride in giving a mite to sustain our Bannerâ€”The Manifesto. Let us give our mites, mights and lives to sustain genuine Christ prin- ciples and The Manifesto.
