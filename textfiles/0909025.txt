THAT ' MIDSUMMER HOLIDAY ' STORY We hope our people will not be too deeply stirred by the ridiculous, sarcastic and scurrilous stories that every now and then find their way into type among the trashy literature of our day. The latest, in a 'midsummer monthly,' can do but little harm among those who, having brains, are willing to accord to us even a modicum of common sense and common courtesy. It will be readily recollected that Dr. J. G. Holland, the editor of the last scurvy tale, once wrote, that '/ really believe God loves the Shakers, but I do not think He admires them!' and with such imperfect logic, we can comfortably conclude that if God only loves us very well, we can risk His admiration, and endure the unpretty thrusts of Timothy Titcomb and his unscrupulous lackeys.
