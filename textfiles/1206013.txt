TEACHERS AND WORKERS Give the workman water pure, Give the workman light and air; If his life is insecure Health and mind cannot endure, And his home becomes a snare. Build the workman's dwelling sound, Not an earth-house or a cave; Scan and drain well underground, Heed and pave well all around, Or you'll make his living grave. Educate the workman's child, In your lesson aye impress That the fountain undented Lies in truth so oft exiledâ€” Mind and body cleanliness. Teachers of the present age, Teachers of the coming time, If you'd live in history's page, Let these truths your mind engage ; They will lead to work sublime. The Builder.
