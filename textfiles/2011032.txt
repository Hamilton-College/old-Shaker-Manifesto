PRAISE. How good God is to us, and how much we should thank him for our many blessings ! King David was very fond of singing praises to God; but at one time when he had done wrong he felt that he could not until he had been forgiven. Even when he was fleeing from his enemy, Saul, from mountain to mountain, he praised God for his goodness in keeping him safe. Everything that God has made praises him by showing his wisdom and power, and why not we, who have received more than any of the rest of his creation. Paul said, 'Glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.' This means that if we are God's we should be pure, honest, loving, prayerful and do our best for God. 12 yrs. old.
