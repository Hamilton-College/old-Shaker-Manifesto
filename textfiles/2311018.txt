Editorial. To be good and to do good is about all... To be good and to do good is about all that can be included in the life of a Christian. The very simplicity of the work which enrolls one as a disciple of the divine Teacher, brings it most beautifully into the illustration which he was pleased to make to his followers. ''Except ye become as little children, ye can not enter into the kingdom of heaven.' It was the confiding trust which little children gave to their teachers that makes this lesson so valuable. When Jesus said, There is none good, but God, he had reference to the source of goodness, so that to be God-like is for men to turn their attention toward God, and in doing that which they think God would like to have them do. This creates goodness. The whole being becomes good, and then out of this abundance of good that is in the heart, the mouth speaketh. Under this system of education all the thoughts and words and deeds become good agreeably to the Christian standard. On this subject of the establishing of goodness in the soul, no better advice could be given than that of St. Paul when he said to his Brethren : 'Let every one be persuaded in his own mind.' It is a lesson which the Christian student must learn for himself, as his goodness is an outgrowth of the soul, and can no more be obtained by demand, than can the power to create a new world. No creed, nor baptisms, nor protestations of faith can ever develop the spirit of goodness. To believe that there is one person, or two persons or three persons in Deity, is to some Christians the pearl of great price, and will insure the salvation of the soul. Jesus never burdened himself with this form of doctrine through which to establish the gift of goodness. His work was that of practical righteousness, and he gave it an individual application. THE MANIFESTO. ï¿½261 The heart must be made pure, to be enabled to see the goodness of God. He must become a peacemaker among men, that he may be called a child of God. A valuable lesson has been laid down by the apostle Paul for those to learn who. would be good. 'Put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.' With this individual preparation, there is an assurance through the spirit of God that the gift of goodness may be established in the soul. Now we would ask those who have obtained one or more degrees of this precious treasure, In what way can it be made valuable ? A passive goodness is about of as much value as would be a nice garment if carefully laid away where no one could use it. And then moth eaten garments and moth eaten goodness would have about the same value. To do good requires action. Help those who need help. Prepare the way of the Lord and make his paths straight. Live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world. It is said of Jesus that he went about doing good, healing the sick, restoring sight to the blind and raising the dead. To do good after this manner is to accept an abundance of hard work, and is quite like the working out of one's salvation, with some fear and an anxious hope, as we render a Christian care for others.
