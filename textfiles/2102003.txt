Correspondence. Dear friend:--This will inform you that we are all well... Kidds Land, England. Nov. 1890. Dear Fjriend:ï¿½This will inform you that we are all well and were deeply interested in your homeward journey. We hope you arrived all right and safe into your family, as they would all feel very happy to see you again among them. You will, evidently, be engaged in your daily duties before this reaches you. Dear friend, allow me to use the term, I am writing in the name of the whole family. We cannot assign the reason for it, but your meekness and modesty and simplicity of manners left an impression on our memories that is growing in our household every day. Not a day passes but that you are spoken of with expressions like these. 'I wonder what uncle Kobert will be doing now?' 'We would have kept him, father, if he would have stayed with us.' Your name, sir, has become a household word; and as the weeks pass along it seems to become more and more permanant in the mind. Your sojourn among us, although very short, yet in that short time you left your wise counsel and your blessing, and with these you have left your impression upon our memories which time will serve to strengthen. Kate and Mary speak of you with the deepest reverence and kind care. So, dear friend, although your body is in America, we have a part of you here, in spirit. I must confess that for a few days after you left us, I felt a blank, as the conversation we enjoyed was very pleasant to the ear and did good to the heart. Your graphic sketch of your life-work may have an influence on some of the rising generation, in the making up of their future destiny. It shows plainly that no one need try to shape their own future to their own mind or will, as in trying to do this without the aid and guidance of the All-seeing Eye, it would only result in failure. The power is in God's hand. Hoping this will find you enjoying the blessing of health is the wish of us all. Your sincere friend, James Scott.
