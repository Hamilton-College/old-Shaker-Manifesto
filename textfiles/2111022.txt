Shaker Station, Conn. Paul gives expression to these words in his letter to the Colossians: 'We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, because of the hope laid up for you in heaven.' The reason of his thankfulness is found in the fact that the Colossian Church had remained steadfast and true to the foundation principles of the gospel. Through temptations, trials and persecutions the hope which they cherished had comforted and sustained them. What was true in the experience of those early Christians has been true in the experience of all the disciples of Christ ever since. The hope laid up for them in heaven has been an anchor to their souls, holding them amid trials and conflicts which they have encountered. And as we press onward in the self-denying path, we with Paul thank God for the hope laid up for us in heaven. 'All who have this hope,'ï¿½that is, the hope of being like Christ, 'purify themselves even as he is pure.' Glorious hope. How it brightens as the years pass away. Let us so live that our faith and hope may stand, ever guided by God's hand. 4652 spaces of cream were sold in Sept. A large crop of apples, 612 bushels and 42 of pears have been dried, and the work goes biavely on. Hubbard squashes a good crop. The.times of feeding poultry should be regular, certain hours being fixed upon for that purpose, but they are few who systematically feed their fowls. Clean water should be kept in the presence of poultry at all times, and yet this important matter is overlooked by many. Warmth in the winter is very essential to laying, being as important as a supply of food. D. Orcutt. The beautiful October days are lending their aid to inspire our hearts with true thankfulness for the bounties of heaven, both spiritually and temporally. Our garners are well filled, and plenty abounds in every direction. 'Hands to work, and hearts to God' never meets with disappointment. A consecrated life finds its daily reward. At this season of hurry and bustle to have the fruits well secured for winter use, combines toil and patience also perseverence, and our labors are not in vain. At present the apple crop demands our attention, as the abundance of shining fruit bends the heavy laden branches to the ground. Potatoes are nearly all harvested and a bountiful yield of good size and quality. Corn is cut, and ready to be brought to the barn, and is also satisfactory in every way. Nothing is wanting to remind us of that love which governs, and the power that has created all these blessings which we daily receive. We have enjoyed a visit from two Sisters from Philadelphia the past month which has proved beneficial in many ways, the bond of union is strengthened, gospel love has been diffused, and the living testimony of Mother's gospel enjoyed. These elements increase our thankfulness and zeal, to make greater effort for this 'Beautiful gospel, this soul saving gospel.' M. Withain.
