THE BROOK THAT RAN INTO THE SEA. 'O little Brook' the children said, ' The sea has waves enough; Why hurry down your mossy bed To meet his welcome rough? 'The Hudson or the Oregon May help his tides to swell: But when your few bright drops are gone, What has he gained, pray tell? ' I run for pleasure, ' said the brook, Still running, running fast; 'I love, to see you bend and look, As I go bubbling past. ' I love to feel the wild weeds dip ; I love your ringers light, That dimpling from my eddies drip, Filled with my pebbles bright. ' My little life I dearly love, Its shadows and its shine ; And all sweet voices that above Make melody with mine. ' But most I love the mighty voice Which calls me, draws me so, That every ripple lisps 'rejoice!' As with a laugh I go. ' My drop of freshness to the sea In music trickles on; Nor grander could my welcome be Were I an Amazon. ' And if his moaning wave can feel My sweetness n^ar the shore, E'en to his heart the thrill may steal;ï¿½ What could I wish for, more? ' The largest soul to take love in Knows how to give love best; So peacefully my tinkling din Dies on the great sea's breast. 'One heart encircles all that live, And blesses great and small; And meet it is that each should give His little to the All. Selected.
