Consecration The value of a book may never be determined by its weight or its size. We have seen large books, profusely illustrated, agreeably to the text, and yet they were books not to be desired. Before us is a pretty little book only 2&gt;ï¿½x4 inches, upon the cover of which is the word 'Consecration.' No one is startled by that word or wishes to conceal it from view. The little story is said to have been written with tears anil prayers, and certainly can not otherwise than do good. Published by H. L. Hastings, Boston, Mass. The interest in Brook Farm will never die. Of all the communistic experiments ever made in America, it enlisted the co-operation of the most remarkable group of people, Almost all those who were active in it are now dead, Curtis and Dwight among the last to go, Charles A. Dana the only prominent man of the number still left among us. From Hawthorne's 'Blithedale Romance' on it has given birth to an enormous mass of literature. No adequate history of Brook Farm has ever been written, although the account in Frothingham's life of Ripley is excellent. But we have been given many fragmentary memories, and impressions of the life there, from varying standpoints.
