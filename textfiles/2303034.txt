NOTHING IS LOST. Nothing is lost; the drop of dew Which trembles on the leaf or flower Is but exhaled to fall anew In summer's thunder-shower; Perchance to shine within the bow That fronts the sun at fall of day; Perchance to sparkle in the flow Of fountains far away. Nothing is lost; the tiniest seed By wild birds borne or breezes blown Finds something suited to its need, Wherein 'tis sown and grown. The language of some household song, The perfume of some cherished flower, Though gone from outward sense, belong To memory's after-hour. So with our words; or harsh or kind, Uttered, they are not all fogot; They have their influence on the mind, Pass on, but perish not. So with our deeds: for good or ill, They have their power scarce underThen let us use our better will [stood; To make them rife with good! ï¿½Youth's Temperance Banner.
