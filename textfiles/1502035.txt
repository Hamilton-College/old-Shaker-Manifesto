Fowler and AVells, Co. 75;! Broadway, N. Y. Terms 82. a year. Pl-EJR EJOLOC V. In the prospectus for 1885, the publishers give good reasons why the Journal should have a wide circulation; and as a means of extending an interest in the subject, the Fowler &amp; Wells Co., have prepared a new phrenological chartï¿½a handsome lithograph of a symbolical head. The relative location of eaeh organ being shown by special designs, illustrating the function of each in the human mind. For instance, secretiveness is shown by a picture of the cunning fox at te up ting to visit a hen-roost; combativeness is represented by a scene in a lawyer's office ; the teller's desk in a bank represents acquisitiveness; a butcher shop is made to stand for destructiveness; the familiar scene of the ' Good Samaritan' exhibits the influence of benevolence; sublimity is pictured by a sketch of the grand scenery of Yosemite Valley. Many of these pictures are little gems of artistic design and coloring in themselves*, and will help the student to locate the faculties and to impress his mind with a correct idea of their prime functions. The chart also contains a printed key giving the accepted names of the different faculties ; the whole picture is ornamental; nothing like it for design and finish being elsewhere procurable. It is mounted for hanging on the wall, and will be appropriate for the home, office, library or school. The head itself is about 12 inches wide, beautifully lithographed in colors on heavy plate paper, about 19 by 24 inches. Price $1.00. It is published and oifered as a special premium for subscribers to the ' Phrenological Journal' for 1885. The journal is published at $2.00 a year, with 15 cents extra required when the chart is sent. Hall's Journal of Health.
