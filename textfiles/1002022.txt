OUR LIVING REDEEMER The love which will pave us from sorrow and sin, The heart that will peace on true righteousness win, And cause us our heaven and earth to begin, Is the Christ that is living to-day. The hand which is ever creating anew, Uplifting our lives to be perfect and true, And bringing fair Eden yet clearer to view, Is our Living- Redeemer to-day. That ever bright star of affection and love, Which guideth us onward to glories above. O'er brooding, as with the white wings of a dove, Is the Saviour now followed of choiceâ€” That Father and Mother and beautiful friend, Who stoop now as ever ready aid to extend, And sympathies sweet in adversities lend, Are the parents with whom we rejoice. [Some Shaker sister has written and sent us the above pretty poem. We have departed from our usual rule, of paying no attention to anonymous contributions, and for the purpose of asking all our readers, if such a pretty poem should be at all ashamed of its author's name ?
