East Canterbury N. H. Oct. 1899. Like Ruth of Bible days, we have been busy gleaning, until now there remaineth none of the fruits of the land out of either storehouse or barn. The winter apples are a good crop, and pumpkins are unusually fine in flavor and huge in form. Three of the latter sufficed for a meal of the timehonored pumpkin pie for one. hundred tasters. The first snow-flake blew into sight on the 2nd inst. accompanied by a number of its mates, but so timid and tiny were they that they melted when we looked at them. When they grow up, we shall see more of them; they will, no doubt, be active and gregarious long after Home Notes have passed from sight if not from memory. But we are reminded that as Christians, 'we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.' The bond of fellowship between the various societies of Believers and the true friendship which sanctifies in Christ the relation we bear one to another, are among the real things and upon them we ask the blessing of God, that they may be multiplied and enriched until, as a people, we are what Christ our Pattei'n, would have us be, and what we all long to be.
