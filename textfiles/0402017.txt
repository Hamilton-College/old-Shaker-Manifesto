ALIMENTATION IN ITS RELATION TO NATIONAL PROSPERITY Dr. Hamlin, Bangor, Me. read a paper upon 'Alimentation Considered in its Relations to the Progress and Prosperity of the Nation.' He said that the subject was far more important than it seemed at first sight, and that it was well worthy of the future consideration of this association. The effect and value of alimentation was a question for the philosopher as well as for the physiologist, and the gourmand gave utterance to a truism when he said that the destiny of nations depended upon the manner in which they were fed. The chemical composition and physiological action of food affected us all, and should meet with universal attention. In the selection of meat for the purpose of food there was not observed in the large cities and towns the care and judgment which health required. Animal food was easily affected in its nutritive qualities. It contained the elements of vir- ulent poison, and a change in its condition converted it into a source of disease and death. The frequent and excessive use of fermented bread had a disastrous effect upon infantile life, for children fed upon this fashionable food and potatoes possessed but little power of resistance to the diseases to which human life was inevitably exposed.
