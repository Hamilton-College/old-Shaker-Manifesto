Substitute For Short Fall Pasture. — If the pastures are short of grass there is but one proper remedy—stall-feed the stock. It is not necessary to draw upon the hay-mow to do this. Every farmer ought to plant a large piece of corn for fodder. Sow a piece of ground with oats, to be cut early for the same purpose, and use them to help out the poor pasture rather than to feed your cattle in the mowing-field. But if the farmer has not provided for such fodder, then top the corn and feed that out; gather the deformed pumpkins, or those lying too thick together; use some of the early clover, or cut what rowen you can. And rather than feed the mowing-field, use some grain or hay, or buy a few hundred pounds of shorts. The stock must not suffer for food, and the farmer cannot afford the injury to his mowing lands that feeding will do.
