EDITORIAL NOTES CONGRATULATION We bow respectfully to our patrons, appearing as we do in Vol. 8. with form and features expressive of improvement. We congratulate all our readers upon the signs of our progress, and are happy to state that all is the work of Shaker hands. We ask for a thorough perusal, kind criticism, and happy reflection. Our object is to do good alone. We have no right to harm any one's feelings nor would we do so. Our first object is to promote radical, Christian religion among all people, regardless of name or denominational persuasion. We congratulate you and ourselves that we have been vouchsafed the encouragement that permits us to go on rejoicing in the good cause.
