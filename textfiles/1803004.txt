DREAMING AND DRIFTING. Cecelia Devyr. After so many years of silence, if I come knocking at the door of 'The Manifesto' will I be admitted to talk a little while with dear spiritual kindred ? They need not fear that I have any stray, morbid, or even metaphysical notions to communicate, for I would say to my fellow travelers that of all people, Believers have the least to do with the vague and ambiguous. The Gospel is God's perfect plan ; but, have we not all seen the shining mists that cover the rocks where many a noble and rudderless barque has foundered? Our Elders with untiring and unflinching bravery, bear their powerful testimony against the very nature of sin; against waywardness and alluring imagination, that would lead from duty and from safety. They know what it is to receive ingratitude for this devotion. My soul is bowed in pain and unutterable sorrow, when I think how easy it is for the heart to 'give heed to lying vanities and forsake its own mercies.' If any of us transgress a law, we expect to pay the penalty, but they who are called to be the High Priests and Priestesses� the Saviors�must suffer where they have not sinned. Surely, God has some great compensation for this inexorable law, that takes effect upon all who would benefit our race. There is a perverseness in humanity that thwarts the good. Looking down the history of the world, we can see where the Gift of Revelation descended to the simple and sincere, and for a time the work of redemption progressed ;� '' But hearts fell off that ought to twine, And man profaned what God had given, Till som^ were heard to curse the shrine TVhere others knelt to heaven.' But they who cursed did not always cease to kneel. They might not always be seeking evil, bat they found it. They at least failed to achieve the designs of God, or they turned from the grand, straight road of truth, into the flowery vistas of vain philosophy, that led down to the unknown sea where their hopes were wrecked on the shores of infidelity and sensuality. Their sweet spiritual aspirations were no more. The seductive influence like a perfume laden miasma, had taken the hearts that once drew life from heaven ; they settled into ease and said, :' There is no evil. All is peace and joy. Behold the sun shines, the dew and the refreshing showers descend.' And so they did. But the roots of bitterness, the thorns, the thistles and the poisonous vines came up, and desolation was there. This we have seen over and over again in the past. Oh ! shall we see it in the future? Will we demand that our leaders shall 'cry Peace where there is no peace?'�that they shall nurture the seeds of disintegration wherever sown, and daub with untempered mortar the structures that a selfpleasing nature would try to erect on the sand? Shall the messengers shrink from delivering the Word because it is strong and has the power of salvation in it? Shall the captains of the hundreds or of the fifties go forward timidly because there are giants in the way ; battles to fight; furnaces of affliction or cleansing floods to pass through? God forbid; and may the faith in our own hearts forbid it also. True leaders of the armies of the Lord do not waver in duty through fear, favor or affection An influx from the unseen world comes to help them with the honest, however feeble, while trembling and coufusion are sent upon the hypocrite, however bold. Zion is the last hope of the world. Her foundations wrere laid in tribulation. Her altars were built in the agony of prayer and sacrifice, and the fires of heaven lighted them. There must we take our all, and feel the fire, the blessed fire. There we can hear the voices parental from over the Mercy Seat,�voices of love that will sustain, voices of thunder that will shake not only our deeds, but the intents of our hearts. How are we awed by the magnificence of the work of God in its power, when the tempests of heaven come down to our souls to break the dry branches, and purify the atmosphere ; when the brightest and best of our number press for more glory, being far from thinking that it is all attained ! There is no room for an old Believer or far traveled sense. The gift of repentance is a boon to be shared by the most advanced, as well as by the least of the household. The weak can make new resolves and take courage, while the strong are inspired, and all like students seeking mundane knowledge, can feel that whatever is gained or not gained, great is the wealth that lies before. Then when the Divine approval comes, it is love, and balm, and sunshine that briags growth, such as the skies of June bring to the earth. From the depths of our souls we may be thankful for the flaming sword that is raised against the flesh by the few witnesses for God. What minister or public teacher�who is not lost in its depravity�does not se� its hideousness ; jet they must all preach smooth things, or if they venture beyond the prescribed limits, it is only to urge that the blight shall blossom. As well put a putrid carcass into a bed of white lilies expecting to have it change to life aud beauty, as to seek to mingle generation with the purity that belongs to the resurrection heavens. Are we not all children when we stand before the Ages, and before the work that Almighty God has for the soul? Even they who have anchors are not secure iu gliding on the dark current ; and the youug in faith should turn from the sight of its treacherous waters, that we may all make a safe journey and that none may be lost through dreaming aud drifting away from the heart given protection of our faithful guides.
