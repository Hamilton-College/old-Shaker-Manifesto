Hancock, Mass. May 14, 1891. Dear Editor:ï¿½Since our last communication to you, sickness has invaded our home, and for a time the illness threatened to become epidemic. However, it soon grew beautifully less, and as all who were ailing are convalescing, nothing alarming is apprehended. The disease seemed to be closely allied to La Grippe, though it took a different form. Elder Louis was seriously ill for several days, and the doctor pronounced it a case of Grippe complicated with other difficulties. At this date he is slowly recovering. The recent cold wave passed over our section of country, but owing to the backwardness of the season, it is thought the fruit buds were but slightly injured. Weather is now warm and pleasant, but rain is needed for vegetation. Nature is most beautifully attired in a robe of pink, white and green. House cleaning is nearly completed and other duties demand our attention. On the 21st ult. the summer term of school commenced. J. L. S.
