Beloved Elder Henry:--I take the liberty to send... Shaker Village, N. H. Dec. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½I take the liberty to send to your address this morning a copy of a simple yet worthy experience related in the Nov. issue of the 'Angel of Peace.' Please read and see if you do not deem it worthy a reprint (in Manifesto.) Unfortunately the author's name is not appended, but in our opinion, he has given his readers a very salutary lesson, and illustrated most clearly one of the fundamental principles of Shaker Theology viz., 'Confession of sin.' He shows us that to obtain the blessing of God and consequent peace of mind we must confess our faults to God in presence of a human witness. If every enlightened conscience could lead its possessor lo act as nobly under similar conditions as he has done, would not the Millennium so long anticipated soon be realized? Kindly, ASENATH.
