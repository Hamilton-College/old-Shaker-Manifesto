RESPONSE TO PHILANTHROPIST CHARLES PARRY n May No. Shaker Manifesto. The angel voice in corraled lines, High-toned, by heaven sent, Unfolds the wealth of spirit mines. Explored by souls, on glory bent. Was it not ever willed to be, That sense of balmy, fragrant breath, Should lead us on to taste, and see The life that triumphs over death ? 'Tis yours to know, the Spirit lives Above the reach of earthly woeâ€” Yours, ' the mission ' that He gives To cheer the way the prophets go. Our human needs, e'er want expressed Through human hearts are bid to flow, On them that love to be caressed, 'Neath folds of drapery, white as snow. Then let me pray, that wings divine May speed thee on thy peaceful strain, Mid harvest-fields, erect a shrine, To bless the scattered sheaves of grain. Oh ! spirit pure in human form, From living fountains leading, With thee I'd stand above the storm, To reach the heart that's bleeding. The dreary path of ages old, Below, beneath oppression, Calls loud for feet all shod with gold, For Truth, not mere profession. Bemis Heights, N. Y.
