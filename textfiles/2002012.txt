My Dear Sister M--:--I was most agreeably surprised with... East Canterbury, N. H., Jan. 1, 1890. My Dear Sister M- - - - - -:�I was most agreeably surprised with the reception of your good and interesting Christmas letter which came duly to hand. Good, because of the kindly impulse which prompted a si.-stcr's greeting to tin.- absent�interesting, as I traced through every line, the comprehension ami consequent appreciation of tlie gospel graces, so essentially requisite to all who are aiming toward the perfection of a Christian character. The proper development and symmetrical giowth of mind, from the plane of nature into the spiritual atmosphere of light and love, has ever been one of peculiar interest to me. Th're are many stepping stones by which the height attained can be correctly measured ; and when the eminence is gained, even above one selfish inclination, by obedience to the effective principle, which underlies all patient effort, we are thankful to give the honor due. So with 'Hope the anchor cast within the vail,' Faith combined with living works, Charity or Love, the greatest gift of all constitutes the mainspring which coutrols the life purpose. Whoever is blest with this incentive, paying no more tribute to worldly honor, approbation or pleasure, cannot fail in duty. Their success is insured. This power can only be gained by culture ; and as one writer aptly expresses it, 'There is nothing by which culture cau be wrought out and made effective, except practice. And practice, though the steps be slow, can lead us to the accomplishment of almost anything.' Then let us keep the soil of our hearts uuder such cultivation, enriched by our life experiences that we. can say with the poet, 'My mind to me a kingdom is.' This royal kingdom even a peasant may inherit. Now my dear M� wishing you all the happiness that the New Year can bring, and who can estimate its possibilities, by the fulfillment of the beautiful promise conveyed in your letter, I close with the united love arid thanks of our Order, for the entire household in our Valley Home. Kindly, Your Sister, J. J. Kaime.
