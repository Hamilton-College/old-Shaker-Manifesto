Which is a part of the natural law... 'Which is a part of the natural law, the ebb or the flow? Either, certainly. Likewise with life's sufferings and life's joys.As you can not say the ebb is go-od, the flow is evil, so you can not say of pain or joy (life's ebb and flow) this is good, that is evil. As long as your spirit is not immutable, whether on the high-way strewn with palm leaves and joyful cries of 'Hosanna' around you, or on the road to the cross with the fiendish yell of 'Crucify him' piercing your ears, you have not yet entered the 'holy of holies.' Ernest Pick.
