SOMETIME, SOMEWHERE. Robert Browning. Unanswered yet? The prayer your lips have pleaded In agony of heart, these many years? Does faith begin to fail; is hope departing, And think you all in vain those falling tears ? Say not the Father hath not heard your prayer; You shall have your desire sometime, somewhere. Unaaswered yet? though when you first presented This one petition at the Father's throne, It seemed you could not wait the time of asking, So urgent was your heart to make it known. Though years have passed since then, do not despair, The Lord will answer you sometime, somewhere. Unanswered yet? Nay, do not say ungranted; Perhaps your part is not yet wholly done. The work began when first your prayer was uttered, And God will finish what he has begun. If you will keep the incense burning there, His glory you shall see, sometime, somewhere. Unanswered yet? Faith can not be unanswered, Her feet were firmly planted on the Eock; Amid the wildest storms she stands undaunted, Nor quails before the loudest thunder shock. She knows Omnipotence has heard her prayer, And cries, '-It shall be done,' sometime, somewhere. Christian Standard.
