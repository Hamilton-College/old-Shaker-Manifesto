Enfield, N. H. Sept. 13, 1891. Dear Editor:ï¿½I had about decided not to send a voice from our (corner?) of the circle, when it occurred to me in our morning service, that if I was only able to place upon paper the genuine spirit and inspiration of both exhortations and pieces sung, it would be worth writing and also reading. Why does not some one in each Society who is a regular attendant in service learn stenography: it certainly would be a surer investment of both time and means than learning the art of remembering, the scientific name of which I fail to recall, if I ever knew. I often regret that so many wise sayings uttered by those rich in experience, are lost upon the air, while if it were possible for them to be read at some future time by an awakened soul prepared for the good seed, might bear golden fruit in the resurrection order; I will just touch upon the different points as. space would not admit of other than brief mention. Our Beloved Elder Giles' last words in our assembly were revived as very opportune; 'We should be producers as well as consumers.' In the spiritual rendering, producers of love, peace, good-will, not consumers alone, preying upon the vitals of society by magnifying the defects to our own detriment. Our Community home was affirmed to be the best home for the development of the Christ spirit; supplying the proper conditions whereby his life and teachings may be lived, which home should be sacred to the memory of all consecrated souls, and never, either intentionally or thoughtlessly, made to serve selfish purposes. The love which should characterize the true disciple, far removed from the inferior quality of this divine element, which is the unregenerate inheritance of humanity as a whole, pure, peaceable, merciful, forgiving and withal truthful. In the freedom of our worship lies both its benefit and beauty, so let us avail ourselves of all our privileges, that they may be blessings in full. 'Running ater is sweet, it is the tight tanks that become slimy and unwholesome.' E. B.
