Shaker Station, Conn. May, 1893. 'Put on the whole armor of God,' and keep it on. This is wise counsel. In the race for eternal life faithful crossbearing is requisite. Nothing truly noble 146 THE MANIFESTO. is gained without work, persistent, persevering, patient work. 'No pruning, no fruit; no battle, no victory; no cross, no crown.' No difficulties too great to be conquered. No danger in the path where Jesus leads. If we would shun sin, we must shun all that leads to sin. There is no better way to bear our own trials and afflictions than in trying to give comfort and joy to others. Sometimes a word of warning, caution or entreaty saves a soul from spiritual ruin and death. We must wear in eternity what we weave in time. Where purity is, a quiet spirit dwells. It is best to lay out some course of religious reading that will give us food for thought and serious reflection. We must feed the soul as well as the body, or we shall fail to reach the heavenly abode for which we are striving. * * * * If we have choice poultry we should give them choice treatment. So long as the poultry must be confined the greater part of the time, they should be fed regularly three times a day. When poultry get no attention they soon get so that they are not worth looking after. When breeding fowls for profit, we should breed what the market demands. The profits in poultry, as in everything else, depend to a great extent on proper management. Daniel Orcutt. South Family. May, 1893. Sow in the morn thy seed, At eve hold not thy hand; To doubt and fear give thou no heed, Broadcast it o'er the land. Thou knowest not which may thrive, The late or early sown, God keeps the precious germ alive, When and wherever strown. We are promised seed-time and harvest although at the present time the cold, wet weather does not give promise of an early spring, yet we believe our toil will not be in vain. The garden vegetables which were planted two weeks ago are peeping out of the soil. Peas are doing well in spite of the cold winds and rains of the past week. On the 6th inst., a white frost appeared, however we think the buds on the fruit trees which are nearly in bloom will not be damaged by it. A life experience fails to recall a season in which the cherry trees did not bloom by the 6th of May. Apple trees are usually in full bloom by the first week in May, but this year seems to be that May will be deferred until June 1st, when a great change will take place in the weather. Early potatoes usually planted by the 20th of April, are this year only just about ready to go into the ground. Can any one remember an equally late Spring? This being the year for us to expect a supply of apples we are quite hopeful, as last year they were few, and very poor. Grass fields are looking well, and the beautiful shade of green that meets the eye on every hand is delightful to behold. Our meadows are quite well supplied with water just now, as small lakes are visible everywhere. The house-cleaning department are desiring more sunshine for their accommodation, as their work is much retarded by such cold winds and pouring rains, but patience and perseverance willovercome all obstacles, and house renovating will be accomplished sometime. ï¿½Health, the greatest blessing we can desire, now prevails with our family, thanks to the giver of every good and perfect gift. Maria Witham.
