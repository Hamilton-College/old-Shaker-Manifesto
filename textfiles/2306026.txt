'I wosdee if this is the same world I started in' said one, when life's inevitable changes disturbed her daily routine; and closer still would be our comparison, for to-day we would wonder if this is the same world we lived on a week ago. 'Then we could only say, The earth's a field of mud,� The sky's a waterspout.' Now the sky is guiltless of a cloud, and a new life seems infused into all creation. Sowers and planters are out in earnest, it being the first opportunity to work the soil this spring; and they know of a truth that 'If we sow no seed in Spring, we shall look in vain for Autumn fruits.' 'The seasons come and go, to teach men gratitude,' and what numberless other lessons we learn by their ceaseless routine. We plant and sow to the best of our ability, hoping and trusting that the harvest may be sure; but ere the fruition of our hopes, we know not what element of nature will come as a destroyer, or who may be the reapers of what we have sown. If in material things we are so trusting, ought we not thus to toil for the inner life? We may often fail to reap where we have sown, but would it not seem sadder still, to fail of a harvest, because we had not sown. On the 19-20 ult. eastern New York experienced the wildest storm known in this locality for years. It was not a cyclone which comes and goes before you are aware, but wind, sleet and rain which lasted twenty-four hours; the last twelve being the worst, during which time even our large brick building shook. But when we came to learn of barns being blown down, horses, cattle and sheep killed, houses unroofed, etc., in the towns about us, we were again reminded, how cosily we were located among the hills; for though we thought the wind terrific, it did not assist the Brethren in the least, to remove an unsightly shed by the tannery, which a pressure of work still keeps standing. So though our village is so located that we must climb or descend a hill to reach it, we have our advantages, and as we look at the beautiful pictured landscape about us, we are glad of the sunny days in life, which cause us to forget the storm. Amelia J. Calver. Center Family. May, 1893. Foe the last few days we have had delightful weather, in marked contrast to last week. Commenced gardening on the 9th inst. Sowed parsnip, onion an 1 beet seed for a beginning; farmers planting potatoes; oats, I think are mostly in tlie ground, some of them are up, nicely. To-morrow we intend to have our first meal of asparagus, it has grown nearly or quite twelve inches to-day. Trees are very late in blooming, not a blossom to be seen as yet; the buds are about ready to burst and in a few days, probably the trees will be in full bloom. I was about to say, health of family pretty good, but on second thought am sorry to say, several are on the invalid corps; we hope this beautiful weather will bring us all health and strength. We are glad to hear through the medium of the Manifesto, of the prosperity of our Brethren and Sisters throughout Zion, hence we contribute these lines for the general good. Timothy Rayson. North. Family. May, 1893. We are very much interested in the 'Home Notes'' column, and like to be there in evidence when we can. We do 144 THE MANIFESTO. not mean willfully to neglect any duty, great or small, and we believe it is our duty, as it is our interest and our pleasure to fill our little medium of gospel intercourse, The Manifesto, with such words of encouragement and union as we have, for our gospel relation everywhere. We are full of courage and hope for the future of Zion, are proclaiming the testimony with firmness and confidence, are full of thankfulness for what the gospel has done for us, are keeping good gospel union, and are happy and thankful Zion travelers. The visible result of our missionary effort is small as yet. 'We are somewhat disappointed, but not discouraged. It gave us an opportunity of spreading a knowledge of our faith, and opened a very interesting correspondence with a few. We have not lost hope of gathering some. In any case the effort will not be lost. Some good will be done. We believe it is our duty to try to gather and save souls. We must be alive and active. We do not intend to stagnate. It is our duty to preach the gospel, keep the faith, live the life, and be content to leave the issue with the Author of our being and of our faith. The season being so late makes us exceptionally busy just now. We have been cleaning up premises generally, as we love to have temporal as well as spiritual things in good gospel order. Sisters are as busy as bees, house-cleaning, raking lawn and grass plots, laying out flower beds, etc., and this year they have offered to relieve the Brethren of the care of one of the strawberry beds. Thank God for good zealous Sisters! Brethren are short handed, and the question arose, Shall we hire an extra hand? We decided to hire no more help, but plant and sow only what we could care for with our present help. This is a wise decision. Work for the season has just been laid out and the gift of the Elders is to have everybody interested and make every one comfortable. To this end we have just adopted the plan of rising, for this season of the year, at five a. m., breakfasting at six, doing such chores as are possible in the meantime. The milking to be done alter breakfast. We have been in the habit of rising at 4-30 a. m. and milking before breakfast, but it has frequently been a hurrying time to get through and in the house in time for breakfast. We hope the new arrangement will enable us to commence the day more pleasantly for all. May 12th, just commenced putting in grain. Cows just out to pasture, but very short feed yet. Delightful weather the past three days. Walter S. Shepherd. Shakers, N. Y.. Second Family. May, 1893. On what topic can we write that will be of interest to all concerned? is a hard question to answer. Surely, if we write for Home Notes we must write of home and home surroundings, whatever they may be; and as the weather, if fair and pleasant or the opposite, has an influence on home and individuals, so will the weather always come in for a share of attention; and as we write from Maine to Kentucky, it gives us a chance to see the extremes of the elements. We at present have an abundance of rain, and though the grass is green, warm weather is yet afar off. It is a poor time to get in crops. Still we were fortunate enough to sow all our oats in April. Have planted a few early potatoes, peas, &amp;c. in the garden for family vise. We are always sorry to chronicle illness, while we feel it is a sin to be sick, especially when we are well. If that be the case we shall have to confess, and try to get well. We have had many cases of La Grippe in our Society, and a few cases of measles. We hope and trust all will get well and none of the cases prove fatal. Let us so live that when our time comes we may be prepared to obey the summons. Isaac Anstatt. THE MANIFESTO. 145 North Family. May, 1893. In recording Home Notes for the month, the very pleasant one is remembered of receiving as a present for our library, a copy of Canon Farrar's 'Life of Christ,' from our dear friend, J. G. Toepper of Washington, D. C. It is an illustrated work of seven hundred and sixty-five pages, and will be a companion to Munkacsy's 'Christ before Pilate,' of which we have a very fine copy three feet by two mounted and placed in the entrance hall of our home at the north. We can affirm by personal knowledge that the efforts of those here who minister the testimony of the higher life in our meetings for spiritual communion are successful. We have been greatly blest by the outpourings of the spirit that we have felt in those seasons, proving conclusively that there are those here who have come up through ^leep tribulation and are in truth virgin souls. La Grippe has been placing its grip upon some of the household, but it has been bidden to depart to the desert with the rest of the evil conditions. We are favored with plenty of moist weather at present, retarding farming operations somewhat; but trust it will be all right if we patiently wait. Hamilton DeGraw. West Pittsfleld. May, 1893. Deak Editor:�So much to interest, instruct, and fill our minds with high and holy thoughts do we find on the pages of each issue of your excellent publication, that we can not fail to realize our obligation to respond occasionally to the call for Home Notes. May came to us in a tearful mood and continued to weep almost incessantly the first week of her sojourn here, but now she is radiant with smiles and appears in her true colors. Vegetation is full of life, and the earth is donning her robe of emerald green. Our live stock consisting of one hundred and fifty head of cattle and fifteen horses, have nearly consumed our large supply of hay�there will be only about twenty tons remaining. In some former seasons there have been seventyfive or a hundred tons to carry over. Water-pipes, that Rip Van Winkle like, went to sleep last Decenber, have awakened, and so far as ascertained are mostly in sound condition. Considering the backwardness of the season,'farm work is progressing finely. Fire wood is mostly prepared for another year, lumber sawed and put in condition for seasoning. Some repairs are being made; at the office the walls and woodwork of each hall have been given a new coat of paint, which brightens and improves their appearance wonderfully. The brick dwelling is being renovated by the aid of paint and varnish. The kitchen and all rooms in the basement, with some others, are being thus renewed. The floor has been relaid in the large dining room, making it seem more cosy and pleasant when the family meet there, which is one thousand and ninety-five times a year. Notwithstanding all this pressure of home cares and responsibilities, Br. Ira is also conducting repairs at the grist mill. New steel beams are being put in the basement to support the weighty machinery, in place of the large timbers which have done service there the past twenty-nine years, and had begun to decay. A new brick blacksmith's shop is to bo erected over there the present season, on the corner where the old wooden shop now stands, and is to be 30x50 feet and roofed with slate. School opened for the summer term on the 24th ult. with a lower number of pupils than usual. Julia L. Street. Shaker Station, Conn. May, 1893. 'Put on the whole armor of God,' and keep it on. This is wise counsel. In the race for eternal life faithful crossbearing is requisite. Nothing truly noble 146 THE MANIFESTO. is gained without work, persistent, persevering, patient work. 'No pruning, no fruit; no battle, no victory; no cross, no crown.' No difficulties too great to be conquered. No danger in the path where Jesus leads. If we would shun sin, we must shun all that leads to sin. There is no better way to bear our own trials and afflictions than in trying to give comfort and joy to others. Sometimes a word of warning, caution or entreaty saves a soul from spiritual ruin and death. We must wear in eternity what we weave in time. Where purity is, a quiet spirit dwells. It is best to lay out some course of religious reading that will give us food for thought and serious reflection. We must feed the soul as well as the body, or we shall fail to reach the heavenly abode for which we are striving. * * * * If we have choice poultry we should give them choice treatment. So long as the poultry must be confined the greater part of the time, they should be fed regularly three times a day. When poultry get no attention they soon get so that they are not worth looking after. When breeding fowls for profit, we should breed what the market demands. The profits in poultry, as in everything else, depend to a great extent on proper management. Daniel Orcutt. South Family. May, 1893. Sow in the morn thy seed, At eve hold not thy hand; To doubt and fear give thou no heed, Broadcast it o'er the land. Thou knowest not which may thrive, The late or early sown, God keeps the precious germ alive, When and wherever strown. We are promised seed-time and harvest although at the present time the cold, wet weather does not give promise of an early spring, yet we believe our toil will not be in vain. The garden vegetables which were planted two weeks ago are peeping out of the soil. Peas are doing well in spite of the cold winds and rains of the past week. On the 6th inst., a white frost appeared, however we think the buds on the fruit trees which are nearly in bloom will not be damaged by it. A life experience fails to recall a season in which the cherry trees did not bloom by the 6th of May. Apple trees are usually in full bloom by the first week in May, but this year seems to be that May will be deferred until June 1st, when a great change will take place in the weather. Early potatoes usually planted by the 20th of April, are this year only just about ready to go into the ground. Can any one remember an equally late Spring? This being the year for us to expect a supply of apples we are quite hopeful, as last year they were few, and very poor. Grass fields are looking well, and the beautiful shade of green that meets the eye on every hand is delightful to behold. Our meadows are quite well supplied with water just now, as small lakes are visible everywhere. The house-cleaning department are desiring more sunshine for their accommodation, as their work is much retarded by such cold winds and pouring rains, but patience and perseverance willovercome all obstacles, and house renovating will be accomplished sometime. �Health, the greatest blessing we can desire, now prevails with our family, thanks to the giver of every good and perfect gift. Maria Witham.
