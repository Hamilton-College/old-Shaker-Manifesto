THE PRESS [Evening Register, Hudson.} ' The Shaker and Shakeress.' This is the title of an exceedingly neat quarto publication, issued monthly by the Shaker Society at Mount Lebanon, and ably edited by Elder Frederick W. Evans. While it must be a powerful auxiliary to the Society in whose interests it is conducted, from the high tone of its general contents and the literary ability it displays, it cannot fail to be popular with a large class outside the Shaker community. We welcome it to our table.
