'The Shaker.' I look upon thy simple page, And feel thy mission in my soul; The light that gleam'd from age to age May now shine forth without control. The myriad watch-fires of the Past, With thine their sacred flames shall blend ; And brazen sceptres there be cast, Until oppression's rule shall end. Let not thy searching power slack, Till honored falsehoods come to shame , Till fettering gyve, and torturing rack, Shall melt before thy burning flame. Those agonies the soul must feel, From Error's grasp upon the mind, More painful are than piercing steel, Or iron chains, that clog and bind. How slow Creation's lengthen'd plan Crept on, through periods untold ; From molten globe, to reasoning man, What lessons we shall yet unfold! And history's demotic leaf, Her primer-books grotesque and rude, The heart no longer chill with grief; For now it reads the March of good! Go forth, thou Shaker, shake the earth ; Let her foundations feel thy power, Until establish'd is her worth, And truth and glory are her dower. Go forth and shake the heavens too ; Let thunders roll and lightnings flash ; Let God's eternal law be true, Though man-made systems rend and crash. 'Tis not for creed, nor sect, nor name, That thou slialt speak the word of might; 'Tis not for mortals' wealth nor fame ; But for the holy cause of Right. Go forth ! Work miracles of love! Heal every soul now sick of sin! Go, like the spirit of the Dove, The weary, hopeless heart to win! Thou art the instrument of God ; Keep pure from every earthly taint; Be simple as the shepherd's rod ; And fervent, as the guileless saint. Go forth, and prayers thy course shall speed, Shall fill thee as a gentle gale ; Bear unto every heart its need : The Angels guide! thou cans't not fail. C. D'V.
