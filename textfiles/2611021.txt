A Remedy for Dandruff. Having suffered much inconvenience from dandruff, and having resorted to many advertised nostrums and other means for relief, among which were various alcoholic solutions of castor oil and washing the scalp with solutions of borax and carbonate of potassa, which latter, although effectual from the relief of the dandruff, seemed to impiirthe vitality of the hair, and cause it to become very sensibly thinner, was finally induced, from my knowledge of the frequent efficacy of sulphur in certain cutaneous affections, to try a preparation of an ounce of the flowers of sulphur in a quart of water, as follows, with the happiest results. The sulphur was repeatedly agitated in the water during intervals of a few hours, and the clear liquid then poured off, with which the head was saturated every morning. In a few weeks every trace of dandruff had dissappeared, and the hair became soft and glossy. After discontinuing the treatment for eighteen months there is no return of the disease. The remedy is highly recommended. Medical Journal.
