THE PRIDE OF LIFE. LOUIS BASTING. ' Oh, why should the spirit of mortal bo proud? Like a swift gliding meteor, like a fast gliding cloud; Like a flash of the lightning, as a break in the wave, lie passes from life to his rest in the grave. ' The above are the opening lines of Abraham Lincoln's favorite poem, which he often recited to his intimate friends, though he had reached the loftiest heights of human greatness. An:1, why should any human being be proud? By what right, inherent or acquired, can any one assume to look with disdain upon another ? All have the same origin and the same destiny ; all are sprung from the same earth ; their life-sustaining necessities are the same, and death gathers all in one common grave. But ' wherever civilization has established itself, there will the people divide themselves into ranks and classes. There will be the high and low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, the refined and the brutal; there will be the moral and the vicious, the religious and the profane. These distinctions are the result of individual action, limited and controlled by social and natural conditions. But their existence would not justify the indulgence of pride, since all are dependent upon each other ; and it is unwise and unreasonable, and a prolific source of weakness. For he in whose heart it has entered loses the capacity of properly judging his environment; as he magnifies himself he correspondingly belittles others, and his plans are apt to be defeated. As long as Home was just and virtuous she was great, but when pride and self-glorification became the ruling passion, her decline and fall began. The history of the Jewish nation exhibits the most startling picture of self-defeated pride and arrogance. Called to be the chosen people above all others, they willingly accepted the call, but never, as a people, fulfilled the conditions upon which it was based. They became blinded in their self-importance. The Messiah was to be a Jew who would thrash the nations round-about, and Jews were to be the rulers of the world. Their utter contempt for other nations is Avell illustrated in the conversation Jesus had with the Phoenician woman. ' The cutting irony with which he referred to the gentiles as '* dogs, ' evidently reflected not on his own personal feelings, but the national Jewish aversion ; and his great heart instantly melted in compassion at the woman's answer. With the rejection of the great truths promulgated by Jesus, they lost even that which they had�their nationality and the protective power of the Mosaic law. The worst and most inconsistent form of pride is that which shelters itself under the cloak of religion. Where that .spirit exists it will kill the spiritual life of the soul as surely as it destroyed the national life of the Jews. Was it not against religious pride that the keenest iuvectives of-Jesus were directed? It stop* all progress. The proud heart is .satisfied with itself. It worships self. Charity and Love, the cardinal virtues of the Christian religion, have no dwelling-place there. We cannot love or sympathize with that for which we feel contempt. Why should any one be proud? What have we to be proud of! Is it our personal appearance? We know that ere many years have passed the iron iiuger of time will have traced indelible lines in the fairest countenance ; and we also know that the smile of innocence and the kindly eye of sympathy and good will can illumine the homeliest face with a beauty which mere regularity of feature can never give. Js it knowledge and scientific love? Let us remember how very little we know even of the things nearest to us and concerning us most. Was it not but yesterday, as it were, that we discovered that the blood circulated in our bodies? How few there are who can name the trees and plants, the birds, the insects and rocks that are all around us ! Or who can solve the mighty mystery hidden in that sun that daily shines upon us, upon which our very lives depend? Who can say what feeds those fires that are forever burning and glowing? There are so many things connected with our lives that are utterly inexplicable to the human understanding, there are such mighty evidences of infinite power, compared to which the feeble efforts of man are almost unappreciable, that pride appears to be absurd, grotesque and ridiculous. Yet there is one form of pride which is not to be condemned, but rather to be commended. It is the pride of character, self-respect and proper self-esteem. The possessor of that quality of mind� and no man's character can be complete without a proper share of it�is careful of his reputation, he will not stoop to low and ignoble acts because he would thereby lower himself in his own estimation and in that of others. The philosopher Kant expresses that sentiment when he says : tkI, in my own person, will not violate the dignity of humanity. ' George Washington is the type of such a character. But a false and sinful pride stands condemned by God and the Christian religion. Jesus was the embodiment of self-respecting meekness, of God-fearinghumility. The apostle John says that the pride of life is of the world and not of the Father. To what depths of crime, sin and suffering, pride has led ! It kindles the 1ires of ambition, the love of rule, the lust of power : it stops at no obstacle, it overrides every consideration of religion and morality, of law and equity, to satisfy its insatiate eraviugs. The great tyrants, those arch-criminals, that have cursed mankind with tliaif existence, were both proud and ambitious. It is but a step from pride to hate, and hate has its ultimate in murder. The climax, the very insanity of pride, is well represented by Milton, who causes Satan to say : '� I would rather reign in hell than serve in heaven.' And with those words lie has discovered and laid bare the source of all pride ; it is the unwillingness to serve, or to be subject to any power, whether it be of God or of man. . The unrepentant sinner is a rebel who defies God ; lie rejects salvation because it imposes restraint upon a lawless nature. Blinded by pride and self-love he refuses to submit to him whose }Toke is easy and whose burden is light. He fails to see that after all the only slavery, the only ignoble servitude, is subjection to sin, and that the only true freedom and genuine liberty is found in the truth of God. From pride. 0 Lord ! deliver us. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
