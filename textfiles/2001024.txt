Groveland, N. Y. Dec. 6. 1889. On the 20th of last month Br. Hamilton DeGraw made a very agreeable visit at the Watervliet Society, in N. Y. We were very much pleased to hear from the friends of that place, and thrice glad to hear from them through a living witness. His call there was made doubly interesting by meeting with the Central Ministry who were with them at the time. The Society here is in favor of a 'village improvement board,' and conclude it will prove to be the best board we have known for many years. Since Br. Daniel Offord, has offered, we see, A plan for improving our Homes, we agree That 'traipsing thro' mud,' thro' bushes and briers, Consumes useful tim, while patience expires. But 'cast up a highway with stones gathered out,' 'Twill add to the beauty of Home, there's no doubt. Another blest feature, 'twill lighten life's cares, For then we'll have less of the sowing of tares. 20 THE MANIFESTO. We are having a few days of warm, sunny weather and some are improving the time to the best advantage possible, by trimming the shade trees of which we are blest with almost an unknown quantity. Farmers finished harvesting beets, Oct. 22, of which we have twenty-three tons, all raised from one and one-eighth acre. (This beats all.) The threshing of wheat was completed November 18, and by Scripture measure, we now count 2074 bushels. Surely the sowers of good seed shall reap a rich reward. G. D. G.
