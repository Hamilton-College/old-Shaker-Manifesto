TREASURE IN HEAVEN BY JOHN G. SAXE [What I spent I had; what I Left I lost; what I f/ave I ham.—Old Epitaph-} Every coin of earthly treasure We have lavished upon earth, For our simple worldly pleasure May be reckoned something worth ; For the spending was not losing, Though the purchase were but small, It has perished with the using, We have had it—that is all. All the gold we leave behind us, When we turn to dust again Though our avarice may blind us, We have gathered quite in vain : Since we neither can direct it, By the winds of fortune tossed, Nor in other worlds expect it, What we hoarded we have lost. But each merciful oblation (Seed of pity wisely sown,) What we give in self negation, We may safely call our own ; For the treasure freely given Is the treasure that we hoard, Since the angels keep in Heaven What is lent unto the Lord!
