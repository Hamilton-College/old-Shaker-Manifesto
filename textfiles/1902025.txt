CONQUER THYSELF. Julia M. Lincoln. This is a duty that every one must perfor n for themselves, 110 other person can do it for them, they can be assistants to them ;md give good advice and counsel, but no one can do another's work. Solomon said, 'w He that eouquereth his spirit, is greater than he thai taketh a city,' truly so. In the past ages, and even in this day, men are considered great, and are extolled over the whole world, who conquer and overthrow cities and kingdoms ; no matter how sinful their hearts are, if they have d tie some great external thing, that is all they deem necessary to the building up of their characters. It is those who subdue aud govern their envy, pride, hatred, revenge, jealousy and every passion that is within, that are true conquerors. They will win a crown jeweled with good deeds, far surpassing the diadems that earthly monarchs ever wore, and their names will command greater praise than those of the greatest warriors in the world. We often read of Jesus, the Nazarene, he was a true hero and conqueror, we count him greater for his good works tnan any king who reigned iu his time ; he had subdued his passions to such a degree, that in the most trying hours of his crucifixion, he prayed that his heavenly Father would pardon his persecutors. Through all his trial? and afflictions, lie never retaliated, but bore suffering with meekness and patience. He conquered all feelings of envy and jealousy, and was therefore clothed with the spirit of the heavenly dove. Conquer thyself! How these words thrill our beings and teach us that we are not yet perfect; it teaches us when we feel a spirit of faulting and anger toward another, that we have not yï¿½*t been redeemed from all wrong. We are all human and must throw a mantle of charity and forbearance, over one another's frailties, in this way we will at last come off conquerors. It will not be our great deeds that will recommend us to our heavenly home, when we leave the mortal form, but it will be a well-spent life of goodness, wherein we have conquered self, and overcome every evil propensity.
