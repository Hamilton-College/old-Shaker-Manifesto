Sanitary. That the rind, or 'skin,' of all fruit is more or less... That the rind, or 'skin,' of all fruit is more or less indigestible is a fact that should not be forgotten. We say all fruit, and the statement must be understood to include the pellicle of kernels and nuts of all kinds. The edible part of fruit is peculiarly delicate, and liable to rapid decomposition if exposed to the atmosphere : it is, therefore, a wise provision of nature to place a strong and impervious coating over it, as a protection against accident, and to protect insect enemies from destroying the seed within. The skin of plums is wonderfully strong compared with its thickness, and resists the action of water and many solvents in a remarkable manner. If not thoroughly masticated before taken into the stomach, this skin is rarely, if ever, dissolved by the gastric juice. In some cases, pieces of it adhere to the coats of the stomach as wet paper clings to bodies, causing more or less disturbance or inconvenience. Raisins and dried currants are particularly troublesome in this way, and, if not chopped up before cookine:, should be thoroughly chewed before swallowing. If a dried currant passes into the stomach whole, it is never digested at all. Popular Science News.
