How the French do How the French do.—The French butcher separates the bones from his steaks, and places them where they will do the most good. The housewife orders just enough for each person and no more, even to the coffee. If a chance visitor drops in, somebody quietly retires and the extra cup is provided, but nothing extra by carefulness of intention, when the little range is extinguished, and waits for another time. No roaring cook-stoves and red-hot covers all day long for no purpose but waste. The egg laid to-day costs a little more than one laid last week. Values are nicely estimated, and the smallest surplus is carefully saved. A thousand little economies are practiced, and it is respectable to practice them. Cooking is an economical as well as sanitary and gustatory science. A French cook will make a franc go as far as an American housewife will make three, and how much further than the American Bridget nobody knows—we should probably be greatly astonished, could the computation be made, how much of the financial, recuperative powers of France is owing to her soups and cheap foods ; better living after all, than the heavy bread and greasy failures of our culinary ignorance. —Home and Farm.
