PREPARE YE THE WAY. M. W. Salford. 'I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness ; Make straight the way of the Lord.' ï¿½St. John, i., 23. The people were curious, and asked : 'Who is he, This man who is preaching in fair Bethany?' So they sent off the Pharisees, Priests and Levites To ask him concerning his baptismal rites : 'Art thou Christ ? Art thou Elias ? or who mayst thou be?' 'Nor Christ, nor Elias, nor Prophet,' said he : 'But the voice of one crying 'prepare ye the way : The Kingdom of God is upon you to-day, The crooked make straight and the rough ways make plain, And all flesh shall see God's salvation ag'ain.' But One is amongst you, whom ye do not know, A greater than I, One to whom 1 bend low; He will grant, what I preach, the remission of sin, The Christ who is coming; oh, listen to Him.' The Catholic.
