Hens C. Hens lay eggs and keep them warm. The hen will have some chickens and when they get old enough to go out the mother hen will take them out to walk in the fields and catch some grasshoppers to eat. Then they go and dig in the dirt and get some bugs and worms to eat. This is all I will say about hens now.
