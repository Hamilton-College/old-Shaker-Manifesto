SPIRITUAL GARMENTS. Alonzo G. Hollister. MOTHER ANN told a certain Sister that she would find her nature like the coats of an onion. When she had stript off one, she would find another under it, and so on till she came to the core. What is the core of human life ? Is it not the heart with its varied affections and interests ? 'The heart is the governing part. 'Tis the heart the hand doth wait for.'' The outside coats of an onion, unfold from within. They are not put on as are our earthly garments. The matter composing them, is drawn from the soil by fine rootlets, and from air by the leaves, and the vital chemistry of the plant, forms within and thrusts outward the matter which constitutes the exterior coats of the vegetable. Just so with the human being spiritually. The garments worn by the spirit are not manufactured from foreign substances and put on from outside as our earthly garments. The garment of the human spirit is its character. The least spiritual of my readers know what character is. They know it is not made as a mechanic makes a machine. It is not woven in an iron or wooden loom. It is not cut out of some stuff by a pattern and sewed together as a tailor makes garments from cloth. Yet in speaking figuratively we say without being misunderstood character is woven in the loom of life. In the upright and virtuous it is formed by pattern, Jesus Christ being the purest and best. But there are many patterns of particular virtues and graces. Hence we say he or she is a pattern of meekness. Another is a pattern of industry, another of constancy and faithfulness in duty, another of self-control all of which virtues and many others are elements of the true Christian character. One may be a pattern of all these and many more. Whoever give? serious, thought to this subject can see that character is not a sudden creation nor is it subject to transfer but it grows from the heart of the wearer or from within outward. The finer, vital and more sensitive part is within. The coarser, tougher, less impressible part is without as protector and conserver of that which is within. The heart has its rootlets of affection which are like magnets that draw from whatever the thoughts feed upon, the material which is elaborated in the mind and thrust forth in conduct, whereby it is made fast in the web of life. In this way we are continually weaving our spiritual garments out of our affections, our thoughts and our conduct. Now it is plain that if our hearts are pure, and our affections clean no defiled thing can enter nor adhere to become part of our spiritual garment. If it pass in review or jostle us in the crowd it will be put aside as with tongs and leave no shade nor stain upon the perfect transparency of our minds. And if we subject ourselves to order, fulfilling all stipulations of our covenant in the gospel there will be no break nor flaw in the character we weave. It will be that of wise and noble sons and daughters, of God. Our thoughts when free from service required by temporal duties instead of turning to the world for satisfaction, will be attracted to the higher and substantial things of our existence. We shall delight in meditating on the things that belong to our peace that we may draw from thence the jewels of Christian grace and virtue which will adorn our conduct and beautify ou*r spirits. Such souls are co-workers with God and thereby add to the felicity and glory of heaven, making a heaven wherever they dwell. But if the heart is impure, what then? Jesus taught, From within, out of the heart, proceeds evil reasoning, i. e. false reasoning. The natural heart of man is the field in which the Father sowed only good seed, but the enemy while men slept, or were careless or thoughtless, neglecting their true interest, sowed his tares. Jesus said to the Pharisees who were relying on ceremonial performances for justification,�Ye appear unto men to fast, but God knows your hearts. Hypocrites make clean the outside of the cup and platter but within are full of extortion and all manner of excess. First make clean the inside of the cup or platter, the heart, which leavens all, and the outside will be clean also. The Apostle tells us,�The law can not take away sin, nor make the comers thereto perfect, because it was weak through the flesh, the works of which it condemned without abolishing them. It was given to restrain transgression ; to bind man's lawless nature till the seed should come whose are the promises of eternal redemption. This refers to the woman's seed that was to crush the Serpent's head, the sensual nature, and purify the heart by confession and repentance. All the righteousness of the world and all its systems of religion can not take away sin from the heart. They may restrain sinful desires within narrowl imits and the most virtuous do, but only by continual conflict. The gospel of Christ in a virgin life, as taught in his second appearing,� the gospel of the harvest of the world through cross bearing,�the gospel which proclaims the season of God's judgment now come, obeyed, will take away sin completely and so purify the heart that sin can not return. Those worldly professors claiming to be rightful interpreters of the will of God to man who teach that it is impossible to keep the commandments of God and to live in this world without sinning, do thereby accuse God of being arbitrary, unjust, tyrannous and cruel, severely punishing his creatures for not doing impossible things. Such have evidently adopted a false ideal of God and are blinded by the false prophet who teaches lies in the name of God and of religion for gain and whose end is destruction in the second death. The true prophet teaches us to crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts on the daily cross of Christ and to expose all its hidden works to the light in his Witnesses. This cross and the testimony of truth that attends it is the ax that is laid at the root of the tree of human depravity to hew it down and cast it into the fire of truth which every true Christian must necessarily pass through to become refined and separated from the dross of nature. For as the Apostle saye,�They that are in the flesh can not please God, because the carnal mind is enmity against God. It is not subject to the law of God neither can it bo. It is therefore lawless and all who yield to be led by it are its bond-slaves and come under the same category of inability and lawlessness. May all my young readers carefully attend to the following reflection. Our material bodies are like a chemical laboratory wherein the vital action extracts the finest essences of food, drink and air which are used by the spirit in constructing its future mansion or psychic body in which it must dwell and which it takes with it until it has ripened for further change. In this body is the record or stored up fruits of all the deeds and experiences of things done in the body and they can be read like an open book by comrades and superiors in the spirit spheres,�except those which have been erased by confession and repentance. As it is easier to change the forms of figures while they are being woven into cloth than it is after the piece is finisht and taken out of the loom so it is easier to weave beautiful spiritual garments by carefully regulating our motives and conduct while in time by the law and testimony of the gospel, than it will be afterward to remove the effects of negligence and exchange deformity for the splendors which would have been and are the result of discipline in the way of the pure heart.
