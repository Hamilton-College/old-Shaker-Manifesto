Ladies' Home Journal Ex-President Harrison will conclude his series of papers on life in the White House in the May Ladies' Home Journal, and take a respite from his literary labors which have so profitably and congenially occupied him for more than a year. General Harrison is the first President to show the public through the White House, upstairs, downstairs, etc. and to detail the President's daily routine, and the social and domestic phases of life in the Executive Mansion. He is also the first Chief Magistrate to crystalize his knowledge and the experience gained as Chief Executive in a series of lucid, instructive and interesting magazine articles on the functions of our government, such as were 'This Country of Ours' papers.
