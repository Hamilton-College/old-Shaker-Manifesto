THE CURSE OF TOO MUCH PROSPERITY The Springfield Republican ascribes all the troubles which have lately come upon the North Hadley fa/mers to the curse of tobacco growing. The quick and profitable sales of the best tobacco crops induced these farmers, as well as those in the other valley towns, to discount the future, and accordingly paper was freely given and freely indorsed. The failure of one therefore brought disaster to others. The first to go under was H. C. &amp; A. P. Russell for about $31,000; then S. S. Hibbard followed with liabilities amounting to about $20,000 and B. P. Hubbard for $30,000. Thaddeus Smith failed for $100,000, and his estate is to be sold at auction on the fifth of June. H. C. Comins, President of the Hampshire Agricultural Society, is in the list, and his property has been attached for indorsing Francis Smith's paper, who is also in trouble. L. W. Hibbard's mortgage has been foreclosed, and his place sold. Henry E. Smith will soon be a bankrupt with $20,000 liabilities; the father of the bankrupt Russells will go down in a few days with liabilities for about $30,000 and about $15,000 assets. Edson Martin's creditors have compromised for 50 cents on a dollar. The community is greatly prostrated by this succession of business failures among the leading men in the place. All the bankrupts were principally tobacco growers.
