Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. May, 1896. There is so much to write that is lovely and fair, That I scarcely know where to begin it, nor where It is best to conclude, but will keep to the rule That stands on the square of four fifties, nor let My words 'yond the Editor's limit to roam' Lest in future he begs me to keep them at home. Earth and air, sea and sky are in grand competition, Each seeks to be first in their beautiful mission, God might have created a handsomer sphere, But he surely did not, perfect beauty is here. The spring work advances, and over the land The bountiful sower outstretches his hand, Already the sowing counts up by the score, For the Brethren have sowed forty acres or more. The Sisters are sewing a different way, With success that THE MANIFESTO. 103 is sometimes as varied as May, For the nonce I'd suggest (as all house-keepers can) That our genius all follows tlie housecleaning plan. So, in loving and blessing and helping each other, We find the true friendship cf sister and brother, And over our home like an archway of gold The love of our Parents above we behold, This light and this love lengthening out like a chain Encircles us all from Kentucky to Maine. Cora C. Vinneo.
