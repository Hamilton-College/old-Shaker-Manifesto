FOLLOW ME. Mary L. Wilson. 'Follow me !' O hear the echo Of the Savior's pleading voice; Follow in the light and shadow, In the cross of Christ rejoice. Follow to the banks of Jordan Where the door of Hope is found, Through confession and repentance, Doth thy grace O God, abound. Follow still and I will lead thee Through resistance, love and care; Where the tempter cannot harm thee, To Gethsemane for prayer. Follow me in self-denial, Up the rugged heights of truth ; Follow in the storm and sunshine,ï¿½ Would you gain immortal youth. Follow me all else forsaking, Father, Mother, nearest kin; Husband, wife, thy own life also, If Eternal joys you'd wink Follow to the Mount of Calvary, 'Mid the persecuting throng; As ye meet the crucifixion, Pray, 'God's Will' not mine be done. In my Father's many mansions I've secured a place for thee ; All my living, true disciples, Have a home, in bliss, with me. In the glory of Christ's Kingdom, Lo ! the Comforter we see ; Wisdom, love and mercy given, In salvation, full and free. Canterbury, N. H.
