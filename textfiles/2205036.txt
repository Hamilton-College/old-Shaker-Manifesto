MORNING HERALD. 'And I will rejoice in Jerusalem; and joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.'ISA. lxv., 19. o'er, When the house is set in order, And the tempter comes no more; When with purity of purpose Thy whole life to God is given; All the world cannot contain it, It will rise for joy to Heav'n. Canterbury, N. H. 1891 O, there'll be a song of triumph,When the battle days are MORNING HERALD. It will rise, a morning herald, Of Mt. Zion's travail here, And the hosts beyond the limit, Of the temple and the sphere Will repeat, 'as in Heaven, Upon earth thy will is done;' For 'thy kingdom' is established, Glorious victories are won.
