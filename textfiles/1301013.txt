DOES THE WORLD MOVE? From earliest childhood, I had a constitutional aversion to cannibalism, in all its forms. It was only by the kindest persuasions of my Sainted mother that I consented to eat as others ate. She didn't want me to be so odd. At Watervliet, April 6, 1820, I found the Shakers. They had an enfilading fire against 'The Flesh,' their own flesh. The flesh of swine, cattle, sheep, fowls and fishes was not contraband of their war on 'the flesli,' nor was Cider Beer, Rum or Tobacco. On the Holy Sabbath, we were served with lordly dishes of extra, luscious, flesh meat. When, in 1837, the Heavens began to draw near to liberate Zion, it was graciously vouchsafed unto purity loving souls, to abstain from THE MANIFESTO. 13 meat-eating and its concomitants, on the one day in seven. This was the beginning of miracles. In ecstasies of delight, I wrote, impromptu, the following jingle. Of all the days in seven, I like the Sabbath best! For this, through gracious Heaven, is made a day of rest, A rest for men and oxen, for horses, cows and sheep, For turkeys, hens and chickens, and all the beasts we keep !! Now, 1882, Purity loving souls may abstain, as aforesaid, Seven days in seven. Does the world move? Heavens without end are before us ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
