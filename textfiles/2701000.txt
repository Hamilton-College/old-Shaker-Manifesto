JANUARY By Martha J. Anderson Out of the tempest, storm and sleet, Comes the New Year calm and sweet; With crystal air, and sky so blue, And mountain tipped with golden hue; For the sun has bared his gleaming breast, Like a shining shield o'er the hills' white crest; And the virgin snow, like a quiet shroud, Outvies the white-winged fleeting cloud, As o'er the earth like a mantle spread It covers the germs of the sleeping dead. Ah! spring will reveal the life it holds, 'Neath the sparkling sneet of its many folds; And the cloud that floats in the azure sky Will empty its blessing by and by. But the day moves on so calm and still, There is scarcely a sound from vale or hill, Save the crack of the teamster's whip I hear As the woodman's loaded sled draws near ; Or lowing of cattle housed and warm, Far better sheltered from cold and storm Than many of earth's dejected poor Who ask for succor without our door. JANUARY, 1897. THE MANIFESTO. This day's delights my heart beguiles, With its outer glow and its inner smiles ; For home abounds with blessings meet, For thankful heart or wayward feet. And just as the placid day declines, Full many a thought my soul defines, And many a new resolve is made To turn from paths where feet have strayed, And walk in the ways of love and peace, That life may be blest in the year's increase. Then the seasons all will hallowed be, As the holy bond of unity Binds heart to heart with friendship warm, That lives through sunshine, cold and storm; That bears through trials, doubts and fears, And strengthens with increasing years.
