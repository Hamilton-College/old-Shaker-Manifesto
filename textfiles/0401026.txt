THE REWARD OF SACRIFICE God will lead forth to fountains pure, And robe in love divine, The souls that follow Christ in truth And all to Him resign. He will uphold the constant mind, Through envy's fiery darts, And spread before the valiant soul The rest that faith imparts. He will uproot the strange, wild vine, And sow the precious seed, That Christ may keep, and angels bless In truth and very deed. And He will raise an ensign high Above the false and vain, And call the honest and sincere Its glory to sustain. For them a house He will create, With treasures rich and rare, Which shall have power to elevate And bless each loyal heir. And, when they pass from death to life, New prospects shall appear; And they shall walk the golden streets With kindred spirits dear. And He will place within each breast The snow-white dove of peace, And safe shall be their heritage Whose joys shall never cease. He'll cause them there in strength to grow. And bloom in endless light, Where seraphs and bright angels meet With anthems of delight. Betsy F. Maynard, Harvard, Mass.
