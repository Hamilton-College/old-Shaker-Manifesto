NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Item first. We have finished the harvesting of our Sweet Corn, picked the most of our pears, and dug part of our late potatoes. 2nd. Have painted the Horse Barn, and commenced on the old dairy building which assumes a vastly improved appearance. We shall have a very light crop of apples. T. R. Vegetarianism. Elder F. W. Evans, writes, 'In the North Family of some sixty people, there are but few who use flesh meat, and these few but little. Our experience is that vegetables, fruits and farinacea affoid ample nourishment for all the normal wants of the system. The laborer is well supported and the cook is much relieved. The moral and spiritual advantages are just what any thoughtful person would naturally expect. With more freedom from disease comes more comfort and cheerfulness ; peace flows easily, like a river toward the great ocean of universal love to God, and good-will to the animal creation, including all the races of mankind.' Oct. 11. We have had a splendid Fall; no frost to do any damage. Have finished picking our apples to-day and have about 600 bushels for winter. Potatoes will yield us about one half a crop. Corn is first-rate. We cut up about all we raised, stalks and ears and put it in the silo. It makes the nicest ensilage and yields the largest amount of milk of any fodder that we have used. Corn put in the silo in this way, we think, makes more butter, or full as much, as unripe corn-stalks with eight quarts of wheat bran, to a cow. On the 5th we had a lovely visit with the Ministry from Canterbury who unconsciously are commencing the second travel or cycle. The testimony of the first cycle was against the life of generation, and the lusts of the flesh. A glorious foundation. The testimony of the second cycle is against a carnivorous life, and the lusts of the stomach. Funeral of Br. D. F. on Sabbath-day. Elder Frederic says, 'There is no mourning in our house to-day, because a long-tried, faithful soul, has passed from this old earth away. He passed through Father�Heavens, above, to Christ�the Resurrection Spheres, where Mother�God is love.' D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. Crops are nearly all harvested; corn was hardly medium. Potatoes some rotted but better than we expected. Apples, poor crop. Tomatoes poor, weather too cold and wet. We are painting the Meeting House and Ministry's Dwelling. The Second Family have just finished filling their silo ; they cut their fodder with a steam engine; four horse power, also do their threshing by the same power. Weather remains cold and damp, fall pasture, good. Oct. 6. We are repairing and painting our 'House of Public Worship,' and we think we are making a move in the right direction. We have finished the work of canning Tomatoes, for this season, which has kept us busy for some time past, as we had a large supply. The Potato crop has also been very good, but the Corn has been injured by the wet weather and the Apples to be kept for Winter will be a very limited amount. J. B. Hancock, Mass. At the fair held at Pittsfield for the benefit of the House of Mercy, a department exhibiting artistic fancy work, choice sweet-meats, useful mats, rugs, etc.,�all the product of the Sisters' skillful labor, was gracefully presided over by El dress Sophia Helfrich. A new shaft 125 ft. deep, is being sunk at the iron-ore-mine. This is expected to reach the lowest vein of the mineral, which is pronounced by experts to be of a very superior quality ; large quantities of it being present. Additions and improvements to machinery and buildings are taking place. At the annual Berkshire Cattle Show, the inventive skill of Believers was worthily represented by a Fertilizer Sower. The machine was invented and patented by Br. Chas. Greaves, of Mt. Lebanon. N. Y. We were delighted to receive a visit from the Canterbury Ministry on Oct. 1. They proceeded the following day to make their yearly call at Mt. Lebanon. A number of successful business expeditions to the neighboring summer resorts, headed ly Eldrefs Emma Strowbridgt? have been made. Elder Albert Battles has shingled and repaired the wood-house attached to the Ministry's Dwelling. The Central Ministry visisted Hancock on the 10th. inst. L. B. East Family. Oct. 14. The appearance of our home is being improved by the painting of the fence in front of tlie buildings. Apples all gathered; have not a large crop, but enough for home use. Potatoes are being harvested, will not have more than half a crop. Turnips and pumpkins, numerous, and of full growth; pumpkins weighing from 25 to 50 pounds. K. D. Canterbury, N. H. This Society is on a high ridge of land, about 900 feet above the sea. It is situated twelve miles N. E. from the city of Concord. The soil is unproductive and requires a liberal supply of manure to force a satisfactory return of grass or hoed crops. For more than thirty years we have favored the covering of the buildings with gravel, and the best workmen were engaged to conduct the business. The experiment has not proved successful. The gravel has been removed from five or six of the buildings, and the roofs are now covered with tin and painted. The honey harvest of N. H. is never very extended, and it would be difficult to count on more than four or five weeks in which to lay up much surplus honey. Some years, however, the bees and their keeper have been made glad, but this season with twenty colonies, not one pound oi surplus honey has been obtained. Enfield, N. H. Oct. 10. With us, autumn duties are being actively performed, potatoes and apples are harvested, and of each kind we have a light crop. For poor people this is very unfavorable. Medicinal roots turning out nicely ; the digging and drying of the same is now being done. The land on the west shore of the Maseoma Lake is of superior quality for tillage, as the soil is very deep and free from stones. Alfred, Me. October, 14, 1889. Beloved Editor ��Your correspondent from this place in Sept. No. of the Manifesto says that twelve buildings have been painted. It should have been twenty. We find it costs less to paint the buildings once in five or six years, than to wait lunger. From eighteen acres of sweet corn, planted, we carried to Ihe Corn Factory, r.ine hundred dollars worth of corn in the hus-k. Four and one half acres of light soil, which yielded but half a ton of hay to the acre, gave us forty-five dollars worth of corn per acre with no manure, except 700 lbs. of Buffalo Phosphate to the acre. From this corn planted, we had more than one hundred tons of silage, which we consider is worth at least four dollars per ton, in the silo. When I tell you that the corn, and six acres more of potatoes and other hoed crops, were planted, cared for and harvested by our own Brethren, without any hired men, and also that one hundred and thirty tons of hay were put into the barns, you will say that they deserved the blessing that attended their labors. [Believers in eyery Society, will say, God bless those Brethren. It is a beautiful record. Ed.] Have had but light frosts, the grass is still green. Your Brother, J. B. Vance. Gloucester, Me. South Poland, Me., Oct. 10, 1889. Dear Henry :�We came up here for a few days, and lo and behold we saw some Sisters at the Hotel with goods for sale, and learned that their Villasre was only three miles away. Yesterday we were driven over to the Village, and who should I meet, (and she knew me) but Sister Mary Ann Hill, (90 yrs. old) who used to be one of our deaconesses, and whom I remembered very well. There is a Canterbury suggestiveness about Gloucester, on account of its hills. We also met a brother that I knew (Samuel Kendrick.) Sister Mary Ann is a perfect encyclopedia of Canterbury reminiscences and was very interesting. B. C. T.
