Gloucester, Me. South Poland, Me., Oct. 10, 1889. Dear Henry :ï¿½We came up here for a few days, and lo and behold we saw some Sisters at the Hotel with goods for sale, and learned that their Villasre was only three miles away. Yesterday we were driven over to the Village, and who should I meet, (and she knew me) but Sister Mary Ann Hill, (90 yrs. old) who used to be one of our deaconesses, and whom I remembered very well. There is a Canterbury suggestiveness about Gloucester, on account of its hills. We also met a brother that I knew (Samuel Kendrick.) Sister Mary Ann is a perfect encyclopedia of Canterbury reminiscences and was very interesting. B. C. T.
