SCENES OF GLORY. Away I have turned from this world's transient glory, From evil and all that the wicked can boast; And have set out for Zion, O hear the glad story, To gain, more than gain, what in Eden was lost. Behold the sweet prospect of life never ending, Here scenes of bright glory will open to you; And as all the strong ties of nature are rending Kind heaven will grant you a life that is new. 'Tis here you may find the true balm of the Spirit, And feast on the bread and the waters of life; Yea, rich treasures eternal may safely inherit, Secure from this world of confusion and strife. Though trials await me the light has descended, The highway of heaven to me has appeared, Though my life it will cost me, I'll not be offended, But keep the straight way which the Lord has prepared.
