THE SHAKER STANDPOINT. F. W. Evans. That our whole souls are with you in the peace cause you well know; you are doing a work, in a part of the Lord's vineyard, that we could neither do, nor�as an order�live without its being done. We are organizing peace, and showing mankind 'a city set upon a hill, that cannot be hid.' Seventeen villages of human beings, of like nature and passions with their fellow men and women, set an example to those who, while professing to be Christians, have individually, and as nations, so perfected the art of killing each other, that England�Christian England� has organized a navy which, in the late review, beat the record of the world�showing war ships that extended over three miles. After nearly 2,000 years, the wicked, worldly Christianity of Christendom�which made China eat opium and buy it of India, and in India, whilst the Christian missionary makes one nominal Christian, the Christian government makes one hundred drunkards�these seventeen villages of people have so crucified in themselves 'the lusts that war in their members,' from whence come all wars, private and public, that they live like the Prince of Peace, celibates, with property in common; having neither magistrates, policecourts, nor prisons. Why may not the whole world be either Quakers or Shakers ? As Quakers, they would not fight; would abolish poverty; educate all children in industrial schools; use marriage only for offspring; would take no oaths, pay no war taxes or tithes, dress plainly, use simple language, and t,41 the truth or keep silence ; would take no part in church and state governments, or monopolize life-elements; thus being a 'new earth.' Or else, as Shakers, forming a 'new heaven,' they would institute the kingdom of heaven upon earth. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
