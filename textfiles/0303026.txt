THE SPIRIT I COVET By Amelia Calver Praying spirit of my Savior, In my heart O, find a place ; Help me, when the night is darkest, When upon the desert waste. When the day seems drear and cloudy, And sweet hope her powers resign, Blessed Savior, be thou near me ; Prayerful spirit, be thou mine. Peaceful spirit of my Savior, Canst thou find a place with me ? Give me power to calm the tempest, While upon Time's billowy sea. I would have my words and actions Bend subservient to thy will; That, should wrath my bosom enter, I can whisper ' Peace, be still.' Steadfast spirit of my Savior, Let me feel thy scepter's sway, Then like thee, I'll tread with firmness Duty's path, in trial's day. Like thee, I will stand unyielding To the lurking charms of ease ; Over self will reign triumphant, Seeking God alone to please. Forgiving spirit of my Savior, Take possession of my heart; When offenses grieve my spirit, Wilt thou then thy balm impart ? Aid me to recall thy sorrows On the crucifixion day, When in sweet and tender accents, ' Forgive them Father,' thou did'st pray. Loving spirit of my Savior, Let me in thy fountains bathe, Ready to renounce all pleasure Which a selfish heart would crave. With thy influence for my guardian, I can for all others care ; Joy with them when joy aboundeth, Likewise of their sorrows share. Healing spirit of my Savior, O could I possess thy power, Gladly every pain I'd banish, Frail humanity restore. Tho' I fail to heal the body, May I not the spirit soothe ? Touch the wounded broken spirit, Healing with the tones of love ? Blessed Savior, thy example E 'er shall be my ' Polar star,' Guiding, though 'mid trackless waters, Pointing on to realms afar. Prayerful, Peaceful, Steadfast, Healing, Loving and Forgiving ever, Blessed spirit of my Savior, O, I pray thee, leave me never. Mt. Lebanon.
