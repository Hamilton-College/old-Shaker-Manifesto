LOSS BY FIRE. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Jan. 9. 1888. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½It becomes my duty to write you of the decease of our brother George W. Smart from Asphyxia. Caused by the explosion of a kerosine lamp. Death followed from suffocation and injuries by burning. Last Saturday evening, Jan. 7, at 8.45, an unusual light was observed in the room occupied by Br. George, which was in the second story of our large store-house, in which was packed a large stock of chairs. It is evident that he was preparing to retire for the night, as the doors were secured and all his duties closed for the day. It is thought that his lamp must have exploded, and in his effort to extinguish the flames, he was prostrated by the smoke and the fumes of gas. In less than ten minutes after the alarm was given, we had our hose attached to the hydrant and a liberal stream of water was soon playing upon the burning building. This is the blessing of having a good reservoir, well supplied with water. The Brethren of the Second Family were soon on the ground with afire extinguisher, and ElderWm. Anderson armed with this entered the building on his hands and knees and succeeded in putting out the fire which the water did not reach. When Br. George was found, he had fallen to the floor, and life had already departed, as the physician from New Lebanon, who was present, gave his testimony. A coroner's in_ quest was held and all the points of law, in regard to such cases, were fullj' carried out. Br. George was one of the most careful men in the Society. Every department that came under his charge was kept in the best order. This is another of the sad cases that we are obliged to report, and which we might hope would never more be repeated. About $4500 worth of chairs and chair stock of webbing and other goods were in the building. The damage by fire and water was estimated to be $300. which was covered by insurance. This was adjusted satisfactorily by the agent of the London and Globe, Niagara and Home Insurance Co's. We can thank God that we still have a home left to us, as it was a most miraculous event that our buildings were saved. Your Brother, Wm. Anderson.
