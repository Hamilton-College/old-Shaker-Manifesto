THE WORLD. ANNA ERVIN. O world of vain amusements, false pleasures, deceitful showers, bitter poisons concealed in luring sweets, mere shadows of happiness, what charms have you for the immortal mind? what food for the starving, craving soul? what healing balm for the wounded heart? Bring all your glittering, precious gold, use all your skillï¿½try all your boasted art, and can you save one frail mortal from the tomb? Nay ' ye have a thousand instruments of death, a thousand means to quench the spark of life, but nothing to preserve the flame alive. And if this mortal body fare thus in thy hands, let not the immortal soul be trusted there. Enfield, Conn.
