Untidy barnyards Untidy Barnyards.—We desire to call the attention of some farmers—there are doubtless but a few—to the untidy condition of their barn and stock yards. In some cases they are filled with broken and disused machinery, rails, pieces of boards full of nails, clubs, etc. We are reminded of this by hearing a farmer remark that he had lost a good colt by its stepping on a rusty nail. There are many animals annually lost from this cause.] The owners, however, are not entitled to sympathy; for a farmer who leaves boards, with nails sticking up, lying around where stock is liable to run, deserves to lose his cattle and colts. See to it at once that all such dangerous articles are piled up where they may dry out and be used for kindling.— Chicago Tribune.
