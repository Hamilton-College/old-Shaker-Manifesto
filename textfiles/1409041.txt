THE SHORE OF ETERNITY. Alone! to land alone upon that shore ! With no one sight that we have seen before; Things of a different hue, And the sounds all new, And fragrance so sweet the soul may faint Alone ! Oh, that first hour of being a saint' Alone ! to land alone upon the shore ! On which no wavelets lisp, no billows roar, Perhaps no shape of ground, Perhaps no sight or sound, No forms of earth our fancies to arrange, But to begin alone that mighty change ! Alone! to land alone upon that shore ! Knowing so well we caii return no more. No voice or face or friend, None with us to attend Our disembarking on that awful strand, But to arrive aione in such a land ! Alone ! to land alone upon that shore, To begin alone to live forevermore, To have no one to teach The manners or the speech Of that new life, or put us at our ease ; Would we might die in pairs or companies! Alone? No, God hath been there long before. Eternally hath waited on that shore For us who were to come To our eternal home; And he hath taught II is angels to prepare In what way we ai:e to be welcomed thereLike one that waits and watches He hath sate, As if there were none else for whom to wait, Waiting for us, for us Who keep him waiting thus And who brings less to satisfy His love Than any other of the souls above. Alone? The God we know is on that shore, The God of whose attractions we know more Than of those who may appear Nearest and dearest here; Oh, is it not the life-long friend we know More privately than any other friend below? Alone? The God we trust is on that shore, The Faithful One, whom we have trusted more In trials and in woes Than we have trusted those On whom we leaned most in eartiily strife, Oh, we shall trust him more in the new life ! Alone? The God we love is on that shore, Love not enough, yet whom we love far more, And whom wre've loved all through, And with a love more true Than other lovesï¿½now shall love him more; True love for him begins upon that shore ! So not alone we land upon that shore; 'Twill be as though we had been there before; We shall meet more we know Than we can meet below, And find our rest like some returning above, And be at home at once with our eternal Love! The Morning Call.
