The Shaker in State Prisons Friend David Sargent has been visiting the Shirley Shakers, and writes us his impressions. He is a man of keen sensibility, deep convictions of the right, and appreciates the life-labors of the Shakers to be ' the oest illustration of Christianity on the face of the earth.1' Friend Sargent superintends Massachusetts' State prison at Charlestown, and it must have been a genuine relief to his care-worn soul and overtaxed body, to visit a people who are not only physically and spiritually free, but are daily crucifying that which would make them otherwise. May the Shakers, that monthly go to State prisons, work out a reformatory influence .with their in' mates; and we would not object, nor be surprised, if many of these preceded in the heavenly race the multitudes of bigoted pharisees. *
