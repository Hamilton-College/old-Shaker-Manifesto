Speak the truth in love Speak the Truth in Love.— Do not advocate a holy life in a scolding and unsanc tified tone. Don't press men to seek perfect peace as if you were driving reluctant animals before you. Don't talk in funeral tones about it, and urge as if the grave was yawning under your feet. It is the high birthright of every child of God to be like Him. You are not in the happiest condition to set it forth unless the ' candle of the Lord ' shines brightly upon your own heart and face. It is a Beulah land where heavenly gales fan the earth, and the fruits of Paradise invite the taste. Encourage the people of God to go up and possess it. Tell them they are well able to do so, although the Anakim may still remain in the land. It is a good thing to carry into the pulpit with you one of the clusters of grapes native to this ' enchanted ground.' There is nothing so impressive and subduing as a real, loving, glowing, melting heart-experience. Let this be seen, and the milk and honey and the fruit of that region will be greatly coveted.— Zion's Herald.
