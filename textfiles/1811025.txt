Sanitary. COL. R. G. INGERSOLL. Col. Eobekt G. Ingersoll has ideas on doctors and physic, and medical treatment, as well as on some other subjects, and in connection with the illness of his friend, Mr. Conkling, he said: 'There is altogether too much gloom about most sick chambers. People tiptoe in and about, ar.d wear long faces and act generally in a way that would make even a well man sick, and is bound to make a sick man worse. I believe many a man has been hurried across the dark river by his horrible, soul-depressing treatment, who might have become well and strong and useful, if he had more sunshine and fresh air in his room, or the odor of flowers to offset the smell of the drugs, and smiling, hopeful countenances about, instead of woe-begone visages, whose every glance betokens the loss of hope and the belief in the speedy dissolution of the pain-racked patient. There was a man from our town named Marcy. He got it into his head that he was going to die. At that time no one was allowed to leave the army for a visit to the North, except on sick leave, or occasionally to accompany the remains of a dead comrade. I saw Marcy and said to him : Now, Marcy, you say you are going to die. If that is so, I don't suppose a few days one way or the other will make much difference to you. I want to go home for a day or two about the 15th, but cannot get a leave of absence. Now, if you want to do me a very great favor and will quit this life, say on the 12th, I can get my coveted leave of absence to take you homeï¿½see? But I knew my man, and he didn't die. He got very angry instead, and recovered, but he declares to this day that it was my proposition that brought him back his old stubbornness and gave him grit to fight for his life. He always did object to being made a mere convenience of.' New York Commercial Advertiser.
