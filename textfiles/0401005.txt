I thank God for our little paper... 'I thank God for our little paper, the ' Shaker and Shakeress ' ; I greatly bless its editor and editress. Much have I learned by perusing it. How thankful I was to have you come and visit us; please to come again as soon as you can. I have now entered into quite a labor of mind against all mental and physical disease. Be so kind as to help me all you can. A great day this is, surely. I want to be a Progressionist, like yourself. I am longing for the time to come when all animals will be in their own climate ; when the lower orders will not have to be slain — yea, more—when they will not have to work to support poor, lazy man. Be so kind as to explain about the ' new heavens and the new earth,' whether those in the latter are to have ' all things common,' the same as the former. Please accept an abundance of love from us all. Your Gospel son, Henry L. Davidson, West Gloucester, Me.
