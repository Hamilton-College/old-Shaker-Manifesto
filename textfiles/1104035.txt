Book Table The enterprising publishers, I. K. Funk &amp; Co., 10 and 12 Dey street, New York, quite outdo our power or space to do full justice. Volume after volume of the most healthy literature issues almost daily from this house. Among the most recent publications are The Preacher's Cabinet, containing 335 verbal illustrations of almost as many topics. It is a multum in parvo, and will be carried in the pockets of many, who cannot better spare 20 cents than purchase an immense encyclopedia. Also, Culture and Religion â€” an excellent work, clearly showing that there is no antagonism, but a genuine relationship, between them. Price, 15 cents. Also, by the same, Standard Hymns, with historical notes of their authors. A pretty little work. Price, 6 cents
