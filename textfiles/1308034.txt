SELECT THE STINGING TREE. The stinging tree of Queensland, Australia, is a luxurious shrub, pleasing to the eye but dangerous to the touch. It grows from two or three inches to ten or fifteen feet in height, and emits a disagreeable odor. Says a traveler, 'Sometimes while shootirg turkeys in the shrubs, I have entirely forgotten the stinging tree till I was warned of its close proximity by its smell, and have often found myself in a little forest of them. I was only once stung, and that very lightly. Its effects are curious ; it leaves no mark, but the pain is maddening, and for months afterwards the part when touched is tender in rainy weather, or when it gets wet in washing, etc. I have seen a man who treats ordinary pain, lightly, roll on the ground in agony after being stuns, and I have known a horse so completely mad after getting iato a grove of the trees that he rushed open mouthed at every one who approached him, and had to be shot Dogs, when stung, will rush about whining piteously biting pieces from the affected part. â€” Frank Leslie's III.
