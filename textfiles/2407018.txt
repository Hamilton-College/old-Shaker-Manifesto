Sabbathday Lake, Me. June, 1894. This is a most perfect Sabbath, and we are enjoying its restful influence. We are also rejoicing that our dear Sisters Eldress Lizzie Noyes and Sirena Douglas are visiting the Societies in N. H. It is a rest from home toil and burden which they very much needed and their letters to us from Canterbury tell of their loving reception and the happy hours which they are passing in that beautiful place. Our horse-chestnut shade trees are unusually full of bloom, the white blossoms contrasting with the deep green foliage. The little flower plants are fast coining along and will soon be ready to do their part towards beautifying the earth. Poland Spring House opens this week. That place is to have one more attraction. The Maine State Building from the World's Fair at Chicago is now on its way to Poland Sprkigs the Ricker Bros, having purchased it and chartered twenty cars for its transportation. It is to be fitted up for a Library and Museum. 170 THE MANIFESTO. The gale of Dec. 12, 1893 blew down over thirty large pine trees. During the past week the Brethren have been to the forest to remove the bark aad secure them from injury, as they can not be drawn to the mil] until next winter. Black flies and mosquitoes were so troublesome that the Brethren had to wear netting drawn over their hats and fastened at the neck. In this way they found they could work quite comfortably. We have had two promising Brethren added to our ranks recently, which gives us courage to look forward to the harvest of souls for which we hope to be prepared. Ada S. Cummings.
