THE CHRISTIAN WARFARE. MAIUON JOHNSON. Not as a bannered Host With plume and steel in martial rank arrayed; With all the pomp and glitter and the boast Of holiday parade : Nor yet as armies come, When hastening to the conflict and the strife, With deadly panoply of war's dread doom, And fearful passions rife : But in the calm retreat, Secluded from the turmoil and the glare ; They turn the spirit's sword within, to meet The foe in ambush there. Bearing a daily cress Against the dearest idols of the soul; Turningfrom wealth and worldlyfame as dross They press toward the goal, Seeking the aid of heaven In earnest fervent prayer, with purpose true ; Beyond the joys of earth, to them is given, Eternal Life in lieu. Canterbury, JV. II.
