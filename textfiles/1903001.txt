CHRIST. Wm. L. Lincoln. He walked in lonely ways. He knew no home, and there were few to call him friend. His deeds were lowly ; but his soul was deeply toned to human needs. He was but a man ; but possessed a soul so rich in gentleness and charity ; so full of love to all mankind, that God could dwell within his soul, and work great and mighty deeds. Pure and stainless was his life,ï¿½beautiful, true, and good ; and yet we crown him every day with thorns. Oh, how we pierce his hands and feet, and keep him crucified. When shall we learn to love him as we ought. Not until we feel the need of living lives of goodness, truth and love. It wns his life, and not his death, that makes us blessed. He is our.light to heaven's courts ; and when we walk amid the poor and lonely, we shall feel him by our side. We feel not his presence, because we go not where he walks. He is the way, the life ; and when we feel no need of him to show us to the Father, we are not in the heavenly path. North Union, Ohio.
