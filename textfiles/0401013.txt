Ayer, Mass. Sept. 21,1873 MUCH-BELOVED ELDER FREDERICK : Will you please have tlie kindness to send me one hundred copies of the ' Shaker and Shakeress,' containing the ' Social Gatherng ' the modern ' Jacob's Ladder ; ' for, of a truth, on that day, ' the angels of God ascended and descended on it,' and the rest of the vision (though it seems to tarry) is sure of fulfillment in spiritual Israel. See Gen. 28: 12 to 15 inclusive. Though I was not apprised of the time of the gathering, yet, not far from that time, I prepared the inclosed poem, Truly the Lion and the Lamb have commenced their state of quiescence, and the Lamb is outside of the Lion ; not forced, but protected by the secular arm. I was both edified and inspired in reading the record of that heaven-blessed day; I found there no finality-pins to mark the place where aspiration perished, to rob the more blessed future. If one-half of man has not been an entire failure, what may we expect of a whole man ? for, when woman holds her station, man alone can never fall. Then blessed, thrice blessed, are the virgins! Heaven ever recognizes the white-robed passport. Your article on ' Judgment ' came with divine unction to my spirit; it has seemed for years that we were experiencing the judgment of our time, for our idolatrous veneration of the past, of persons and mediums, in place of vital advancing principles of truth. There seems to be a prevailing disease of looking back to something great and grand (well nigh final), and stretching the imagination forward to something still grander; in the distant future ; almost forgetting that we live to-day, and that our work is ever before us. To assert such truths, insures an unwelcome and undeserved appellation. God bless you, Elder Frederick. Gratefully thine, unqualified love to all. Elijah Myrick
