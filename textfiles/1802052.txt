It is a very good work on the subject of Shakeeism. It is logical and right to the point. His answer to Col. Ingersoll and to a Catholic are the best I have read. The book is cheap and has valuable information of all the doctrines held by the Believers. All should have a copy who care anything about knowing the belief held by the Shakers. The work is cheap for $1.50. Rev. Joseph L. Berne.
