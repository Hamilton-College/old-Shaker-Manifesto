AGNOSTIC-ISM. HABVEY L. EADS. Discourse! (Ivlivci't'tl at Soutli Union, Ky. June, O, !���. Among all the Isms that have been introduced into the world in the last five hundred years the Agnostic seems to be the most dangerous to the religious and spiritual life. The first article in the Agnostic's creed affirms the existence of an Eternal Energy from which all things proceed but it dares not to call it God. The second. All things occur according to law. The creed seems to be the invention of Prof. T. H. Huxley of England. Whatever he intended by its introduction I know not, but as it is used by his adherents and followers, it seems to be involved in a contradiction�It is made to mean both to know and not to know that is I know and don't know thus or so�They know things occur according to law, but do not know there is a law maker, and go on building up the Potentiality of matter with no aspiration above the mere animal life. ' Its Apostles can speak only of a full stomach, comfortable clothing, the cook shop, beer garden, &amp;c,' and leave the world to fight for equal earthly enjoyments with no promise to a future bettering ; and what does such existence mean? A weeping birth, a smitten child, a wayward youth, oppressed man, afflicted and sorrowing woman, a mourning death, and all is over ! The sect is now publishing an Annual in defense of their doctrine, in which Huxley, the high Priest thus defines it, 'Agnosticism is of the essence of Science. It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe,' thus placing all knowledge on intellectual ground, ignoring God and everything Spiritual. He continues:�'I have no doubt that scientific criticism will prove destructive to the forms of supernaturalsm which enter into the Constitution of existing religious'�This will certainly prove true with all religions that base any part of their structure on Science which belongs not to the Spiritual but to the Material and intellectual plane of life� But continues the Priest�'' There may be things not only in the heavens, but beyond the intelligible universe which are n�t dreamed of in our philosophy. ' There may be but I am Agnostic, that is, I know I don't know it thus contradictory stands the high priest himself; because he knows it not, he will not believe any other person knows it being spiritually blind himself he cannot believe any other person can see, ' though a man declare it unto him '�Thus the Agnostic makes himself easy aDd dozes and dreams his life away�He feels composed and smiles at our ignorance in believing in spiritual realities that have no existence�Such ones pity our weakness and would gladly help us on to Scientific ground, all this while they acknowledge they have nothing to look to or rest on but nature, themselves being the top round. So at last they rest on themselves, a forlorn hope, a broken stick, knowing if they know anything, that they must soon perish and pass away as forest leaves :�All this confusion of thought, thij incoherency and blindness come from the fact that they are materialists and that spiritual things are incognizable by the intellect; if they were, animals could see spiritual things ; but they cannot as ' spiritual things are spiritually discerned, ' not intellectually. Such ones may behold persons engaged in worship and smile at their folly and pity their weakness, without knowing what they are smiling at when the weakness, ignorance and folly are with themselves though admitting there may be a power above to whom we should pay homage. Such a thing may be possible as a future existence, and there may be such a thing as a future accountability to the power that caused our existence here but we don't know it say they, and there may be such a thing as future rewards and punishments, but no one knows it and all such are spiritually dead while they live and I would say with the Apostle : '' Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ will give thee light. ' Believe and obey, then ye shall know. '' The blind shall see and the dead be made alive.' Here the Agnostic will say, how am I to know this? To which I would answer, by a change of base. I have shown yours to be untenable, looking and depending on something inferior to yourselves, you being an effect look to the cause of your being in prayer and supplication, then deliverance will come, then you can unite in the worship of that Power, not mechanically merely but in spirit and in truth being quickened into spiritual life. Christ does not promise by the aid of Science to quicken the intellectual man, but to quicken the spiritual man, when this is done we are new creatures '' old things will have passed away, all things become new and all things of God.
