Enfield, N. H. Aug. 1895. As I write our Home Notes amid the delightful scenes and under the genial skies of a New England summer, I feel like lifting my voice in praise to the Giver of nature's gifts, for, 'Beautiful for habitation is Mt. Zion.' As usual, at this season, we are entertaining many visitors, drawn hither no doubt out of curiosity to see a people who though conversant with the world, 'are not of the world.' We are pleased to note that those who visit us are uniformly of the respectable and intelligent class of society. Our fields of ripening grain, and the vegetable gardens proclaim the near approach of autumn. We are not as fortunate as our Florida friends who can raise two crops in one season. With the exception of early peas, we fail to do this in New Hampshire. Our three acres of onions (the larger part raised for seed and now in bloom) call out much comment from city visitors, as does the general cleanliness prevailing in our home. The latter condition may be accounted for, when we consider that we make and use annually from fifteen to eighteen barrels of lye soap. The health of the Society is generally good, which necessary physical force, is a strong aid to make the mind conform to the ennobling principles that create a Christ-like nature; a character not composed of ideas and verbal sounds, but of virtue, sustained by a spirit of self-reliance. Those who obey the dictation of au enlightened conscience, are able by acquired strength, to wade through the waters of tribulation and to help others mount the hights which vibrate with the gospel of truth and are radiant with the purity of the Christ spirit, which overcomes the world. George H. Baxter.
