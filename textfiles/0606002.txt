LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE HENRY C. BLINN Begin to-day. No matter how feeble the light, let it shine as best it may. The world may need just that quality of light which you have. Illuminate your whole house with every faculty of the mind, and do some little good in the world before you die. It is foolish to squander time in the vain search for the best place, hoping to be approbated twice for every thing that you may do. Trim your lamp ; it may be small; never mind, it is no less a lamp. It may give a flickering light. If used in its best capacity, you need have no fears. Should it stand in contrast with larger lights, it may be no less valuable. Too much light is, at times, an objectionable feature. Yours may be the best in many cases. Jesus says of his disciples,â€”' Ye are the light of the world,' and advises them to let their light shine. Shall his followers to day do less ? It seems that there was an inclination to hide the light under a bushel, or rather to live selfishly. Is there such an inclination among any order of Christians today ? It was an injudicious course in that day, and is no less so in the present. Give to God the best that you have for the redemption of the world. You have no occasion to wait and watch for a favorable time. Golden opportunities are oftener ideal, than real. If you let your light shine, others may have reason to glorify God with you. Have you the spirit of kindness and gentleness ? Sow broadcast as you go. Make those who know you best publish the ' good news ' and the aged will have reason to bless you, while all the youth and children will venerate you as one of the Saviours that should arise. Be to the world a peacemaker, a child of God, and by no means hide the least talent in the earth, nor allow one faculty with which God has blessed you, to be consumed upon your own selfishness.
