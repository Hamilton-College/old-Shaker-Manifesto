Enfield, N. H. May, 1893. Had Home Notes been written one week earlier we should have said,ï¿½winter lingers and spring is nowhere. Now, at this date, May 12, summer is here, with thermometer at 110 deg. However, our weathers are so very freaky, it may all be what one little one styled a ' 'pop'' by the time it is printed, and we be left to wonder if the tiny life germs of the vegetable kingdom can possibly develop in such cold, uncongenial environments. Under these and similar conditions, the promise that 'Seed-time and harvest shall never fail,' is our star of hope. Two hundred feet of rubber hose have been in use to convey water where pipes were frozen in dairy, kitchens, and toilet rooms. Some have thawed voluntarily since the advent of a warmer atmosphere, so those who are expecting to dig more or less this summer, to lay more tubing, will be grateful for so much assistance from the elements. The maple syrup harvest proved an average one and very nice. We have broken our record for good health which prevailed through the cold season. Nearly every one has participated, to some degree, in a disease which has made sneezing and coughing continually heard in the land; weak knees, aching muscles, and a general feeling of collapse, lias been the complaint. If the same amount of union could only be as apparent in a good cause, we might see the effect of concerted action, to our profit. A deal of kindness and patience was shown by those who cared for the afflicted. 'Angels in the way,' are all such, as really as when life's little day hath ebbed out, and we meet for the last memorial meeting to speak good words. Why do we not speak them now, and why do words that censure find utterance, so much more easily than those that commend? This is a subject worth studying, for we all want to bear good tidings, as messengers of love in God's house, and there is ample chance for all, however cramped by circumstances, if we bear in memory the following comforting lines. 'A smile can glorify a clay, A word new hope impart; The least disciple need not say I have no alms to give away, If love be in the heart.' Mary Ella BriggS. North Family. Mav, 1893. Combined with the arranging of this number of our Home Notes, is the wish that we had more varied and interesting items to line into our meagre compilation of home doings; variety of topics being the spice of social intercourse, as are a variety of subjects the relishable spice of literature, but with the grand truth ever before us, ''A contented mind is the richest of gifts,' and having passed triumphantly through the severe winter without any serious results either to person or property, we have abundant reasons for expressing thankfulness to both seen and unseen powers of protective good; living with such cheering realities we believe can but be conducive to mature good results. All nature gives ample evidence of growth, ever new, yet ever of the same basic life-giving elements; and from its voluminous life we can cull many a lesson teaching us to do likewise, pass from sameness into newness of growth, of progressive thought. THE MANIFESTO. 149 'Ever changing, ever aiming Toward a higher, better life; lnver learning, ever earning, Is the good Believer's strife.' Practical faith in a regenerative Divinity, prompts personal effort to benefit our fellow beings by continual works of righteousness ; thus finite minds blend in unison with the Infinite. Having a year's supply of wood housed and our maple harvest over, lands are being prepared for the receiving of grains and vegetables. Our winter Dairy has been quite satisfactory, supplying us with an abundance of butter and cream for home use, besides furnishing some two hundred pounds of butter for sale. Each faithful worker in the Lord's vineyard shares our best love and good wishes. George H. Baxter.
