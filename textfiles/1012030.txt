[Autobiography of Antoinette Doolittle] It may not be known to the public generally, but there has been published, very quietly, and perhaps too modestly, an autobiography of the leading Eldress of the Novitiate Orders of Shakers, Antoinette Doolittle. We are not aware whether this gem is in the market or not ; but we venture to give her address (Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.) while we will have more to say of this little work hereafter.
