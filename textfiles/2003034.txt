I think the book of Proverbs the most interesting... Proverbs has 5. I think the book of Proverbs the most interesting, because it is so rich in wisdom; in that which teaches us of better things above, and guides us to a fuller knowledge of God, his great love and tender mercy, without which we are as one groping in darkness. Wisdom is the light which shows us the folly of sin.Exodus has 4. Ruth and Psalms 3 each. Esther Gill.
