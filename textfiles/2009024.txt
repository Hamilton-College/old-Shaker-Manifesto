The spirit of the Manifesto, in all its simplicity... The spirit of the Manifesto, in all its simplicity, cannot speak otherwise, than peace on earth and good-will to all mankind. As a messenger to herald these glad tidings, it will ever help to fulfill the beautiful prophecy, when the knowledge of the Lord will cover the land. It is this knowledge of God, this reign of peace, this season of universal rejoicing to which all are looking forward with an anxious hope. That it will come: that it is now coming to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear; and that it has already come to many precious souls who have denied themselves of all ungodliness, are spiritual truths of which multitudes of Christian witnesses love to speak. To the worldly-wise and ignorant, like many other things, it is quite beyond their full conception, and they put the day of God's power into the distant future. It may be after the great judgment day; it may be wThen Christ shall come in the clouds of heaven. To them, as to the priests of Baal, there may be no God to hear. One class, however, have the precious promise of seeing God and that at as early a date as they may choose to be ready for his coming. This becomes the special privilege of 'the pure in heart,' and on this race every one can enter his name, and by faithful perseverance, certainly, win the prize. Those who anticipate the millennium of God's love on the earth, must be actively engaged in the preparatory stages, or the fulness can never be realized. So long as there is confusion and strife, so long there will be slavery and cruelty. So long as nations shall war against nations, and in their mad career destroy even the bread that should feed the poor, the gospel testimony of God's witnesses, so prophetic of the 'last days,' will be heard only faintly and be received with many misgivings. However strange this may be, the history of the ages teaches us that divine truth makes but slow progress in the minds of those who are so fully absorbed in the life of this world. The blessings of a United Inheritance which dwell in a Christian Community, will close out the narrow, selfish relations of the children of this world, and open an avenue to a more blissful abode. It was a high conception of spiritual truth that filled the soul of Jesus when he prayed,ï¿½' Thy kingdom come,' God's heavenly kingdom in which all would become peacemakers, and as anxiously seek to forgive others, as they would wish to be forgiven. If we believe in the testimony of Christ and enter in at the strait gate, all this is to be realized while we live on the earth. It is in the Christian Community in God's kingdom of Fathers and Mothers, Brothers and Sisters. A people who are learning to do the will of God, in its new revelation to their souls. The ideal of a Christian home has always been in a Community where 'God's people shall dwell in peaceable habitations, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.' Jesus anticipated this spiritual home where 'Brethren and Sisters could dwell together in unity,' and faithfully devoted his life to its fulfillment. He prayed for God's home to come upon the earth, as it was already in the heavens. All who had the least idea of a spiritual relation, believed that God's children would be gathered to a habitation where there would be no rich nor poor; where all who were led by the spirit of God, would become the Sons and Daughters of God, and share, alike, the blessings of the heavenly kingdom on earth. The first lessons to be impressed upon the minds of the disciples was that of the common brotherhood in which God was to be the Father of all who accepted this new ministration. The selfish relations in which they had lived were to give place to something better, and make of them a spiritual family, in which God's will, instead of man's will would be done as it was done in heaven. 'Except a man forsake all that he hath he cannot be my disciple.' This decisive word was placed before every one who wished to enter the brotherhood with Jesus. That some who were wealthy should turn away, sorrowfully, as did the young man, or question the propriety of forsaking all to follow Christ, as did Peter, is not at all surprising, for the same trial still exists among men. Blinded by the god of this world, they are led into his selfish relations without the least resistance, and to that extent that the Revelator exclaims, 'The whole world wondered after the Beast !' Jesus and his disciples gave the first lessons for the peace and prosperity of a Christian Community. The Church must be consecrated to God and his people ; a part cannot be reserved for self and selfish purposes. Peter's admonition to Ana- nias may be timely for all who enter the Church of Christ. 'Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie unto the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land? While it remained, was it not thine own ? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.' These burning words, and those in the 5th chap, of Matt, represent the permanent basis upon which Jesus established his church. 'Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.' I Cor. III., 11. That can secure to any one the reward of the Christian in this life, or assure him of eternal life in the world to come. This Christian Community was to be separate from the selfish and grasping life of the world, and its people were expected to love righteousness and truth above all things. In this was to be found a new life, spiritual, even as the angels of God in heaven. A Christian Community, even at this late date needs an inspirational care of consecrated souls, to raise it above the elements of a worldly life. Much has yet to be learned to secure a growing prosperity, which must make of our home the kingdom of God upon the earth, wherein righteousness shall be the ruling spirit, and where nothing shall harm or hurt in all God's holy mountain.
