FRIENDSHIP. [Contributed by Mary Johnston.] If there's one thing more than others That emotion always sends To a tired and weary wanderer, 'Tis the memory of his friends. Time may drift him seaward ever, Tide may waft his bark away, Homeward turns his better nature, To his friends he longs to say, Words that burn within his bosom, Thoughts that daily, hourly come Of life,s friendship oft remembered In the sacred ties of home. Oenius may give power and plenty, Fit us for important ends, But the drive-wheel of promotion Is the recommend of friends. As the magnet of the compass Turns the needle to the pole, So the heart of friendship ever Nerves the impulse of the soul; Sends the warmest, richest feeling Through the heart, tho sad or gay, Wakens in our inmost nature Thoughts that live beyond to-day. What are riches, power and plenty, If to gain them all depends On the risk of health or honor Ever absent from our friends? Often tender words have fallen On a heart all worn and weak, Driving back the tide of sorrow, Waking thoughts that none can speak. And our thoughts will span the prairie, Or e'en fly beyond the sea, Touching tender chords of friendship, Keeping silent company. Then be brave and own your friendship, Press the hand of friends you see. One good word or act of kindness Vibrates through eternity. Harbinger of Light.
