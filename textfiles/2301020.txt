Enfield, N. H. Dec. 1892. In union with our precious kindred elsewhere who are doubtless preparing their contributions for the coming Manifesto, we likewise hasten to sign our final Notes for the departing of the grand old year so soon to be numbered with the past; but before we bid our friends adieu 17 18 THE MANIFESTO. would send in advance to one and all, our best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Since we find that there is nothing more worthy our strife than the cultivation of kindly thoughts and deeds toward our gospel relations, we pledge anew to grow these ennobling graces by toil and care until we become 'the Angels in the way,' to our dear Brethren and Sisters who with us are on the pilgrim journey toward a purer, higher life. We are at present date enjoying a very pleasant visit with our good Brother, Thomas Evans of East Canterbury, N. H. He seems earnest and hearty in the strife to become a true heir of the kingdom. May the powers of good above and around sustain and strengthen him, is our earnest prayer. To-day we are again called upon to consign to its kindred dust the mortal re- mains of our loving Sister Tirzah Whittaker of the South Family. How rapidly the aged in our Society are passing on; soon the few now remaining will all be in brighter mansions with kindred souls who have been their loved companions in earth life. We have enjoyed many bright days since the frost king first nipped our fingers, but winter must have its full reign. J. R.
