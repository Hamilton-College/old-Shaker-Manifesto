HOW TO PURIFY WATER. Water containing vegetable or animal impurities, even in small quantities, may be purified by putting into it about two grains of alum. The alum acts as a sort of coagulum on this matter, causing it to curdle, and settle to the bottom of the vessel. No taste or unpleasant effect is produced, as the alum goes with the suspended matter. It requires about ten or twelve hours to effect the cleansing. The purified water may be decanted and kept in bottles in an ice chest until wanted. Still another way is to boil the water for about fifteen minutes. The boiling softens hard water and kills all germs but does not remove the organic impurity� only cooks it, and renders it inert. Many families boil their drinking water, bottle it and keep it in a cool place until needed. Water containing fifteen grains of alum to the gallon, by boiling briskly for a quarter of an hour, will show only four or five grains�a quantity about equal to spring water. Pure water is of the greatest necessity for drinking and cooking purposes, and every successful effort to secure it will yield good results healthwise. The Journal of Hygiene.
