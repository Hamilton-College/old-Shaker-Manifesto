Elder Evans, of the Shakers... Elder Evans, of the Shakers, attributes to the use of animal food the thirst for intoxicating drinks. ' I have found,' he says, ' by many years' experience, that whenever I get a man to abstain from the use of flesh meats, much salt and other condiments, he quite easily leaves alcohol, tobacco and other drugs.'â€”Yates Co. Chronicle.
