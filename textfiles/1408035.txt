A SCHOLAR'S FAREWELL ADDRESS. ROSIE QUIMBY. Another term of school is gone Gone with the winter's snow And like the fast receding years Our happy school days go. This school is small compared to some That in our district lie But 'tis as hard for us to part And just as sad to say Good Bye. Not only sad is it to part With school-room Books and} playmates true But also with our good committee And our loving teacher too. To me she's proved herself a friend A parent loving, kind and true And let my thanks to her extend At parting for they're truly due ; Her counsel I will ever heed While toiling 'mid the scenes of life, By her example, T'll be led In the so called world's mad strife. 0 ray school days, happy school days ! Can it be they all are flown, With their happiness and pleasure? Can it be they're really gone? Yea they're goneï¿½gone forever, With their griefs and pleasures too ; For Father Time is ever punctual He will not wait for me or you. Now these pleasures all must cease, Childhood's happy joyful glee, No more the schoolmates or school Looks Or our play around this tree. Ayer, Mass.
