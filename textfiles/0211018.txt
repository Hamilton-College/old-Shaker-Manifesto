Novitiate Musings Beloved Shaker :â€”Having come suddenly from the midnight of anti-Christian darkness to the full blaze of millennial light, that light shows me many things which, though quite familiar to the experienced Zion traveler, are new to me. I experience, especially in our meetings, new and beautiful influences, which, from want of a more satisfactory term, I will call ministrations of the Spirit of God. It is needless to describe them further than to say, that they are golden and harmonious; that they penetrate the whole physical frame, elevate the mind and soul from the grosser appetites of earth, and stimulate the spirit to fresh exertion to struggle upward. They vary in their character so much that no two are exactly alike. I am sincerely anxious to know, from the experience of larger hearts and wiser heads than mine : 1st. What is the source of these ministrations ? 2d. What are their nature, consistency, properties ? 3d. What are the most favorable conditions for obtaining; them ? 4th. Is it possible to reduce the obtaining of these ministrations to a science ? 5th. Is this a proper subject for investigation, or should we accept these ministrations without questioning their source ? 6th. Would it be acceptable to furnish carefully-noted experiences of the kind for publication, so as to obtain information from many sources, and thus establish the truth by the experience of many witnesses ? This last would involve careful noting of the kind and degree of the ministration, and of the state of the mind, feelings, and bodily system at the time of the reception. Thomas J.
