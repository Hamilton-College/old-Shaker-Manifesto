A newly-varnished carriage... A Newly-varnished carriage is liable to spot. To prevent this some wash the carriage two or three times in clean cold water applied with a sponge instead of using a hose ; this will help harden the surface, and prevent it to some extent from being injured by the mud or water getting splashed on the job. Never let mud dry on the surface, and then wash off expecting to see no spots on the varnish. You will certainly be disappointed, and the only way to remedy the evil will be to have it revarnished. Soft water is better than hard water for the washing of carriages, as the lime which is in the hard water is very liable to injure the varnish.
