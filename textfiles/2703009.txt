Shakers, N. Y. Feb. 1897. Whatever an individual has his mind firmly fixed upon, he is determined to attain. Many times circumstances make it impossible as regards our material life for success to come, but in the spiritual realm the forces that operate and are dominant there, move with a, reliableness which leaves no place for doubt as to the final result, and while viewing it in this light it is pleasant to note the interest which is growing to present advanced truths; those that pertain especially to the evolvement of the Divine life and to have them unmixt as far as possible with creedal forms which reflect the development of the medium through which they are given. That our dear friends who have past over the mystic river come to us as ministering angels, impressing us witli thoughts and desires, many times beyond our normal comprehension, we believe. While perusing the Feb. Manifesto and noting the harmony of thought that pervaded it, we were imprest to say, Blessed are our gospel kindred! whether in the sunshine or walking through the valley or the shadow, we will fear no evil, for we are compast about by those spiritual forces that to the honest soul are a wall of protection. We are blest with health to perform our daily duties for which we render thanksgiving. While our aged Brethren and Sisters are preparing to lay their earthly burdens down it is joy to know that they have a blessed heritage who have grown up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The winter up to present date Feb. 4th, has given us but very little snow, not enough for good sledding and now we are thinking how soon the time will come when preparations will be made to cultivate the soil. We can welcome the beautiful spring with its birds and flowers. Hamilton DeGraw.
