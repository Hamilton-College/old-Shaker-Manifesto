THOUGHTS. By Willie C. Hicks. (12yrs. old.) 1. Do good for evil. When any one kicks you do not kick him, but do good to him for evil. 2. You know that if you help a sinner, you are laying up treasures in heaven; help a sinner as much as you can. 3. Do not be afraid of a sinner but take him and talk kindly to him and be done with him. 4. Be loving to every one, do not say 'go away' or 'leave me alone,' that is not 'brotherly love.' 5. The Lord is with you wherever you go, but if you do not keep his commandments you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
