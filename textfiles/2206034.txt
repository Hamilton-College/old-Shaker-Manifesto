Sarah A. Weatherford Sarah A. Weatherford, at Pleasant Hill, Ky., May 9, 1892., in the fifty-third year of her age. Our beloved Sister was gathered into the Society at the age of eight years. Was called from earth in the prime of usefulness, and will be greatly missed by her associates and friends. Yet it is well if, in our affliction we can say, 'Thy will, O Lord, not mine be done.' J.
