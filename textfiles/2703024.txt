YOU NEVER CAN TELL. [Contributed by Eldress Lois Wentworth ] You never can tell when you send a word Like an arrow shot from a bow By an archer blind�be it cruel or kind, Just where it will chance to go. It may pierce the breast of your dearest friend, Tipt with its poison or balm; To a stranger's heart in life's great mart It may carry its pain or its calm. You never can tell when you do an act Just what the result will be; But with every deed you are sowing a seed, Tho its harvest you may not see. Each kindly act is an acorn dropt In God's productive soil; Tho you may not know; yet the tree shall grow And shelter the brows that toil. You never can tell what your thoughts will do In bringing you hate or love; For thoughts are things, and their airy wings Are swifter than carrier doves, They follow the law of the Universe� Each thing must create its kind; And they speed o'er the track to bring you back Whatever went out from your mind.
