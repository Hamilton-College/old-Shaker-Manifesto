Encouragement For Missionaries. Condensed From Eclectic Magazine. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. Max Mlller Prof, of Oriental languages in Oxford University, and translator of the sacred literature of the Eastern nations, into English, classifies the six leading religions of the world as missionary and non-missionary. The former he pronounces alive and the latter, dying or dead. Any religion or system that is self propagating, or is making new conquests through the zeal and activity of its votaries, cannot be absolutely dead, though it may contain never so much error. And any system which makes religion to cousist in a profession of belief, and the practice of ceremonies which effect nothing toward destroying the natui'e of � in in the heart, is far from perfect good, unmixed with error. In the second class, are Judaism, Brahmanism, and Zoroastrianism. The subjects of these are represented as wishing to confine the benefits of their religion to people of their own blood, whom they esteemed as a peculiarly privileged and favored class, or caste. For example UA Jew must be of the seed of Abraham. And when in later times they admitted strangers to some of their privileges, they looked upon them not as souls who had been gained to God, saved, born into a new brotherhood, but as strangers, or proselytes. That is, men who had come to them as aliens, not to be trusted as their saying was until the twenty fourth generation. A similar feeling prevented the Brahmins from attempting to proselyte those who did not by birth, belong to the aristocracy of their country. They went so far as to punish those who happened) to be near enough to hear the sound of their prayers, or witness their sacrifices. The Par si, [ZoroastrianJ too, does not wish for converts. He is proud of his faith as of his blood. And though he believes in the final victory of truth and light, and says to every man Be bright as the sun and pure as the moon, he does very little to drive away spiritual darkness, by letting his light shine before the world. The missionary religions, are Buddhism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity. However they may differ in their doctrines, they all have faith in themselves, they have life and vigor, they want to convince, they mean to conquer. From the earliest dawn of their existence, these three religions were missionary. Their founders and first apostles, recognized the duty of spreading the truth, of refuting error, of bringing the whole world to acknowledge the paramount, if not the Divine authority of their doctrines. We know very little of the origin and earliest growth of Buddhism. But the presiding Elder of their great Council, held at Patilipatra 246 B. C. an old man, too weak to travel by land, and conveyed to the Council in a boat, and after the Council was over, began to reflect on the future, and found the time had come to establish the religion of Buddha in foreign countries. He therefore dispatched some of the most eminent priests to distant cities and countries, East, West, North and South. When threatened by infuriated crowds, one of those missionaries said Even if the gods fdeities of the elements,] were united with men, they would not frighten me away. And when he had brought the people to listen, he dismissed them with the simple prayer, 'Do not hereafter give way to pride and anger. Care for the happiness of all living beings, and abstain from violence. Extend your good will to all mankind. Let there be peace among the dwellers on earth.' The fact that missionaries were sent out to convert the vworld, represents to us what at that time was a new thought� new not only in the history of India, but of the [whole world, says Muller. The Koran does not invite, but rather compels the world to come in. Yet there are passages which show that Mohammed had realized the idea of a religion of humanity ; that he first wished to unite his own with that of the Jews and Christians, comprehending all under the common name Islam, which originally meant humility or devotion. All who humblefl themselves before God and were filled with reverence, were called Moslem. The Islam, says Mohammed, is the true worship of God. When'men dispute you, say, 'lam a Moslem.' Ask those who have sacred books, and ask the heathen ; Are you a Moslem ? If they are, they are on the right path. But if they turn away, then you have no other task but to preach to them the Islam. Islam also means to satisfy or pacify by forbearance. It also means simply subjection. As to Christianity, its very soul is missionary, progressive, world embracing. It would cease to exist if it ceased to be missionary. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
