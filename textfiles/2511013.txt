Shakers, N. Y. Oct. 1895. The kind words expressed for The Manifesto by the 'World's Advance Thought,' are reciprocal. Speaking from experience and with no disparagement to the many worthy publications, the 'Advance Thought' is a jewel of the first water and the principles taught by it are worthy of a foremost place in human society. We enjoy the blessed seasons of spiritual communion in our weekly Society meetings, and we could not but pity those who should lose tluir interest in these seasons; they are of great benefit in the development of a harmonious life. We have been asked how we liked the new method of spelling that is largely used by The Manifesto. We can say that it certainly simplifies the old method, and after the novelty passes away, its superiority over the old method is apparent, At the date of writing, Oct. 6th, we have not on the uplands had any damaging frosts, but on the lowlands around us are frosts that destroyed tender vegetation, on the 15th of Sept. The weather still continues dry. Hamilton DeGraw. A EEFEBENCE to the advanced form of spelling made by Br. Hamilton is quite suggestive. Those who asked the question should know that this change has been moving on from an early age, and while they are astonished at the present slight variation they may be interested to compare it with that of their fathers of only a few generations in the past. See Matt, viii., 'Forsothe, when Jhesu hadde comen doun fro the liil, many cumpanyes folewiden hym. And loo! a leprouse man cummynge worshipide hym, saying: Lord yif thou wolt, thou maistmake me clene.' Webster's Dictionary. A great many people even at the present date do not spell according to Webster or Worcester, and any new rules will not disturb their form of orthography. We will write a few examples of the spelling of 1895 which are not uncommon.
