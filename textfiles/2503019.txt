Shirley, Mass. Feb. 1895. These are days to be remembered. February Oth, the thermometer marked 15 below zero. Yesterday the 7th the weather moderated somewhat, so that we THE MANIFESTO. could have an old-fashioned snow-storm this a. m., the 8th, which has made it very difficult to get about in any shape. The snow-plow was heard go by on the R. E. a short time since, proving that we are not entirely shut off from communication with our gospel friends in particular, or the outside world in general. There seems to be a great correspondence in all the elementsnatural, spiritual, physical, social, moral and political, and what shall the end of all these things be? Where are the Wise Men to tell us? on whom we can rely! Loud-mouthed demagogues are plenty is there any better way, than to so live, that we can justly claim^ a right to the promises of God, applicable to the order in which we are called. They are many and cheering, amid all the changing scenes and storms of life, and we seem to have need of all the courage and energy they are calculated to inspire. May we not fail in the day of trial. We are enjoying a good degree of health generally. Next winter's wood well under way so that when spring opens(as it soon will) we shall not be far behind, at least. We are glad to hear the good words that come to us from month to month in The Manifesto, or in other ways, and desire to have our love and prayers mingle with those of our gospel relation, so they may arise as grateful incense before our Heavenly Father and Mother, and the Hosts of Heaven, whom it is our ambition to join, when earth's labors and sorrows are ended. With some of us, the time can not long be delayed, but we intend to keep our armor bright, and 'never give up the ship.' John Wliiteley.
