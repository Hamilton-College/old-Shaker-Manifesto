NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. Apr. 30, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�Enclosed, please find the list of books, pamphlets, tracts, etc. with price, to be secured at the several families at Mt. Lebanon. Thank you for the advanced copy of the Manifesto. It is like the month (May) bright and betokens good things for the future. You truthfully remark that mankind are going up and not down. They are moving toward God the Father of light and the dispenser of all good gifts. A few more steps in this direction will lead them to acknowledge a heavenly Mother, and when she is found the wheels of progress, as Sister Emily Ofl'ord says in her excellent article, will roll more rapidly. The fire that was kindled in the first appearing of Christ, has been and is beingrekindled by her testimony. Believers should fan the flames and increase the fire by throwing into it those things which the spirit of God does not approve. The accumulated brush from orchards put on the asparagus bed was burned four days earlier than last year. By the help of a quart or two of kerosine it burned with rapidity. Is it not so with individuals? When prepared and willing to be helped, they are readily touched by the gospel fire and find enough to consume, as we by searching find the moth and the miller, the rubbish and dirt where we least expect it, upon cleaning our houses. 'Our God is a consuming fire.' She will not only clean out every vestige as small as a breast pin or a finger ring, that savors of a worldly life, but the very spirit that would keep that life alive. Not only sins committed, but the nature of sin that we all possess is embraced in the testimony of Mother, and whoever accepts this must part with their dearest idols. The idol may be a father, mother, son or daughter, husband or wife, selfish prop- erty�or some bad habit like smoking or chewing tobacco, it must eventually be consumed by the fire of truth. And happy and glorified is that soul 'who spares no idol, great or small.' Our good father, Elder Frederic, is still a prisoner. The wound is healing nicely. In mind lie is as active as ever, always reading or writing when not conversing or sleeping. We have finished house cleaning and have on hand two hundred dozen shirts to make. It would seem that every man and boy should own as much as one, but alas! alas!! Booth's 'Darkest England' tells the story and New York city might repeat it. Brethren are preparing gardens, and Sisters have raked the door-yards. Cows were turned out to pasture the 21st of present month, earlier than ever before known. If the readers of the Manifesto are interested in weather reports, there is a lively little paper called 'Words and Works,' that is printed at St. Louis, Mo., foretelling the state of the weather; and by it, we learn that frost and snow will give us one more call in May ere winter takes its final departure. In the meanwhile the grass will grow and flowers bloom, and seed-time and harvest will not fail, no more than can the love of the Gospel fail. O, there's a love that can never die, 'Tis pure as the heavens, warm as the sun in the noonday sky. It giveth life, health and endless joy, And liftcth souls from earth. O come ye needy, share this love, It is of heavenly birth. A. W. Enfield, Conn. May 8, 1891. With abundant reason for thankfulness for the blessings which surround us on every hand we are progressing heavenward. The scenery is delightful at the present time, trees in full bloom on every side, and although two severe frosts have visited our section of the Connecticut valley the past week, we do not despair of having some cherries and pears, but peaches will probably be a failuie. The work of potato planting has been very much assisted by the new Planter, which works well, and is a success. Oats are in and stocked down some ten days ago. Grass is looking well, and with a little rain now will be of great value to vegetation. The apple trees are coming forward, and hopes are entertained of a good yield. Our new Lawn Mower is highly prized in keeping the grass in good order around the dwellings. To beautify home within and without, is the duty of all Christians, therefore we would improve each and every opportunity to cleanse the sanctuary, that we may make those around us cheerful and happy, and also have a greeting ready for any who may come to seek for truth. M. Witham. Harvard, Mass. April 26, 1891. Deab Editok :�On the 15th of April we were again summoned to the bedside of one of our dear mothers, to see her spirit take its flight for the heavenly spheres. It was a joyful parting; there was not a tear of sorrow shed, for she died as she had lived a sunbeam of cheer and strength to all around her. All through her sickness she manifested the spirit of gratitude and love to those who were attending to her little wants. A gleam of cheer and sunshine was always on her countenance, and after receiving the little kindnesses which so many bestowed, she would always look up with a smile of thankfulness. Thus did our dear mother pass on to the higher stage of existence. She left the primary for the higher grade where all the faculties can be brought into use and develop what they cannot here, a full, perfect womanhood. The funeral of our Sister was attended on Sunday the 19th. Quite a company of her friends were present to give in their tribute of respect. A wise Quaker wrote, says George J. Holyoke, 'I expect to pass through this world but once. If therefore, there be any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it for I shall not pass this way again (in the body.) Let this be my epitaph. What I spent I had. What I saved I left behind. What I gave away I took with me.' Never have our doctrinal positions needed more helpers. Never before opportunities so ample and gi*and, with hopes so inspiring and glorious, ever and steadily pointing to an early revelation of the spirit of Christ in the true principles. Never, Heaven helping us, shall its dearly purchased banner of virgin purity and consecration be lowered by our consent. Around its standard, m;ule sacred by the heroic devotion of tLc living advocates of truth, let us battle on, hand in hand, heart to heart. Young Brethren and Sisters, we will stand by the noble principles of redemption to mankind, and by its living inspirations, and our Zion shall become as a beautiful tree. If there is inspiration in anything under the sun, should it not be in living in holiness, and redeeming our time? Like the spring that is opening upon us, why not look upward and draw down a new inspiration of spiritual life and strength. Two weeks since our dear editor sent a request to me to help him do a little missionary work by sending out some of our religious publications, and so spread a further knowledge of our faith. This invitation I can readily accept. Brethren and Sisters, can we not do a little in this line to help those who are doing so much? Let our dear editor see by the next month's issue that he is not alone in his noble work. Farming has commenced, though the spring seems quite backward. A few potatoes, peas, onions and beets have been planted. A. D. B. Canterbury, N. H. May 16, 1891. Time, like everything which belongs to time is marching rapidly along. Already the first quarter of the new year has passed into history, and has carried us from the severities of a winter climate to the inspiring influences of spring. New life has awakened the trees and plants and meadows, and they are budding and blossoming with a beauty that gives inspiration to every heart. God's beautiful gifts can never grow old. With spring comes the seed-time and through the careful management of this, the anticipation of a plentiful harvest. The gardeners are closely noticing every indication of the germinating of choice plants, as their summer hope of happiness depends to a certain extent on the growth of the indispensable asparagus, and then of the nice, early potatoes, as well as the corn, beans and peas. How hard and yet how interestedly we work to obtain a little food to assist in sustaining life. Our cherry and plum trees are now in full bloom. A good share of the cherries will be claimed by the red-breasted Kobin family, as compensation for their early, morning songs, while the plums will probably be appropriated to the uses of the curculio. Some persons advocate the planting of so many trees as to exhaust the labors of the insects and then have a supply of perfect fruit for table use. Many of our plum and cherry trees have been ruined by the black knot, and we fail to find a remedy to prevent this wholesale destruction. The introduction of an earthquake since our last, enters into the list of variations. It succeeded quite well in giving us a shock, and frightening us with an in or tm-earthly sound. Some through fright ran out of the houses, but finding themselves unharmed they soon returned to their dwellings and to their duties. On the 30th of last month Eldress Rosetta Cumings and Sr. Katie West from Enfield, N. H., made us a visit of one day, and on the *7th inst. Br. Wm. Wilson from the same Society, also called to see us for a few hours. All as gospel friends were made welcome to the blessings of our consecrated home. * Weather Record, for April, 1891.

The monthly mean is found by taking one half the sum of the maximum and minimum for each day in the month. We do not use the exposed thermometer for this purpose. The maximum and minimum are self-registering thermometers which indicate the highest and lowest temperature of each day. This report is a copy of that sent to IT. S. Signal Service at the close of each month. N. A. Briggs. Enfield, N. H. May 14, 1891. Admitting that the weather has rightfully been tabooed as the topic to which empty minds resort as something safe to converse upon, when 'all but that has fled,' yet it has grown to be so erratic, it is really worthy of mention. We had our May weather in April, lovely warm days, but within a week have had thermometer below freezing; plants that had braved the winter months in the south windows of the dining hall, were transplanted into open air beds, just in time to be frost-bitten and die at last. Eight here I think Br. Daniel Orcutt, who has blessed the young people with so many words of wisdom, would moralize in this wise. 'Haste makes waste,' concerning things terrestrial or otherwise, and none could gainsay it; yet if we learn from our mistakes (and the wise always do) just as effectually as by any other means, we shall never spend precious time in regrets. 'Groweth the morning from pray to gold, Up my heart and greet the sun! Yesterday's cares are a tale that is told; Yesterday's tasks are a work that is done. Buried beneath the billows of sleep Yesterday's toils are as if they were not. Lay them low in the soundless deep, Resolve that the future with wisdom be fraught.' The earthquake that we learn was distinctly felt at Canterbury, we did not realize at all. We wisli it might portend more than the disturbance of natural elements to us all. Should like to learn from a reliable source, some Society nearer the scene of action than we are, if the current newspaper story of a religious awakening in Indiana, is a truthful one, and if it bears any resemblance in form or substance to the Kentucky Revival. We are doing about as usual at this season, 'sowing with a free and liberal hand,' hoping also that the blessed rain and sunshine may be given in just sufficient quantities to yield the increase; and yet with all our apprehensions, 'We love to think that God appoints Our portion day by day; Events of life are in his hand, And we can always say, Appoint them in Thine own good time, Yea, in Thine own good way.' E. B. Groveland, N. Y. May 10, 1891. Timb on the wing, May ends the i-pring. Always we find something of interest in the boundless realm of thought from which to indite a good matter for the pleasure of the ready reader. We can announce with May notes the success of farm work in every branch; farmers are plowing and preparing ground for planting Sweet and Indian corn, should Providence with suitable weather cause it to grow, yielding of its bounty, fruits, bushels by the hundred. Oats and barley sown a few weeks previous are thriving nicely. 'But who can tell what the harvest will be? ' No one can tell, by waiting we'll see. It may be rich and it may be poor. But a harvest of either one we are sure, Not quite sure either; perhaps none at all, Will mark the spring sowing at the coming of fall. But this we are sure of tlw seed that is sown, At present 'tis thriving and nicely has grown. We are deep in the ways and means of house cleaning, taking practical lessons in the fashionable art, the school that our foremothers graduated from in the days of long ago. We have no remembrance of how they conducted their house cleaning, but we do not believe they hunted bugs in their rugs or were ever bothered with such an unmitigated nuisance as the modern carpet beetle. We have tried every ordinary and extraordinary remedy as a means for destroying them but they live and continue to live growing more and more numerous each year. The cold wave and snow storm that swept by here last week failed to injure the fruit buds as many predicted it would. The pear, cherry and pe*ach trees are weighted with their blossoms of sweetness. Honey-bees and bumble-bees Find refuge in the trees, They live and thrive and grow and hive, In spite of snow or breeze. Hay pressing and shipping continues the same as before adding a mite to the needed funds, that go to make up the great sum of earthly wants. Still, 'We need but little hpre below, Have little time to learn.' G. D. G. Union Village, Ohio. May 1, 1891. 'Time is eternity, fraught with all eternity can give.' Thus sings the poet. Well here we are, at the first day of May. 'We are all in good health. Our late potatoes were planted yesterday. The day before was the solemn anniversary of our South Family fire, when a whole family was broken up and in one day divided among the remaining families. Such orcurrences, if they can do any good, may remind us that 'we have no abiding city here, but seek one whose master and builder is God.' Amen! God's will be done. Every tree in our apple orchard is in full bloom. Oats all in. Heavy breadth. A sister probationer joins the Church today. We are putting up a few medicines for those who think they must have them, but Union Village fights shy of all medical drugs. We have replanted our young orchards of apple, pear, peach, plum, cherry and quince. They stood the long drouth last summer quite well. But we nursed them very carefully by watering and fertilizing, else many more would have perished than did. Our North Union suit was decided in our favor. Elder Joseph is at Cleveland watching the case. I fear another drouth is on, like last year; hut if we will persist in cutting away all the green forests, we must look for drouths and cyclones. I hope the Government will soon pass a Code of Forestry Laws, and make the same sufficiently stringent and compulsory to secure our land from utter destruction. Pastures hecoming abundant and milk and butter increasing accordingly. School will close about the first of June, proximo. We are making calculations for a thorough renovation of our street fences and have made several miles of farm fencing during 1Jie past year. La Grippe left a number of negatives here both among ourselves and our tenants, but we didn't allow him to finish any of his pictures and now he is gone, we hope never to return. We commence planting corn to-day. We used to commence planting about the 21st of April. Kind regards, O. C. H.
