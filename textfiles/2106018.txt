Union Village, Ohio. May 1, 1891. 'Time is eternity, fraught with all eternity can give.' Thus sings the poet. Well here we are, at the first day of May. 'We are all in good health. Our late potatoes were planted yesterday. The day before was the solemn anniversary of our South Family fire, when a whole family was broken up and in one day divided among the remaining families. Such orcurrences, if they can do any good, may remind us that 'we have no abiding city here, but seek one whose master and builder is God.' Amen! God's will be done. Every tree in our apple orchard is in full bloom. Oats all in. Heavy breadth. A sister probationer joins the Church today. We are putting up a few medicines for those who think they must have them, but Union Village fights shy of all medical drugs. We have replanted our young orchards of apple, pear, peach, plum, cherry and quince. They stood the long drouth last summer quite well. But we nursed them very carefully by watering and fertilizing, else many more would have perished than did. Our North Union suit was decided in our favor. Elder Joseph is at Cleveland watching the case. I fear another drouth is on, like last year; hut if we will persist in cutting away all the green forests, we must look for drouths and cyclones. I hope the Government will soon pass a Code of Forestry Laws, and make the same sufficiently stringent and compulsory to secure our land from utter destruction. Pastures hecoming abundant and milk and butter increasing accordingly. School will close about the first of June, proximo. We are making calculations for a thorough renovation of our street fences and have made several miles of farm fencing during 1Jie past year. La Grippe left a number of negatives here both among ourselves and our tenants, but we didn't allow him to finish any of his pictures and now he is gone, we hope never to return. We commence planting corn to-day. We used to commence planting about the 21st of April. Kind regards, O. C. H.
