THE TWELVE CHRISTIAN VIRTUES. Daniel Fraser. 'There appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.' The inquiry arises, is this woman typical of what all women may be? or is she in this case, an exceptional�an isolated phenomenon r The human mind being capable of indefinite expansion, and of corresponding elevation of life, leads to the assumption that all women may be so clothed�clothed with divine energy, and be crowned with all the Christian virtues�with the practicabilities of divine human life. Every star is a radiating focus, so also, is every Christian virtue. That a woman so clothed should be a wonder in heaven, is evidence that the heavens are subject to evolutionary elevations. Materialistic evolutionists are desirous to find evidence of progress in creation, and for that purpose go down into the geological formations of the past. No harm in that. If the lower forms of creation afford evidence of progress, the higher forms of life should do so much more. Should men of science begin with themselves, perhaps they would find that evolutionary capabilities are theirs, that they are in possession of a higher, and of a lower human selfhood ; and that it is man's distinguished and special prerogative to say which should govern ; we 'being servants to that we yield ourselves servants to obey.' Men of science accepting this invitation may unfold themselves into divine men, first, by subjecting all the cravings of their animal self-hoods to the requirements of physiological and moral righteousness. Second, by loving the neighbor at the expense of self. In thus unfolding, they would solve many, nay, all the pressing problems of to-day. In these matters there is no time to be lost, it being noticed that it is the educated, the men of property, the leaders of society, who by their various systems of monopoly create criminals, and give birth to the anarchist. These leaders, instead of monopolizing, and of denying to the hungry unemployed access to the elements of human subsistence ; the way to these elements will be gladly opened equally to all. TheD, instead of war, there will be peace. Instead of penitentiaries there will be communal homes. Should these men happily unfold into, and manifest the attributes of the higher life, they will find, that in the heavens there is a Law of laws, a divine creative Force, bringing willing souls forth into the likeness of a heavenly Father and Mother ; as was the case with our ever blessed elder brother, Jesus the Christ. He was the first born of many brethren ; as was also the case with our ever blessed Mother Ann the Christ, the first born of many sisters. They were clothed with the virtues of the higher life. Hence, it was their delight to be among their people as those who serve. We shall find in ourselves when so clothed, the most satisfactory evidence that the heavens are the source and fountain of all human progress, and of divine elevatious. 1 now turn to those who have been called into, or providentially placed iu our communal homes. I have addressed those who are seeking to unfold material thiugs, to unfold themselves into divine men, and to slough off the old man with all his degrading lusts. Shall I ask you, are you clothed with divine energy? Is it your labor by day and by night, to be crowned with the stars of heaven�the Christian virtues ? Do you know them all one by one ? have you studied them? Is it the labor of your life that these virtues be incorporated in your being? Does their radiance envelop your person? or does your manner of going and spiritual attitude give a negation to these inquiries ? Being clothed with the wedding garment is the only certificate of citizenship. 'My son, give me your whole heart.' 'He who is not with me, is against me.' Communal homes can only be sustained by a living exercise of the Christian virtues. Individuals fail because they do not cultivate them. Because of a lack of these virtues the men-made communities of modern times have failed. Where are they ? Where is 'Brook Farm' with its high ideals, and its cultivated men and women ? Where is the 'Hopedale Community?' Its founder, Adin Ballou, endeavored to give the marriage order opportunities to manifest 'Christian Socialism.' The craving of the 'lust of the flesh and of the mind' of the animal man swamped his labors. Where is the North American Phalanx with its able men and splendid opportunities? Where is the Russian Community of Oregon? Its members discussed themselves to pieces while maintaining their sovereign individualities. The woman as above described was not there. In organizing and maintaining communal homes, the presence of those who are clothed with divine energy, and crowned with the stars of heaven�the Christian virtues, will be more and more a necessity.
