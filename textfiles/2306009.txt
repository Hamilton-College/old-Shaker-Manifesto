SCRIPTURE TEXT. We are asked, What authority can there be for saying that Jonah was swallowed by a whale? As we know but very little about the whales of the Bible, and still less about Jonah, we will take the testimony of the worldly wise men on this subject, and if we do not get into a whale they may get us into a muddle. In the book of Jonah it is said, Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. Jonah i., 17. While in the New Testament it reads, For Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly. Matt, xii., 40. 'Much criticism has been expended on the Scripture account of Jonah being swallowed by a large fish.' One writer says 'we might as well doubt all other miracles in Scripture as to doubt this. There is no question of hard or easy, natural or unnatural, probable or improbable, in regard to a real miracle.' Smith's Die. If it is a miracle, then it makes no difference whether it says the whale s wallowed Jonah or Jonah swallowed the whale. God is able bj a miracle to do either. It is said that the word which is translated whale, could as well be translated sea monster, or serpent or dragon or seal. Parldmrst however, says, that the fish was not of the whale kind, but of the shark kind. Another writer says, The word translated whale in the New Testament, signifies a great fish and nothing more. B. Diet. As this becomes one of the disputed passages over which but little or no light can be cast to prove satisfactory, all readers must be left to guess their own solution. It is worth noticing that the 'fish' of Jonah is found five or six times in paintings in the Roman catacombs assigned to the first two centuries, and that it is distinctly a dragon. Brit. Ency. Bishop Jebb thinks that Jonah was lodged in the back part of the whale's mouth, while G. C. Anton endeavored to solve the difficulty by supposing that just as the prophet was thrown into the water, the dead carcass of some large fish floated by, into the belly of which he contrived to get, and that thus he was drifted to the shore! One writer thinks that Jonah was taken prisoner on his journey to Nineveh, and retained there for three days. Nineveh was presided over by the fish god, to whom was paid divine honors, and it was this fish god, or great fish that swallowed Jonah or retained him, as a prisoner, in the city. The writer in Smith's Dictionary accepts the whole story as a miracle and says. 'The authority of Jesus on this subject is just as good as it is on any other, and if we reject his sanctions and interpretations of the Old Testament we reject his whole mission. He then informs us that, some think this story was taken from the one referring to Hercules, who 'sword in hand leaped into the throat of a sea monster, and for three days and three nights maintained a tremendous conflict in the monster's bowels, from which he at length emerged, victorious and unharmed.' Rev. Wm. Houghton says that the fish which swallowed Jonah 'must have been a large specimen of the White Shark which sometimes attains to the length of thirty feet; and several writers testify that this great fish has been known to swallow men whole, and in one was found the body of a man in military armor. And to make this more probable one writer says that a whole horse has been found in the belly of a White shark. 138 THE MANIFESTO. We hope the fact may be established that Jonah did actually enjoy that wonderful sea voyage, for the space of three days! After working so hard for the big fish and the fisherman, the Rev. writer could not let Jonah return pleasantly to his home, but addsï¿½'At best, Jonah was a poor, distressed hypochondriac, easily discouraged and easily elated.'
