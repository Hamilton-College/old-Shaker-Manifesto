We are gathering apples, pears, sweet corn, potatoes, etc, all of these look so perfect in form, and are of such excellent quality, we might imagine they grew in the garden of Eden. In hrashing our grain, the oats turned out over fifty bushels to the acre; rye yielded in proportion. We have a full supply of garden products from vegetables, fruits, and roots each in its season. The weathr being so dry during April, May and June our meadows did not yield the amount of hay they did last year, consequently there will not be so many tons to sell. We shall have enough to supply home stock. The standard of our moral obligations we endeavor to bear aloft both by precept and example. In our connection here we find, Many men of diverse minds, Many men who choose to stray And their foolishness display. Many who their wills control, Exhibiting a dingy soul, There's a few who still declare, By the Truth their lives they square.* The health of Community, generally, good. There are some who can not always stand erect under the pressure of Life's burdens and so need the help of a good physician. Elder Arthur Bruce gave us a short call on Aug. 28th, which was very pleasant. It increases our love which is the life of the soul. Calvin Q. Eeed. South Family. Sept. 1899. 'The world moves' bringing to us blessings, rich and many. The new highway is rapidly approaching completion; the traveling public are watching and waiting for the good time coming, when the old road shall be no more, and the crooked, winding ways of the old mountain road will give place to the strait path where the wayfarer can travel without a fear. Brothers, Frederic McKechnie and Daniel OffordSisters, Eldress Anna White, Sarah Burger and Cecelia DeVere who attended the Peace Convention at Mystic, Conn., on Sunday afternoon, the 27th ult. gave a rehearsal of the meetings, in the TERMS. THE MANIFESTO. 157 Hall of the Church family. As we listened to their remarks we were more and more convinced that the 'world moves,' and that goodness is filling the souls of men. Elder George Clark, of Enfield, Conn., called here on a sunny morning in Aug. and in the afternoon Elder Arthur Bruce of East Canterbury paid us a hurried visit. The 'world moves' and so they could not tarry long, for the call to all is Forward. We shall much regret the passing away of The Manifesto, it was such a pleasing medium of communication with friends far and near, but the 'world moves' and all things of this world must pass away, but the word of eternal truth and light which we have sought to publish in the earth can never die. Genevieve De Grata. North Family. Sept. 1899. The beautiful autumn weather of September, clear and sunny, yet cool, finds us with haying all finished, potatoes almost all in, and rye and other grain crops safely housed. We are now awaiting the arrival of a portion of our corncutting machinery from the repairer, and then we shall be able to cut the ensilage corn that is to feed our milk-producers throughout the approaching winter. Of fall apples we had a very plentiful supply from our Eed Astrakhan, Twenty Ounce, and other trees. Winter apples still remain to be gathered, so soon as they shall ripen, and though they are not over-abundant we shall yet have enough, and that as the proverb tells us is as good as a feast. Our bee-keeping experiment has been quite a success. From our five hives we have so far, taken 100 lbs. of honey and expect to get yet more before winter comes. Meantime the bees, angry at the robbery of their stores, are continually on the alert to sting any one who comes near their homes, or else diligently search into belated squash and bean blossoms for the means to make up that 'more' which we are expecting. We have received in printed form copies of a vote of thanks from the authorities of New Lebanon, expressing appreciation of our liberality in donating right-of-way for the New State highway that runs through our lands. Such tokens of the good-will of our neighbors are valuable and to be valued, and we feel correspondingly grateful for them. In concluding these Notes we have only to mention that a few of us had the privilege of visiting the 34th Annual Conference of the Universal Peace Union at Mystic, Conn, towards the end of August. It was very pleasant to meet with so many lovers of the cause of peace and good-will among nations. We are all agreed that peace and good-will between individuals is the only right thing. Those who met at this conference met to maintain that it is also the only right thing between nations. We derived much good from our brief intercourse here, and believe that vs e also ministered good and the whole aim of life can be summed up can it not?in these few brief words, to give and to get good. Frederic McKechnie.
