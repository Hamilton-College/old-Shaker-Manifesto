THE TRUE SHEPHERD'S VOICE. ELVAH F. COLLINS, MT. LEBANON, N.Y. 1. Hear the sweet voice of the Shepherd of Israel, Calling the lost sheep home- 2. Flee ye in haste from the darkness now deep'ning, Ere he doth turn away; 3. Limped, the silvery streams that are winding, Thro' verdant pastures broad- Home to the fold of his love and tenderness, No more in sin to roam. And in the wilds of a fruitless wilderness, Blighted your hopes decay. Gardens, where flowers of immortal pu-ri-ty, Send forth their breath to God. Wander no more on desolate mountains, Nor o'er the desert barren and drear, Wander no more on desolate mountains, Nor o'er the desert barren and drear, Wander no more on desolate mountains, Nor o'er the desert barren and drear, Heed ye the tones that are pleading in mercy, Come to my fold my blessing to share. Hear ye the voice of the Shepherd of Israel, Come to my fold I'll gather you near. Heed ye the voice that so sweetly is calling, Come to my fold, in love draw ye near.
