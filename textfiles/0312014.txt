CORRESPONDENCE We confidently expect that our noble-hearted brother (Elder Wm. Leonard) will forgive us for making a few extracts, without permission, from a lengthy and valuable communication from his pen, which was not designed for publication. To us it was a jewel when received ; and it was placed in our casket us such ; and we feel quite certain that it would be interesting and instructive to many of the readers of our ' Monthly ; ' but it is too pro- lix to publish in its entirety. Yet we hope that even the fragmentary presentation thereof will not lessen its illustrative force, nor mar its symmetrical beauty.
