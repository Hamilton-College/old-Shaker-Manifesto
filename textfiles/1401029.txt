A Hindoo has been preaching in Boston... A Hindoo has been preaching in Boston Mass, in a Unitarian church, and we trust that the church members have been made better by his presence. He does not profess to be a Christian and may not see the necessity for such a change. He says ' We believe in the grand doctrine that God in his spiritual glory has come down to earth, and that now access between him and us is direct. That glorious doctrine of true Christianity has been obscured and dimmed by men who lack the appreciation of the teachings of their own scriptures, but the time has come when the claims of the Holy Spirit shall be vindicated. If the spirit of God is a living presence, if he is a consuming fire, if he is a ready counselor, if he is one to whom every appeal may be made in a moment of perplexity and sorrow, we are bound to tell the world what the responses of that Spirit are. ' This catholic spirit and clear view as seen by the distant light of a hindoo mind, would compare favorably with the greater light of a Christian dispensation. St. Paul has said, 'As many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God,' and no doubt this influence may be felt in India as well as in the United States.
