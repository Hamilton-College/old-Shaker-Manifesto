RELIGION MARION PATRICK In reflecting on the subject of religion, we are led to consider the saying of the wise Solomon : ' Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.' Religion is a cheerful and happy practice ; its neglect brings sadness and melancholy. That religion demands of us the renunciation of all enjoyments in life, reserving nothing to balance the sacrifice, is a sad mistake, and is a fearful drawback to its advancement among mankind. How much wiser and better mankind would be, were all endowed with the full conviction that true happiness consists in the cultivation and exercise of all Christian virtues ! As the gentle dew falls on the flowers to revive their drooping leaves, so should religion inspire the spirit, and renew its latent energies in times of affliction ; and remain as an abiding solace for all the trials we may be brought to endure. The beauty of a truly religious life is one of its valued recommendations. It teaches us how to live, to merit one another's respect and love ; contributes to our present comfort and future happiness ; is an invaluable gem which shines brightest in adversity; a sterling jewel that imparts godly impulses to the heart, and a gentle spirit that leads to a far better world. Its influence calms the ruffled scenes of life; gives assurance of an endless happiness, and is a steadfast anchor to the soul. It shows itself in benevolent actions, proceeding from the most unselfish motives, knows not the lust of power, nor seeks its own preferment. Its creed is, ' Do Good, love mercy, and walk humbly before God.' Its sect is the pare in heart wherever found, and its index, Him. who went about doing good â€” illustrating the spirit of God in the human heart.
