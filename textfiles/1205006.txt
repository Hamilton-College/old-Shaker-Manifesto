WHAT SHALL THE MOTIVES BE! ADA S. CUMMINGS What shall the motives be Throughout the present year? Shall they be for evil, Or shall they bring good cheer: Shall the Angel Reaper's E'er search for wheat in vain? Or shall they find a store Of ripened, golden grain? Shall my heart be growing A crop of evil deeds? Or carefully produce A harvest of good seeds? Shall my hands cease labor Because the work is hard? Or shall I with new vigor Discouragements discard? Shall my life be wasted And time be spent in vain? Or, constantly improve Each moment for my gain? Shall I cultivate the thorn And let the roses go? Or tares, cast in the fire That flowers sweet may grow? With careful watch, I'll give The tares and thorns no room ; Rich graces from the spheres, Within my heart shall bloom. That, when the Angel lieapers Bind up the golden grain, They find in me a harvest,â€” A life not spent in vain. West Gloucester, Me.
