Mary Clark Mary Clark, at Pleasant Hill, Ky. June, 10, 1894. Age 77 years. Sister Mary came to Pleasant Hill in 1860, with a family of three brothers and a nephew. She was a quiet, peaceable Sister; faithful at all times to her duty, and now that she has entered into rest, we can say, 'Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.'
