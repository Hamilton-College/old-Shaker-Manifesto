UNSELFISH. By Ann Cumings. 'Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much: but where little is forgiven the same loveth little.'Luke, vii., 47. TTTE are told that an acknowledged sinner finds forgiveness, for the reaV V son that she loved much; also that where little is forgiven, the same loveth little. Who that has known what it was to feel that before God, and THE MANIFESTO. 29 the light of an awakened conscience, he was sinful, and needed the forgiveness of God, can fail to appreciate the worth of this divine blessing, and feel himself under some obligation to extend it to other souls. In John, xxi., 15, Jesus asks, 'Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? ' We may infer that Simon was surrounded by those who constitute the vine of the earth ; fathei, mother, sister and brother. He said unto him. 'Yea, Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee.' Then Jesus answered, 'Feed my lambs,' thus giving a practical demonstration of professed love for him. Thrice the question is repeated, 'Lovest thou me?' each time receiving an affirmative answer, Simon is commanded, or requested to prove his love for the Master by feeding his sheep and lambs. How unselfish the return desired, for the love the disciple bore the Master. How unlike the element which seeks to accumulate and appropriate for selfish ends, rather than befriend and minister unto his little ones, in his name. Again Jesus says, 'I am the good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have which are not of this fold ; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd.'John, x., 14, 15, 16. May we not imagine the millennium very near, if not already come, when all the lost sheep of the house of Israel are found by the good Shepherd, brought home, and there is one fold and one Shepherd?
