It is a fact known to the philosophical instrument-makers, that if a metal wire be drawn through a glass tube, a few hours afterward the tube will burst into fragments. This will not happen if a piece of soft wood is employed. In these times, when glasslamp chimneys are in such wide use, it is of no little importance that this fact should be made known. Thousands of persons who have been in the habit of using wires, table forks, and a variety of metallic articles in the washing of these chimneys, will, in the above stated fact, find the reason of their chimneys so often snapping to pieces on the lamp.
