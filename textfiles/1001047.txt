Home Topics Stair carpets should always have a slip of paper... Stair carpets should always have a slip of paper put under them, at and over the edge of every stair, which is the part which they wear first in order to lessen the friction of the carpet, against the boards beneath. The strips should be within an inch or two as long as the carpet is wide, and about four or five inches in breadth. A piece of old carpet answers better than paper if you have it. Red flannel underwear Red Flannel Underwear.—Winter or summer, nothing better can be worn next the skin than a loose, red woolen, flannel shirt ; red, for white flannel fulls up, mats together,, and becomes tight, heavy, and impervious ; woolen, not cotton, because that merely absorbs the moisture from the surface, while (woolen) flannel conveys it from the skin, and deposits it in drops on the outside of the shirt, where it is soon dried without injury to the body. Dr. J. H. Hanaford says, in the Golden Rule... Dr. J. H. Hanaford says, in the Golden Rule, that in order to make the most of the little nutriment contained in potatoes they ought to be steamed or baked. The latter is best, and soaking in cold water for half an hour before putting in the oven is an advantage. In neither case should the skin be removed before cooking, or eating afterward. Bed-bugs Bed-bugs. —A sufferer from bed-bugs writes as follows : ' After fighting them eight years I learned, from a girl that had served as a chambermaid in a large boarding house, that bugs can be exterminated for all time. I immediately followed her direction, which was to take grease that had cooked out of salt pork, melt it and keep it melted (the vessel can be kept on a pan of coals), and put it with the feather end of a quill into every place where I could find a bug. It is necessary to see that the bedcords or slate are entirely free from the pests. It is more than thirty years since a bug has been seen in my house.'
