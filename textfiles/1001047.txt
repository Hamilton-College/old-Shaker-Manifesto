Bed-bugs Bed-bugs. â€”A sufferer from bed-bugs writes as follows : ' After fighting them eight years I learned, from a girl that had served as a chambermaid in a large boarding house, that bugs can be exterminated for all time. I immediately followed her direction, which was to take grease that had cooked out of salt pork, melt it and keep it melted (the vessel can be kept on a pan of coals), and put it with the feather end of a quill into every place where I could find a bug. It is necessary to see that the bedcords or slate are entirely free from the pests. It is more than thirty years since a bug has been seen in my house.'
