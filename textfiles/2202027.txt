To the Memory of Eldress MARY P. VANCE. The Reaper came at noonday And took from our embrace, Our patient, worthy Sister, To dwell in holier place. Yet still we feel her presence, Although no form we seeAn Angel near in guidance As earthly friend can be. We seem to hear her whisper, 'Faint not, beloved few, The Comforter is promised, And God hath watch o'er you. In sacrifice I'm with you, In burden, and in prayer; Your fondest hopes and interests Are still my trust and care. Oh precious gospel kindred Acept a Sister's love, This hallowed bond of union O may we e'er preserve.' We've heard the Spirit message, Its import we will keep; May you, dear Sister, Mother, Blest fruits of labor reap. Alfred, Me.
