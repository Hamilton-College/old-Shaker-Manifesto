HOW TO KILL AN ENEMY. [Contributed by D. C. Brainard.] 'There is but one way to kill an enemy,' says the Christian Witness, 'and that is by putting coals of fire upon his head, that does the business for him at once; Lie in wait for him, and when you catch him in trouble, faint from hunger or thirst, or shivering with cold, spring upon him like a good Samaritan, with your eyes, hands, tongue and heart full of good gifts, just feed him. give him drink, warm him with clothing and words of kindness, and hn is done for. You have killed an enemy, and made a friend at one shot.'
