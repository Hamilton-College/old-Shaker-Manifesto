A BURDEN BEARER. Elizabeth G. Lake. Not mine are luxuries of earth; I seek not fashion's vain display; Nor claim I gift of genius rare : My earthly heritage is care; With toiling, struggling, day by day, I seek for good of lasting worth. My life-work few may understand, For silent forces, all unseen, Attend me wheresoe'er I go� A constant prayer my soul doth know, And nothing ' common or unclean' Comes to me from the Father's hand. My heart with sympathy o'erflows For every fellow-being's need; And as I toil along, unknown, Grieved oft by sorrows not my own, I wonder at the selfish greed That feeds upon another's woes. But not for me to feel unkind To harshly judge or censure any; Each to his Master stands or falls; Singly to one my duty calls, Though working always for the manyFaithful to serve I freedom find. Content am I to harvest here Results of whatsoe'er I sow ; Nor enyy I the worldling's pride� With simple fare I'm satisfied, And fear no harm from outward foe, While peace within my soul doth cheer. Yet burdened heavy day by day, I often weep and sigh alone, For this�God's family aru, one : Redeeming work is not yet done ; Christ in the flesh must yet atone Till all shall learn the living way.
