Little Things of Life It Is the babbling spring that flows gently, the little rivulet which runs along day and night by the farm house, that is useful, rather than the swollen flood, or the roaring cataract. Niagara excites our wonder, and we stand amazed at the power and greatness of nature there, as she pours it from her hollow hand. But one Niagara is enough for a continent, or the world—while the same world requires thousands and tens of thousands of silver fountains and gentle flowing rivulets, that water every farm and meadow, and every garden, and that shall flow night and day, with their gentle, quiet beauty. So with the acts of our lives. It is not by great deeds, like those of martyrs, that good is done; it is by the daily and quiet virtue of life—the kind temper, the meek forbearance, the spirit of forgiveness.
