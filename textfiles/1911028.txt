The Bible Class. We place here in this little corner of our Manifesto... We place here in this little corner of our Manifesto a sweet bait to attract the attention of the young people among Believers, who are interested in the study of the Scriptures, which we are sure must be the case in every Society. We have asked a question which will take research, thought, and spiritual jugdment to answer, and we would like to hear from each one their own decision, and the result will be published in the next Manifesto. We would like all answers to reach us by the fourteenth of the month that they may be ready for the next issue. Let each answer be upon a separate slip of paper, written only on one side, and with name attached. Enclose all from one family in the same envelope with nothing else so that time need not be wasted to assort them. We think a research like this among the treasures of the Bible will bring to view many hidden gems. We cannot say until we have tried it just now the answers will be published. If several different answers are given, we may insert them all, giving the highest choice the irst place. 1. Which two verses of Psalms, used as a prayer, are the sweetest and strongest? 2. Which is the most noble act of self-sacrifice mentioned in the Old Testament, and why? 3. Who is the grandest character in the Old Testament, and why? 4. Which is the most interesting book of the Old Testament? 5. Which of all the Savior's promises contains the most comfort? 6. Which are the two wisest Proverbs? 7. Which is the most joyous Psalm?
