HERALD OF CELESTIAL LIGHT WATSON ANDREWS Teeeming with celestial light Heaven's Herald, haste ye onward. Ever toward the highest hight Soaring, call the nations homeward. Hail the day and hail the hour— Angel tongues proclaimed thy calling— Kingdoms totter, lose their power, Error—Babylon is falling. Rise then, Herald, in thy might, Millions wait thy saving power ; And to shed thy blessed light, ~Now's the day, and now's the hour.' Inspiration—gift Divine— Fans the flame upon thy altar ; Every precious gift is thine ; Speed thee, Herald, do not falter— Teeming with celestial light, Onward upward in the right. N. Union, O. North Union, O., Sept. 28, '79. Dear Editor Brother.—The above acrostic was written some time ago, but having seen no precedent for its admission into your columns until your last issue, I hesitated about forwarding it. Hope it will be satisfactory. One merit it certainly has, to wit, truthfulness. All well, yours in love, Watson .
