The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 4. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Rewritten by Henry C. Blinn. Ebenezer Cooley saw in vision, a woman whose -appearance was glorious and her face shone as bright as the sun. In the beginning of the year 1781, he visited the Church at Watervliet, N. Y. and when he saw Mother Ann, he knew her to be the same woman whom he had seen in a ywsion. Mother Ann spoke to him and said ' I have seen you in vision. You must go forth and preach the gospel. You ought to have been prepared before this time. ' This strengthened his faith, and after having confessed his sins, and been instructed what to do to be saved, he was filled with the h�ly spirit, and became a powerful^ preacher of the gospel of Christ. Under his ministration many were converted to the faith. Ebenezer Cooley and Israel Chauncey were the first missionaries from the Society of New Lebanon that preached the gospel in the state of New Hampshire. Their first visit was in Sept. 1782, and their first meeting was held in the Free Baptist Church, at Loudon Center, N. H. Ebenezer became a member of the Society at New Lebanon ^and for several years officiated as tke senior Elder in the novitiate order. Hezekiah Hammond, of New Lebanon was much opposed to the testimony of the gospel and was not willing that any of his family should go and see the Believers. Subsequently inspired by a visionary dream he resolved to go and see Mother Ann and the Elders for himself. In June, 1780, he went to Watervliet, N. Y. and remained over the Sabbath. On Monday he sent tor his horse, and made arrangements to return to his home. Father William Lee, spoke to Hezekiah about the sin of unbeliel, but without effect. Mother Ann then spoke to him about his receiving the word of God, and that he should give it his attention. Hezekiah stood in silence for a short time and then said, 'The hand of the Lord is upon me. I cannot go home, at present. Accepting the faith he made an honest confession of his sins to God, and then returned to his home to consummate the work which God had placed in his soul. Becoming established in the faith, he gathered his whole family to the gospel, and remained faithful unto death. Hezekiah was a preacher of the word of God and on this account was dreaded by the enemies of the cross of Christ. He was brought before the commissioners in Albany, in 1780, and being found a fearless preacher of the Divine Spirit, he was charged with being an enemy to the country, and with others committed to prison. In Aug. 1783, Mother Ann and the Elders called at the home of Hezekiah, in the town of New Lebanon, N. Y., and made a visit of a few hours. Israel Chauncy, of New Lebanon, visited Mother Ann and the Elders at Watervliet, N. Y. in June 1780. While he was absent, his wife, Elizabeth, had a remarkable vision, during which she saw Mother Ann and the Elders at Watervliet, and Israel was with them in the worship of God. Israel appeared to be in great tribulation, and putting up his hands, she heard him say, ' Pray for me. Forgive me, for thou knowest all the sins that I have committed from my youth up to this day. ' She then heard, in vision, Mother and the Elders say,�'* Thy sins are gone, open beforehand to judgment. ' Mother Ann then took Elizabeth by the hand and immediately the vision ceased, and she found herself in her own house. When Israel returned, the vision was related to him. 'It is a true vision of God, ' said he. 'and these things were shown to you as plainly as though you had been there, in person.' On hearing his report the whole family were tilled with the spirit of God. and with great joy. A few days after this, Israel and Elizabeth made a visit to the Church, and Mother Ann met them at the door. Elizabeth knew her to be the same woman that she had seen in vision. On the second night, after their arrival they enjoyed a beautiful meeting. Israel and Elizabeth embraced the faith and entered the gospel work by a full confession of all sin. At the time of their departure, Mother Ann said to them. 'Now you must go home and set your house in order, for there will be great numbers of people who will soon come to visit you. You have begun to bear for other souls, and you must never fail.' Israel gave himself wholly to the work of God and was a faithful minister of the gospel of glad tidings. Nathan and Hannah Goodrich, made a visit to Watervliet, in June, 1780, to see Mother Ann and the Elders. They arrived at the place while the family were engaged in their religious service. Some one was delivering an exhortation and urging the necessity of a living, practical righteousness. The first words that they heard, were,� 'Strip off your pride and shake off the abominations of your heart. ' Nathan and Hannah entered the meeting and were convinced with what they saw and heard that it was God's work, and that these people were his living witnesses. Before the close of their visit, both accepted the faith and lived to become earnest .and able advocates of the cross of Christ. Esther Brackett visited Mother Ann and the Elders while they were imprisoned at Albany. While engaged in conversation, Mother Ann said to her,�' You must be born again or you cannot be saved from sin. He that is born of God cannot commit sin. You must become as a little child. ' ' The signs spoken of by Christ, follow them that believe. They shall speak with new tongues ; the sick are healed, and the spirit of God is made known by divers operations. Search ihe Scriptures, and labor to get an understanding of them. God is merciful and will give to them that ask. I have suffered many things for my faith, and you must do the same, if you would be saved.' John Demming of Hancock, Mass. visited the Church at Watervliet in June, 1780. He accepted the faith and promised to obey the gospel testimony. He then informed Mother Ann that he was poor and in debt, and knew of no way to pay his creditors. Some of his family had been sick and the physician's bill was quite large. Mother Ann said to him. ''If you are faithful to obey the gospel, God will bless you and make you prosperous. Returu to your home, put your hands at work and your heart to God. Learn your family to be industrious and you will be able to pay your debts, and none of your creditors will trouble you. ' '� Instead of applying to physicians, take faith in the power of God, and your family will be healed.' Among many other things Mother gave him this advice,�You must never cut your nails, nor trim your beard, nor scour your buckles, nor do any such thing on the Sabbath, unless in case of great necessity. ' John accepted the admonition and went home in obedience, and found all the promises fulfilled in a remarkable manner. In a short time he was able to pay all his debts : his physician's bills grew less and a general prosperity attended him. Hannah Siiapley, of New Lebanon, visited Mother Ann and the Elders, in June, 1780. Hannah was convicted of sin and received faith in the testimony She confessed to Mother Ann that she had not lived to the light that she had received. Mother then said to her. 'You must begin at the top twigs and crop them off, and continue the work until you come to the root, and then you must dig that up, that there may never be a future growth. ' Hannah carefully and faithfully regarded the word of God that was spoken to her. She accepted the faith, and the cross of Christ. Asa Allen made a visit to see Mother Ann and the Elders while they were at Stafford, in Oct, 1782. He had heard many strange reports about the people and concluded to see and heai and judge for himself. After a short visit he returned home. The next day he went again. As the door was open he saw the Believers rise from the table and then kneel in thankfulness to God for his mercies. Soon after this, Mother spoke to Asa. 'We are of that Community that worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Jesus Christ,Jand have no confidence in the flesh.' �'We can testify to all souls that God has laid a sure foundation of an everlasting Kingdom of righteousness and peace, which can never be moved nor shaken. He thatiis to rule therein is Christ, and of the increase of his government and kingdom there shall be no end.' Asa became convinced that he had heard the word of God, and was desirous to find a relation to the Kingdom of Christ. The Eldersjthen answered him #in these words. ' The first offering that God accepts is a true confession of all sin, and then they must be forsaken forever. ' Asa accepted the^gift^and set out to obey the gospel. Mother Ann then said to him. '' Those who through faith and obedience find a just relation to Christ, thus revealed, will of all souls, be the most blessed. I see it. ;teT know it. God will pour his blessing upoa them.' Samuel Fitch was one of the first persons that visited Mother Ann and the Elders at Watervliet, N. Y. He arrived at evening and tarried over night. Mother Ann related to him the^manner in which the spirit of God wrought upon her, in the first of her faith, and of the remarkable dealings and manifestations of God to her, from time to time. ' I saw by revelation the loss of all mankind, not only the present generation, but those of past ages. I saw them clothed in blackness and darkness. I have seen souls in the regions of darkness, in agony and distress. I have seen the dead rise and come to judgment, and receive the gospel, and travel in the regeneration.' Samuel was convinced that Mother and the Elders had the power and the revelation of- God. He confessed his sins and became an active and zealous laborer in the vineyard of Christ. He visited Mother Ann at the time she was imprisoned at Poughkeepsie, and manifested great solicitude for the safety and protection of Believers. While on their extended missionary tour to the Eastern states in 1783, Mother Ann and the Elders visited Samuel at his own home in Richmond, Mass, on the twenty-fourth of July and remained there several days; A great many people called to see the Believers at this place, and fortunately nothing serious occurred to disturb them. A ?ew days after this, however, .while the Elders were present, a furious mob threatened to break into the house, but were prevented by Samuel and other Brethren. A warrant was obtained and Samuel with others of the Believers were appreicnded and committed to Barrington ail to be tried by the County Court. The result of this s&amp;cond trial has not jeen left on record, but we may well suppose that like many others of a simiar kind, it ended in a farce. (TO BE CONTINUED.)
