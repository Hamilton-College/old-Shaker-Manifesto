Deaths. Mary Shepard Mary Shepard, at Watervliet, O., Dec. 22, 1891. Age 56 yrs. 11 mo. and 20 days. Sister Mary has been a faithful worker among Believers for fifty years. She came to the fold when she was but six years old and has been a good Sister to the cause. She will be very much missed by all, for we can see her no more. When well, we could see Sister Mary every-where; she was always faithful at her post of duty. H. W. F. George M. Wickersham George M. Wickersham, at Mount Lebanon, Church, Dec. 25, 1891. Age 80 yrs.
