GERMS OF TRUTH Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. There are germs of truth upon the earth. That never have been known, And seeds of grace in ev'ry heart That angels there have sown; 2. The type of many unborn flowers, Are placed before our eyes; We catch a hope they yet will bloom, And then the vision dies; They struggle 'neath the heavy soil That shrouds the land today, The seeds of error check their growth, Impede their upward way. But when the magic spirit power Of angel ministry, Shall rule the elements of earth, All life the good will see. 3. And we who 'neath God's holy light Sad winter little know, May lend a summer's warmth to aid The soul in grace to grow. And we will pierce the threatening clouds 'Till sunshine floods the earth, 'Till it reveals the mighty strength And depth of angel worth. 4. And we will seek in every heart To find the germs of truth, And breathe thereon the holy life Of everlasting youth; Then, when the eventide of years Around our spirits close, No lingering fear or sad regret Shall mark the last repose.
