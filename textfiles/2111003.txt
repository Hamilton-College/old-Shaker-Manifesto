Read at the Funeral of Sister Averill A. Copley. Evelyn Strowbridge. The present occasion produces a universal feeling of oneness. A mingled intensity of sorrow, softened and chastened with joy. For the good it has been, around what remains of the fragile, long-suffering form, we tenderly wrap the tomb shroud, and by law immutable, virtually consign it to the consuming elements, from whence proceed no sigh of fear, of blighted ambition or cry of distress. Of the soul, the spirit, the being to be judged, rewarded and rejoiced, we speak with the select, sacred language of tenderness and love. We incline to go back to the days of childhood and review the good of that early period, and as we walk hand in hand in every-day association through youth and mature years, we note the progress of the Christian character, the growth of ability consecrated. Almost at the beginning of a promising life of willing activity, came the serious injury, productive of over thirteen years intense suffering. Even then though 'A veil hid from our eyes the events of succeeding years' it came like a heavy blow. Did her cheerful spirit lose any of its vigor and interest? Nay, nor the deft hands now cold in death, cease to do for the good of others. Kindness of heart and willingness to help others, especially the sick, have been corner stones to the character so well begun here, and as she nears her celestial homeï¿½open swings the door, and on Jasper walls in the light of divine promise we read. 'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.' And patience, a virtue so much needed and well tried by her extreme physical condition, was more than remarkable. When she was first afflictAverill ed, we missed her from the family circle, and as each passing duty or pleasure appeared, we distinctively felt that a link had been broken, but because of the inevitable fact, that health was almost totally and forever gone, we gradually relinquished hope to reason, and have been the pitying, sorrowing witnesses of prolonged sickness and pain. Now that relief has come, her spirit will find a more healthful atmosphere and continue the development of virtue and usefulness. Yet not afar is the spirit world, nor the souls of our invisible loved one, and as we seek to draw them around us, the sainted circle will be widened and strengthened by one more who has sought 'The Pearl of great price' conscientiously and patiently filled out her measure of life toil and suffering. And who, when the Virgin roll is called, can answer in the confidence of the upright. Shaker Station, Conn.
