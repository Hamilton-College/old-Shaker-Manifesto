PROFANITY [Contributed by J. S. Prescott.] 'Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. ' Dent, v: 11. Tins was a commandment to Israel, and is equally binding on every one of Adam's race. All are alike the workmanship of the matchless and uncreated One. All share in His boundless fullness, protection, redemption and inexpressible love. All are accountable to Him for the use of their time and talents, and it is God alone who can unfold our spirits with his resistless power. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, and David says ; ' While I suffer thy terrors, I am distressed; ' and God assures us, 'He will not hold him guiltless who taketh his name in vain. ' Shall poor dying man take the name of the Most High irreverently into his polluted lips, and hope to escape his righteous judgments? Tremble, ye swearers ; the withering curse, edged with horrid wrath, hangs over you. Let no one imagine that the occasion or circumstances will excuse him. Not even the sacerdotal robe can shield the guilty from retributive justice. If there is any difference in the sin of profanity, that uttered from the pulpit is the more shocking and heaven daring, and demands the severest rebuke. The remark of the young man on returning from church when he had listened to one of those wild harangues sometimes called sermons, was not far from correct. Said he, :'If I had profaned the name of my Maker as the preacher has today, I should be fined tomorrow : ' and one could hardly blame the little boy who in his artless manner said; 'Ma, I do not want to go to meeting again for the minister swears so. ' Could men but realize the low, degrading vulgarity of swearing, a sense of shame, if not the fear of God, would deter them from a habit so vile and inconsistent. Selected.
