To Polish Shirt Fronts and Wristbands . — Starch the fronts and wristbands as stiff as you can. Starch twice — that is, starch, dry, then starch again. Iron your shirt with a box-iron, in the usual way, making the linen nice and firm, but without any attempt at a good finish ; don't lift the plaits ; your shirt is now ready for polishing ; but you ought to have a board same size as a common shirt board, made of hard wood, and covered with only one ply of plain cotton cloth. Put this board into the breast of your shirt, damp the front very lightly with a wet sponge, then take the polishing iron, which is flat and beveled at one end — polish gently with the beveled end, taking care not to drive the linen up into wave-like blisters. Of course this requires a little practice, but if you are careful and persevere, in a short time you will be able to give the enamel-like finish which is so much wanted.
