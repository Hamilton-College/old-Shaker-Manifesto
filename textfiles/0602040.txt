A singular mathematical fact __A singular mathematical fact. Any number of figures you may wish to multiply by 5 will give the same result if divided by 2 â€” a much quicker operation ; but you must remember to annex a cipher to the answer, whenever there is no remainder, and when there is a remainder, whatever it may be, annex a 5 in the answer. Multiply 464 by 5, and the answer will be 2,320; dividing the same number by 2 and you will have 232, and as there is no remainder, add a cipher. Now take 357, and multiply by 5; there is 1,785. Divide the same number by 2, and you have 178 and a remainder; you therefore place a 5 at the end of the line, and the result is again 1,785.
