Letter Box Shaker Village, N. H. A. Shaker Village, N. H. My Dear Sister J. ;—It is a real privilege to write to you because 1 love you and I know that you take great pains to teach me and my companions nice lessons about the Bible and as I expect to live so good and happy in my pretty Shaker home, I want to learn all the good I can from the Bible and other good books. I want to promise you that I will be very industrious and try as hard to learn, and be prompt with my lessons as you are in teaching me. I am trying to be useful in other ways. Sister M. is teaching me to be helpful; since I have lived with her I have learned to darn stockings very nicely. Perhaps you will smile to hear a little girl praise herself but last week I showed my work to Sister L. and she said it was neatly done, and she would be willing to have it on her stocking; now if she said it was well, I guess you will believe it. 1 want to promise you, dear Sister J. that I will try real hard to be a good girl, and live kindly with all my little mates, so that you can love me and ever claim me as your little sister. Lovingly. Shaker Village, N. H. Mar. 1882 Forest Shaker Village, N. H. Mar. 1882 Dear Sister Mary;—As I was going to write to you I thought I would tell you that I am SHAKER MANIFESTO. 139 trying to be a good boy, so that I can become a good man and be like Br. William. I have learned my text from the Bible .to repeat this evening, I hope you will come and see us sometime in our Sabbath school. I have been to the sugar camp this week. It is two miles from home. We have tapped all the trees and have been chopping wood. We have two yoke of oxen. You must come to the Camp sometime. We had a good time playing hide and seek. I drove a yoke of oxen and they hauled a log to the Camp; the oxen had hard work to pull the log through the snow.
