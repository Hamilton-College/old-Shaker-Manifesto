Shaker Village, N. H. Mar. 1882 Forest Shaker Village, N. H. Mar. 1882 Dear Sister Mary;â€”As I was going to write to you I thought I would tell you that I am SHAKER MANIFESTO. 139 trying to be a good boy, so that I can become a good man and be like Br. William. I have learned my text from the Bible .to repeat this evening, I hope you will come and see us sometime in our Sabbath school. I have been to the sugar camp this week. It is two miles from home. We have tapped all the trees and have been chopping wood. We have two yoke of oxen. You must come to the Camp sometime. We had a good time playing hide and seek. I drove a yoke of oxen and they hauled a log to the Camp; the oxen had hard work to pull the log through the snow.
