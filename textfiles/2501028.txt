The time for making good resolutions... ,,The time for making good resolutions for the new year is already past; but the time for keeping good resolutions is still open. It is only as the influence of new year's resolutions is operative on the remainder of the year that there is any special gain from such resolutions.' 'Pkejudice may be considered as a continual false medium of viewing things, for prejudiced persons not only never speak well, but also never think well of those whom they dislike, and the whole character and conduct is considered with an eye to that particular thing which offends them.' 'Every man is a tamer of wild-beasts, and these wild beasts are his passions. To draw their teeth and claws, to muzzle and tame them, to turn them into servants and domestic animals, fuming, perhaps, but submissiveâ€”in this consists personal education.'
