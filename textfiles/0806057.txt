EVIL THOUGHTS You are not guilty on account of anything you cannot control. Evil thoughts follow some principle of association, some old channel of thought, or inherited predilection. The remedy does not lie in a frantic opposition to them. This only makes the impression deeper. Turn your attention away from them. Do not oppose them so much as neglect them. Above all, never let one of these cast-out devils find the house empcy, swept and garnished. Fill your mind with other things-. Be careful what you read. Read abundantly, and of the best books. An idle brain is the lodging-house of evil thoughts, as an unoccupied house gives shelter to tramps and unclean beasts.
