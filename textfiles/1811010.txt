OUR HEAVENLY PARENTAGE. Hamilton De Graw. 'Our Father and Mother who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.' To testify of the Fatherhood in nature is also a proof of the Motherhood, so in our spiritual parentage to testify of one is a proof of the other. Mankind have too long been half orphans, a masculine triune God 118,3 been a great source of the one-sided legislation that has afflicted mankind, but thanks to the increasing light of this Dispensation of Christ's Second Appearing, the darkness that has so long enshrouded the human soul is breaking away and it is coming to a fuller realization of that eternal truth that it has a Mother in heaven, tender and affectionate, ever ready to draw her wayward children to her by the bonds of pure love. We have representatives here of that divine order in the heavens, in the order of our spiritual leaders where the dual principle is practically illustrated in their Fatherly and Motherly care for their spiritual children. O my soul, take courage, look upward to that fountain of light and love and draw inspiration for the coming conflict between truth and error. Let thy light so shine that others may see the true way and glorify the divine Father and Mother of the New Creation that with infinite patience awaits the evolution of the soul from the chrysalis where its spiritual faculties are dormant, into the light of their presence where the soul finds its true home, and in the inspiration of the poet can exclaim, 'I have found a rich prize Of its virtues I would sing, Let th&gt; hills and the vallies In sweet echo ring. Tis a Mother 0 a Mother, No more an orphan I roam, For I've found a true Mother And she has gathered me home.' Sonyea, N. Y.
