John Whiteley, Dear Friend — I have read your advertisement in the 12 mo., Shaker Manifesto... New Bedford, January 8, 1880 John Whiteley, Dear Friend — I have read your advertisement in the 12 mo., Shaker Manifesto, and I will gladly accept your offer to send me the Divine Afflatus and The Shaker Manifesto for the year 1880. I here inclose twenty-one three cent stamps to meet the expense. I would 42 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 43 say that I have taken The Shaker Manifesto for three years and it has given me great pleasure. In 12 mo. number of Shaker MANiFESTo,vpage 274, is 'Shaker Theology,' article No. 1. I should like to see more clearly defined, through The Manifesto, as I hardly know what is meant by soul death in the last line. The Orthodox idea is that death is eternal to a great part of mankind. The Adventists say that death meafis that a large portion of our race will be burnt up,.both soul and body. I cannot accept either of the above ideas, for I don't for one moment believe in the possibility of a lost soul. But I do heartily believe in the eternal progression of our race from lower to higher conditions of life, and that All will be finally holy and happy with the ever loving Father of us all. Articles two, three, four and five have my hearty assent, in which I have long believed. In conclusion I would say that I wish it were in my power to help circulate The Shaker Manifesto among the peoples, by subscribing for several copies. But I am a poor old man, and poor in this world's possessions or I certainly would. But I do wish The Shaker Manifesto hearty success in breaking down the walls of old theology, and building up the new. I remain ever yours for the truth, Caleb C.
