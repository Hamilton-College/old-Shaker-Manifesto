The Old Faith and the New The God of Israel was to them a bloody God. The blood of beasts, birds and human beings their God demanded of them, or they thought he did, and they obeyed. Paul, in trying to harmonize the old, bloody faith, with the gospel of the new dispensation, engrafted the bloody atonement doctrine upon Christianity, making a falsity of it. As a consequence, those who cling to the old faith in confidence, think God a bloody being, who even murdered, or permitted the murder of his own Son, as an off set for sins committed by others. It is a sorrowful truth that in this late day of unusual intelligence, Christians should not see and believe, universally, that the only atonement demanded by, or accepted of God, is to renounce a sinful life and go and sin no more. This is the new faith. 162 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. Let the people accept the new faith ; rejecting the necessity of shedding the blood of Jesus, or the blood of any animal or bird, and return to God by following the life of Jesus, the Christ; or 'follow Paul, as lie fulloivcd Christ,' and rejecting all permissions of anybody to live differently than did Jesus, thus find an at-one-ment with God. The letter from the wife of Freeman (who believing in a bloody God, murdered his child, as he thought by God's direction), tells a sad story. There is great source for gratification to reason, that the people are losingfaith in such a bloody God, else we should have abundant repetitions of deeds like Freeman's. Still there are some, who still demand for themselves a bloody God to worship, and such should be watched as idiots or lunatics. Freeman, according to his wife's description, was too good a man for such a God as he believed in.
