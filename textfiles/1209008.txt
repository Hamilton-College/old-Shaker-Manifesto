BE MINE TO LOVE IN TRUTH. JOHN WHITELEY A love sincere, intense, Can never be concealed, While what is mere pretense Will clearly be revealed. Be mine to love in truth, If not so much is shown—¦ The aged and the youth Reap from the seed I've sown. If in humility 'twas sown And watered with my tears, The harvest fully grown Will leave no place for fears. God's blessing will attend The toiler in His field, And tho' life's labors end— Kind acts will increase yield. Shirley, Mass.
