Beloved Eldek Henry;ï¿½To-day, in the morning, at ten minutes past six o'clock, our venerable Elder Daniel Boler passed from time to eternity; aged 88 yrs. 6 mo. and 9 days. He was born May 2, 1804. This fulness of years has been conscientiously and consecratedly devoted to God according to the best of his understanding, comprehension and ability.
