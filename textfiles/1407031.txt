An improved diet brings in its train... An improved diet brings in its train improved health, improved tone of mind, improved morals. The angry passions lose their vio. lence. Men become reasonable creatures. Insanity, now unhappily on the increase, would become a thing of the past. With the tranquilizing of the passions we lose the fchief incentives tc war and murder of every kind. 'When comes the promised time when war shall be no more?' as shouting congregations energetically enquire with undoubted zeal, but with extremely little prospect of a satisfactory answer. If we were not brutalized and debased from our youth up with the accustomed sight of torn limbs and bleeding corpses displayed for our admiration in every street, we should hardly bring ourselves to contemplate the possibility of allowing the scenes of the battle-field to be enacted in our name. The difficulty which usually confronts us in the attempt to raise a reasonable discussion on the subject of food is the repugnance evinced by the carnivorous towards any description in plain language of the things that they are not ashamed to do daily. They unanimously agree to ignore the brutality of their proceedings, and are indignant at public attention being drawn to the revolting facts. It is not generally supposed to be an easy task to take away a bone from a dog ; when, therefore, we propose to take not only the bones, but also the flesh and the blood, from a large class who are in the habit of putting such things into their mouths, we cannot be j surprised that they should be indignant at the I insolence of the attempt.
