VOYAGE OF LIFE Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Upon the rocky shores of Time Our barques might anchored be, Yet pilot-like our spirits long To cross life's rolling sea. 2.0, youthful mariner beware! Thy vessel frail may strand, Unless 'tis guided on its way By Truth's unerring hand; To sail ... away! . . Upon its changeful tide, To brave the tempest and the storm, And o'er the billows ride Then sail ... away! And leave all phantom fears. Prepare with strength to meet the flow Of the incoming years Though deep and strong the current glides, Far out upon the sea, Yet Faith—thy compass—will direct, And Hope thy light will be ; Still sail away! Nor trust in thine own power, But watch and pray though calm the day, Or dark the midnight hour. 5. Thy finite vision cannot span. Or bound the mighty deep; The secrets of the future years, Within its bosom sleep; But sail away I O voyager on the main! 'Within the blessed port of peace, Sure anchorage thou wilt gain. 4. The treasured wealth of patient toil, Within thy spirit hold ; The shining pearls of Wisdom, place Upon life's threads of gold. And sail away! With Love at thy command, To buoy thee up, and cheer the way, To the immortal land.
