NOTES. The Cross of Christ Every person that understands the value of a Christian life, becomes interested, not only, in his own salvation, but also in the protection and salvation of all men. To pass from sin into righteousness or from death into life is the work which becomes manifest on the acceptance of life from God. All desire to be saved from that which leads to unhappiness and to rest assured that salvation is the ultimate of life's journey. Those who accept the :amc of Christian usually make earnest protestations of their belief and confidence in the redeeming qualities of the work. It should not only accomplish this but as the reward of obedience, 'Save his people from their sins, ' rather than as many may teach�in their sins. If this became the established rule, to destroy sin by a righteous life, this active working principle would then be a growth in righteousness which could easily be made manifest. How very singular it is that the way of the cross or the highway of godliness should present so many phases of discipline, so many forms of belief and so many systems of sacrifice. Even though it may be of a very diffusive quality and its particles may be caught up and appropriated, so that those who have gathered, one, two or more grains are led to suppose that what they have obtained is the best, and sometimes the only acceptable treasure, yet this fractional amount may point toward the spirit of righteousness in which they incline to rest in perfect satisfaction. St. Paul in his earnestness to maintain a just relation towards the wise Master builder, speaks out boldly and clearly by the inspiration of God that wells up from his own heart, ' God forbid,&gt;T said he, 'that! should glory save iu the cross of our Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world. ' What a noble declaration of faith I While so many were found to glory in the Avorks of unrighteousness this faithful apostle becomes a witness for the Church of Christ, a living member of the resurrection order. There was no mystery around this cross that presented1 the least doubt to his mind. Ho very well knew that to be spiritually minded Avas life and peace, and he quite as Aveli knew that to be carnallj minded was death to the soul. For him to accept the spirit of regeneration, was at tlie same time, to be crucified to the world, as a life in the spirit and a life in the flesh could not be maintained at the same time. ' For Avhat fellowship hath righteousness Avith unrighteousness, and Avhat communion hath light Avith darkness.' Whatever may have been the views entertained by the apostle at a previous date, in respect to the Church of Christ,, or the cross by which came salvation, he Avas now thoroughly decided respecting the course he should take and Avas equally bold in proclaiming it to all who would give a listening ear. The cross of Christ Avliich is the embodiment of the life of Christ has for its mission,�'to make an end of sin and to bring in everlasting righteousness.' Religious organizations with a bundle of creeds, or Avith a system of ceremonies would fail to hold even a distant relation to the Church as known by the disciples. Whatever may be the advantages ot the world, it is an enemy to the Church and a union would foreshadow a gradual decline and possibly no less certain,� death. It is very singular that... It is very singular that just at the time when the Bible is under a severe criticism, when the professors and profane are analyzing and comparing passage after passage through the hope of finding their origin or of solving the mystic doubts by which the Bible has been surrounded.�that some one should draw from the mouldering archives a document that bears the wonderful name of ' The teaching of the twelve Apostles.' So far the work has fared much better than many other papers that have been rescued from the tombs, although they also put forth the claim of genuine. Defenders of the faith are not wantinjr � to surround this treasure and to assure us that ' the genuineness of the document can hardly be doubted. ' That it belongs to the second Century and not farther from the birth of Christ than one hundred and sixty years. We Avonder that such a care should be exercised over those few pages of the octavo volume that was so fortunately brought to the light, while the other articles are but feebly noticed. That the Apostles teaching is a good moral lesson and well worthy of our attention, is readily admitted, and whether written in the first, second or third Century may not be of so much consequence as that it teaches the principles of righteousness. This passage in the fourth chapter is peculiar, 'My child, him that speaks to thee the word of God remember night and day, and thou shalt honor him as the Lord ; for where that which pertaineth to the Lord is spoken there the Lord is. ' This harmonizes very pleasantly with the advice that Paul gave to the P'phesians. 'Children obey your parents in the Lord ; for this is right. ' Eph. vi., 1. This illustrates a consistent Christian separation between the parents of generation and those of the regeneration. All may be teachers and demand attention, may be faithful and honestly devoted to the order in which they belong, but while one points toward the kingdom of God and its righteousness, the other gathers its blessings among the earthly treasures. The attempt to serve two masters has not proved conducive to spiritual interests. The only safe course for the Zion traveler is to ' seek first the kingdom of God, ' and this instruction whether found in the New Testament or in the supposed teaching of the Apostles will be quite safe to follow. We shall hope that other writings may be found which will prove of value in making many wise unto salvation.
