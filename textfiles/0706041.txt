Carding the cattle Carding the cattle.â€”A good idea, that of Bro. Tinkham, of the Green Mountain Freeman, to utilize the old worn up corn brooms in the cattle stables. 'We have seen people,' he says, 'card cattle when we thought neither carder nor animal much enjoyed it; the animal would cringe and shrink away from the card, and the carder would tear round and scold, 'because it did not keep still, evidently not thinking this was the only way the animal had of telling him he hurt. You never see a man rubbing his back against the door-casing unless it itches,nor do cows care to be carded unless they have the same occasion, and then not hard enough to make it a pain instead of a pleasure. We have found an old broom cut oft'up near the 'tying' to be an excellent article for grooming cows, especially about the roots of the tail, where a card will not work ; while not harsh enough to be painful, it will scratch nicely and reach where the card will not. About as much solid comfort as usually falls to the lot of mortals in this wicked world, may be taken by the man who loves animals in seeing them stretch themselves under his brush, or follow him about and poke their noses under his arm, or hold down their heads to be scratched, as natural as folks. Try the old broom, boys, and see how it works.'
