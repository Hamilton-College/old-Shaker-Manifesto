THE SLAUGHTER OF BIRDS FOR THEIR PLUMAGE Mr. Alfred Newton writes a striking protest to the Times against the wholesale slaughter of birds for the sake of ornamental feathers. He quotes the proceedings of a single sale of feathers to show that to supply that sale alone, 9,700 herons {or egrets) must have beon destroyed. All these feathers are said to have come from India last autumn. Mr. Newton observes that no country could supply 10,000 herons in a single breeding season, without nearly rooting out the stock. Moreover, 15,000 humming birds and upward were Included in the sale, of which 740 were of a single kind. As far as we know, none|of these birds really diminish the stock of food available for man, so that in destroying them for mere show we empty the world absolutely of a certain portion of its beauty and happiness, while the beauty is certainly by no means made up in the ornamentation of feminine toilets which is thus procured. In this age of fine moralities does no one really bestow a thought on the morality of such reckloss spoliation of life as this? â€” London Spectator.
