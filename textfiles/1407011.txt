OVERC0ME. NANCY G. DANFORTH. 'Be ye not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. ' Paul. How wide a field for thought is contained in these few words. Be not overcome of evil. Let not evil take possession of your spirit. We should not yield to any form of temptation that may present itself to our mind. Whenever the adversary whispers some excuse, some pretext for doing wrong, we must not be deceived and overcome of that evil. We should not be overcome of evil thoughts, either low cravings, in ourselves, or jealous surmisings of others. Neither with evil speaking, insinuations and inuendos. When wesire tempted to say aught that will detract from the truth, or in any way to enlarge more than is strictly truth, if in any point we yield, we are overcome of evil. The Apostle says, ' Be ye not overcome of evil. ' What shall we do? 'Overcome evil with good. ' How ? By resisting every impulse and tendency, which, if followed would lead us to do wrong. To resist effectually, is to put down all temptation when first presented, and not yield in any degree. This is the way we can overcome evil with good. When an evil thought is presented, cast it aside and call some good idea to our aid, fix our thoughts on some object worthy of our strife. If we would speak evil, then utter no word, but those of love and blessing. When tempted to take one step in a wrong direction, take more to do a kindness to another. If those around are annoyed or perplexed, then speak soothingly, and not add to their burdens. Finally, be true to our own souls, and confess the least departure from that which is good, thus mortify the evil nature within. By constantly practicing these things, we shall not be ' overcome of evil, ' but eventually become able to '' overcome evil with good. ' Canterbury, N. H.
