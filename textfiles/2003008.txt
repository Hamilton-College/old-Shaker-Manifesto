Sister Aurelia:--I was glad to hear from you through... North Falmouth, Jan. 6, 1890. Sister Aurelia :ï¿½I was glad to hear from you through the Manifesto. Your ideas in regard to the questions for the Bible Class accord with mine. I had decided in my mind that Jephthah's daughter was the greatest sacrifice and that the Book of Daniel the most interesting, before I received the last Manifesto. And now the question, 'Who is the grandest character in the Old Testament ? ' Is it not Daniel ? where will you find another whose record is so free from blot or stain as his, courage so dauntless, faith so steadfast and humility so deep. What a commanding presence he must have had as he stood before the throned Kings of Babylon, and anoounced his firm allegiance to his God, and then he was pronounced by a mighty archangel to be greatly beloved, his glorious visions of the far off future and the assurance that he should stand in his lot in the last days, surely, he was the grandest man in the Old Testament. From the signs of the times and what we read from the best literature of the day, it is evident that there is a silent unseen power working in the minds of men that will shake their old ideas into 'chaff that the wind driveth away.' Perhaps Daniel may now be sitting at his king's gate and is a medium of truth and righteousuess to us poor mortals. The Manifesto is as good as ever, the Editor's notes in January No., are excellent. The 'Notes about Home' are very interesting I wish we could have more of them. Is Sister Mary Ann Hill still with you ? I saw her name mentioned in the Manifesto a while ago, she must enjoy her last days after such a long life of rectitude and unselfish love. Kind angels are hovering about her, and when her earthly life is ended will bear her spirit to the presence of her Savior whom she loved and honored so well while here. My grand-daughter after four months confinement has recovered and is apparently well. I have not much to say about myself. My health is not very good. 1 am still compelled to 'walk in the world with the worldly.' I try to bear my burden with patience. Hoping to hear from you again, I remain with sincere respect and love to all, Your Brother, A. Lewis.
