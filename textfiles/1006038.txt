SMALL THINGS The smallest crust may save a human life; The smallest act may lead to human strife ; The smallest touch may cause the body pain; The smallest spark may fire a field of grain ; The simplest deed may tell the truly brave : The smallest skill may serve a life to save; The smallest drop the thirsty may relieve ; The slightest look may make a heart to grieve; Naught is so much but that it may contain The rose of Pleasure or the thorn of Pain.
