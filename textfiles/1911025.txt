White Water, O. Brother Henry :ï¿½Our crops are all good, this season. During the months of May and August it was very dry. We have harvested all our grain. We have had a bountiful supply of Potatoes, and also of Winter Apples, and the same may be said of small fruits generally. Our crops of Hay and Grain have been small. C. H. S.
