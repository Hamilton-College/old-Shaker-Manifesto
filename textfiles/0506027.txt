'CONSIDER THE LILIES' Slumbering in restful quiet — under the pure white mantle of snow — what miracles of wonder are reposing ! Miracles, scarce less wonderful than that of creation, await only the genial, magnetic rays of the sun, to astonish us with their beauty. First will come the violets, and then, the crocuses and tulips, from their wonderful bulbs. Every one has its own marked characteristic individuality — its own perfect life — to spring forth, to bud, to open and exhale its little wealth of bloom and fragrance, and then retire. So of all Nature's creations, in their simple state, be they bird or beast. They know their time, fulfill their life of freedom, and then retire. And does it seem probable that the wise Creator ever intended that his last and crowning work of completeness should have less of the spirit of spontaneity than inferior things ? Must she, because time was when her charm was in her dependence, ever be doomed to rob herself of the health and stamina — back bone — which her cares — her duties — so urgently demand of her? To every mortal the message comes: 'JEach Soul to its Maker.' No sponsor can answer for another, before ' the great white throne,' for ' the deeds done in the body,' each one must account for himself or herself. To live out our ideal of perfected man, or womanhood, physically, mentally and spiritually, is the call of God to our souls. If indifferent, and supine, on us will come the results — condemnation — for misimproved talents, and unfulfilled uses ; for '' I have called you to freedom,' and have given you every needed good that you might ' grow as the lily ' and obtain all the possibilities of life and being. E. H. Webster, Harvard, Mass.
