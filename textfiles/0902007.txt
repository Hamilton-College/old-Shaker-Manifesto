THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS ELIZAETTE SUTTON ' The pleasure of doing good is the only pleasure that never wears out. Then should we not live with the great truth constantly in mind, that unless we live to the glory of God, and the highest good of our fellow men, life would be to each one of us a failure ? ' If this is so, how guarded we should be against self ease and pleasure. Who would not wish to bear glad tidings of love and good will to all within the circle of their influence ? Home is where our good works should begin â€” right in the little group called Home. With so many privileges permitted me, I see that / can do some good if it is but little. Something smiles within me when I say to my friends : 'good morning!' or in a pleasant mood I lend a helping hand to lift the burdens of life, or smooth the pathway of some one under trying circumstances. If I see any one dejected have I a balsam to administer, in kind words of heaven-born love and deep soul interest, which may reflect sunshine, and give relief to half the disaffected feelings which too often arise ? Some love, with no hatred, removes a load of unpleasantness, and opens avenues of real good as a final result. I will live to do good; and strive to do no harm, that heaven may bless me; that my superiors may approve of and love me, and my associates truly appreciate my intentions to live as a Christian should live. This is the result, when full obedience to my Shaker faith is complied with. ML Lebanon, N. Y.
