THE SHAKER AS A PREACHER ' I look upon The Shaker as the very best means of spreading our Gospel principles, and a more effective missionary than any and all other preaching combined. I hope all believers will feel a pleasant duty in circulating and sustaining it.' — Elder Amos Stewart, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. ' We hail the monthly entrance of our Shaker as a season of large refreshment. The truths it preaches, though as old as eternal hills, are new as to-day. - We often feel moved by the inspirations of those who preach through it, and derive an encouraging cheer from such, which, did the authors realize, would well pay them. All hail, The Shaker !' — Eldress E. Farr, Union Village, 0. ' The Shaker comes to us in beautiful style. We are pleased with its onward, progressive and determined missionary spirit. May it ' go into all the world.' ' — Elder W. H. Wetherbee, Shirley, Mass. ' Can any feel other than that The Shaker ought to be blest with the largest success ? And instead of considering it a transient meteor, ought it not to be considered a permanent luminary — one of growth — like a good Shaker, to grow better with every added year ? Let us 'sustain the structure' and The Shaker by all means.' — Elder H. C. Blinn. ' The Shaker is a lively preacher to me. I think its sermons grow better with every additional number.' — Shubael Prentiss, Shakers, N. Y.
