ADIEU TO EARTH. Farewell all earthly pleasures, From my vision flee away; Your beauties so alluring, Do quickly pass away. How sordid are your treasures, How transient is their stay, And like the flowers of Summer Their beauties soon' decay. You boast of golden riches, Of things both bright and new; But often on their brightness A blemish comes in view. I see no lasting substance In all your great display, Your glory, pomp and splendor Earth-like will all decay. And vanish 'neath the brightness Of heaven's intrinsic worth ; There's naught within ymr borders That gives the soul new birth. Away from E'.irth's enticements My mind shall ever soar, Up to the land that's holy, For things that will endure. Shirley, Ifass.
