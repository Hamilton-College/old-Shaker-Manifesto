PUCKERED-PURSEDNESS A quaint minister once prayed that the church might be delivered from ' puckeredpursedness.' He meant that his desire was that the purses of his people would not be kept so tightly closed that the money could not get out from them to go on the errands of the Lord. The church at large needs to be delivered from this evil. Some money does come, but the purses of Christians are still too closely puckered. Open them wider, brethren ! If the purse is full, let the gift be large. If the purse be scantily filled, nevertheless let the outcome be proportionate. Purses are filling up all over the. land. May they not be kept puckered when the claims of a perishing world are presented to Christian thought.â€” 0. In American Messenger.
