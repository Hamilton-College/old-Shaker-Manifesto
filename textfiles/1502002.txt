ASCENSION. MARY WHITCHER. I^o ladder readies heaven's height Devoid the rounds of truth and love, These lowest, strongest, give the might To reach the heavenly worlds above. Above the false and the untrue, Above the fickle and the vainï¿½ This is the heaven we pursue, And this on earth is ours to gain. Bright flecked with joys our pathway lies, And sunlit from each higher sphere, Possessed of peace, we hold the prize Above all price, and ever dear. Canterbury, N. H.
