Ayer, Mass. Dear Editor :With us nature begins to take on the look of change from the warm and beautiful to the cold and dreary. What a beautiful season the past has been to us; though at times uncomfortably warm and the heat almost unbearable, yet we have been blest with the bounties of nature, beyond our expectation, and to whom shall we give credit if not to the industrious hands that have worked in faith, believing that God would help those who help themselves. Our Sisters have been busily engaged in preparing for market the great quantity of herbs that is yearly raised in Harvard. Those not personally acquainted with our home can form but a faint idea of the amount of work this requires at our hands. All must pass through the hands of the Sisters, before they are ready to be sold. Much of this work is performed during the heated part of the season. As I have seen the happy companies sitting at their tables, stripping the herbs, I have thought; How could they show more zeal or energy, even though they were at work for their selfish interest? Homes are like harps; some are finely carved and bright with gilding, but ill tuned, while another is old and plain but from its chords we hear some beautiful music. Step by step we may finally cross the highest mountain; so will a little self-denial, used every day work wonders in our home circle. The divine arrangement of the laws governing men's lives, decrees that he who lives only for self, lives for no one, while the person who lives to bless others, also blesses himself. The person who carries grace and sweetness into the lives of others, finds that his own life has imparted to it a brightness and buoyancy that continually increases. 'How good I feel,' exclaimed the little boy, when he had helped his classmate over a rough place. 'I wonder why it raises one up so to help any one who needs help?' God bless the liberal heart. Let us give and give as to God. Shirley met with Harvard on the Sabbath for worship, and two Sisters are with us from Enfield, Conn. A. D. B.
