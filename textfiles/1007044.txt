SPIRITUALISM ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO. The Merrimac Valley Visitor (Newburyport, Mass.) contained in its issue of April 10th a lengthy article upon Shakerism, in which it is stated that for upwards of one hundred years what is now known as Modern Spiritualism was familiar to that people. The manifestations were prevalent during the times of Ann Lee, who was born in Manchester, England, in 1736, and came to this country in 1774, 'driven by persecutions and instructed by revelations,' and continued until 1837, when, from that time until 1848, they appeared more frequently and with greater power. ' It came upon them by songs and music in the air; it seized upon little girls at their amusements and whirled them around the room, prostrated them on the floor, and threw them into trances. Soon they began to talk, narrate what they saw in the spiritual realms, sing hymns unwritten, set to music that mortal eyes had never seen. They had the gift of tongues; also the gift of discernment, so they could read the characters of those they had not before met.' It is fortunate for the world that these things subsequently occurred outside of that community, for they considered that the people of earth were in a totally unprepared state for what they (the Shakers) were experiencing. Having held this view of the case for more than a century, it is quite probable we should have been debarred from communion with our spirit-friends up to this time, and whether we should ever be granted the privilege would depend altogether upon whether — according to Shaker judgment-—-we were sufficiently prepared for it. But the invisibles were not to be kept back, and so they rapped at Rochester and sought an interview with the people of earth. These old-time Shaker manifestations prove to us, what the history of all past ages confirms as truth, that evidences of spiritpresence and power are not new, not characteristic of our times alone, but as old as history itself.
