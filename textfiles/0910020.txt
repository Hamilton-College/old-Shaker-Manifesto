Speak the Best of Neighbors One of our neighbors has had the name of being stingy and avaricious ; but these terms are born of prejudice and are not wellfounded. A poor neighbor of his wanted to borrow a horse to take some things to market; the so-called stingy neighbor not only lent the horse, but refused to accept of any compensation. Another poorer neighbor of this so-called avaricious man lately said: ' W. is the first to respond to the calls of the sick or those in want or distress.' Another of our neighbors sent some hams to another neighbor to be smoked, and when done offered payment; but the one who did 236 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. the good deed declined any pay, saying : ' The same smoke that cured my hams, cured yours ; the curing of your hams cost me nothing, therefore you owe me nothing but thanks.' Such good deeds among neighbors might be multiplied ; and then let such good news circulate, as deeds to be emulated by all other neighbors, poor and rich alike.
