I WILL BE WHAT I WILL TO BE. [Contributed by Ezra J. Stewart ] I mean to tread this narrow way, Whatever may betide; I care not what my flesh may say, In all its lordly pride; I will be what I will to be; From all the chains of sense set free. I will to be at one with God— And that and nothing less— In everything with full accord I will in His ways press. E'en tho He say the flesh must die; At once that flesh I' 11 mortify. 16 TEE MANIFESTO. If I am weak, what matter that? The Master's leal and true. His spirit's leadings have begat What can but bringme through. Ne'er as a coward will I flee The strife which sets my inmost free. I am determined to pursue The course I have begun; And with abounding life in view All clown that course I'll run. Hinder me not, you fearful crew; To all that's good I will be true. Sel.
