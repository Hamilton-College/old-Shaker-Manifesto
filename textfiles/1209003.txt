THE INCOMING WOMAN OLIVE F. CHANDLER Behold in the distance, the incoming woman ! No tarnish of fashion, no sham or display; 80 divinely majestic, a halo precedes her, Illuming earth's pathway by night and by- day. She's risen superior to sensuous desires ; A magnet of love, drawing higher mankind ; She's chaste, pure and gentle, yet strong and courageous, Her sceptre is trutli and her mission divine. 0 welcome with gladness, ye brave sons and noble! Her advent is seen in vast beauties revealed; In tastes so artistic in paintings and flowers, She's opened new fountains of art long concealed. 0 heed her all nations, and list to lier pleadings She's wisdom eternal and culture divine. O trust her and garner her spirit and power, The image of God doth her being enshrine. She's coming my friends, lo, her spring-time is nearing! The true buds of promise are swelling to bloom; The breezes all laden with essence of healing. Will bring a new era and banish the gloom, Her brothers no longer may dare to oppress her, In her their true equal and helper is seen; So pure is her presence, so chastened her spirit, The 'kingdom' is 'conic,' and she reigneth its Queen.
