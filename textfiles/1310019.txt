FAITHFULNESS IN TEMPORAL DUTIES. SARAH S. WOODS. Luke xvi., 11. 'If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?' and 1 Cor. iv., 2. 'Moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful;' (whether it be little or much entrusted to him.) It would seem from these tests, that persons who are slothful, indifferent and dishonest in temporal duties of any kind are not prepared to receive the true riches. Luke xix., we read of a certain nobleman who gave to each of his servants a sum of money to trade upon, in his absence to a far country. We find on his return that he bestowed his blessing and favor, on those only who had gained other pounds in addition to what had been given them; while the unfaithful steward had his money taken from him and given to him that had ten pounds. We have testimony from scripture, also Mother Ann's words, that souls who were unfaithful in temporal things, could not find the blessing and protection of God in their spiritual travel. Mother Ann counseled her children to put their hands at work, and their hearts to God. At one time she said to some Brethren, Be faithful with yoiir hands. Every faithful man will put up his fences in season ; and will plough his ground in season, put his crops into the ground in season ; and such a man may with confidence look for a blessing. She counseled Sisters to be neat, industrious and prudent. She said also, don't speak harshly ; let your words be few and seasoned with grace. In applying this subject at home, we find unless we are determined to devote willing hands to faithfully labor with all our faculties combined, for the upbuilding of the cause of God as our first parents have set us the example, we have no right to call ourselves their children, or to claim their inheritance.
