SCHOOL HOUSE, The school house is not a very large house but it is tall. There is one chimney on it. The house is white outside. In the school house 'there are desks and there are twenty seven scholars in the room. The teacher's desk is in front of the other desks. Then there are some black-boards for the scholars to write on and there are fourteen of them and there are eleven windows in the room. The school room is on the lower loft. There is a globe here and it has a large cover. Then there is a clock in the room and we have readers and spellers and arithmetics and grammars and geographies to read out of. L. G. W.
