To drive away hen lice To drive away Hen Lice.— A correspondent of a foreign exchange says that the only reliable means of ridding the hen-roost and pigeon-lofts of vermin is a preparation of sulphur and carbon, technically known as sulphuret of carbon. In France it has been thoroughly tested, and we are assured that it works like a charm. It kills the insects which prey upon pigeons and fowls without injuring the birds. A bottle containing the solution will last several days, and the cost of it is small. Put two ounces of the sulphuret of carbon in a bottle open at the mouth and hang it by a string in a henhouse. At the end of eight days the bottle should be refilled. The remedy is said to be infallible. If as good as claimed to be, it should be known to every farmer and poultry raiser in the land.— Poultry Yard.
