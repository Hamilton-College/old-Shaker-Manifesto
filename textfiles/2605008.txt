Enfield, N. H. April, 1896. The approach of the glorious springtide has the effect to raise us from the tomb of materiality that would tend to render inactive the purer qualities of our being, into a high spiritual atmosphere. Seeking to follow Christ we should look above our natural desires, and do the work the gospel of self-denial bids, loving mankind even as Christ, with a love untainted by the lust of selfishness or animal emotion. THE MANIFESTO. 85 'God's glory is a wcmd'rous thing, Most strange in all its ways; And of all things on earth, least like What men agree to praise.' We have recently enjoyed a festal season of love and soul strength in the visitation of one of Zion's honored, well tried veterans, Eldress Marion Patric, of Enfield Conn. Why may we not often enjoy such seasons? The conscience and character of our communal homes is embodied in the personalities of the older members of our Church, and is it not their duty to keep before the younger minds the soul cleansing testimony of Christ? To the awakened conscience ever rings out the appeal, Now is the day of your salvation, give all for Christ. We send renewed love to all the readers of our Manifesto. George II. Baxter.
