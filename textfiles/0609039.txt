No cross, no crown No Cross, no Crown. — Coleridge remarked, that the temper of tho present age inclines it to every enervating indulgence. Men appear to think tho Christian armor an unnecessary incurubrance; they have no desire to engago in any combat, to undergo any trial: if religion is to bo cultivated, it must be as one of the jftiie aria — as an element of belles-lettres ; they forgot or despise the saying of Bishop Patrick, that there is no passage to celestial glory but by some crocs; that we must suffer with Christ, as well as confess Him, if wo would be with Him in Paradise.
