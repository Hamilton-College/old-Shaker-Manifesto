The Boyhood of Jesus 'And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit.' How thoroughly human this is! It was a real, true humanity, which in him was united to divinity. Here is a true Galilean child, a real Israelitish boy. Here is the human nature in its process of development. Its proper qualities are becoming, coming forth into manifestation, into full and evident possession of their substance. There is a proper growth of healthy and perfect childhood, advancing toward healthy and perfect and strong manhood. Was there in Nazareth, think you, or in Galilee, a more resolute boy than Jesus? Had there* been in Rome or in Sparta? He 'grew and waxed strong in spirit.' 'The grace of God, which was upon him,' did not make him feeble and spiritless. There was in him the natural connection between healthy bodily growth, and increasing strength of mind. As he climbed thehills about Nazareth; as he plied the lighter tools in his, Joseph's shop ; as he fed temperately at the table, and slept soundly under the roof of that home, which, if lowly, we can never imagine untidy nor unwholesome—he grew, and as his frame increased in size, and his limbs in vigor, his spirit waxed stronger day by day. It increased in energy, in courage, in fortitude. We cannot imagine him rude, boisterous, turbulent, ready to quarrel with other boys, nor to tyrannize over them, when he found himself the stronger. But can you imagine him scared by any blustering young Nazarene, turned aside from duty to human parents, or to God, by any rough boy's threats, or any proud girl's sneer? Boys, true piety will not make you tame, spiritless, cowardly. Study your Bibles to learn what kind of a boy Jesus was. To be tike him will make you both manly and gentlemanly.— H. A. Nelson, D. D.
