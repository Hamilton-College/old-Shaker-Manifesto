LANGUAGE If you hear a person use low, vulgar, profane language, immediately turn your mind upon what virtuous teachers have instructed you in this matter. Observe how such base conversation shocks the sensibilities of virtuous, refined people. Contrast, with such examples, those who are universally respected because their conversation is always proper, christianized and refined. Under these observations, if you desire to be virtuous and good, you will be enabled to see the beauty and excellency of the one, and the hateful, corrupting, souldestroying tendency of the other. By this means you may prove the truth of many of your early moral lessons. Moral Instructions for the Young.
