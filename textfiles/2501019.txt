Enfield, N. H. Dec. 1894. A happy New Year to all our gospel friends! News is scarce this month and items 'few and far between.' We have commenced the manufacture of eight hundred Eclipse Corn Planters; the iron work is delivered to us all finished and ready to be arranged into the complete machine. The hard wood frames and the seed hoppers are made from our own lumber and by our own people. There are twentyfour nails, forty screws, and about twentyfive bolts to be placed in each machine. Some of the screws have to be adjusted very carefully, which requires a precision on the part of those who do this portion of the work. We are quite fortunate in having this employment during the win- ter season, as it is quite a help in a financial way, although we do not consider the remuneration we receive is any more than adequate. Many of the old maple trees that have so long stood guard over the street that passes through our village, have at last yielded to the 'woodman's ax,' because of decay and broken limbs. 20 THE MANIFESTO. We are pleased with the decision of the Central Ministry in regard to the use of the organ in our worship. The more beautiful our praise, the more acceptable in God's sight. Let us use it as not abusing it. Mascoma Lake is solidly frozen and covered with snow: this shows to us that winter has begun in earnest. G. H. Kirkley
