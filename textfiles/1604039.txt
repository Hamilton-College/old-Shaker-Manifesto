Beloved elder Henry; I love my... Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1886. Beloved EldekHenry;ï¿½I love my beautiful home, and I will be a good child that I may keep it. I think we had a very nice meeting this morning. I love to go to meeting and sing and hear the good words that are spoken, as they will make me a good girl, a good youth and a good sister, and so that everybody will love me and respect me., I love the Brethren 'and Sisters very much, and I love all my companions too. I think it has been very pleasant, I was glad to see you in meeting, last evening and this morning. We are going to visit Elder Abraham this eve and recite our scripture lessons to him. Tomorrow is Monday and I think I shal help iron some clothes in the forenoon, anc in the afternoon all the little girls will have a play time. I am learning to knit. I like to knit the heels better than the toes. We are all trying to be good girls. This is all I can say now. From Hattie.
