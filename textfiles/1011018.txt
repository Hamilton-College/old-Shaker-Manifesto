DO THY LITTLE Do thy little — God has made Million leaves for forest shade — Smallest stars that glory bring. God employeth every thing. Then the little thou hast done — Little battles thou hast won, Little masteries achieved, Little wants with care relieved, Little words in love expressed, Little wrongs at once confessed, Little favors kindly done, Little toils thou didst not shun, Little graces meekly worn, Little slights with patience borne — Those shall crown thy pillowed head, Holy light upon thee shed. Those are treasures that shall rise Far beyond the smiling skies.
