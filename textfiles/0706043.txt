GUIDING STAR James G. Russell Enfield, N. H. Glorious light, so brightly gleaming, From the realms of bliss afar; With transcendent radiance teeming, Christian, 'tis thy guiding star. May its gladsome glimmers, peering Through the mazes of thy way. Swell with joy, thy heart while nearing Blissful realms of endless day 2. Dangers oft may round thee gather, Clouds conceal thy light from view; Trust in God, thy Heavenly Father, He will guide thee safely through. He will be thy sure Defender, Whatsoever may betide, Never more to sin surrender, God is thy unfailing Guide. 3. Never faint in times of trial, Onward move with courage new; Take the cross of self-denial, With a purpose firm and true. It is not the swiftest runner, Nor the strong that wins the day; But behold the overcomer In the saints who watch and pray. 4. These shall find deliverance surely— Victory over sin and death— Those who walk uprightly, purely, Heeding what the spirit saith. Words of peace and consolation, Cheer the spirit ever on, Toward the goal of free salvation, Where Redemption's prize is won.
