New England Magazine We see how Jonathan Edwards was taught by his father to look upon men as naturally very wicked. The lad saw the opposition to his father; he heard the many quarrels in the surrounding churches discussed; he beheld the sensuality and drunkenness of the town; while he noted the comparatively slight moral effects of his father's fiery preaching; and naturally he came to think the world a very wicked place and the natural man a very fiend. In that parsonage-home, where total depravity was used to explain all actual and imaginary sins, where the comparative failure of a gloomy theology was attributed to the native wickedness of the heart, what could such a lad think except that men are indeed by nature vile and miserable wretches? And this gloom of Calvinism which shadowed Jonathan Edward's boyhood was intensified by the prevailing mood of feverish superstition, fostered by the monotony and hardships of that pioneer life and by the constant fear of the Indians, whose ravages Windsor Farmers felt for many years. There is no richer soil for the growth of superstitions than the constant dread of the cruel redskins, under which those early settlers lived,ï¿½ a fact which has been too little taken into account in treating of the delusions of New England ; a fact also which only those who have had experience in a similar situation can fully appreciate. from 'Jonathan Edwards,' by Rev. Joseph II. Crooker, in New England Magazine for April.
