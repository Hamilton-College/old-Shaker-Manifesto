House and Farm Watermelon Preserve —To 30 lbs. of melon add 34 lbs. sugar. Cut the melon in pieces an inch thick, or larger if preferred, and boil in 9 quarts of cider, or acid water, until it is soft, then skim out into a cullender to drain. Pour out the cider and put in the sugar, with water enough to dissolve it readily, and skim it well. Then put in the melon, and let it boil until it looks clear.— Tomato Catsup —To a peck of tomatos, boiled soft, and strained in a sieve that will allow the pulp to run through. Add four table spoonfuls of salt, four of ground pepper, four of ground mustard seed, two of ground allspice two of ground cloves, one of cayenne pepper, one gallon of strong vinegar, boil gently three hours, cool and bottle.
