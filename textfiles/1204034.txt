Upon this vital point intelligent people are sadly and willfully stupid. A large majority of the cars, theatres, halls, parlors and churches are dens of poisons. It must be a strong attraction which can draw me to a public hall. In lectures before lyceums I quarrel with the managers about the atmosphere of the hall.

The eminent Baudeloque declared it as his conviction that the lack of proper ventilation in our dwellings is the principle cause of scrofula.
