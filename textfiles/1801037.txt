Temperance About 50,000,000 pages were printed by the Woman's Temperance Publication Association last year. ' What is whiskey bringing, do you ask? I'll tell you; it is bringing men to prison and to the gallows, and it is bringing women and children to poverty and want.' There never was a truer answer than this. It is estimated that it sends to prison every year one hundred thousand men and women. Twenty thousand children are sent to the workhouse annually by drink. Three hundred murders are caused by intemperance every year. Two hundred thousand children are made orphans every year, by this dreadful evil; and sixty-five thousand are killed by intemperance every year, in this country. Messenger of Peace
