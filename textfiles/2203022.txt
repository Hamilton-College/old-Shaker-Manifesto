In Memory of Elder CHARLES CLAPP Annie B. Goepper. Elder Ciiaki.es Clapp, the subject of this memorial was one of those few men who combined all the qualities essential to the true and polished Christian gentleman. Brave as a lion when circumstances required, his every-day life was marked by courtesy, hospitality and affability. A true Christian! He practiced his religion in his daily walk. In his death, the Community has lost one of her most faithful members, and our family, a kind father and affectionate friend. He was ever ready to aid and strengthen the weak and erring and welcome the prodigal son and daughter back to the fold. His end was that of the just man. Calmly, peacefully and without a struggle, his spirit was wafted on high to reap the reward of a well-spent life. 'By tlio bright waters now thy life is cast .Joy for thee, happy friend thy bark is j)ast The rough sea's foam ! Now the long- yearnings of thy soul are still'd, Home! Home!thy peace is won, thy heart is file;1,, Thou art gone home !' Union Village, Ohio.
