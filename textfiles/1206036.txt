A strong, good-sized table... A strong, good-sized table is almost a necessity in the cellar. Jars that are too heavy to be lifted on and off shelves may be set on the table. Many cellars are sometimes infested with ants and other bugs. One way to keep them from crawling over the jars is to take the tin-cans in which peaches or tomatoes come, set the legs of the table in the cans, and fill them half full of water.
