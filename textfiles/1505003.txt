JUSTIFICATION. MARY WHITCHER. Do your duty every day,- - Live to God the best you may,- - Yours shall be the earned pay Of sweet justification. Cloudy days and nights will come, While the darkness makes them one; Notwithstanding, you've a home In sweet justification. God would be no God to serve To the tension of each nerve, If in Him was no reserve Of sweet justification. It is enough, the earth will move, And only half is made of love, And what the metal yours, will prove To bring justification. 'Tis all according to your light Obeyed or saddened, wrong and right Kept in the Motto clear to sight Is your justification. 'Tis done, in honor let me stand, The laboring oar is in my hand, And by its plying brings the Land Of rest and restoration. All this in time, eternity May hold a greater joy for me, But what can Heaven really be But sweet justification? Canterbury, N. H.
