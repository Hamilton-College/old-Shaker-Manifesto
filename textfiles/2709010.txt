Shaker Station, Conn. North Family. August, 1897. It is needless to say that we are having more cloudy than sunshiny weather, for this seems to be the general complaint. Farm work is much delayed by almost constant rain. The Sisters have been, several times, to the distant hills, some two or three miles away, for huckleberries, but success did not crown their labors as the berries are quite scarce. Two of our Sisters, Angeline Brown and Florence Staples in company with Eldress Sophia Copley of the Church family are about to return from the sea-shore after an absence of sixteen days. They have been selling Shaker bonnets, fancy goods, confectionery etc., with considerable success. Since our tarry in Enfield we have had occasion to attend one funeral,ï¿½that of Clarissa Lyman. She was an aged Sister of eighty-three years. Her acquaintances all declare her to have been a good, true mother. Elder George Clarke is busily engaged in the laundry, making everything as convenient as possible. We have alreadj a large engine and boiler combined, an improved mill, and at the end of another week our new wringer will be completed. We bless the labor of consecrated souls and great will be their reward. Edith E. Shu felt.

It contains some items that may prove profitable reading for many months to come. Ed.]
