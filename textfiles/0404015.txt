WOMAN'S SPHERE 'The eyes may brighten, and lips may smile, And the heart with anguish be torn the while.' For woman (generous toiler) Can bury sorrows deep Till oft, in cloister'd moments, 'lone, She finds them but to weep. And yet her grief must silent be, Her burden she must bear, Till truth can fetter error strong, And heed her time-bound prayer. She was not form'd for man to rule With firm relentless hand ; She was not form'd a chattel slave, To be at his command; She was not form'd to be the means ¦ Of bearing down a name Unto an offspring cursed, debased, That cause her spirit shame. She feels her rights, but she is bound By those whom passions hold; She knows her claims to earth and heav'n, For this her heart is bold. She presses through the flood of thought, Sarcasm, scorn, and ire ; She holds her way undaunted, firm, Enrobed in Love's attire. She knows, when Reason, Justice pure, Shall place within each heart Those living truths which guard the soul, Then slavery will depart, And Freedom can her course pursue, Sustain her glorious cause, While Wisdom helps to form anew The Father's broken laws. Then priest, or priestcraft, ne'er can stay Equality, or right; But man shall own and bless the cause Which gave to earth new light: And, through her powers for good and right, Life's burdens shall decrease ; While 'neath her influence, chaste and pure, Disease and crime shall cease. Through her shall gleam the golden light, And inspiration true Shall touch with love the soul of man, His life for God renew. And then, as one, they'll toil in peace, And seeds celestial sow ; While heav'n and earth the chorus swell,— God reigns with man beloiv! Charlotte Byrdsall, Mt. Lebanon.
