West Pittsfield, Mass. Sept. 1896. As we look upon the mountains surrounding our house and note the change of color in the foliage of trees and shrubs, listen to the moaning of the wind, we are reminded that summer will not always last and our thoughts find expression in the poem of Bryant, when he says, 'The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year.' Harvest time brings to us its usual round of duties and learning from nature the prudence of storing for necessity, we wisely conclude to be unlike the cricket of whom the school children tell us, who foolishly danced away the summer hours, finding when winter came nothing but an empty store. The crop of hay was secured about the middle of August. After this work was commenced in removing the old palisade, which lay a little south of the Office. Nearly two thousand yards of rock and earth have been taken from this section to a much more desirable place. The ledge of rock was broken by blasting powder and dynamite and then taken to protect fine high embankment at our grain and cattle barn. This makes a good drainage west of the Office, south, through this section. We have often heard of 'removing mountains,' and this has been accomplished, if by a slower method. Where formerly only a peek from the Office sitting room window only found a mound of earth, now may be seen a broad landscape view extending from the large expanse of meadow land to the railroad and Richmond Lake, a mile and a half in the distance.
