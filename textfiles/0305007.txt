SHEPHERDS ' I am the good Shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine; and they shall hear my voice. I CAN indeed testify to the truth of these words. Christ's Spirit is ' known' and felt by my hungry soul. I rejoice to find him in so many. Some time back, he was not to be found in any man or woman upon this earth. But now we are blessed with the presence of the heavenly Bride and Bridegroom. The kind, loving Shepherds in Zion, possess the pure Gospel of Jesus Christ and Mother Ann, and are worthy of their inheritance, because they have lain down their lives just as did Jesus. They are true followers of Christ. They do not go behind, and drive their sheep, but they go before, and all the good sheep follow. It is something of a cross to follow Christ; yet I rejoice that my lot is cast among faithful cross-bearers. Larz Erickson, Pleasant Hill, Ky.
