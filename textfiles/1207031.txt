WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO B. F. BAILEY Lines written, on seeing a tearful little girl, pushed from the walk in a crowded street. There, my little girl, don't cry, 'Twas but the hand of unthinking rudeness ; Beneath the garb of thoughtlessness, doth lie Much good, in crudeness. You'll find in passing, all through life, Much to embitter; This world is full of ceaseless strife, And show, and glitter. There's a hand, to guide thy little feet, On it rely, Once more, the rough and crowded street; Don't fear to try. Your little heart will often feel The cruel blow, And grief will cause thee to unseal The fountain's flow. For, 'tis by suffering cruel wrong We learn to feel, For other's sorrows, and grow strong; And true as steel. So, cheer up my child, and meet the crowd With eyes more bright, 'There's a silver lining to every cloud,' To cheer thy sight.
