A New Fruit A novel freak of nature was lately shown us by D. A. Buckingham, the venerable elder of Watervliet Society at Shakers, N. Y. It was about eighteen inches of grape vine, of Delaware variety, upon which he had, early in the spring, stuck an early Rose potato to prevent the vine from bleeding. The vine Â¦had grown fuur or five feet from the ground, and the potato had sprouted, and maintaining its vitality had grown nearly all over its surface, curious mongrel fruit resembling equally well, potatoes and grapes, perhaps to the number of fifty. The green foliage around the fruit was equally mixed, half and half of potato and grape leaves. It is the purpose M.AJSTIWttS'FO. THE SHARER 3O9 of the Elder, we learn, to try his hand at bringing into use, either a potato with a grape skin, or a grape as large as a potato; and we wish him success in either case.
