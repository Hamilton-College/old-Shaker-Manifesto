An Interesting Discourse Delivered at South Union, Ky. c by Elder H. L. Eads. Text�Behold I create new heavens and a new earth. Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy.�Isa. lxv., 17, IS. Mankind in general seem not to know that God hath established in their midst the long promised new earth and new heavens and set up His kingdom therein, which will never have an end. It has come upon them unawares, ' as a thief in the night,' and being yet in the mustard seed form it has not been visible to the world at large ; but. as promised, it will yet spread to the ends of the earth. Although existing here in this mundane sphere, it is distinct from the old, having no connection nor blending therewith, in spirit nor purpose. This new earth is that which is redeemed from sinful, selfish man and occupied and used for regenerative purposes, while the old is held by selfish man and used for generative purposes ; there being no more connection between them than there is between flesh and spirit. The new heaven is the new kind of happiness enjoyed by the deni- zens of the new earth, where 'Jerusalem is made a rejoicing and her people a joy.' The old heaven is the old happiness enjoyed by the selfish generative world. It is thought by some that the new earth is to be a part whereon propagation will be confined to God's law of nature, and from this orderly propagation will the new heavens be supplied. Than this there can be no greater mistake. If true the animals already occupy the new earth, and old Father Noah did the same ; but how did his orderly offspring turn out? Were they better prepared for the new heavens than others ? The child born in the gutter is as pure, as holy, and as near to God, as the child born in the King's palace. His displeasure rests not on the child, but on the disorderly parents. The highest and most chaste generative work is born of lust, and hath no place in God's new Earth ; for ' When lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin, and sin, when it is finished, it bringeth forth death. Do not err, my beloved.' James i., 15, 16. The Apostle was right in saying: ' Not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.' 1 Cor., 26. There are more pearls to be found down in the mud than up on the mountain top ; gather them in and wash them and they will shine. It will ever be as it has been, more difficult to go up and bring them down than to go down and bring them up: hence Christ's words in the parable : ' Go ye into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that the Lord's table may be filled. ' It is neither the duty nor the province of the new earthians to undertake to discipline the old in matters pertaining to generation : their whole duty there is to reap the ripened grain and gather it into the garners of God; but, while orderly generation should rule the old earth, yet the better children are made more by better training, better surroundings and associations than by better propagation, because, in its best form, it is destitute of anything spiritual. It is all carnal. To redeem souls from these lower conditions is the object of the creation of the new earth, where generative propagation is wholly excluded. Here souls are created anew, raised into holiness of life and become the children of God. Believers, called Shakers, are now the privileged occupants of God's new earth and heaven, wherein dwelleth righteousness ; than which nothing better nor higher is possible to the world, neither in the present time nor in any coming age or ' cycle.' The way, the conditions are Godmade, God-given and perfect. None other can be more so, for herein the opportunities are given by which all can, if they will, be ' perfect, even as their Father in heaven is perfect.' Matt, v., 48. Any attempt to change God's plan of redemption would be to weaken its efficiency and mar its beauty and perfection. The requirement now is to give up all, including our own wills and our own lives, to the will of God in his appointed order�to be as was Christ Jesus ; in our humiliation let our own judgment be taken away, as was his. To the worldly wise of the old earth this seems to be foolishness ; but it has been this very foolishness that has builded and upheld the work for more than one hundred years ; and this only will perpetuate it, the equal of which (and 1 say it not boastiugly) is not to be found anywhere on the whirling footstool of God. Then let me repeat: Nothing less Avill answer God's demand on every soul who enters His new earth, and nothing more can possibly be required. Be not deceived. It is the meek that shall inherit the new earth, and 'blessed are they that do His commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and enter in through the gates into the city.' Rev. xxii., 14. Of this temple the two foundation pillars are Jesus, the Bridegroom, and Ann, the Bride, whose ''teachings are celibacy, community, peace, simplicity in dress, demeanor and language and separation from the world,' with its vanities, pride, fashions and customs. They are the shepherd and shepherdess, their sheep do hear their voice and follow them ; no goats in the flock. If any of the divisions of God's new earth should conclude that the way is too crossing, that the requirements are unnecessary, and persist in such thought, they will fail ; but if all will turn in simplicity and obey, then with them there will be no such word as fail, but theirs will be an eternal success with the upholding power of God and His blessing evermore. ' And there shall be no more curses, but the throne of God and the lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve him, and they shall see His face. For the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign forever.' Rev. xxii., 3, 4, 5. Some suppose that in a second cycle a change will come, when a ' central head will be unnecessary, as then, all will perceive truth fortthemselves, which will be the controlling and growing power;' and then 'it will no longer be said, know ye the Lord, for all shall know Him, from the least to the greatest. ' The mistake here is in supposing that God can be known by any one outside of his order, ' where He has placed His name for salvation. ' All coming cycles will be repeated like those of the sun. All who will be saved must travel the same road to reach the same end. All must take Christ's yoke upon them and be meek and lowly of heart as he was, and all must confess their sins alike, as he did. All must repent alike. All must crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts alike. All must give up their own wills and obey alike. These are to be repeated in all the cycles of time without end, or complete redemption will not be found, because this is God's plan, and He cannot have two ways to do the same thing. If any think they are wiser, let them remember that the ''foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. ' 1 Cor., 25. As said, all our success and prosperity depend entirely on our compliance with and doing God's will�not God afar off, in or above the clouds, but God in his appointed order. Those who fail in this fail in all; then they are wont to say: 'This is like all other religions, a failure�it has had its day and must pass away, to be followed by something else that will share the same fate, as all history has shown. But not so, God will not be defeated in his purposes. After all the flood-spewings out of the Dragon's mouth a remnant will be left of the faithful to carry the pure work down into the centuries to save the world in the coming ages.
