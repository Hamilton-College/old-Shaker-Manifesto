Eldress Emily died of pneumonia, complicated with other distressing ailments. Her death is a very serious loss. She was brought to us by her parents when about eight years of age, and a more faithful, devoted aid loyal Believer, has seldom been raised in our Society. If she could have been restrained from doing so much for others she might have lived longer, but she never seemed to be able to stop while she could do. Indeed, she was an uncommon example of zeal and selfabnegation. But it is all over now and we are left to toil on; pray on, and abound in more faithfulness and charity, for 'The days of man are few, And swiftly pass away, As clouds flit o'er the breezy blue, And deck the vernal day.'
