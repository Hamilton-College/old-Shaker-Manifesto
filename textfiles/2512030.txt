Many years ago... Many years ago an old gentleman told the writer that when he was a young man his uncle lived in Salem, in a house located close on a line with the sidewalk. Next to his house a neighbor's house set well back from the street, leaving an open green sward in front, over which his uncle's family had a fine view down street toward the morning sun from their sitting-room windows. One night the neighbor's house was destroyed by fire. He did not wish to rebuild and sold the land to another neighbor who proposed to build a house on a line with the uncle's house, which was the customary way, he said: 'Uncle, you won't allow it to be done, will you?' 'I don't know as I can prevent it.' 'But the front of that lot was never THE MANIFES TO. 285 fenced in since the discovery of the country. It has always been open to the public and they have no legal right to build on it.' 'But I don't see how I can help myself.' 'Don't you think I had better go and consult Ben Merrill?' (The best lawyer of his time iii Salem.) 'You may, if you like.' He called on the lawyer, stated the case, and asked if they had a right to build as proposed. The lawyer replied: 'No they have not.' 'Then, if we pursue a certain course, [naming it] we can stop them.' 'No, I did not say so. Young man, you see this ruler. I hold it upright by placing my finger on the end. If I take my finger away, can you tell me which way it will fall?' 'No.' Neither can I; but [letting it fall] now both you and I know. Well, the law is just as uncertain as that.' 'I see. How much is to pay?' 'Three dollars.' The old gentleman said; 'I don't think uncle ever invested any three dollars better than that.'
