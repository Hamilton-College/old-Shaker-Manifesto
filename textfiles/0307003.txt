ORTHODOXY vs. SCIENCE ' I am now advised that a new astrologer is risen, who presumeth to prove that the earth moveth and goeth about, not the firmament; the sun and moon, not the stars — like as when one sitteth on a coach, or in a ship that is moved, thinketh he sitteth still and resteth, but the earth and trees do move and run themselves. Thus it goeth; we give ourselves up to our own foolish fancies and conceits. This fool (Copernicus) will turn the whole art of astronomy upside down ; but the Scripture showeth and teacheth another lesson when Joshua commandeth the sun to stand still, and not the earth.' — Martin Luther quoted in ' Exeter Hall.'
