LIVE AND LEARN. NOW that the 'Congress of Religions' has passed into history, we may pleasantly anticipate the great good that will result from the expending of so much precious time and money and mental anxiety, to establish the fact that all nations do believe in God, who is the Father of all. 'Devout men from every nation under heaven' have discoursed of the Fatherhood of God and of the brotherhood of man quite as freely and as fully and as satisfactorily to the masses, as have the multiplied sects of the Christian church. Even the Buddhist from Bombay was free to say that 'Spiritual progress is impossible for him who does not lead a life of purity and compassion. So long as one is fettered by selfishness, passion, prejudice or fear, so long the doors of his higher nature are closed against the truth.' If the knowledge that has been obtained through this meeting of the nations shall lead men to have more gentle consideration for each other, to preach peace instead of war, to preach love instead of hatred, it may be an enlarged ray of light, which will lead all to more peaceful habitations in this world, and possibly in the world to come. As the spiritual head of the Christian church was in theory and practice, a peace-maker from the heavens, then above all people the Christians, as his disciples, should establish the reign of peace upon the earth. For more than one hundred years after the mission of Jesus was preached at Jerusalem, no person could have been found in the Roman army that was designated as a Christian soldier. It was left for more modern Christians to sing with Young,ï¿½ One to destroy, is murder by the law, And gibbets keep the lifted hand in awe, To murder thousands, takes a spurious name, War's glorious art, and gives immortal fame. Our weapons of warfare, said Paul, are not carnal. We have no occasion to hurt each other, and the church that carries the earthly sword to destroy its enemies, will in all probability, agreeably to the Scripture record, perish with the sword.
