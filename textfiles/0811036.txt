Tell what you know&gt; The world craves positive teachings, and not the dreariness of negations. Goethe ex- pressed this idea when he said : 'I will listen to any one's convictions ; but pray keep your doubts to yourself. I have plenty of mine own.' Direct teachings are like centres of force and influence, but negations are like leaden weights, burdening the traveler, and drowning the swimmer.
