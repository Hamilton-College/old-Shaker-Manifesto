A PARABLE: HAS IT AN APPLICATION ? Among the trees that clothe the earth, there grew one more beautiful, yielding more perfect fruit than any before. Said this tree : ' I have the most perfect symmetry, the most beautiful foliage, and bear the best fruit of any extant. Am I not perfect ? Thus will I remain â€” preserved just as I am ; my fruit shall not fall, neither 136 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. shall any leaf change, I challenge the law of evolution, that cannot augment nor improve perfection.' So ignoring the laws of life, circulation ceases ; the leaves and fruit being the record only of life and growth. The same elements which added growth to life, in the absence of life (which comes of evolution), effect dissolution. Who that would work with God must work through His laws, the laws of evolution, progress; not stationary, but active, living, moving, gathering and diffusing. ' He liveth longeth who can tell most true things truly done each day.'
