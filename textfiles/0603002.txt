THE CHEMISTRY OF BREATHING D. FRAZER What is the use of breathing? is it merely to draw in a portion of the atmosphere and then expel it ? Of all the processes involved in the manifestation of animal life, the act of breathing is the most important. We can live without food for days, but to live without air we cannot ; we breathe about one thousand times an hour. If the process of breathing ceases but for a few minutes, life is at an end. Hence the necessity of breathing deeply of good air; just in proportion to our ability to absorb oxygen from the air, have we life. This absorption of oxygen by the venous blood is a chemical act. Therefore, to breathe rightly, first, have good air ; second, let nothing enter the circulation which impairs the affinity of the blood for oxygen. Soda and saleratus should never be used in food, and the habit of taking much salt is amiss. In former times when large open fire places were in use, and our houses loosely built, attention to ventilation was not required. Now that we live in close apartments with no open fire places, we are shut off from a true relation to the vitalizing oxygen of the air. Hence colds are frequent, and they are catching on the approach of cold weather. Closely-confined air to breathe, associated with alkaline matter in our blood, cannot but be favorable to the formation of soft, flaccid, muscular tissue, just the pabulum in which the seeds of scrofula and consumption can grow apace. A word to the wise is sufficient.
