A MOTHER'S LOVE. Catherine Allen. While sitting in communion blest With kindred friends and parents dear, Upon my spirit was impressed A gift to cherish and revere. A Heavenly Mother's tender love; The life and center of our home, That shelters as with wings of dove, All hearts who 'neath her influence come. Each child this love so constant shares, Though oft it changes form and guise ; The needed gift our Mother bears With patient heart and purpose wise. It is the power that causeth grief, Repentance deep and true for sin ; That brings the spirit sweet relief, And lights the lamp of hope within. It is the two-edged sword that wounds,� And then the balm that soothes and heals ;It is the fire that sin consumes,� And light that endless life reveals It is the hand that smites with death Those elements which are of earth; And then becomes the living breath To souls who find angelic birth. It sometimes comes like thunder peals, To waken slumbering souls to life, And oft like angel music steals, To calm the troubled waves of strife. And when we pass through furnace heat,� Through surging- tides and vallies dark. This gift will stay and guide our feet, And point to us the shining mark. Oh ! boundless is its power for good, United with a Father's grace, This precious love of Motherhood Will prove the Savior of the race. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
