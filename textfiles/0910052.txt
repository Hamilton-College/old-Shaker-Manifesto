Poor farming and poor religion Poor Farming and Poor Religion.â€” A farmer in New England has sixteen harvests of grain and hay rotting in the stacks. At the breaking out of the war he held his crop for higher prices, and with each year and additional advances he waited for more, until at last the current set in the other way, which disgusted him so that he refused to sell, and, continuing to stack and stack, he has now on hand $20,000 worth of produce. His neighbors say he is crazy, which is probably true, but how much wiser are those who having gifts which might be of use in society and the church fail to employ them. A talent hid in a napkin is of no more use than grain stacked up to rot. Or how much wiser is the man who does nothing but add each year to his pile of silver or gold or bonds, which in his hands are of no value to society during his life, and perhaps are the ruin of his family after he is gone.
