GIVING GOD OUR BEST. The vessels nsed in the temple service were of pure gold; none were of silver, for it was not anything accounted of in the days of Solomon; therefore it was not considered worthy to be mixed with the gold offered for the service of the King of kings. Whatever was for his service must b3 of the best quality. May we not learn a lesson from this? Does it not teaoh that we are to offer to the Lord nothing but goldï¿½pure true gold? What, then, is the gold which we are to give to God? Can we all give it? Yes, it is the soul's offering to him we call our King. It is the ' soul's best' for God. How freely we give the best we can possibly afford to those we love ! Shall we less freely offer ourselves and our best to him who first bestows whatever we possess of talent, influence or substance? Think you he will accept our silver if '\ve withhold our gold? In our service for him let our energy be the gold of our strength, not the dribblings of a, spent power. We willingly give our best exertion to obtain pleasure or recreation, let us see that we expend it not alone in this, reserving only the silver for God's work. Some of us may think we have not much to give compared to what many others have. This may also be true; but if that little is really our very best we may confidently offer it for God's acceptance. It is not the quantity he asks but the true pure metal, however small the quantity. The Christian.
