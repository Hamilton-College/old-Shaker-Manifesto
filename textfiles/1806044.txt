'Tis hut one little thing thou hast to do : Then if He find thee diligent and true, New tasks await thee and a wider span. Perhaps a better knowledge of the plan Of that great web on which thy hands have wrought. And be not thou too lowly in thy thought; No man before thee, since the world began, Could do the work that lies upon thy loom : If thou neglect or slight it, it is loss To all the world, in all time to come. What is thy kinship to the Saviour worth If thou demean thee as the sons of earth? And what if Jesus had despised his cross?' Selected.
