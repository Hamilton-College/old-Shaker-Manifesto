WHAT IS PROGRESS? [Contributed by H. DeGraw.] Extracts from Archbishop Ireland's Columbian Address. Progress is in man, it is the growth of. man in the facilities and powers of his being, in his empire over inanimate and irrational creation. There is no progress deserving the name where no provision exists for the growth of man's spiritual nature. Progress is the continuity of creation, to arrest it through malice or indolence is a crime against Creator and creature. Christ's gospel is throughout a gospel of progress. I will never believe that good must necessarily yield to evilï¿½and hence I shall never cease to put my trust in the progress of humanity. The path that has once been trod Is never so rough to the feet; And the lesson we once have learned Is never so hard to repeat. Though sorrowful tears may fall, And the heart to its depths be riven With storm and tempest, we need them all To render us meet for heaven.
