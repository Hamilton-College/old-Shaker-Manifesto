What are the Vital and Eternal Elements of Religion? GILES B. AVERY. From the earliest history of our race, '�Religion,' in its most comprehensive, or, rather, its widest sense, that is, an intuitive conception of some character of a Supreme Being, or Power, more mighty than man, to whom man is subjective and accountable, has been manifest, in ils theological sense, that is, as a system of doctrines, or principles, from the days of Moses. But, religion, in its sense of practical piety, as distinct from theology, has ebbed and flowed, both in the individual, and society experiences, in some sense, and in some degree, from the days of Moses, unto the present time. But, religion, meaning systems of faith and methods of worship, comprehends the beliefs of Pagans, Mahomedans, Hindoos, Indians, Parsees, Jews and Christians ; in all their varied characteristics of profession, belief, or denomination ; and it is religion in all the foregoing 'tenses that we now propose to consider. It is possible that, in each and all of the religious systems of past human history, there may have been some elements and principles adapted to human needs for the period in which they existed, bit all of them appear to have been measurably transitory, and many of them wholly so ; and yet, myriads of their professors cling to their sail riven barques as though forae favorite wind might yet float tliem into a haven of bliss beyond a world teeming with woes ! But, man is a creature ot progress, and is not content to remain in any locality or condition, either physical, mental or spiritual, that does not give him satisfaction, peace and comfort. He is not content to merge his faith in a system of so-called religion, which is both material, finite, and transitory, and therefore incapable of moral and spiritual elevation, progress and continuity! His organization calls for life, perpetual and uubounded life! Yet, when the chalice is presented to his lips, if it requires a sacrifice of something he has adopted, and for a time pursued and sought unto for comfort and therefrom, in some degree, been fed and nourished, he is loath to part with it! 'This tendency to resist innovation, even though it be improvement, is observable in every special organization ; in law ; in medicine ; in science ; in religion.' And a measure of this conservatism is a necessary element in human character, to avoid rashly rushing into systems of theology, adopting supposed philosophical propositions, which on trial, by experience, prove sophistical ; or scientific problems, which, by a deeper and truer knowledge of science, are found to be erroneous. Yet, dissatisfaction,�a want of life. soul life, liberty and love; a want of that knowledge which solves the problems that weigh upon his heart ; a lack of that wisdom that answers questions that his unearthly self is constantly asking, the absence of that lamp of truth that throws light on his origin, his nature and his destiny, urges mankind onward to new fields of exploration, seeking truth ; to higher flights of the winged soul to know God ; and to more interior and intense labors of soul to find a true, lasting and happy relation to Him ; to be panoplied with His power ; to triumph over error with His wisdom ; and to bask in the sunshine of truth by obtaining His revelations. Hence, the urgent inquiry, What are the vital, and eternal elements of a New and True Religion? The history of the transitory religions of the past has shown that mere formalism and monotonv, are elements of materialism, of earth-born origin. The drapery of religion�good words,' in some degree, existed 2,000 years before Christ; and every phase and color of religious belief, has had a share in this sacred verbiage, which, as a helm to guide the human barque of floating destiny, has, beyond all controversy, ported many a hum^n craft in a harbor of measurable safety, from the wrecking storms of selfish, passionate humanity, but, the end is not yet! The human family are not at rest ; salvation from those destructive throbbings of human passion, from those perilous graspings after momentary pleasures of sense, is not obtained from those transient sources. Engulfing chasms of sin swallow up earth's millions in misery, inequality in the distributions of a bountiful providence, provokes interminable jealousies and hatreds ; and injustice breeds desire to revenge; thus human will, ra?ped up to desperate energy by the injustice and oppression of human laws and systems of association, breaks over all bounds of restraint; dashes into crimes that appall the senses, and contribute to make earth a pandemonium of strife and contention ; of wretchedness and woe. From these conditions the soul turns shudderingly away, and agonizingly inquires for those elements of religion that are eternally flowing forth fountains of soul life, liberty, equality, justice and happiness. The faith, the religion that is to save and redeem the world, must have a vitalizing motive which proceeds from the strongest forces in the soul, that force is pure love ; not the flickering emotion which dances on the pulses of animal passion, but that tractive power that lifts the soul to heavenly mansions, and ushers it into the embraces of the righteous doers of the will of God, who have wrought to make happy the abodes of man. 'Philosophy has made slow progress in redeeming man,' and has tardily and falteringly wrought to save them. 'I have eyes to see man's misery, but no hands, to lift him out of it. ' It is manifest that the elements of eternal life in religion ; that is a perpetual vitality, and propelling power of religious progress, are to be found in the sacrifice of selfishness, and a whole souled consecration and love to God above, through love to man below. It was this overflowing and everflowing soul of love to God and man, which made, of Jesus, a vicegerent of God ; which gave him power to give his life for his people and God's Cause ! The language and logic of true love is there is no death ; no death ! Spiritual, ' Xo death to those who walk with Christ, They overcome the world, And rising from the carnal life They win the hundred fold. ' ' The supreme truth that God is love, is the secret of the Universe, God's whole creation swims in a sea of eternal love.' 'Not to love is, at last, absolute and utter desolation,' solitude; hermitage. All that is now manifest in human society that is inharmonious, is not of God's creation ; it is of man's conception and inception. The truth which by God's revealed word flashes its light upon the world, is, that the gospel of eternal soul-life, is a gospel of eternal soul love ! This, indeed, was the divine germ of the Mosaic Law ; the grand trunk of the tree of Life upon whose fruitful branches hung ' all the law and the prophets.' The beloved Apostle John hath truly said, ' He that hateth his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.' I John iii., 15. The one lone element in all the myriad theologies and religious systems ( socalled, ) that have deluged the world with wordy creeds ; the one only element which has been of any value to mankind, and, as a bursting germ of life, has, from time to time pierced the flimsy husk of bare progressions, and given even a ray of hope to those who embraced them, was love to God and man ! ' Christ presented himself to the world, drawing off from its speculations its ritualized dogmas ; its traditional ethics, and fixed its thought on himself, ' not on himself worshipfully, but on himself as exemplarily sacrificed to the love of God and man ; giving thereunto his life! And, said Jesus, ' Greater love hath no man than this, that he give his life for his friends. John, xv., 18. This love, as the eternal life of a True and New Religion, were it universally possesse:! an:l practiced, would ''turn the whole world into joyfulness.' This love, being the soul and substance of all true religion, that hath eternal life, and cannot, like human theologies, pass away in the lapse of time, and by the dissatisfactions of humanity, takes away all mystery from ih: gospel testimony, so that '� the wayfaring man though a fool, need not err therein. ' Christ hath begun to make his second appearance in ' One like unto the Son of Man ;' the agent that St. John, in vision of God's work of the last days of God's grace to man, saw sitting upon a white cloud.'' (A cloud of witnesses purified from sin.) Unto whom the spirit of the Lord cried out, ' Thrust in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come for thec to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. ' This harvest is the harvest of humanity ; that is, cutting it off from its natural, generative stock, and garnering it into the Kingdom of God which is not of this evil world,�-Now nothing is more like a ' Son of man' than a daughter of man ; and Christ now manifest through the daughter of man, constitutes Christ manifest the second time in hij glory ; 'woman, the glory of man' and Christ thus dually manifest, the glory of God. Now in this Christ dispensation ''there shall be no more death,' (soul death, the fruit of sin,) ' neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain,' (the fruit of sin,) ''for the former things' (religiousfalse systems ; and man's sins) 'have passed away.' ' And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new. ' Rev. xxi., o. Evolutionists have advertised for a New Religion ; and religious professors, for a New Theology! Wha1. can be newer, than a religion, the life testimony of which ' turns the world upside down' makes its faithful converts ' New Creatures' reaps them from the old earthly stock of generation, which perishes in the usage ; and grafts them, as living branches, on the tree of Eternal Life ; institutes for them a New Earth, and a New Heaven, having the former things all passed away ? 'A New Religion?' It is found! For 'Now has come salvation and strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ. ' Rev. xii., 10. 'And they who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings, as eagles ; they shall run and not be weary ; yea they shall walk and not faint, saith Jehovah.' Isaiah, xi., 41. 'Let this blessed sound of salvation from sin, be published and received as a royal diadem, in the eyes of all nations forever and ever.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
