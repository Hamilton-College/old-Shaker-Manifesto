Anti-Infidel Library A Word to Thoughtful Men. To meet the increasing flood of infidel liter, ature which deluges the land, H. L. Hastings of Boston has since 1883, been engaged in issuing in serial form, the Anti-Infidel Library, a series of brief, cheap, pointed pamphlets bearing on these important questions. They have received the heartiest commendations from persons well qualified to express an intelligent opinion on this subject. The first number of this Library, containing 'A Lecture on the Inspiration of the Bible,' has had a circulation of more than two million copies. Lord Shaftesbury, for more than thirty years president of the British and Foreign Bible Society, used to order them by the thousand for distribution among City Missionaries and outdoor preachers in London and England, Other numbers have been widely scattered. Some 40 numbers have been issued, up to July 1893 which are sold at 5 to 10, 15, and 25 cents each and furnished for distribution at reduced rates. This work appeals to all Christian and rightthinking men. The profits on the sale of these publications do not warrant our expending money in advertizing them, as we would gladly do. May we not take the liberty of asking Christian friends and editors to help a work that is being done, under many difficulties, with limited resources, by directing the attention of Christian people to these publications?
