THE COIN OF POLITE SOCIETY Whenever a kindly or considerate act is shown you, my dear, be always careful to say that magic index to good breeding—'Thank you.' Certainly you say it to the man Mend who has given you an evening of amusement at the theatre, or who has taken you to and fetches you from a friend's home. To whom else should you say it? To the maid servant who hands you your letters, who makes a special point of keeping your room in good order, and who, remembering that you liked certain things placed in a certain way, was always sure to do it. To the stranger who holds open a door for you, to the elevator man who saves you climbing so many stairs, to the man who gives you a seat in car or omnibus, and to anybody in any station of life, who shows you a courtesy of any kind. We are apt to be very stingy with our thanks; to accept things entirely too much for granted, and to believe, in having courtesies shown us; that they are only what we deserve. Now this is the wrong way of looking at it, and some day it will serve that girl right—that girl who believes that the good things of life in the way of politeness are hers lawfully, and that without any effort on her part they can be retained, will discover her mistake. You can never be too generous withthankyou's; they are the current coin of polite society, the circulation of which tends to make everybody more eager to do unto others as they would be done by. No girl makes a mistake who has a thank-you always ready. It is the index to a good character and a loving heart. Politeness is golden, and thank you is the coin which passes everywhere and is recognized by all. -- Ruth Ashmore, in Ladies' Home Journal.
