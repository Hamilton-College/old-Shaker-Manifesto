THE BRIGHT SIDE C. D. Bradlee. Count up the joys and not the pains; Think not of losses, but of gains, Keep back the clouds, gaze at the sun; Thus life will smoothly with you run. Our gifts are more than all our blows, And what is best we know God knows; And He will send his blessings down, Some veiled, but all will hide a crown. If we could know the meaning grand In tears that come by God's command, Then sweetly should we take the cross, And count as gain what seems a loss. Only let us wait and pray, When out of night will come the day. And pearls long hid from human sight Will crown our brows with holy light. ï¿½Good Way.
