ETERNAL LIFE. DANIEL FRAZER. ' We cannot conceive of a means without an end, a contrivance without an object. '�Henry George. Divine attributes inhere in man. Their unfoldment, is in the line of his destiny. The relationships of created things, whether in their construction ; in the stupendous movements of solar systems ; in the chemical forces which build up planets ; or in the domains of living organisms, in their diversity of functions, and their adaptations to ends, all bear a relation to mentality, and to the development of thought in man. Of life as we are cognizant of it, mental development can go but a little way. Mind barely begins to awake ere the bodily powers decline ; yet, dimly conscious of vast fields to be explored, relations to be formed, and sympathies to be extended when death suddenly closes the scene. Hence as far as animal life is involved, there is an abrupt termination to unfinished destinies. And unless there is an after life, there is a break�a failure. A vista opened to grand acquisitions, and closed by an Irapassable gulf. If mind and character developed on earth extend no farther than life's short span ; then there is a want of purpose in our creation and existence, inconsistent with the linked harmonies of the universe. And also inconsistent with man's divine capabilities, and with the fact of his ability, mentally to expand indefinitely. The sphere of man's thought Avidens as he thinks, and his poAver to actualize his conceptions, is limited by earthly conditions. The indications are, that man's career on earth is but a beginning to his future history. In this our rudimental state, we ever associate our animal life, its short duration and other limitations, with a living and ever expanding power within us. This unseen Force, is the true, the real human personality, invisible as is the Personality of God. And like Him, can manipulate inorganic elements into form, beauty, and use�cause them to accomplish his designs, and do his pleasure. ' Let us make man in our own image ' is not an idle myth ; it is an ever-present reality. The creations of man's invisible personality, as in the steam engine, manifests a thousand fold more strength, works with greater precision than can the animal who is said to be the person who made it. Of this personality Jesus Christ spoke wheu he said, ' If I ascend up on high, I will draw all men unto me. ' Those who accept his word lovingly, and ascend with him divinely, have eternal life abiding in them. Eternal�continuous life, affords opportunities to correct moral deviations, personal and social difficulties ; and links together all the harmonies of creation. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
