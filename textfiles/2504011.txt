Shakers, N. Y. Maxell, 1895. The open winter that wejthought might be probable from the indications in the early past of the season, was just a 'little ways off.' We have had our share of snow, and blizzards that have piled it up in promiscuous heaps, and in other places left the ground bare and exposed, but at present date, the 8th inst. there does not seem to be much visible indication of balmy spring; but we will wait with hope, knowing full well that it will come, that the promise of seed time and harvest can not fail. It should move a heart even of stone with sympathy, in reading of the awful destitution in some parts of the west; and many times in partaking of our bountiful repasts we feel rebuked for not having that deep sense of gratitude for these blessings that we should. When we read testimonies from such veterans as Elder John Whiteley, it gives us courage; but, 'as the Ancients of the City pass away, who will keep the testimony burning bright?' Whatever the temporal circumstances or what the tribulation we past through, every one who loves the cause and gives' it support, can lift up their heads and rejoice, and sing praises to the God of their salvation; for the testimony of the higher life has gone forth, and is being received in honest hearts by those who are weary of the elements of the world, and are yearning in spirit for the ministrations of the higher life.
