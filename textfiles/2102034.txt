'AFTER MANY DAYS.' Annie R. Stephens. The following lines were received by Elder Fred, eric Evans, while on his visit to England. They were sent from his gospel home at Mount Lebanon, N. Y. O toilees in the vineyard, O workers for the Lord, Think not your efforts fruitless Because of no reward; We sigh when winter lingers For the bright and smiling Mays, Yet the harvest ever cometh, Though 'after many days.' O yearning hearts! look upward, In patient trusting wait, The seed we sowed in spring-time May often blossom late; And the good that we have scattered Along life's weary ways, Will yield a glad fruition Tea 'after many days.' Go work with ardent courage, And sow with willing hand The seed o'er barren deserts, And o'er the fertile land; And lo! earth yet shall blossom, Though the brighter morn delays. For God perfects the harvest, Yea, 'after many days.' Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
