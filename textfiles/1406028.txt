CHRISTIANITY AND COOKING. AN excellent communication under the above title appeared not long since in the Boston Journal and it is certainly a good omen to see that such an influential secular paper should publish an article so fraught with practical Christianity, and with its thousands of readers how many may be blest through its very efficient ministration. At first sight the presentation of the terms so closely conjoined as Christianity and Cooking seem almost ludicrous, as though the beatitudes could possibly have anything in common with the culinary department. The truth, however, in reference to this is being better understood and the careful preparation of food may largely assist in the development of moral tendencies, while a neglect may as certainly tend to that which is immoral. A religion that does not include the whole of man, his food, his drink, his clothing and his sanitary privileges as well as his religious obligations must indeed be very defective. The many forms of theology which have arisen from time to time have each in their turn accepted some of the Christian truths and with these held more or less carefully to the laws of God that were given for the well-being of the physical system. There was a time, however, when the people of God under the leadership of Moses exercised great care in the selection and preparation of their food, and if we are to accept the record which history has so kindly furnished, we shall learn that the effect was magical. No such results have dawned upon any succeeding nation. As unfortunate as it may have been, the Christian church, in this respect, can boast of nothing superior to their Gentile or heathen neighbors. Christianity in offering a salvation to the race must necessarily be as choice in its ministration to the body as to the soul. The very close relationship Avhich they so carefully sustain, the one to the other, cannot be ignored. It has been said, very truly, that ' the adoption of the Christian idea leads to a life that renews society and brings the true contemplation of God's works and the earnest endeavor to realize his purpose concerning the human race. ' There is, no doubt, but that this was to be the ultimate of the work of Christ. To create all things anew, and to teach that God's laws respecting the physical well-being of the body can be of no less value than are the laws respecting the welfare of the soul. In the early history ol the race a deviation from the Sinaic commandment was regarded so very wrong that it was termed an iniquity, and passed from generation to generation. It certainly can be no less an iniquity in a day when more light and more truth dawns upon the earth. The civilization of the age, has in its upward march, been making some wise changes which must, indeed, be appreciated, while Christianity as an order has only kept pace with those of her own country. This writer who is certainly on the border land of the kingdom of light, further remarks ; �'' We have tunneled mountains, we ^have bound continents together by steamships and telegraphs, and have spanned them with railroads in order to bring food to us, and yet we do not know enough about food to keep soul and body together with any great degree of comfort, fee h�w to make the body the most efficient instrument for the soul's higher activities. ' If an acceptable and a hygienic reform has reached us it will be one more phase that will pleasantly foreshadow the anticipated millennial age, which is the hope of every Christian mind.
