CONSTANTINE THE GREAT. LOUIS BASTING. When Diocletian became emperor of Rome in 284 A. I), the empire was being assailed from all sides ; in Britain, France and Spain, in Asia, Africa and Hungary, war raged universally. Though a most able and determined ruler, he found the task too great to govern such a vast territory single handsd. He therefore divided the government with three associated governors ; and after having reigned for twenty one years, he resigned his august office and betook himself to raising cabbages, enjoying more genuine happiness in this simple employment than he ever did while wearing the imperial crown. His successor, Constantius, also divided the empire, taking for his share Britain, France and Spain. Before his death, which took place at York, he appointed, in 806. his son Constantine, the subject of this sketch, his successor. Constantine was born at Naissus, in modern Servia. His childhood and youth were spent amid stirring scenes of camp life and warfare. His education was wholly military. At the early age of seventeen years, we hear of his distinguishing himself in Egypt, and later on in Persia. His talents were such as to procure him the enmity of Galerius, one of the associate Caesars, who discerned in him a possible future rival for power, and who therefore sought to destroy him. Constantine had to flee for his life to his father in Britain. He remained nine years in England after his father's death, ruling with vigor and wisdom. Then trouble began. Maxentius, whose residence was at Rome, not being satisfied with his share of government and aiming at universal dominion, made war upon him. Constantino was compelled, in self-defence, to appeal to arms. Successively he defeated, not only Maxentius, but four additional claimants for the imperial throne. In 328 he was sole emperor of Rome. For fourteen years he controlled the complicated affairs of government with a degree of energy and statesmanship that compels admiration. His brilliant generalship forced the barbarians to respect the frontiers; and his political sagacity and vigorous administration restored the internal relations of the empire to order and prosperity. In two particular instances was his remarkable comprehension of facts, and his ability to understand the signs of the times, displayed. The city of Rome had become utterly corrupt; its vast population approached two millions in number, the majority being paupers and slaves ; it was divided into turbulent factions whose contentions seriously interfered with orderly government These considerations induced Constantine to make Constantinople the capitol, where he could create conditions suitable to his purposes. The future proved his wisdom; for Constantinople remained the seat of the Eastern Empire for more than a thousand years afte,r Rome had fallen before the Goths. Constantine recognized Christianity as a lawful religion. He has often been charged with being the originator of the system uniting church and state, and lurid imaginations have declaimed with much turgidity of enunciation, endeavoring to identify him with the anti-christ of the Apocalypse, or something dreadful of that sort. It is a most unjust accusation, not at all supported by historical facts. After Constantine had defeated Maxentius at the Milvian bridge, the Roman senate met him in procession and conferred the dignity of Pontifex Maximus, i. e. chief-priest, upon him. Nor was he the first in whose person supreme political and religious power was united. We find all through Roman kistory the closest possible attachment of ecclesiastical and civil maiters. Romulus was priest as well as king, and so were all his successors. Under the republic thep^estly offices were sought for and obtained by politicians in the same manner as other offices. The senate decreed the erection of the temples, provided for their maintenance, and paid the salaries of the priests. When Hannibal was threatening Rome, the senate ordered four persons to be buried alive to appease the angry gods ! ^Constantine was head of the church, not by usurpation, but by time honored law and custom ; he was the heir of a system thai had been growing for tea centuries�not the inventor of it ; and being a patriot and a man of much common sense, he used the great power placed in his hands by circumstances, or if you please, by Providence, to the best of his ability for the good of his people. He was little concerned what form religion assumed, but he insisted upon order in the state. . He had perceived that the worship of the gods had lost its hold upon the people #t&gt; a large degree, especially among the educated classes. Cato the 8toic had said long ago that one augur could not meet another in the street without laughing. He had also perceived that Christianity was a power of too much magnitude to be suppressed; for in spite of three centuries of persecution it had steadily grown in influence and importance. When he therefore recognized it as the state religion, he did so as a statesman and for political reasons�with its ethics and doctrines he was in no wise concerned. Julian, his successor, attempted to re-establish paganism, but failed ignominiously; thus again the soundness of Constantine's judgment was demonstrated. In answer to the accusation that he himself was not a Christian, it may be said that he did not profess to be one. All that is known about it is tint he was baptized on his death-bed, which may have been an incident somewhat analagous to what took place in our time. When Ulysses 8. Grant lay unconscious in one of the crises that preceded his final dissolution, his friend, the Rev. Dr. Newman baptized him with water. When told afterward of what had been done, he is said to have remarked: 'O, well! its all right; I have thought of this thing before. ' The diflTereu.ee between Grant and Consiantine is the difference between the 4th and 19th centuries. Both were great men ; both did the work of their day and time with energy and devotion. Christianity and civilization are under great obligations to them ; yet neither of them cared for the form of religion, and neither the first Christian emperor, nor the great American general, were Christians according to the high standard of the New Testament.
