Sabbathday Lake, Me Dec. 1898. The words of the Quaker poet seem in keeping with the present times wherein he says; 'Let tlie north wind strong And golden leaves of Autumn, be Thy coronal of victory, And thy triumphal song ' Most certainly it seems that the victims of the wreck of the Portland who were destroyed by the furies of the North wind, a short time since, must need some assurance ; some coronal of victory, which no doubt they received after their souls were wafted to a more friendly port, where the furies of such fearful tempests are unknown. While we are enjoying the winter holidays we will not forget to extend greetings over the banks of snow to our precious kindred in other homes, neither will we forget the needy who are always with us. We are deeply interested in the account of the visit of Lafayette to Watervliet, as narrated in the December Manifesto which has just arrived. Sister Genevieve gives a delightful description of her visit to the Church family, which makes us feel envious as we have no other family near us to visit. WTinter has set in uncommonly early and cold; bringing some sickness, but we trust all are convalescing. Ada S. Cummings
