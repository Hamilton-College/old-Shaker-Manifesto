SOFT CHRISTIANITY Much of the Christian character of the day acks swarthiness and power. It is gentle enough, and active enough, and well-meaning enough, but is wanting in moral muscle. It can sweetly sing at a prayer meeting, and smile graciously when it is the right time to smile, and makes an excellent nurse to pour out, with steady hand, a few drops of peppermint for a child that feels disturbances under the waistband, but has no qualification for the robust Christian work that is demanded. One reason for this is the ineffable softness of much of what is called Christian literature. The attempt is to bring us up on tracts made up of thin exhortations and goodish maxims. A nerveless treatise on commerce or science in that style would be crumpled up by the first merchant and thrown into his waste-basket. Religious twaddle is of no more use than worldly twaddle. If a man has nothing to say he had better keep his pen wiped and his tongue still. There needs an infusion of strong Anglo-Saxon into religious literature and a brawnier manliness and more impatience with insipidity, through it be prayerful and sanctimonious. He who stands with irksome repetitions, asking people to ' Come to Jesus, ' while he gives no strong commonsense reason why they should come, drives . back the souls of men. If, with all the thrilling reality of eternity at hand, a man has nothing to write which can gather up and master the thoughts and feelings of men, his writings and speakings are a slander on the religion which he wishes to eulogize. Morbidity in religion might be partially cured by more out-door exercise. There are some duties we can perform better on our feet than on our knees. If we can carry the grace of God with us down into everyday practical Christian work, we will get more spiritual strength in five minutes than by ten hours of kneeling. If Daniel had not served God save when three times a day he worshiped toward the temple, the lions would have certainly eaten him up. The school of Christ is as :r;uch out-door as in-door. Hard, rough work for God will develop an athletic soul. Religion will not conquer either the admiration or the affection of men by effeminacy, but by strength. Because the heart is soft is no reason why the head should be soft. The spirit of genuine religion is a spirit of great power. When Christ rides in apocalyptic vision it is not on a weak and stupid beast, but on a horse�-emblem of majesty and strength : ' And he went forth conquering and to conquer.
