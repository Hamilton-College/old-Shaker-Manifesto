Word and Works Word and Works for August refers us to the 25th page, to study the forecasts for the month. With Mercury, Venus, Vulcan and the Moon all busy at work to create a storm, is sufficient reason why we should watch as well as pray. Electrical storms are not especially interest ing to many minds and any hint given of their anticipated presentation would be received with watchful care. The Origin of Storms will be read with deep interest by those who are so fortunate as to obtain a copy of Word and Works. Those who are not specially interested in studying the coining of the storms can read about the beautiful flowers, or even take the pillow shams, or they may read of 'Our Homes.' Word and Works has an abundance of good reading and can easily interest a large class of minds.
