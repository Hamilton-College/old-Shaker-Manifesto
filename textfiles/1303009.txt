NO TIME TO BE LOST! DOROTHEA T. COHRAN. Haye.yo.u a duty to do? Then begin it at once.rand do not sit dreamily dreading the cross. You never can accomplish any undertaking without resolute and persistent efforts. The longer you procrastinate, the stronger the adversary will seek to bind your conscience. In this way souls often become captivated and are enticed from virtue, until they are ruined. There is danger in delay. The enemy takes advantage of those who say within their mind: 'Tomorrow will do as well. There is time enough yet.' For when tomorrow comes, courage has fled, the duty which seemed but a mote, now appears like a mountain. Then comes a thousand bitter regrets. Instead of being able to erjoy the blessings which are ever springing up in our pathway, like beautiful flowers, testimonials of God's goodnes8, we walk constantly among thorns and briers, the fruits of our own idleness and folly. 'Never put off till the morrow, what should be done today.' Canterbury, N. H.
