A NEGRO'S PRAYER. A teacher in one of the colored schools in the South was about to go away for a season, and an old negro poured out for her the following petition : 'I give you the words,' said the writer, 'but they convey no idea of the pathos or earnestness of the prayer.' 'Go afoae her as a leadin' light, and behind her as a protectin' angel. Roughshod her feet wid de preparation ob de gospel o' peace. Nail her ears to de gospel pole. Gib her de eye ob de eagle, so she spy sin far off. Wax her hand to de gospel plow. Tie her tongue to de line ob truf. Keep her feet in de narrer way, an' her soul in de channel ob faith. Bow her head low beneaf her knees, and her knees 'way down in some lonesome valley, where prayer and supplication is much wanted to be made. Hedge an' ditch about her, good Lord, an' keep her in de strait and narrer way dat leads to heaven.' Bible Banner.
