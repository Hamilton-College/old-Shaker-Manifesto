In Memory of Sister SARAH WOODROW. H. R. Agnew. Go Sister, to that peaceful home, For which you toiled so long; Go reap the golden harvest sown In seasons past and gone. The angels wait and watch for you, The loved ones over there, Rejoice, that one so good and true Sweet heaven with them can share. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
