HINTS TO WRITERS AND SPEAKERS William Cullen Bryant gave the following excellent advice to a young man who offered him an article for the Evening Post. My young friend, I observe that you have used several French expressions in your article. I think, if you will study the English language, that you will rind it capable of expressing all the ideas you may have. I have always found it so, and in all that I have written I do not recall an instance where I was tempted to use a foreign word, but that, on searching, I found a better one in my own language. Be simple, unaffected; be honest in your speaking and writing. Never use a long word when a short one will do. Call a spade a spade, not a well-known, oblong instrument of manual industry; let a home be a home, not a residence; a place a place, not a locality, and so of the rest. Where a short word will do, you lose by using a long one. You lose in clearness; you lose in honest expression of your meaning, and in the estimation of all men who are competent to judge, you will lose in reputation for ability. The only true way to shine even in this false world, is to be modest, unassuming. Falsehood may be a very thick crust, but in the course of time will find a place to break through. Elegance of language may not be in the power of all of us, but simplicity and straight-forwardness are. Write much as you would speak; speak as you think. If with your inferior, speak no coarser than usual; if with your superior speak no finer. Be what you say, and within the rules of prudence. No one ever was a gainer by singularity of words or in pronunciation. The truly wise man will so speak that no one will observe how he speaks. A man may show great knowledge of chemistry by carrying about bladders of strange gases to breathe, but he will enjoy better health, and find more time for business, who lives on common air. Sidney Smith once remarked: After you have written an article, take your pen and strike out half of the words, and you will be surprised to see how much stronger it is. ï¿½Selected.
