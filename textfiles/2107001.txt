SONNET. Lucy S. Bowers. My soul rejoices in the golden light, My thoughts are happy of the vaulted blue, And oh! my pleasure in the sparkling dew That comes 'mid beauty of the starlit night To earth and plant and flower a sweet delight. I feel transported with the sunset view For ages pictured, yet each time more grand and new. Oh world of wonder to the mind and sight! O God, Thou art our God, most High, most Pure, Intelligent, beneficent, sublime. Though graven heaps of stone Thy name secure, Still Thou art He who ruleth every clime; Who made the earth whose fountains will endure, A monument to Thee till end of Time. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
