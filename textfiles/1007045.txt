SAD FACTS. It is a sad fact to contemplate, that in the works of Messrs. Krupp, at Essen, Prussia, 300 cannon of the largest caliber are turned out every month; that 15,000 have been made in two years. The European governments use them for the mutual destruction of their subjects, and appear always ready to begin this destruction when they can find a pretext. * * * The worst of it is, that for the supply of armies the best men are required, the flower of the nation, while the cripples and old men are left at home for the propagation and improvement (?) of the human species.
