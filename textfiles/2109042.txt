To Cool a Bedroom. If the sleeping room is warm, it may be cooled for a time by wringing large pieces of cotton out of water and hanging them before the open windows, says The Ladies' Home Journal. Leave the door open, and as the air comes through the wet cotton it will be cooled. This is a good device for cooling a sick room; the cloths can then be wet again and again. Keep the gas turned low during the process of undressing, and sleep without a light, unless it is a tiny night lamp.
