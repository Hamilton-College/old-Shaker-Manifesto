CONCERT OF ACTION BY D. AMBROSE DAVIS. Why stand we apart with our work in the vineyard, Since God's every child has its mission to fill? Oh, why not go forward like brothers and sisters, Forever united, in earnest good will? Are we not all in the hands of Jehovah, All the recipients of his divine care? Then why so ungrateful as not to be willing To let every soul have its God-given share ? Oh, if we look upward for wisdom and guidance, How quickly the angels respond to our call, Using forever, their utmost endeavor, To make us evangels of kindness to all. The trees of the forest have no altercation, But stand in their order as if they were one; Their roots and their branches make progress together, Until their great work of the temple is done. The sunshine, the rain, and the dew drops of morning, Are ever the same to the high and the low; For nature, we find, in her blessed bestowal, Is always impartial, wherever we go. The star gems that sparkle in beauty above us, So many and varied, all acting their part, Are seeming to ask us to be more fraternal, With shoulder to shoulder, and heart pulse to heart. For tho' in God's wisdom our missions are varied, Our hearts best emotions should still be the same; And favors, the kindest, from one to another, Should always be known as our purpose, our aim.
