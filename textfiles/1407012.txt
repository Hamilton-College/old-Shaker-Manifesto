HOME. ANDREW BARRETT. Discipline and trial are the means of improvement. Besides giving us an insight into our characters, they will if properly improved enable us to advance an,d attain every degree of excellence. Discipline and trial if rightly met and borne will create the only true love element in the soul; and love will make affection and affections bring home. It is a wonderfully mistaken idea that the blessing of home alone is found in some magnificent edifice whose towering lieight and ornamental architecture attracts the vision far and wide. If love and affection constitutes the true home then we may find it in the log cabin of the wilderness as in the mansions of the most gorgeous character, where fortune upon fortune have been expended to feed the fancy of the pleasure seeker. If home is where there are friends to love us, bound by the ties of affection, then we can find it in the quiet retreat of the little village, as well as in the midst of turmoil and strife of the great Metropolis. Reason teaches that home in its true sense and meaning implies contentment and love. Where each other in turn are greeted by welcome feelings and an assurance that no deception or caste is underlying the true spirit. It is welcome Brother, welcome Sister, to your home again. It is meeting Brother and Sister with a salutation of good morning or evening in meeting or parting. It is love where selfishness has wholly been extracted, and in our heart lies as deep a love for our neighbor as for ourselves. Harvard, Mass.
