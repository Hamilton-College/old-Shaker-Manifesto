In order to keep their butter over the period of low prices and the hot weather, California dairy-men seal up their products in tin cans, and sink them in the bottom of cold streams. Butter made in April comes out in October in good order and continues to keep fresh in the cold weather of winter. Forty-four-pound cans are commonly used.
