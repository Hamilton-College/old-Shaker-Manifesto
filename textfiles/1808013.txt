CHARITY. Amelia J. Calver. 'Charity shall cover a multitude of sins.' 1 Peter, iv., 8. 'Go,' said a master-builder to two artists in his employ, 'prepare those two blocks of variegated marble for my temple. They are to occupy important places : make them beautiful.' Each alike anxious to obey orders earnestly bent his energies to the work before him. The one on the right whose work faced the south, and the suu. saw beauty in the various colors of the marble, and after overcoming the unevenness of the surface, brought out its rich beauty by polishing. The bright svarm sun shone down upon his lab&gt;&gt;r ; he saw the work of his hands and was satisfied. The other whose work faced the north, consequently in shade, saw only blemishes in the variegated spots, and with gouger sought to remove the imperfections ; but every effort proved of no avail, for the rougher the surface the more ugly the dark lines, and at last finding his marble nearly perforated, in his attempt to find the terminations of the colored veius, he gave up in despair.
