Sixty lbs. carried 1,000 miles for six cents :—Any farmer who has raised wheat knows how heavy a bushel of wheat feels, after he has carried it half a mile or so. We have found it a full day's work with a good span of horses, to take 30 to 40 bushels 14 miles to market, and return with an empty wagon. How would it be if we had no railroads or canals, to transport to the sea-board shipping markets the immense grain products of the west and northwest? During July of this year, the average rate paid for carrying wheat all the way from Chicago to New York, by the lakes THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 113 (1.7c.) and canal (4.3c.) was only six cents per bushel of GO lbs., and for a bushel of corn, 56 lbs., 5 1-3 cents! The distance sby this route is some 1,500 miles. The railroads, to compete with the water routes, have had to carry grain at about the same rates, and the shortest distance by railroad is nearly 1,000 miles. Allowing a team and driver only $4 a day for wages, feed, and other traveling expenses, carrying 40 bushels, and going 33 1-3 miles each day, the expense would be $3 per bushel,jproviding that the team got loading enough homeward, to pay expenses and wages back. So, at the best, it would cost fifty times as much to carry grain to market by wagon as it does by railroad. The same reckoning applies, in a lesser degree, to shorter distances. Shall we tear up the railway tracks, or abuse the owners, who do not receive 4 per cent on the average for the money invested? Ought we not rather to have a good deal of sympathy with the original builders of these roads, a large number of whom never got any thing for the money expended — either for the principal or the interest ? Not a very profitable business certainly.— American Agriculturist.
