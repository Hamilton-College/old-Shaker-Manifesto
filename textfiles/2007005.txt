SERVE THE LORD. D. C. Brainard. The Lurd by his servant Joshua said :� '�'�And I have givn you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and ohveyards which ye planted 'not do ye eat. Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in who�e land ye divell; But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Joshua, xxiv., 13. The question arises, is not the above text literally true in this present day and generation, and does not history here repeat itself ? There is a large number of us in the different families who were adopted in childhood by the Society, and many at mature age. Do we not occupy lands for which we did not labor ? Do we not dwell in houses that we built not, and eat the fruit of vines that we planted not? and in taking upon us the apparel and name of Shaker do we not assume a character that is well known and accepted throughout the world as a synonym of honesty, justice and square dealing which personally we had not earned? these facts I think will be readily admitted. Then there is certaiuly a great and heavy responsibility resting upon all, that we make a wise and judicious use of those treasures which we have come into possession of, and only hold in trust for those who are to succeed us, that by no neglect or carelessness, we waste or criminally squander the heritage of the Lord, but be adding thereto. If by causing two blades of grass to grow where only one grew before, the race is benefitted, how much more to be commended are they who add to the consecrated inheritance, consecrated by the toils, labors and lives of those workers in the vineyard who have gone to their reward. Yet of far greater importance it is that by no word, act or deed we in anywise lower the high standard of honesty and truth bequeathed to us by the lives and stern integrity of the founders of this Order. Then I would say let no one be ashamed to don the uniform and earnestly accept the profession and life of a true Shaker. Jesus said, whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words, of him also shall the son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. We should at all times fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods of this world, which are the lusts of the flesh and of the mind, which if any man love, the love of the Father is not in him. Let every soul take heed and not wait halting between two opinions, but this day choose whom ye will serve, and may the choice of everyone be, 'As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
