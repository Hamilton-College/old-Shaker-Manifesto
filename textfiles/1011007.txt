Truth always safe TRUTH ALWAYS SAFE. Men talk of 'dangerous truths,' as if't Could be That truth is ever dangerous or unsafe ! 'Tis only we and our imperfect ways That are at fault. Nettles touched timorously Sting to the quick ; but grasp them with a will, And they are harmless a^ sweet beds of balm. And so with Truth approach her with distrust Or fear, she stings us with her positive, Sharp weapons, and we cry out, ' We are hurt ! ' But front her boldly and she harms us not ; Nay, wrestle with her, hold her till the day Breaks, and the cry bursts from our desperate lips, ' I will not let thee go, except thou bless ! ' And we shall know her as she is, a sweet, Strong, helpful angel, sent to us of God, And blessing ere she goes. Only half-truths Are dangerous; of them, my soul beware ! Look to it that they cheat thee not with shams, And flattering, specious forms of lower good, When the supremest good is in thy grasp, Or may be for the reaching after it. Friend's Intelligencer.
