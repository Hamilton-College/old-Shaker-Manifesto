Society Record Mt. Lebanon stands improved by an ornamental iron fence on either side of the road passing through the Church family. New roofs are noticed on some of the buildings. 'The 'North' are testifying their love for future adherents by repainting all their buildings. One of the most beautiful and affecting seasons was at the farewell gathering to bid adieu to Elder F. W. Evans.
