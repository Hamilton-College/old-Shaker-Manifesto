INQUIRY. No. 3. What is the difference between the Quakers and Shakers? While the Quakers believe in the old Adamic relation of 'marrying and giving in marriage,' the Shakers believe in the testimony of the Christian resurrection, in which Jesus said, 'they neither marry nor are given in marriage.' The Quakers are believers in the Trinity, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,three male persons in the Deity. The Shakers teach that God is our Father and our Mother. The Quakers believe in the plenary inspiration oi' the Scriptures, while the Shakers believe that the Scriptures are a record of God's work among a specially favored class of people. The Quakers amass to themselves all the private, selfish property that time and ability will afford. The Shakers live in a Christian Community and have no private property, but hold as said the apostles,'All things in common.' While there are essential differences in the two orders, there are some things in which they quite nearly approach each other. The Quakers are stanch non-resistants and a worthy example of this Christian principle. They accepted the words of Jesus,'my soldiers will not fight.' The Shakers accepted the same testimony, and are also, non-resistants.
