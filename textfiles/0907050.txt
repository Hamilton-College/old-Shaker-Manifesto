ASPIRATION C. G. Reed Center, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. O Heav'n sweet empire of my song, Celestial clime of heav'nly bliss, 2. Let earth her wealth and splendor boast, Her coronets and wreaths display, 3. There is a realm where all is pure, Where naught but virtue sheds perfume, 4. Elysian fields their glories bright, Resplendent on my vision shed, Realm of the pure angelic throng, Bright land of glowing happiness. Her heroes, kings and nobles toast,—¦ Ephemeral glories of a day. Where living peace is ever sure, Where joys eternal are in bloom. Where virgin souls in cloudless light, Among these fadeless beauties tread. My soul is thrilled with love divine, Sweet joys around my heart entwine, This pomp is all a transient joy, Far higher themes my tho'ts employ, I work to gain the blest domain, Where souls redeemed in triumph reign, O Hallow'd Spirits! Blissful Clime! I crave your happiness sublime, My spirit soars to spheres a bove, Where all is harmony I contemplate the spheres above, Where all is harmony Transporting in the spheres above, Where all is harmony A birthright in the spheres above, Where all is harmony and love, and love, and love, and .love, My spirit soars to spheres above, Where all is liarmony and love. I contemplate the spheres above, Where all is harmony and love. Transporting in the spheres above, Where all is harmony and love. A birthright in tha spheres above, Where all is harmony and love.
