THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN'S WITHIN. WILLIAM CLAY. [ Contributed by G. B. Avery. ] Ah, what is the soul, in its prison of clay, But a poor oiphan child from the stars, Like an eagle, it aims for the regions of day, But strikes on the hard iron bars. With bodily wants, and low earthly care, It frets out its poor mortal life, Now radiant with hope, now black with despair Till it sinks down a wreck in the strife. In this cold barren world of sorrow and pain The spirit seeks vainly for rest, [gain We chase the false phantoms of pleasure or And find them but shadows at best. We make ourselves slaves to this carcass of sin And all for mere clothing and food, While the God-imaged soul is starving within For the noble, the true, and the good! Would ye learn a great truth more precious [than gold Would ye fly for a refuge from sin, Remember 'twas taught by the Savior of old, That the kingdom of Heaven's within. When man to his godlier nature is true, And the conscience within is at rest, [hue Then the earCh and the sky take a heavenlier Like the beautiful land of the blest. When the brute in our nature is under control And the heart to its maker is given [the soul Then God's Divine Spirit doth shine through As stars through the clear vault of Heaven. Some pure gifted souls, like the great God of [light Shed sunshine wherever they go. [bright, All things that they touch grow both lovely and And they make their own heaven below. Like the poor blinded worm in darkness and We are groping our way to the skies, [doubt, Ah, 'tis only within and never without That the secret of happiness lies. What matters this life with its terrible jars, Its trials, its sufferings and woe? Let the spirit be calm and serene as the stars While the clouds rage in fury below. Would ye learn a great truth more precious Would ye fly to a refuge from sin, [than gold Remember 'twas taught by the Savior of old, That the kingdom of Heaven's within. Selected.
