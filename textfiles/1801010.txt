SABBATH EVENING Mary H. Caswell The Sabbath day was ended, The Bible placed aside ; Full many texts I'd gathered From this unerring guide Which rested on my spirit As rays of purest light, Revealing to me clearly My duty in God's sight. Though oft through early childhood, And e'en in wayward youth, I'd read these sacred lessons, And learned to love their truth; Yet, in the recent review Of ancient precepts rare, One 'mong the many others Engrossed my special care. 'Twas uttered by our Savior, Most sweetly, calmly given To his devout disciples To point the way to Heaven ; See Luk*. Except ye be converted And like a child become, Ye can in no wise enter The Kingdom as my own. So positive this statement, I ask who can gain-say This truth divinely spoken A truth that lives to-day? And thus I said 'tis folly, For one to entertain A hope to reign in glory, Without a righteous claim. Henceforth may angels witness, My promise which shall be, To seek the Father's Kingdom, Through blest humility. Canterbury, N. H.
