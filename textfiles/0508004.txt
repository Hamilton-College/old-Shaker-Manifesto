LETTER FROM THE EDITOR OF 'THE SUN' New York, June 14,1875. Friend Evans, I don't know that I have ever expressed the sentiment to you, but it is proper that I should say frankly, that I have no personal conviction that materialization is a true thing. Neither do I care very much whether it is true or not. I have no idea whatever that witnesses from beyond the grave are of any value as teachers of Spiritual Truth. T*ruth must stand on its own merits, and if it were uttered by ten thousand spirits, it would not be a whit more true than when uttered by one man in the flesh. Having said this, I will say that such a meeting as you propose would be immensely interesting and important. If it is really possible to produce a spirit from the other world in the appearance of an ordinary human body, and to have this spirit address an audience, the fact would produce an extraordinary excitement. Nothing that could occur, I suppose, would so deeply impress the minds of people in general; and, if it is practicable, I can see no objection to undertaking it. As for defraying the expenses, there would not be the slightest difficulty in having that done over and over again, by charging a small fee for admission ; but a considerable force of police would probably be necessary to preserve order. Yours sincerely, Charles A. Dana
