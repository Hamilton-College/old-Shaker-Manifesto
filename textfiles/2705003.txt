RIGHTEOUSNESS. By Joanna J. Kaime. HANDS at work and heart toward God,' was the injunction given by JHL Mother Ann Lee, the founder of our Order. To the faithful observance of this exhortation by her loyal followers, our Church owes its successful establishment, its maintenance and its power. A practical application to the daily life of the principles embodied in these two simple sentences, has proved to us that one is not without the other in securing satisfactory results. Perchance some might claim that the first requisite of material success is in putting 'hands at work' without being supplemented with 'heart toward God;' but would not the elements of selfishness bear sway in this way? With the heart fixt upon God and sustained by godly principles what can not a Christian or a body of Christians achieve ? During the lapse of a hundred years has the Shaker Church stood successfully upon this combined temporal and spiritual platform when looking to God for direction and sustaining power. Called, as we have been, to share in the communal blessings with which a kind Providence has so signally favored us, it becomes us to offer our best gifts in deepest gratitude. To those who leave the order of generation, is granted the privilege of becoming the children of the Resurrection, and according to their several abilities such are responsible that every consecration be made in view of the best improvement of time, physically, mentally and spiritually considered, and thus enhance in a three fold measure the welfaie of our home as well as the comfort of its devoted members. Without a conscientious regard for the performance of every duty, personal and selfish interest would be inclined to rule and the higher spiritual law of communistic principles be lost to view. In the t.ime of the Apostolic church St. Paul commanded 'that if any would not work neither should he eat.' He further states, 'We hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busy-bodies; now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work and eat their own bread.' Who is there with much experience in life that has not realized the train of mischief and even crime which follows in the wake of the idle and thoughtless individual unemployed with hand or heart in some honest, and consequently worthy occupation. The question often arises,ï¿½Are there not some of the present day who might profit by St. Paul's advice? That there is a diversity of gifts in every church is very true, and every one who improves these various talents for the good of the whole is personally benefited and blest to share the hundred-fold advantages of a Christian, communal home.
