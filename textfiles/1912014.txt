Hancock, Mass. Nov. 11. Beloved Elder Henry ;ï¿½You kindly invited us to write you when we closed our school. At the close of this session we provided no public entertainment, believing the time spent in learning and rehearsing dialogues, recitations and corresponding exercises might be more profitably employed. We think that once a year quite often enough, and at the close of the first term is the pleasantest season in which to entertain our friends. Those of the Brethren and Sisters who visited the school during the last week, seemed pleased with the progress made by the pupils and their remarks of commendation were very acceptable to both teacher and pupils. The S. S. Committee manifested special interest in the efforts which the pupils had made in the studies of Arithmetic Grammar and Drawing, and expressed themselves as well pleased with the exercises. Several of the pupils of the ''Bible Class' are very much interested in searching for answers to the Scripture questions, and we think it an excellent exercise for them. WiJl enclose a few of their thoughts about some of the verses of the Bible. From your Sister, Emoretta Belden.
