BEN BUTLER'S GRANDMOTHER. A HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE ARISTOCRACY. I was literally adopted by my grandmother, my grandfather having died several years before. She was a very remarkable looking woman, wliostood about five feet eleven inches in her stockings. She was then in the neighborhood of eighty years old, and walked with a stick, yet she was as erect as ever. She also taught me fully to understand her politics, which, so far as I could understand them, were that there ought not to be any kings, princes, barons, nobles, or knights. She never said anything against aristocrats, and my memory of her now is that if ever there was a high-priestess of the aristocracy, she was one, and especially did she dilate upon the fact that herfamily,theCilleys, was the best in the state. Can any one doubt where I learned my political status: democratic politics in government and personal aristocracy?ï¿½From 'Benjamin Butler's Boyhood,' by Himself, in New England Magazine for October.
