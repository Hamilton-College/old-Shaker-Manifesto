CONTENTMENT It is an old maxim, that ' A contented mind is a continual feast.' Tliere is, perhaps, nothing more certain to insure happiness, than an even temperamentâ€” a cheerful, contented disposition that can look at the bright side of things, even under adverse circumstances. Nor is there any thing that will more effectually prevent usefulness, and mar the happiness of individuals, or produce more unpleasant conditions in society, than the reverse of this. The former looks for good, and finds it ; and is quick to discern virtue in others, and to cover their defects with charity. While the latter, sees every fault, and magnifies it, and finds it much easier to see deformity, than beauty ; and always inclines to put bitter for sweet. If we would make life bright and happy, and have friends to love and care for us, we must, while young, cultivate such dispositions and habits as will make us agreeable and useful members of society. We cannot be too earnest in this ; for upon it depends, in a large measure, our present and future happiness. We shape our course, the joy or fear Of which, our coming life is made ; And fill our future atmosphere, With pleasant sunshine, or with shade. Florence Martin, Union Village, O.
