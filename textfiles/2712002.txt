OUR RECORD. By Edwin P. Sevester. THE writer of this article wishes to call the attention of all the young people within our Zion, wherever their home may be, to the all-important fact, to start life aright,ï¿½begin and continue and persue a right course. Then in after life, taking a retrospective view of the past, you will look with pleasure and satisfaction upon it. If you have kept a clean record the best you know, according to the light you have received, then you will be spared the bitter experience, and the humiliation that others have no faith in you; that everybody distrusts you; that you are walking under a cloud, and that men turn the cold shoulder, refusing to associate with you. O, my young friends, you who have a long life before you, it is of the greatest importance that you maintain your life record clean. : ; Think of that man, of whom I wrote in my preceding article, who had the misfortune of staining his past record with evil deeds, but who repented and turned from evil. Those who know him best declare that he has lived for many years an honest, upright life, and yet respectable people, those who value their reputation, close their doors against him, and banish him from their circle. And here is another man, Senator of the U. S. who in years gone by, had led a wild, fast life, being irregular in his habits. It is declared of him, that he walks under a cloud. Now, that man may have lived for years an exemplary life, otherwise he would not have been chosen to such an exalted position. And yet there is a shadow darkening his life. The influence of our present conduct, is far-reaching into our future state of existence. What we sow that surely we shall reap, the law of compensation is inexorable. If we sow to the wind we shall reap the whirlwind. Often we bring upon ourselves, what we are pleased to call the visitations of Providence. Let all take such examples as a solemn warning, redeeming past error by present uprightness. Forget the past and reach forward into a new life. Forgive as we hope to be forgiven, bearing noill-will against any one. In taking a retrospective view of my past life, I can see how often I have failed and wavered in my faith or strayed from the narrow path yet G-od in his mercy has drawn me back into the right path by means unlookt for and powers unthought of but I knew a Father's and a Mother's care was ruling the billows. In the tempests and the storms of temptation, a strong arm has always been uplifted for my salvation ; a kind hand has been extended for my protection, until I can proclaim that Christ is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God through his testimony and life.
