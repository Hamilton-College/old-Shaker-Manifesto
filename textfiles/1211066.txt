FRETTING FRETTING. Fretting won't pay. To the contrary, it is always practiced at a loss of time, strength and temper, ending in the greater loss of happiness. Fretters are much more apt to practice their pernicious habit because of small matters than great ones. Nay, imaginary troubles are quite as apt to be the subject of their disquietude as real ones. And so, if they have nothing real to stew themselves over, they will conjure up something wherewith to make themselves miserable. We have read an anecdote well calculated to show the folly of people fretting over their misfortunes. It told of a couple of gardeners, whose pea crops had failed because of the frost, or some other adverse influence. One of them went about amongst his neighbors fretting and insisting that he was 'the most unlucky creature in existence.' Sometime afterward, on visiting his unfortunate neighbor and getting a glimpse of his garden, he exclaimed: 'What a fine crop of peas you have ! How is this, that you have peas this year and I none? I thought your planting was all for naught, like my own !' 'Precisely so,' said the other. 'Butwhile you were fretting I replanted my crop!' Fretting would not be so bad a habit were its consequences confined to the fretter. But they are not. Fretters are almost certain to make their families and friends and neighbors unhappy. And so they become social nuisances, calling loudly for abatement. Remember this, ye fretters, and fret no more ! Granite, Free Press.
