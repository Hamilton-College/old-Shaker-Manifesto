Kind Editor: I read your article to ' youth and children' in the last number of our paper, at the opening of school as soon as in my possession. The children seemed to appreciate the paternal advice ; and Henry Clough has written his thanks, and the expression of our little school. You will accept it as a purely original letter, and know, should you feel to give him any advice, it will be acceptable. He seemed afraid I might alter the letter somewhat, and thus I gave entire place to his expanding, manly powers, knowing the keen eye of the editor would detect any blunder; and should he offer amendments it might do quite as much good as though from one who has the constant discipline. With many thanks for past favors, and especially those kind words to we little folks, I subscribe myself your humble sister, Emma J. Neal Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
