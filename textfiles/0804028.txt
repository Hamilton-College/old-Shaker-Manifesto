FARM and GARDEN Farmers are kings Farmers are Kings. A writer says that 'when Roman virtue was the purest, the greatest generals cultivated their own farms. Industry and frugality were in high esteem. 'When our ancestors,' said Cato, 'wished highly to praise a man they called him a good farmer.' ' Leckey tells us a censor deprived a citizen of his vote because his garden was negligently cultivated. Rome was the greatest of the old nations, and her history is the most replete with important lessons to us of the American republic. Before the commencement of her decline under luxury, King Pyrrhus sent a messenger to the Roman senate to treat for peace, and on his return the king asked him what he had seen? 'I have seen,' he replied, 'a senate full of kings.' Such were they who had been bred to agriculture and to arms. If all these kings did not cultivate their own farms with their own hands, they were occasionally compelled to call one from his plow to be dictator in a national emergency. Regulus, in the midst of his campaign in Carthage, asked to come home because his farm was uncultivated and his family would need bread. He was not permitted to come home; but the senate took charge of hiss farm. That was when the soldier served his country without pay. No wonder such a people conquered the world. Everything in history, nature and in phi- losophy, appeals to the farmer to cultivate an unbounded esteem for his occupation, and to exert himself, in co-operation with his fel- low farmers, in placing agriculture at the head of all pursuits in honor aud dignityThis would afford the surest guaranty to papular morality, public integrity and republican perpetuity.
