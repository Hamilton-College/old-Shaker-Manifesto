Beloved Elder Henry;�To-day brings us the work of loving hands, sacred to the memory of our worthy Elder Giles. His Autobiography together with the touching mementos of his many friends. It was a beautiful thought to thus coinbine the two. His early resolutions to devote himself to the Shaker life, his entire consecration of time and talents to its cause are so well authenticated by the 'cloud of witnesses' at his departure, that the pamphlet seems like a string of pearls well clasped. And since, 'The lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime.' it is as you wrote us; this Memorial will be one of our best missionaries. Happiness cannot be bought at halfprice, neither can the full satisfaction of our life be reached without the entire de nial of self and selfish interests. But it needs the willing co-operation of every member in Community to make it a success. Also a careful, prayful, watchful spirit that we may have that 'wisdom which is from above, first pure then peaceable.' The living months have come to us again, and impress us strongly to 'look up through nature to nature's God.' As we cast our eyes over the landscape just now we see that the frosts of winter, and the stormy blasts have destroyed the verdure of the past summer. The earth is sere and brown. But what will the sunshine and showers do for it? O beautiful lesson to learn! The life principle is hidden beneath and within this seeming ruin, and ere long the perennials will bud and blossom the annuals will be replanted, and it will soon be verdure and freshness everywhere. Can we not go and do likewise? Though the inevitable vicissitudes of earth-life everywhere may destroy many cherished plans; though our fondest hopes may fail ere fruition; yet the perennial principle of truth within us is ever ready to blossom into life when awakened by the rays of the sun of righteousness; while new resolves and works meet for our daily needs, must like the annuals be 'resown with worthier seed,' and fitted to the toils of our day. We had an unexpected display of lightning on the evening of Feb. 28; though at the time it was quite cold and snowy. Winter lightning is said to show 'that there is solid weather behind' and it proved true this time, for the first week in March has the coldest record of our quite severe winter. A. J. C. North. Family. Mar. 16, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�I received a nice roll of music for which I return the hearty thanks of all the singers. The autobiographies arrived to-day and they look very nice and give universal satisfaction. I thought you might have such a flood of matter connected with the autobiographies, that I would not add to the overflowing vessel. We have had some very cold weather and a great deal of rain. The first week in March I gave our new boilers a thorough test as to the economy compared with stoves. The coal was very carefully weighed and it took just twenty pounds of coal for each joom per day. I took a great deal of pains that all should be warm and all the complaint I heard was, too hot. Nothing special moving, either in the physical or spiritual elements in these quarters. Our labors are mostly directed to raising the money to pay the taxes and hired men. Fishes are not caught very often in our waters that have the wherewith-all in their mouths to pay tribute to Caesar. So we must toil on, pray on. In kindest love, D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. Mak. 1891. It is a general time of health. No one sick. This is a great blessing. Ice and snow are plenty, but we are having a few warm days, and the snow and ice may disappear. The South family have been putting in a hot water heater to warm their sewing room, and it has proved to be a complete success. This is much better than a coal stove as it warms the room more evenly. Believing that cleanliness comes next to godliness, they have fitted up a new bath-room with all modern improvements. There seems to be some rivalry, to see which family will have the best care and present the best appearance. This is a move in the right direction. The Second family have made some improvements in the cooking of food for the stock. They have introduced a boiler for heating the water and also for steaming the food. They also have a silo, and of course the butter which they make must be number one. The gardeners at the Church are sow86 ing their tomato seed in boxes, and looking forward for early plants. We have one hundred lambs from our flock of sheep and all are doing well. As a Community we are prospering in temporal things, and are also striving to gather the fruits of the spirit. J. B. Enfield, Conn. Mar. 1891. 'This one thing I do,' said the apostle, 'forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.' What is the 'one thing' for which we are striving? Let us see to it that it is something worthy the energies of the immortal soul, something worth living for, something worth dying for. Let us strive to work foi the good of others, to uplift some sinking soul, to strengthen and cheer some sin-sick one, or arouse some weak and erring one to better endeavors. Let us make our heaven here. Virtuous living, kindly acts and loving consideration make of home a heaven that one is in no haste to exchange for heaven above. 2440 spaces of cream were sold in February. Spinach and top onion seed that was sown in October, is now two inches above ground, and gives promise of a fine crop early in May. Currants need one good trimming annually, cutting out old wood and thinning the new. A little salt in poultry food is beneficial, but too much is dangerous. Brahmas, Cochins and Games are the best table birds, (roasted.) Crosses of lighter breeds on the above, for broilers. For general purposes, Wyandottes, Plymouth Rocks and Langshans. For eggs, Spanish, Minorcas and Leghorns. For profit a person can secure better returns by selecting according to the variety in which he is most interested. All fowls should be made to scratch and search for a portion of their food. D. Obcutt. Harvard, Mass. Mar. 11, 1891. Deab Editor:�This morning the thermometer stands five deg. below zero, with two feet of snow on the ground. What a contrast with several past years. Last year we had what we called four days of good sleighing. This year over one hundred will tell the story. Last year we made out to fill our ice house with ice five inches thick and that of a poor quality. It is now full of ice twelve inches thick and of the very best quality. Last year our Sister society at Shirley did not ha,ve the privilege of getting any ice, and were obliged to sell their milk, but this year they have filled their house with the very best of ice. The deep snow this morning has forced us to stop sawing our wood, which we had thought to finish in some three days. Men and teams must go out on the highways as the drifts have made the roads impassable. We are adding a few necessary improvements to the comforts of life, as the purse may warrant. A radiator has been put into the dining-room to use up a little more of the surplus steam. The Sisters have concluded that it was more beneficial to health to have the floor of the ironing-room made of wood instead of cement, and the apparatus for ironing has been removed to a room above the basement. I think this is an item of importance that should be brought before the people, more than it now is. If experience is worth more than theory, then I think those who have had a thorough trial of cement floors, may have liberty to speak. It is one of the most unwise things that can be done, to improve on the old style of laundry labor, to have a cement floor through the hope of saving a little in the wear and tear of the flooring. It will be certain to bring injury to the health of those who so faithfully care for that part of our domestic life. The constant complaint of cold feet is only the stepping stone to something worse. If the feet are cold we just raise the temperature of the room to *75 or 80 degrees, and this makes the heat so oppressive to the head and lungs, that we are glad to open a door and get a breath of fresh air. The result of this sudden change with the head so heated and the feet uncomfortably cold, is often disasterous to the system. It is a decided mistake to make a cement floor for a laundry with the idea of having less expense. The floor made of wood may not be quite so durable, but in its use the injury to the health is decidedly less. A. B.
