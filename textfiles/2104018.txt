Harvard, Mass. Mar. 11, 1891. Deab Editor:ï¿½This morning the thermometer stands five deg. below zero, with two feet of snow on the ground. What a contrast with several past years. Last year we had what we called four days of good sleighing. This year over one hundred will tell the story. Last year we made out to fill our ice house with ice five inches thick and that of a poor quality. It is now full of ice twelve inches thick and of the very best quality. Last year our Sister society at Shirley did not ha,ve the privilege of getting any ice, and were obliged to sell their milk, but this year they have filled their house with the very best of ice. The deep snow this morning has forced us to stop sawing our wood, which we had thought to finish in some three days. Men and teams must go out on the highways as the drifts have made the roads impassable. We are adding a few necessary improvements to the comforts of life, as the purse may warrant. A radiator has been put into the dining-room to use up a little more of the surplus steam. The Sisters have concluded that it was more beneficial to health to have the floor of the ironing-room made of wood instead of cement, and the apparatus for ironing has been removed to a room above the basement. I think this is an item of importance that should be brought before the people, more than it now is. If experience is worth more than theory, then I think those who have had a thorough trial of cement floors, may have liberty to speak. It is one of the most unwise things that can be done, to improve on the old style of laundry labor, to have a cement floor through the hope of saving a little in the wear and tear of the flooring. It will be certain to bring injury to the health of those who so faithfully care for that part of our domestic life. The constant complaint of cold feet is only the stepping stone to something worse. If the feet are cold we just raise the temperature of the room to *75 or 80 degrees, and this makes the heat so oppressive to the head and lungs, that we are glad to open a door and get a breath of fresh air. The result of this sudden change with the head so heated and the feet uncomfortably cold, is often disasterous to the system. It is a decided mistake to make a cement floor for a laundry with the idea of having less expense. The floor made of wood may not be quite so durable, but in its use the injury to the health is decidedly less. A. B.
