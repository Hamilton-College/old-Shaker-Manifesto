Sabbathday Lake, Me. Dec. 1893. Brethren and Sisters of the Household of Faith:â€” Our good Sister Ada Cummings, who writes our monthly notes for The Manifesto has some trouble with her eyes and therefore must be careful for the present. As she can not write until the time will be past for you to receive our New Year's greeting in the January number, I take my pen to tell you that we, at Sabbathday Lake, wish you all a Happy New Year. It is a hazy Sabbath, not what we would call foggy, for the sun is shining almost through, and it makes us think that heaven is beyond, only a little ways. We attended our religious service and heaven appeared right in our midst, no haze to separate. Eldress Harriet Goodwin spoke beautifully to the youth and children, and said she had noticed a marked improvement in their deportment, and this is what her loving, motherly eye is quick to see. Their Elders and Teachers spare no pains with them, and they show that they are giving good heed to the kind instruction which they receive from day to day. This afternoon I visited Sister Ada and her company of little girls. They were just arranging for a meeting of their own. I asked if I could be a spectator and liberty was granted at once. They had leaders appointed from their own number and the order was perfect. The gifts of the spirit were really made manifest. Toward the close of the meeting I taught them the 'Celestial March' and other religious exercises which made the worship of our fathers and mothers so beautiful; and that caused me to think of the pure and holy lives which our fathers and mothers lived. O, how white and clean are the spiritual robes of the children of the resurrection! These are Sabbathday Lake notes and temporal matters are left out. So in the commencement of the New Year, we will seek the spiritual first, then the temporal blessings will be added. Aurelia G. Mace
