Beloved Elder Henry:--as I was reading... Shakers, N. Y. Feb. 1893. Beloved Elder Henry;�As I was reading Elder Daniel Offord's article in the March Manifesto, it brought to my mind a pleasant little episode that once took place in our religious service. It seems that Eldress Kuth Landon had for some reason called upon a very bashful Sister to make some demonstration of her zeal, and in her flustration, the Sister replied;�'You begin.' Would it not be a good plan for Elder Daniel to begin and sound the key note? In kindest love, Isaac Anstatt.
