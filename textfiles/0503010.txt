WHAT ARE WE DOING? Brethren and Sisters : What are we doing? Are we keeping the way of God, in its purity, according to the teaching and example of our Gospel Parents? In our daily vocations, whatever they may be, are we faithful according to our best abilities, being careful and prudent in whatever of temporalities with which we have to do ? Are we meek and gentle in our deportment, manifesting a kind and forbearing spirit toward one another, striving always to make as much allowance for the weakness of others as for our own ? Having gained a good degree of mastery over our baser appetites and passions, are we alive to the fact that we have but entered the portico of the vast temple of spiritual refinement, but just entered the forest, cleared away the coarse, natural growth, preparatory to. cultivating the fields of illimitable improvement ? When we see pride, arrogance, envy, superstition, jealousy, anger, hatred, impatience, disrespect, loquacity, indifference to the feelings of others, idleness, or any other of the heads of the hydra, cropping out, are we aware that we are merely looking into a mirror ? Are we aware that the more we are under such influences, the less patience and forbearance we have with the shortcomings of others ? In this day of materialization, do we comprehend the vital importance of the fact that God is manifest in humanity ? That as we respect the Holy Eternal Parents, in our Elders, Sisters and Brothers, even so may we be respected ? And do we further comprehend that love of God in humanity need not be limited by sectarian bars ? Are there not sheep that are not of this fold—is there any living thing God has made that is not entitled to sufficient respect, to be treated with kindness ? My dear Gospel Kindred, is not this a good time for me to examine myself— to prove my own self to see that I am not only in the faith some time ago delivered to the saints, but in the increase of God ? I think it is. Martin Andrews, Enfield, Conn.
