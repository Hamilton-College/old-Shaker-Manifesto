'THE LEAST OF THESE.' She had little of earthly beauty; She had less of earthly lore ; She climbed by a path so narrow, Such wearisome burdens bore! And she came with heart a-trembling To the warden at heaven's door, And said, 'There were hearts of heroes,' She said, 'There were hands of might, I had only my little children, That call to me day and night, I could ouly soothe their sorrows, Their childish hearts make light.' And she bowed her head in silence, And she hid her face in shame, When out from a blaze of glory, A form majestic came, And sweeter than all heaven's music, Lo, Christ did call her name !
