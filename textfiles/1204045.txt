QUEER BREAD MATERIALS Earth bread is made from a white earth in Upper Lusatia, formerly a part of Germany, but now under the rule of Prussia, and the poor of that region use this bread in times of scarcity. The earth is dug from a hill where saltpetre was once manufactured. When laid in the sun until heated it cracks, and globules like meal exude from it. It is supposed that the saltpeter or soda in this earth gives it lightness. Something similar to it is f'ouud in Catalonia and is also used for bread. It is affirmed that in cases of extreme need many have lived on this bread for weeks without experiencing any injury. Soft stones were ground and made into bread in the late famine in India, to prolong, if possible, the lives of that striken people. Fish bread is still used in Iceland, Lapland, CrimTartary, and other places far North. The fish is first dried, then beaten to a fine powder; and sometimes the inner bark of some of the trees of that region is mixed with it, and then wet and made into bread and cakes. Moss-bread is manufactured in Iceland from the reindeer moss, which toward the month of September, becomes soft, tender and damp, with a taste like wheat bran. This moss contains a large quantity of starch, and the Icelanders gather it in the latter part of the summer season, thoroughly dry it, then grind it into meal; and bread, gruels and pottages are made with it. The want of better grain frequently compels the poor Icelanders to bake a kind of bread from the seeds of the sand-reed, which, on their shores, are merely eaten by the birds of passage.â€”Food and Health.
