My Shaker Faith BY ANDREW BARRETT What thanks and praise to God belong, Who gave to me this precious faith; It is an anchor, firm and strong. The best estate a Shaker hath. Thanks be to God for holy faith, That bears me through all trials sore, And like a light in shades of night, A stay when angry billows roar. When trials weigh my spirit down, And troubles like the tempests beat, Faith is my guide, and points the way— Directing sure my erring feet. It leads my bark through calms and storms, And like a skillful pilot, too, It proves to me of greatest worthFaith is the guide I will pursue. Faith is my armour and my shield— A heavenly weapon, bright and sure; It makes my greatest foes to yield, And gives me courage to endure. Faith is the holy gospel ground, Where heavenly beauties ever show; Where plants of purity abound, And innocence will thrive and grow. Lord, may this living faith increase— Grow daily stronger in my soul; It is the guide that leads me o'er All dangerous rocks, each tempting shoal. It is the compass that directs The soul to heaven's port above; To dwell with those who live in truth, And bonds of everlasting love.
