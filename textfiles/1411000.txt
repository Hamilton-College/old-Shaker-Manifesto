NON-RESISTANCE. WILLIAM LEONARD. When the demand from the Government, called upon the States to draft hundreds of thousands, it found the Shakers with a faith that neither allowed us to tight, to serve in hospitals, or to pay for substitutes. To enter the army was to renounce our faith in Christ. To serve with the wounded, was to restore the soldier 10 the use of the rifle and the sword. To pay for substitutes was to employ another to do the work of human butchery for us. We hesitated not a moment, but determined to take a firm stand upon the glad tidings, sung by angels at the birth of Jesus : ' Peace on earth and good will to men.' We had long ago, in the days of peace surveyed the whole field, counted the cost, and were prepared to stand by our faith and meet the consequences. We were well aware that we would appear before men as. craven and cowardly, as selfish and miserly, and as reapers of the spoils purchased by the blood of patriots, returning no equivalent, To men of spirit among' us, it looked at times fearful; but we determined tostand true. Pretenders left us to enter the army, this they were at liberty to&gt; do. But there were among us, Godfearing young men, who took a straight course, and one by one they were numbered among the drafted. One young* man was summoned from the Society at Shirley, was examined and accepted. He returned home determined to remain there and to place his whole trust in God. He prayed fervently, was sorrowful at his prospect, and continued thus till an officer took him from the Village. When forced away almost heart-broken, he more than ever determined to stand on the power of non-resistance and place his whole trust in Heaven. The first night he was placed in prison with deserters, and in irons. Their curses upon the government, their ruffian-like conduct, and their horrid oaths, so shocked him, and contrasted so fearfully with his own Grod-fearing people at his quiet home, that it seemed to him like dropping from heaven into the very hells of perdition. He would then have considered it a favor to have faced death before the morning light. On the island he could not be persuaded or threatened into a course to make him take his first degrees in the drill of a soldier, and was of course kept in confinement. Finally, one of the officers designing to ayouse his fears, threatened to have him shot, if he did not comply. He entirely mistook his man; he had lived a life which had wholly disarmed death of its terrors ; and lie meekly replied, ''I would consider it a great favor if you would shoot me, for I had far rather be shot than to be placed in my present condition. ' In'all this they could feel no Avillfuluess or rebellion. They saw so clearly that it was the effect of acting from principle, that they liberated him, and assigned him the duty of a waiter. He enlisted the sympathies of every one who knew his case. They admitted his friends to visit him, and although he had passed one surgical examination, they favored him with another. Last of all they released him on furlough, sent him home, and never recalled him. Who doubts the interposition of kind heaven in the case of this trial of faith, in this servant of the Lord ? Scarcely a society of our number, but what met with similar trials ; but we had a God-fearing President, and others of like spirit, at the helm of state who knew that the sincere children of God had been the salvation of nations ever since the world began. The draft extending to all was right. But the officials listened to rea.son why we could neither fight, or voluntarily pay an equivalent, gave indefinite furloughs to all such, and sent them out of the service. This was equally as right. And was not God's protection to be seen in this likewise ? In Kentucky, a village of Shakers may be found at South Union, a few miles from Bowling-green, where for a season, the rebel army lay. They Avere in want of everything, and the brethren had much to supply their wants. The leading members had strong reasons to fear their raids for plunder. They knew that they had planned such robberies, and were distressed at their prospect of danger. They earnestly looked to Heaven for a protector, and one was raised up from a quarter unexpected: the notorious Morgan,ï¿½the Commander at that place. He learned all that was intended, and promptly stepped forward to the rescue. He issued immediate orders, strictly forbidding any such proceedings. He informed his legions that he had long known the Shakers, that they were harmless and unoffending, that they took no part with ei her side, injured no man, and had no desire so to do, and none under his command should injure them in any way. His strong iron will and unquestionable power shielded them, and they were thankful to heaven for it. They viewed him as one that Clod raised up to help them in the day of trouble, and so do we. Rebel though he was, this will be held in grateful remembrance by those he befriended. We never doubted, but gratefully acknowledged that we shared largely in the civil blessings secured to this nation, by the noble heroes, patriots and martyrs who fought and fell in putting down this bloody rebellion. And however it may appear to men who do not recognize the '' wisdom from above' or the higher law, we never doubted that we could do more good for this cause by obeying the word of God to us than iu any other condition in which we could be placed. God would have saved even Sodom, if five comparatively righteous souls could have been found in that wicked city. This nation suffered to put down treason, on the worldy political plane, while the Church, non-resistants, often suffered to obey their convictions and hold their standing on the plane above. This patriotic and Christian struggle, beautifully blended to uproot treason, and restore peace and prosperity to the land. As with others, that war greatly enlarged our expenses, doubled our taxes, and entailed on us our part of the debt of this nation. If it had been greater, we would have scorned to complain. If the authorities had attached property to pay for substitutes, we would have sub-, mitted to it patiently. In the days of the old Revolution, one of the Quaker lathers, who lived in Valley-forge, met] the Commander-inChief when the army was in sore distress, and kindly said, 'Friend George, my religion . utterly forbids me, to use carnal weapons ; but it requires me to feed the hungry, and cloth the naked, as far as I am able. Thee and thy officers, to the extent of my means, may dine at my table ; and I will do what I can for thy soldiers. ' It was kindly accepted. This was the right spirit. We do not wish to boast of kind deeds, but present a few cases in connection with this to show that the man of peace should be liberal even in extreme cases. Our Societies gave liberally to the sanitary cause and to the freed men. We shared with the soldiers in hospitals luxuries, provisions and money. In our Western Societies, especially in Kentucky, they helped feed with a liberal hand, the armies of the North. In South Union, a great grain-growing section, they dealt out large stores of provisions to hungry troops, and submitted to some demands for horses, wagons &amp;c. with as much good nature as any could have done. At the Society of Pleasant Hill, in Kentucky, they witnessed the strife of conflict, cared for the wounded of both parties left on their ground, fed bands of soldiers, and one morning, prepared and dealt out breakfast to 1200 cavalry men, and fed their horses. Boasting of such deeds is far from my intention, I simply present them to show what the non-resistant man may do and stand upright. To close, allow me to say that a Shaker Village is the best peace society in existence. Harvard, Mass.
