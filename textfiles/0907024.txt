I am really disappointed in The Shaker Manifesto... ' I am really disappointed in The Shaker Manifesto. It is a better paper than I had ever expected to see ! I like the June No. very well. Some numbers back, and I believe the March JSrO. particularly, I thought to be the Banker No. ; but they are all getting to be Banner Numbers. Pleased! I am very much pleased with its course. I am fully persuaded now, that it will do the work whereunto it is called.' Elder H. L. Eads
