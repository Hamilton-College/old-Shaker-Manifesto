Not That Kind of a Ticket: 'Take one, ' said a philanthropic looking man to a youth on a Fulton ferry boat as he tendered him a ticket on which was printed, 'Ho! every one that thirsteth. ' ' Thanks, awfully, but I don't drink, ' returned the youth. ' Why, this is a scriptural sentence you should ponder over, young man, ' said the patriarch in an aggrieved tone. 'Is that so? Well, I thought it was a ticket for beer, ' retorted the worldly minded youth.
