WHAT A FAULT-FINDER IS GOOD FOR. [Contributed by Lucy A. Miller.] In the village of- - - - - -lived a man who was a bold leader of all opposition to religion, and always ready to publish abroad the inconsistencies or short-comings of any who were professors of religion. After a time he concluded to remove from the place to a distant part of the country, and meeting the leading minister of the village one day, after the usual salutations, he said, 'Well, I suppose you know that I am going to leave town soon, and you will probably be very glad of it.' 'Glad of it? Why no,' said the minister, 'you are one of our most useful men, and I shall hardly know how to spare you.' Taken aback by such an unexpected reply, the other immediately asked, 'How is that? What do you mean by saying I am useful, or that you will miss me when I am gone?' 'Because,' said the minister, 'not one of our sheep can get foot out of the fold but you bark from one end of the town to the other, and so show yourself one of the most useful watch-dogs that I ever knew. I don't know where we shall find any one that can supply your place.' The rebuke struck home, and the fault-finder, with a crestfallen look, went on his way.
