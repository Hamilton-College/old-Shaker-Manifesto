Letter Box Sister Asenath: My age is fourteen and a half years... Shaker Village, N. H. Mar. 1884. Sister Asenath ;ï¿½My age is fourteen and a half years. I live with Br. Joseph Woods in the Church family of Shakers. I attended school the past Winter and was in the first class in everything. My studies are Arithmetic, Reading, Physiology, Geography, Grammar and Drawing, I like them all very much. Bertie and I am in Fractions and shall soon be in Percentage, we expect to go through decimal fractions. I have had good lessons so far and shall try and continue them good. Last Summer the boys each had a small piece of ground to plant and take care of. I planted on my piece, some corn, melons, beets, turnips and radishes ; but the melons did not do very well so I destroyed them and planted some buckwheat in their place; but I planted it too late so it did not come to anything; my corn was very good, I planted about a pint and got about four bushels. The kinds of work I like to do best are carpentering, tinkering, and pipe-fitting. I feel very grateful to you for the good care you take of my clothes and also for your teaching me to write well. I am glad to have some one to take such good care of me, for I have not had it for a good while before I came here. I will try and take good care of my clothes and not give you unnecessary trouble. I am progressing nicely in my music and can read in any key, and I will here say that I am very thankful to my teachers for persevering with me as I hope to repay them some day by making a good man.
