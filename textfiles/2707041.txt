'A silly school-boy was one day boasting how many rich and noble relations he had;�and having exhausted his topics he turned with an important air and askt one of his school-fellows,� Are there any lords in your family. Yes, said the little fellow, there is one at least, for I have often heard my mother say that the Lord Jet,us Christ is our elder brother.' The boy was right; and as he grew up it was his privilege to know more of this elder brother and to tell the perishing multitudes the tidings of his grace. Blessed are they who have our Lord in the family, and who know him as their elder Brother and their everlasting Friend.' Publisht by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
