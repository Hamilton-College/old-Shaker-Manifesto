Books and Papers. Popular Monthly Many important articles and striking stories have been secured by Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly for publication during the coming year, among them an illustrated paper on 'The King's Daughters and Sons,' by Louise Seymour Houghton, one of the leading spirits of that great order. The Ladies' Home Journal Mrs. Borer's magazine, 'Household News,' has been absorbed by The Ladies' Home Journal in order to make it possible for Mrs. Borer to form an exclusive editorial connection with the latter magazine. All of Mrs. Borer's literary work will hereafter appear exclusively in the Journal, of whose domestic department she will have entire charge. Several pages of their agazine will be given her each month, and in these she will begin by giving a new series of simple cooking lessons to be followed by domestic lessons treating separately the care and arrangement of each room in a house. The Outlook The August number of The Outlook will be its annual Educational Number. It will contain several features of special interest to teachers and students. One of these will be an illustrated paper by Professor Todd, of Amherst College, on modern methods of astronomical work, with special reference to the trip made by Professor Todd and his party to Japan for the purpose of observing the last eclipse of the sun. Bodolf Ltinciani, the famous archaeologist, has written for The Outlook a peculiarly interesting.article on Modern Borne, which will be profusely and beautifully illustrated furnisht by the author.

'A silly school-boy was one day boasting how many rich and noble relations he had;�and having exhausted his topics he turned with an important air and askt one of his school-fellows,� Are there any lords in your family. Yes, said the little fellow, there is one at least, for I have often heard my mother say that the Lord Jet,us Christ is our elder brother.' The boy was right; and as he grew up it was his privilege to know more of this elder brother and to tell the perishing multitudes the tidings of his grace. Blessed are they who have our Lord in the family, and who know him as their elder Brother and their everlasting Friend.' Publisht by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
