Lifeless Preaching The following is from the N. Y. Herald: A preacher who has often suspected himself of being one of the prosy ones desires to thank the Herald for its late protest against long and lifeless sermons. Such efforts are as tiresome to the preacher as they are to the people; but custom being what it is, it is very probable that if any minister were to change his pulpit manner, and say in plain, unadorned style whatever might seem to him appropriate to the needs of his congregation some worthy parishioners would find fault â€¢with him for not doing as his predecessors have done from time immemorial. Public opinion alone can change the prevalent pulpit manner for one that has more life and Usefulness, and as public opinion cannot in any other way be so easily influenced as through the press, let the Herald and other papers agitate the subject until sermons become as pointed as editorials.
