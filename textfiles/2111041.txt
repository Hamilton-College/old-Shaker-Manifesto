Books and Papers. BEN BUTLER'S GRANDMOTHER. A HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE ARISTOCRACY. I was literally adopted by my grandmother, my grandfather having died several years before. She was a very remarkable looking woman, wliostood about five feet eleven inches in her stockings. She was then in the neighborhood of eighty years old, and walked with a stick, yet she was as erect as ever. She also taught me fully to understand her politics, which, so far as I could understand them, were that there ought not to be any kings, princes, barons, nobles, or knights. She never said anything against aristocrats, and my memory of her now is that if ever there was a high-priestess of the aristocracy, she was one, and especially did she dilate upon the fact that herfamily,theCilleys, was the best in the state. Can any one doubt where I learned my political status: democratic politics in government and personal aristocracy?ï¿½From 'Benjamin Butler's Boyhood,' by Himself, in New England Magazine for October.

The portrait of the new Premier of Canada in the Phrenological Journal and Science of Health is a realizing feature of the October number, and the account of him shows a fitting memoir to the late Sir John McDonald. Supply and Demand contains truths that just now appear to be fermenting in some quarters. Two notable Americans are set off entertaining in Character and attitude. Dr. Elisha Bartlett is written up among the distinguished phrenological lecturers of fifty yrs. ago, while Alice Fletcher, the ethnologist, receives the attention she deserves from the editor. Prize Essay No. 4 is one of the most interesting parts of the October list, and written by a man of more than average capacity. So, too, Some Practical Thoughts on the Discrimination of Character come from a professional hand, and are instructive. In Child Culture, Hetty Dean is, as usual, bright and suggestive, and The Girl with One Talent gives much encouragement to the homely ones. Science of Health has more than its ordinary proportion of good, 'meaty' reading that comes right into our life conduct.
