THE PHRENOLOGICAL. The portrait of the new Premier of Canada in the Phrenological Journal and Science of Health is a realizing feature of the October number, and the account of him shows a fitting memoir to the late Sir John McDonald. Supply and Demand contains truths that just now appear to be fermenting in some quarters. Two notable Americans are set off entertaining in Character and attitude. Dr. Elisha Bartlett is written up among the distinguished phrenological lecturers of fifty yrs. ago, while Alice Fletcher, the ethnologist, receives the attention she deserves from the editor. Prize Essay No. 4 is one of the most interesting parts of the October list, and written by a man of more than average capacity. So, too, Some Practical Thoughts on the Discrimination of Character come from a professional hand, and are instructive. In Child Culture, Hetty Dean is, as usual, bright and suggestive, and The Girl with One Talent gives much encouragement to the homely ones. Science of Health has more than its ordinary proportion of good, 'meaty' reading that comes right into our life conduct. Something for everybody in this number, while the whole contents cannot be discounted. Price, 15c, or $1.50 a year. A specia.1 Trial Trip offer is made of three months for 25c.
