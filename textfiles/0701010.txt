Prayer True prayer is not the words that glide forth from the oily tongue; tis not the narrow wish that the bounds the worthy supplicant's dome. Tis not the bended knee' of fear, crouched 'neath Jehovah's frown, !;. , Nor' yet the scalding, bitter tear, remorse ' pleads with renown. We see a hungering, sincere soul, bowed ;neath its Maker's shrine, ,.Its 'soul-throb breathings, uttering, 'O, not '. my will, but thine.' , it's all a consecrated gift to God, with utmost care, .:And'• Heaven, in accents clear, proclaims, .•. this, .mortals, this is prayer. 2 A.., wrestling earnestness of soul, no epithet can trace; . a struggling, running for the goal, of God's ....... assisting grace; Deep; ,deeper than the realms of thought, more real than its blare, . And full dependence on its God, this, mortals, this is prayer . . Abstracted from the world's turmoil, and '., .shielded from its gaze, And emptied of its every spoil, the soul must ' be :who prays' . . And filled with love to every soul, recipient of God's care,' Read'y to glve to God the whole. this is 'the '; 'Work of prayer. 3 . But, prayer is more; 'tis Heaven's decree; a power the lame to heal, The sick restore; the bond to free; to blind the light reveal ...•. ' The power to build on-earth a heaven, and . store it with God's grace, . ;:And permeate it with a leaven to raise the ,~ ;. human race, To mansions of the higher life where shame, nor sin, nor wrong, .! •. ; -; .Are ne'er presented in the strife, which to its saints belong. . .' ,' The race is run from faith, to works of peace, .. ' And love, and joy Their prayers uplift their working souls, to heaven without alloy
