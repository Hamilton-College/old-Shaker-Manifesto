JUDGE NOT. Belle Rullhausen. 'Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice, take each man's censure; but reserve thy judgment.' The happiness of life would be greatly augmented if persons were more careful to reserve their judgment, especially in regard to the faults of others. God alone is able to judge the heart righteously and discern the motives which lie in the soul; but far too often do we harshly and coldly judge an innocent brother or sister from external appearances, forgetting that virtue is sometimes clothed in the coarsest raiment. Too frequently is it the case, that those who have wandered from God, and endeavored to retrace their steps, have encountered so much scorn, censure and unkind judgment, with few to extend the gentle hand of pity, that they sink down in discouragement, thinking that a good name once lost can never be regained. Just here a maxim written by Shakespeare occurs to my mind. 'He who steals my purse, steals trash, But he who filches from me my good name, Robs me of that which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed.' How true it is when any one is robbed of his good name, or in other words, when his true worth is depreciated and he becomes a victim to the false judgment of others, he is made to appear poor in the eyes of mortals, but God who searches the heart, sees us as we really are. If we recognized the divine and good in the hearts of others instead of the failings, so common to humanity, we should be following the Christ, who gave to the down-trodden and oppressed words of tenderness and love. Many are so sensitive to criticism and unkind remarks that we can not be too charitable in our judgment. New Lebanon, N. Y.
