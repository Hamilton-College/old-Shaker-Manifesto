WORDS [Contributed by Harriet Shepard.] Words are very important things. They are but breath, and yet what deep furrows of joy or sorrow do they plow in the human heart! How do harsh words rend the feelings and fill the eyes with tears! How do approving and kind words thrill like music, and often influence a whole life. Words have either hurried individuals to vice, or bound them to virtue. As well might we sport with fire brands as be careless and inaccurate in the use of words. Form in early life the habit of severe accuracy in the use of language- -words planned and chiseled by the law of truth. See that they express what you mean; the slightest voluntary deviation is a lie, and every lie dishonors and begrimes and bemires the soul. Selected.
