SYSTEM. Watson Andrews. Webster defines system, as 'si. complete whole of objects related by some common law, principle or end; a complete exhibition of essential principles or facts arranged in a rational dependence or cohesion; an assemblage of objects arrange! in regular subordination, or after some distinct method, usually, logical or scientific; a regular union of principles or parts forming one entire whole.' And who can study our system of orders, and notice its perfect adaptation to the objects to which they are applied, and not see the exact correspondence with the above definitions. Or observe the lots of care and gener al membership,�Ministry, Elders, Trustees, Deacons, Teachers, Brethren, Sisters and Children,�and note how perfectly these by-laws and orders meet the requirements of every day life; and not realize that neglect or disregard of these orders by even one individual of a community, must unavoidably produce inharmony, and to that extent, disintegration. The four cardinal principles underlying our church relation, as we all know, are the following ; virgin purity of life, community of interest, parental control, and filial respect. These are, it may with propriety be said, the four corner stones upon which our gospel temple rests. Does any one suppose that one of the corner stones or supporting pillars of a building can be taken out and the building stand as secure as before? Or that any one of these foundational principles can be ignored and yet our Zion home be secure ? Let us see. First, without virgin purity of life, we should be obliged either to adopt the common practice of the world, and marry, which would inevitably bring us into the common condition of the world ; 'or do worse ;-'-'� and this would bring our homes to-sure1 and swift destruction, and our name to the annals of infamy. Second, without community of intei'est, our institution would contain all those elements of discord which result from diversity of interests, which are legion, and which render community life impossible ; and all life inharmonious, and in that degree, unhappy. Third, without an adequate controling influence, a community of any name or nature, and no matter for what purpose instituted, anarchy and confusion must inevitably prevail, and speedy dissolution follow. Fourth, and equally as important as adequate control, is due respect. Harmoijy, and hence success in community life, as has been proven over and over many times, is impossible without a systematic code of by-laws and orders corresponding to the underlyingprinciples of the institution; and of course, strict obedience to those laws. This being the case, and such a code of orders having been found indispensable in the formation, and for the protection of the church, when under the influence and in the immediate presence of the leaders and founders of the gospel, and the Holy Spirit by which they were inspired; is it reasonable to suppose that this spirit can be kept, union maintained and temporal 252 THE MANIFESTO. interests secured in any other way, or by any other means than those to which we owe our Zion homes to-day? 1 Believe it not! The demon of license and disorder, under the guise of liberty, is abroad in the earth; and anarchy and confusion is the result. And to the extent that system is ignored, and order disregarded, anarchy and confusion will prevail in Zion. Our gospel system is that introduced by the 'Comforter, the Holy Spirit,' on the day of Pentecost; and our government that of the heavens, viz., Parental, and our duty, that of children. Only in the degree that we 'become as little children,' can we create a heaven here or hope for one hereafter. Union Village, Ohio.
