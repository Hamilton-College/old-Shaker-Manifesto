THE LABOR MOVEMENT IN AMERICA, by R. T. Eley, Ph. D. F. W. EVANS. An extraordinary book this. J can safely recommend it to our people. No family can afford to be without a copy. The origin of the present unsatisfactory private property system in land; the long struggle between productive industry and unproductive capital�the employe and the employer�through many generations, is given in a good spirit and after a wise method. The author abjures war and all destructive contention, while he advocates a peaceful re-organization by means of universal equal education, in place of the present system unequal class education, which teaches neither morality, hygiene, nor industry. Upon the basis of the common inheritance and possession of the common and necessary elements of existence�laud, air, and water�he wrould reconstruct Government, as the machine of the sovereign people. Cummunistic and co-operative associations, including a very full, friendly and liberal notice of Shaker Communion, occupies a large space in the book. It shows that might not right, was the origin of private property in land. That the land being held, in unlimited quantities by the minority, the majority became either their chattels or their wages slaves. As chattel slaves they had food, lodging, clothing and work. As wages slaves, they had neither. They are beggars. As hirelings, they compete with each other in begging a privilege to labor upon the land, or iu the factory. As tenants, they beg for a house to live in ; as paupers, as a last resort, they beg for a temporary home iu a poor house ; whilst as tramps, they beg for everything, and steal when opportunity offers. As landless poor, in crowded tenements, they die by the thousand. In some districts at the rate of ninety in one hundred, before they are five years of age. They die for want of work, land, room to live in, air to breathe, proper care and food to eat. They have not the raw material to spend their productive labor upon. Iu America, the majority have the power iu their own hands to establish society upon the basis of natural rights. God has given the earth to all human beings from which, by their labor they can derive their subsistence. All have equal rights to the life elements�they being the raw material. Hitherto, by superior and class education, the few have monopolized the land and made slaves of the majority. And by universal and equal education the laborers will monopolize the land and make slaves of the minority, the non-producers and they will become beggars. This condition is already attained by Believers. Why may it not be reached by the rest of mankind? Published by Thomas B. Crowell &amp; Co. No. 13 Astor Place, New York.
