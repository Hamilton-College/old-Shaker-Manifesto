Deliver me O Lord from the evil man. 140 : 1 Deliver me O Lord from mine enemies. 143 : 1. | will abide in thy tabernacle forever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. 61: 4. Every day will I bless thee : and I will praise thy name forever and ever. 145 : 2. Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him. 34: 4. Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. 139 : 10. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise. 100: 4. Qod is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 46: 1. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
