Juvenile. STRIKING CHILDREN It is not likely this article will ever meet the eyes of those for whom it is intended. The ones who really need advice are usually those who can not or will not read it. But in the hope of arresting even one angry hand which might otherwise do untold damage by a single ill-aimed blow, these lines are written. ' A box on the ear,' has come to be so common an expression that we smile when it occurs in a racy narrative; but it should never be smiled at. A box on the ear may cause partial, or even total deafness for life; it may cause internal injuries, which may result in stupefying, or even entirely destroying the intellect; it may cause illnessï¿½even death. Should an act freighted with such tremendous possibilities ever be lightly spoken of? And what sort of a soul can the man or woman possess, who, knowing the results that may follow the act, can recklessly give a child a box on the ear? A blow on any part of the head may, and most likely will, be followed by grave consequences. A blow upon the chest, the stomach, the spine, is almost equally dangerous. In fact, there are only one or two places upon the human body which may be struck with comparative safety; and, when it seems necessary that corporal punishment should be administered to a child, it should be administered in those places. The teachings of scripture and commo ; sense seem to point to the occasional necessity of corporal punishment. It should never be bestowed in anger, however; never without the most careful deliberation, and as a last resort. If a child has been trained from early infancy to habits of obedience, there will rarely, if ever, be found a necessity for whipping, after it has attained the age of five or six years. Other punishments, equally effective, can and should be devised for older children. In any case, never strike a child at random in a moment of impatience. The remark which is often made, that bright, precocious babies often develop into the most commonplace men and women, may perhaps be accounted for in another way than that fond parents overestimated their brightness in infancy. Blows, kicks, and violent shaking must have their effect upon the tender brain and nerve of childhood. It would not necessarily require much of such treatment to reduce an originally brilliant intellect to a condition little short of idiocy. Congregationalist. An Acrostic from Psalms.
