A PRISONER'S STUDY A prisoner condemned to confinement for life, after a careful study of the Scriptures, found them to contain 3,586,489 letters. 773,692 words, 31,173 verses, 1,183 chapters, and 66 books. The word 'and' occurs 46,277 times; the word Lord 1.855 times : the word reverend THE MANIFESTO. 23 only once, which is in the 9th verse of 111th Psalm. The middle is the 8th verse of the 118th Psalm. The 21st verse of the Gth chapter of Ezra contains all the letters of the alphabet with the exception of the letter J. The finest chapter to read is the 26th chapter of Acts of the Apostles ; the 19th chapter II Kings, and the 32d of Isaiah, are alike. The longest verse is the 9th verse in the eighth chapter of Esther. The shortest is the 35th of the 11th chapter of St. John. The 8th, 15th, 21st, and 31st verses of the 107th Psalm are the same. All the verses of the 136th Psalm end alike. There are no words or names of more than six syllables. The 117th Psalm is the middle and shortest chapter in the Bible. It must have taken him many years of patient, careful study to gather all these facts. We hope in such close perusal the Spirit revealed a deeper lesson to his heart and made him fully acquainted with its precious precepts. M. J. S. in the Christian Union
