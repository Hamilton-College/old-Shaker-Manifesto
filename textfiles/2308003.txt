SECOND APPEARING OF CHRIST. Watson Andrews. Twelve reasons for believing in the second appearing of Christ as having been accomplished according to prophecy, and in the line of the female. 1. There is a universe of natural life originating with Divine Power in obedience to natural law ; and there is a universe of spiritual life originating with Divine Power in obedience to spiritual law. 2. The human Ego, the 'living soul,' is this Divine Power, Deity, manifest in humanity, and subject to natural law. 3. This Deity, then, is original humanity, in infinity, and subject to spiritual law. 4. Such as original humanity was, then, the Deity is, in an infinitely superior degree. 5. Humanity is not composed of one, but two beings, distinct in nature and attributes: viz. male and female. THE MANIFESTO. 185 6. The Deity, then, is not composed of one, but two beings, distinct in nature and attributes, viz. male and female. 7. One being, distinct in nature and attributes from another, can not administer the nature and attributes of the other. 8. Two beings of distinct natures and attributes in united effort, can minister the nature and attributes of both, in accord with the law governing the case. 9. Hence there is required the united effort of male and female in order to produce their 'image and likeness.' 10. Jesus, the Christ declared his followers must be born again. That no man could enter the kingdom of heaven without passing through this new birth. 11. Jesus, the man, was the subject of the first, the natural birth. 12. Jesus, the Christ, was the subject of the second, the spiritual birth. CONCLUSION. As the natural man and woman are subjects of the natural�old�birth, through the united instrumentality of natural man and woman in conformity to the natural laws of generation; so the spiritual man and woman must be the subjects of the spiritual new birth, through the united instrumentality of spiritual man and woman, in conformity to the spiritual laws of regeneration. Hence, as we believe Jesus of Nazareth to be the anointed Savior in the male line, because his advent was foretold by ancient prophets and typified ' by numerous symbolic representations ; and because he was recognized by a Grod-fearing man, John the Baptist; but principally because of the fruits he brought forth the world-wide results of his mission, as also by the fierce opposition and cruel persecution he suffered at the hands of the popular religionists of the times ; so we believe Ann Lee, of Manchester, England, to bs the anointed Savior in the female line ; not only because a second advent was predicted and the only logical reason for such an event, so far as we can see, was the quickening into spiritual life the female nature, in humanity, as the male had been in the first advent; but for all the above reasons as well: viz. by prophecy, by typical representation ; by being recognized by the godly inspired of the times, who were waiting and watching for his second coming, and by the like opposition and persecutions by the popular professors of religion of the most advanced civilization of the time; but principally because of the divine light and power manifest in her life and testimony and the most beneficent results of her mission. The symbolic representations alluded to above, relating to the first and second advents of the divine spirit in the work of human redemption, point to two correspondent powers, united to accomplish the same purpose, being the united influence of male and female in the work of redemption. ~ Such are the Cherubims, (see Ex. xxxvii., 7.) whose wings covered the mercy-seat above the ark ; the two tables of the covenant; the two silver trumpets ; the two olive trees ; the two olive branches; the two golden pipes through which the two olive branches 186 THE MANIFESTO. emptied the golden oil out of themselves ; the two Anointed Ones, and many others which might be mentioned in God's typical work. The two cherubims placed over the ark that contained the two tables of the covenant, were very remarkable types of the two Anointed Ones, the male and the female, who are united in the work of redemption, and the covenant of peace is between them both. Over the ark was placed the mercy-seat of pure gold, and the two cherubims of gold were placed on the ends of the mercy-seat, and their wings were extended on high, so that they covered the mercy-seat with their wings ; and their faces looked toward each other and toward the mercy-seat. These figures are so plain and obvious, that it seems as though they could not be misunderstood, so strikingly representative are they of the true order of the work of God through the united agency of the male and female in Christ. Between the two cherubims was the mercy-seat from whence the law of God was delivered, which not only pointed out two gospel dispensations, but also showed, in a figure, that the merciful display of God's grace, in the last dispensation, would proceed from between the Two. All who have received this last manifestation of divine light and power, through the Two, have found it a saving faith, affording them complete victory over the animal nature, and fully satisfying their every need.
