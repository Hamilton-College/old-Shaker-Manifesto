ONION AS A NERVINE Onions are almost the best nervine known. No medicine is so useful in cases of nervous prostration, and there is nothing else that will so quickly relieve and tone up a worn out system- Onions are useful in all cases of coughs, colds and influenza; in consumption, insomnia, hydrophobia, scurvy, gravel, kidney and liver complaints. Eaten every other day they soon have a clearing and whitening effect upon the complexion. N. Y. Med. Times.
