Stability of Principles BY ALONZO HOLLISTER Mankind are continually tossing like the waters of a troubled sea, forsaking present opinions, fashions or improvements for something they fancy is better, or to return after a season to the same again, because no solid foundation of happiness is attained. Pleasure is oft the impelling motive, and this is sought in sensual indulgences, or in ease, riches, or in novelty and change, none of which afford happiness ; for abiding happiness is the result of growth, and stability in the principles of virtue and goodness ; and its proper nourishment can only be obtained by self-denial. Young minds partake very largely of this changing element; and the more so as they receive their mental pabulum from the fictitious, passionate and trashy literature of the day. If they ever become reliable and substantial members of society, it is necessary that they should grow conservative ; not shut up in the unreasoning elements of passion and will, but their feelings must be weaned from those external and changing elements of superficial excitement, and become fixed to the principles of understanding and habits of thought. The principles of eternal life revealed in Christ, are unchangeable, remaining the same to every individual that receives them, now and ages hence. For instance, the doctrines of the New Testament, which lie at the founda- tion of our faith, and which are just as real and important to believers, in this day, as they were to those who first taught them, more than 1800 years ago; the revelation upon which we claim to be founded being a new revelation, not of essentially different truths, but of the same truths, by the same spirit, to every soul that receives that Spirit; and a revelation of further truths in the same line, as the increase and growth of souls in these, and the general progress of the work of God demands them. One can no more neglect any of these and be a disciple of Christ, than he can skip over the four fundamental rules of arithmetic and become a mathematician; or than he can neglect the letters of the alphabet and be a good philologist. Those whose motives and conduct are guided and governed by these principles will exhibit a uniform and stable character, in all the varied conditions and carcumstance of life—a character which they have not naturally in them, though the natural disposition of some will approach nearer it than others—but a character that is formed in them by the agency of the Holy Spirit, ministered by the gospel, in obedience to its principles ; a character that will overcome and eventually eradicate from the soul every disposition, opinion or principle that is contrary to the pure nature of God.
