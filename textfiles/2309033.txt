Beloved Elder Henry:--Each month... Milton, Oregon. July 17, 1893. Beloved Elder Henry:�Each month the Manifesto comes to me laden with heavenly manna. I trust we will never permit its monthly visitation to cease to visit each household, when it does such valuable missionary work, in sowing seeds of truth. There is a great controversy in churches as to which is the true mode of baptism, claiming that without water baptism, we are eternally lost. Paul in his epistle to the Galatians 111- T 27, says,�'For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.' This is plain, that if we 'walk even as he (Jesus) walked we are baptized with the true baptism, water being simply a sign to link the dispensation of John's baptism to Christ's baptism. W. W.
