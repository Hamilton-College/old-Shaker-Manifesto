A correspondent of New Remedies... A correspondent of New Remedies gives the following receipt for a paste for use in prescription books and labels : I dissolve half an ounce of alum in a pint of boiling water : to this I add an equal weight of flour, made smooth in a little cold water, and a few drops of oil of cloves, letting the whole come to a boil. This paste will keep months. I put it in glass, or ordinary ointment jars.
