TESTIMONY OF RICHARD TREAT. NO. 2. In about a month I made another visit, and carried my wife with me. By this time the enmity of the wicked began to show itself. The children ran out of the houses, hallowing, Shakers, Shakers, and mocking us as we passed along the road. At this time my wife confessed her sins, and set out with me in this self-denying way. I found the testimony had greatly increased since my last visit. The word of God in Mother and the Elders, was swift and'powerful beyoud expression. It was like a twoedged sword against all sin and all manner of uncleauuess. Many people continually resorted there to hear the word of God and learn the way of salvation ; and many confessed their sins and set out to take up their crosses. Mother Ann's testimony was like flames of fire to search out and bring to light the hidden works of darkness. She exposed with keen and cutting severity the deceitful craftiness of men and women, showing that all these practices proceeded from the nature of lust, the seed of the serpent; that it produced self-defilement, deceit, hypocrisy and all manner of evil communication, which tended to corrupt the mind, to darken and defile the senses, and sink the soul into the filthiness of the flesh and separate it from God. Her testimony was the most mortifying to a carnal nature that can possibly be imagined. Never since the world began, was the nature of lust so powerfully and so effectually exposed. Yet the tenderness and charity of Mother and the Elders toward poor. souls who were lost in the flesh, and honestly desired to find the way out, was as boundless as their severity against sin. While I was there four high minded and foppish young men came on a Sabbath morning, and rode to the house and hailed it, and said, 'We understand that there arc those here who have the spirit of discernment, and can tell people their sins ; and we want to have ours told. ' Mother and Elder William went out and invited them into the house ;�they refused to come in, but insisted upon having their sins told. Instantly the power of God fell upon Elder William, and he exposed their sins to them with such plainness and such power, that they hung their heads, and were ashamed even to look each other in the face, and mounted their horses and made off as fast as possible. Great numbers of people came from various parts to see them, whom they fed and lodged freely, without manifesting any lack of any thing. They would often meet the Brethren and Sisters, at the door, when they came, saying, ' Come in Brethren and Sisters, come in ; we have but little room in our house; but we have a great deal of room in our hearts. ' It was clearly evident that they felt willing to give up all their earthly substance, yea, and their own lives also, for the sake of planting the gospel in this land. This I felt as sensibly as I could feel one hand from the other. They spared not even their own lives, but gave them freely. They were accounted poor, having nothing but what tkey gained by their honest industry ; though they had taken up a lot of land which they held by lease in perpetuity from Stephen Van Rensselaer, Esq. yet it was in a wilderness state when they took it. By their industry they cleared some part of it, so as to accommodate themselves and their little family with some pasture and tillage laud. It appeared evident, however, that they could not devote what little they had to feed so many people as were continually visiting them, without suffering materially themselves. I returned home, and the Brethren in New Lebanon, taking these things into consideration, agreed to send something for their relief. Accordingly we collected nine sheep to send them, and David Darrow undertook to drive them to Watervliet: and having proceeded within about eight miles of Albany, he was pursued by some evil minded men from New Lebanon, who robbed him of the sheep, and seized his person under pretence of treasonable conduct. rJ hough the malicious conduct of these men evidently proceeded from a spirit of enmity against this new religion�the testimony of the gospel which had then just been received and embraced by so many people in New Lebanon ; yet the pretence for these rash proceedings was as follows: it had been reported that Mother Ann had come over in Burgoyne's army, and engaged in plotting against the liberty of the country. Many who opposed the testimony and rejected the cross of Christ, were willing to believe these reports, and were ready to assist in any means to overthrow the leaders of the work, and suppress the testimony. Hence, these enemies of the cross, having received information seized this occasion to vent their malignity by charging with a design of conveying his sheep to the enemy. The event showed the real object of these malicious persecutors. David Darrow, after being robbed of his sheep, was required to give bail for his appearance at Albany for trial. At the time appointed, he appeared before the commissioners in Albany, in company with Joseph Meacham and John Hockuell. They were all three committed to prison without any trial. A few days after this, Mother and the Elders were taken from their own dwelling and conducted to prison also, without any trial. Such were the measures taken by their enemies to suppress the work of God, and prevent the spread of the gospel. But the measures taken to destroy the testimony of Mother and the Elders, instead of producing that effect, was the very means of extending its power and increasing the number of Believers. The prisoners, conscious of their own innocence, and filled with the power and gifts of God, sung and praised God in the prison, that they were counted worthy to suffer persecution for righteousness' sake. This gave offence, and was the occasion of their being removed from the jail in the old City Hall, to the prison in the old fort on the hill. There they were visited by many people, who heard the testimony and confessed their sins in this prison. I visited the Elders while they were in prison. The mighty power of God which attended their singing was so extraordinary, that it really seemed to me as if the very foundation of the prison trembled. After they were released, I visited them frequently, at different places�at Watervliet, Harvard, Ashfield, Hancock and New Lebanon, and found a continual increase of the power of God. In all the many privileges I had with them, I never saw the least fault in them, neither in word nor deed. They were like angels in my view, being continually filled with the gifts aud power of God, and striving, with great fervency of spirit, to help souls to God, that they might have the law of Christ written in their inward parts, and be able to keep the gospel when they should be left without their present help. Hence they labored in. sorrow and sufferings, and spared no pains to plant and establish the gospel in this land. I visited Mother just before she left this world. She counselled me to be faithful and keep the way of God. She spoke in the spirit of prophecy and said, 'The time will come when the Church will be gathered into order, and then it will be known who are good Believers. But that is not my work ; my work is nearly done. ' I then took my leave of her. I never saw any thing in her but godliness, from the first day to the time she left this world. I know by the spirit of God that dwelleth in me, that she is the Lord's anointed�'the Bride, the Lamb's wife�in whom is no guile. ' In persecution she suffered exceedingly, and with great patience. In sorrow she exceeded any one I ever saw. Many times have I seen her on her knees, in tears, crying to God with such cries as I never before heard from any mortal. The energy of her spirit was so great, that it seemed enough to break the hardest heart and melt it into tears. Such was her labor and tribulation to plant and maintain the gospel. At other times she was filled with great joy, and would fill a whole assembly with this gift in a few minutes. Even the heavenly joy that seemed to shine in her countenance, was sufficient to cheer the heart of every beholder. Mother and the Elders never spared any pains in teaching the Believers in every good work. They often told us that if we would be faithful, we would be ' blessed in our outgoings and our incomings, in our basket, and in our store,' both in things temporal and spiritual. These promises we have found verily fulfilled, even beyond all our expectations. Elder James Whittaker, who succeeded Mother in the Ministry, was boundless in charity, as well as Mother and Elder William. He was very faithful in building up what Mother had planted ; in purging out evil, in supporting and encouraging the feeble, in strengthening the weak, and in preparing the people for that order in a church relation which was at hand. He often warned us to keep the testimony we had received from Mother, pure and unspotted. He would often say, 'We have given you the gospel;�see to it that you keep it, and make a good use of it.' He was a bright example of love and kindness, meekness and innocence : he was indeed like an angel before the people. Sometimes he would exclaim, ' O, the glory of Zion ! When you see Zion nourish and bring forth fruit, then know ye that the root is holy.' This might be sufficient evidence to the world, if they had no other. The evident prosperity of this Society, both in things spiritual and temporal, is enough to show that it is not built on a false foundation. Every malicious slander, that is published and circulated against the Society is without a cause. Now I would ask the candid reader, what more striking evidence can we have to prove that Mother Ann was really anointed of God to usher in the latter day of glory, and bring in the kingdom of righteousness and peace, and make an end of sin, than the abusive slanders and calumnies that are poured out against her and her faithful followers? For Jesus Christ said, ' If they call the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household ?' He was called ' a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners, ' and all manner of evil was spoken against him falsely. This was, and still is considered as an evidence that he was not of the world, and therefore the world hated him. Mother Ann was slandered by those who delight in slander�by those who delight to feast on the iniquities of the righteous, and who hunt for iniquity in the followers of Christ, as the raven and the vulture seek after the dead carcasses of those who fall in battle.
