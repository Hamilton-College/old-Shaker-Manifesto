Union Village, Ohio. Dear Manifesto :�The present year is the most seasonable in Ohio of any for several years for all kinds of crops�fruits� cereals�vegetables. Our wheat is all cut and is likely to be a good yield, perhaps the best for many years. We are still selling timber, but are about winding up that business. The suit against Pleasant Hill Society commenced yesterday at Frankfort Kentucky. It involves a good deal of money and if the plaintiffs succeed it will be an unspeakable disaster to Pleasant Hill. We are about to go back once more to Osage Orange hedge fences, at least on all our public roads. We have struck a Dayton O. Co. with a new method of cultivating and training by wireplashing. They have planted and plashed 1200 miles of their fence within a few months. Our school closed on the 2nd. of June having continued nine months. Ours is a co-education school, and our Board of Education allows our teacher $50. per month. Our 1500 young apple, pear, peach and plum trees are doing well and we are likely to have plenty of apples from the old orchards the present year. Here is a passage from the Bible�'Not any tree in the garden of God was like him in his beauty.' Who will hunt it up and explain it? We were just beginning to think our corn was needing rain and here it comes just in good season. We have had one good shower and more is coming. New potatoes begin to come in. Charles H. Sturr, Trustee and business manager at White Water commenced selling new potatoes three weeks ago and opened at $1.25 per bushel. And so it goes out West. O. C. H.
