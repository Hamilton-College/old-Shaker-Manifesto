CRITICISM ON THE ABOVE My Dear G. A. L. — Last night an Albany Express, containing your letter on ' Shaker Village,' in u Atlantic,' came to hand. Many thanks for such favors. Elder John Whiteley was very much pleased with it; and I was too, excepting the lack of lustre which you infer therein, and which Howells felt impressed to give us. This Society is the smallest in our Israel, yet I can point to more than a dozen, who shine with more lustre, even in the dark of these days, than any measure of jewels that could be procured! One branch of my life is devoted to the cause, that will make the true and single-hearted, even though the least, 'to shine!' Don't let us say, ' perhaps too good;' or think abouU a lack of lustre ; but rather of a burnishing up. If we do so with a will, there will be lustre enough. Permit me, to think our honored friend, Howells, did not over-estimate the brightness which rests on Shirley. And may he, when visiting Shakers, N. Y., and other societies, find you all luminous — earnestly engaged in manifesting a divine humanity, free from the earthliness of lower self-hood. Let us celebrate the 'Centennial' by a general shining forth of purity of life, and the reign of universal peace and good will — at home and abroad. Yours, Daniel, Frazer Shirley Village, May 30,18T6.
