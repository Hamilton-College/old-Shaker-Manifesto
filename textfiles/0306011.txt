CARPETS Carpets are injurious to health, so far as the lungs are concerned. They accumulate dirt, and hold it as a reservoir. Every motion of persons, things in the room, or even of the air, causes it to rise in an impalpable powder, to be seen only in the rays of sunshine that may chance to get into the room to fade the colors of the carpets. Therefore, to preserve the carpets and the accompanying furniture in their beauty, carefully exclude the light; and, to exclude the dust, keep the windows closed; and, to preserve the health of the family, let them live in other rooms, with no carpets, plenty of air, and floods of sunshine. This arrangement would keep things even between the family and friends visiting, inasmuch as they pay, for a generous hospitality, with the most precious of all coin â€” their own health.
