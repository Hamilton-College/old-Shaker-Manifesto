Editorial. ACTION Of what use is the promise of 'seed time and harvest' to the man who is so negligent of his duty as to make no use of them, or to the man who in his poverty has no seed to sow, and consequently can have no harvest to reap. Although it is ssid that the diligent man may be worthy to stand before Kings, it is said quite as emphatically that those who neglect their sowing in its proper season must be forced to beg in harvest. It may not be so agreeable to accept this form of penance, but as it is in accordance with the Divine Plan, it meets us in our own paths, and awards to us the sum of our daily needs. It was a wise provision in the economy of nature that the law of compensation should have a universal influence and through this stimulate to action the whole creation of God. From the highest type as found in man, to that which is very low in the scale of Creative energy there is to be found no change for this individual demand. The apostle so fully eudorsed the protectionary law that he did ^not hesitate to say to all his brethren, 'For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.' 2 Thes. iii., 10. Even the story of the journey through the wilderness informs us that every man was obliged to gather the manna for himself and for those of his family or suffer for the neglect. Although the foolish and impr � ident may neglect the keeping of this law and bring upon themselves the consequent sufferings, it can have no bearing upon the mind of a devoted Christian worker, otherwise than to stimulate him to renewed action, and to greater faithfulness. Temporal duties which bear so directly on our happiness or misery in this life, are often made of superlative interest and matters of personal comfort become the absorbing theme upon which the mind so fondly dwells. Even for this a reason may be rendered, and a ray of comfort afforded. Having, as we do, such a tenacity to life, which was implanted in us by the wisdom of God, we are by nature impelled to make everything consistent with our understanding of right, for prosperity and happiness while on our earthly pilgrimage. It is not strange, under this influence, that so many fail to secure the more imperishable treasures, in the heavenly home, 'where moth and rust doth not corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal.' To build up and to establish a moral or spiritual work, in the soul, a correTERMS sponding zeal and earnestness to succeed must be manifested, and the same untirino' efforts carried forward in order to secure a permanent foundation, which may not be destroyed by the corroding elements of the world. Jesus in his inimitable sermon informs us of the blessings that shall attend the pure in heart, and no less those who thirst after righteousness. Blessings which are so liberally proffered, in the goodness of God, should claim our first and our highest attention. God giveth liberally to all, 'He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.' It is for us to tell of the advantages to be derived by accepting a discipleship and by receiving into our minds the life and spiritual interest of the Savior of men. We acknowledge with all meekness the temporal blessings, in which God gives tfl us our daily bread, and in which be remembers the ' birds of the air,' and the 'lilies of the field.' With all this merciful condescension to make our earthly home one of love and joy and peace, we must also bear witness that the inspiration of the Christ, urges us to seek first the kingdom of God. And of what use would the kingdom of God be to us, or to any people, if we closed the door on entering or failed to publish the glad tidings of peace on earth; to men and women, 'good will.' Of what benefit is the 'seed time' if there is no seed to sow? or having the seed, to fold it in a napkin and hide it from sight? Could we not read the biblical story with profit? (see Matt. xxv., 14�30.) These lessons that are given to us and the experience Ave have obtained while contending for an existence on the earth, should be used to advantage in our acceptance of a spiritual life. In both we share enjoyments and disappointments, sunshine and storm. We contend with laudable zeal against every enemy to our prosperity, as we toil early and late for our earthly possessions, and we must contend as zealously against every enemy of our spiritual interests and peace of mind, if we ever expect to obtain a victory over the world. If, in the one, there is danger in delay, as the season for ploughing and the sowing of seed is passing, then it is equally true that the other demands corresponding vigorous action, if we would wish to insure a spiritual prosperity, and establish upon the earth the kingdom of God, in which shall dwell righteousness and peace.
