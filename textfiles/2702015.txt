East Canterbury, N. H. Jan. 1897. 'Peace on earth, good-will to all men.' It may be well to anticipate the good time that is coming, as that may afford us an opportunity the better to prepare for it. If the voice of prophecy is to be relied on, there is a time coming when nations shall leai n war no more. The savageness of human beings in war and the savagery of wild beasts seem quite alike in the results, and it is a wonder that after so many thousands of years so little has been learned of the loving kindness of our God. This testimony of peace on earth, which the Christ mission, publisht, should be the accepted mission of Believers, and faithfully publisht to the world. With the return of Christmas comes the renewed Christian thought of God's love to man, and to know that this has been generally observed throughout the several Communities of Believers, adds much to the pleasant remembrance of the day. By the young, especially, the yearly visit of St. Nicholas is one of great joy, and it is well for old and young to have pleasure in the anticipation. The receiving of gifts, and the cheerful entertainments may all contribute to the great sum of human enjoyment, and be the means of helping forward the beautiful mission of peace. Like our Brethren and Sisters in other Communities, East Canterbury had its program for an hour's Entertainment as follows:ï¿½ Christmas Chorus, Quartet. The Sister Years, A Child's Dream, Jesus Calling his Disciples, The Humanophone, Jacob's Ladder, The Lost Umbrella, Mariner's Song, Quartet. What we do at Home, To the Palace of the Heavenly King, The Rainbow, by seven little girls. The Ducks, by tha Quartet. The Finished Education, Joseph and his Brethren in seven scenes. Goodnight, by the Quartet. It may be that after these illustrations of spending Christmas our friends abroad may become better informed. Henry C. Blinn.
