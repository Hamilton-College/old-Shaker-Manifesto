Ed. of Manifesto:--We read in Jno. iii., 3... Pleasant Hill, Ky. Apr. 1888. Ed. of Manifesto :ï¿½We read in Jno. ill-, 3, 'Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.' How are we to be born again? Shall we know when we are born again ? Jesus explained the new birth to Nicodemus, but he did not understand it. Those only can understand, who have experienced it. 'The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou nearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell wThence it cometh, and whither it goeth ; so is every one that is born of the spirit. Jno. iii., 8. When the new and living seed of the Son of Man, the word of God, is received into the heart, it strikes root and grows, day and night, and we know not wherefrom it comes or where it goes. We see, however, that it makes a great change in our lives, and we feel the spirit of it in the heart. Our love to God grows stronger and stronger and is manifested in our thoughts and acts, with the naturalness that children love their parents. True love to God comes by the new birth. It increases as the new man grows, and makes us the children of our Heavenly Father and Mother. In this love it will be our comfort and our joy to do those things that olease God, and manifest a spirit of kindness and good-will to all our gospel relation. In this we shall remember the poor and needy who may come to us for aid and in God's name never turn them harshly from our door. God's blessing is better than covetousness, and indeed, it is better to give than to receive. Your Brother Lars Erickson.
