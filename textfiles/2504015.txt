-Alfred., Me. March, 1895. 'The stormy March has come at last,' and with it bacteria which affects the head and lungs of our people. I wonder if we should be troubled with bacteria down in Florida. The zero weather we have does not freeze them, and I do not think the torrid weather of Florida would roast them. By an article in the last Manifesto I learn they have mosquitoes, flies and fleas, there. We have flies, and a few mosquitoes but no fleas. I think we will be content awhile longer to live in Maine. The few warm days of the past week remind us that spring will soon be with us, and gladly will we welcome it, for the winter has been a cold and disagreeable one. The busy hum of the saw tells us that next year's supply of wood is beingprepared, and so the seasons come and go, taking our lives with them. Do we so live that we have no desire to recall the days that are past, that we may improve them better? If so it is well with us. We have pledged our lives to perfect consecration to God. Soul and body, time and talents, all that we have, and all that we are to his service. What a great and noble work Do we daily and hourly live to this pledge, or do we let self and self-interests govern? May we remember the great profession we make and live according thereto.
