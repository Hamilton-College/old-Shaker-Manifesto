At the time that David Crouch, jr. accepted the faith... At the time that David Crouch, jr. accepted the faith of the Believers, his wife, Sarah was opposed to his course and did not wish to change her order of life. The Believers held their meetings at a house about one half mile distant. One evening while Sarah was meditating upon this new and strange religion, and anxious to know if there was any good in it, she mentally asked for a sign, and at the same time thought it almost impossible to be granted. 'If,' said she, 'Patience Crouch and Mary Worcester, will be taken under the operations of the spirit of God and turn down to my house, I will believe.' As singular as the case may be, the meeting commenced and soon after Patience and Mary were turning, as the spirit willed. Continuing in this same exercise, they passed from the dwelling into the highway and over the road for a distance of one and one half miles to the house of David Crouch which they entered, and passing several times around Sarah, they left the place without speaking a word and returned to the meeting. Sarah accepted the evidence and with that the testimony of truth, and continued a loving and faithful Believer through time. Patience Crouch.
