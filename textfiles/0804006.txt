SUCH IS PRAYER WATSON ANDREWS Archimedes supposed, that if he only had support for his lever, he could move the planet Earth ! Whenever I have carried out the Savior's injunction, 'Pray without ceasing' literally, I have found it an Archimedean lever, which supported by his life, practically, can in- deed move 'the idorld' aside, with all its loves, and its hatreds ; all its pride, ambition and self-worship ; all envy ings, jealousies, suspicion, evil surmisings, slanders, calumnies, and strifeâ€”the le- gitimate outgrowth of the world.
