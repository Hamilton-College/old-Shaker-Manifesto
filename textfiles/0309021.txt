MY OFFERING I OFFEit a few expressions of love and affection to my Gospel friends, with whom I love to commune, whether they are in the visible form, or have passed to the inner spheres. Their influence aids me along on life's journey, and is a solace in the hour of adversity, and a guide in prosperity. The ties that are formed between earthly connections are frail and unreliable; but those which are formed by living in obedience to truth, are invincible; they are true in life, and death cannot sever them; but they will continue to grow stronger as we progress in the spirit spheres. I own a heavenly Parentage, and rejoice in the beautiful relation that I hold to them, and to my faithful brethren and sisters of the household of faith; and with them I am privileged to leave the lofty hills of pride and self-indulgence (where is continual unrest), and descend into the low valley of humility, and work in the Lord's vineyard, and cultivate the flowers of innocence and peace, while we eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and drink from the wells of salvation; and here the guiding star of purity sheds a halo of light over our pathway as we journey on. Here, dear Gospel friends, let us faithfully perform all our vows, and never be willing to sell our birthright for the vain pleasures of time, for what will they avail the soul ? Were we to climb to the eminence of worldly honor, gain wealth, and win the laurels of fame, it would only serve to bewilder and dizzy the mind; it would not insure a safe passport to a heavenly home, nor would it fit us to stem the strong current of temptation, or to ride over the billows of the sea of time, or to meet the incoming tide from the boundless deep which rolls from the shore of the eternal world. But, if we choose our inheritance with those who fear God and work righteousness, and walk humbly before Him, performing deeds of charity and love, ' binding up the wounded spirit, comforting the afflicted, giving drink to the thirsty, and washing the saints' feet;'â€” then we shall look back upon a well spent life, and feel that we have justly earned the treasures of immortal glory, and are worthy to be numbered with the jewels of Christ's kingdom ; while they who place their affections upon earthly things, and regale themselves with vain pleasures, will, in the end, find bitter disappointment.
