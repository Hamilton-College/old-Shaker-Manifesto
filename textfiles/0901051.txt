Book Table POEMS OF THE LIFE BEYOND AND WITHIN. Beautifully tinted paper. Compiled by Giles B. Stebbins. Such is the title of some very fine selections of poetry, extending back to the days of Hindoo Veda, and embodying some of the finest sentiments of well-known poets, dead and living. Great skill has been manifested by the compiler in securing the best poetic thoughts of the most respectec poets. To very many such a book would be esteemed one of the brightest gems that could grace the literary repository. In it we find no mediocre sentiments ; and surely none of low degree. The aim of the editor can clearly be seen—that it was to present a superior collection of emotions, rhythmically expressed, to displace, if possible, the inferior line of poems. Colby &amp; Rich, 9 Montgomery Place, Boston, are the publishers. It can be obtained through this office for $1.50. harper's school geographies.
