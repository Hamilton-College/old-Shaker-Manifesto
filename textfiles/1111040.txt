THE BRAHMIN The Brahmin, says Dr. Scudder, has intellectually no superior. No man can mingle much with them and not have his wits sharpened. They are the learned men of the country. The Sanscrit, ' queen of languages,' is their native tongue, and its vast literature has been their grand field of mental training. The Brahmin is almost white, wonderfully neat, begins every day in the water-tank, eats no animal food, believing that if he does he shall pass through as many transmigrations after death as there are hairs on the animal of which he eats. Physically these people are of splendid form, majestic heads, and carry themselves grandly.
