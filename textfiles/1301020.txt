Dear Florrie:—I have got all my lessons and... Ayer, Mass. Sept. 1, 1882 Dear Florrie:—I have got all my lessons and teacher says that I may write you a let. ter. We have had a splendid time with Elder Henry have we not? I wonder how many more good folks there ai'e. I have seen a few from Mt. Lebanon. I wonder if there are any more good folks besides them and those that live here. If I lived in N. H. I would go to meeting every Sabbath so as to get a card wouldn't you? Dear Florrie, what do you think of my letter, do you think I shall ever be a good letter writer? I will try and be a good girl so'that every body will love me. Dear Florrie, I must now close. Good bye, Etta Foye,—Age, 8
