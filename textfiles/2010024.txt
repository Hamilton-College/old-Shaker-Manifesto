NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. So much there is to say of home yet we would not be tedious, nor reiterate an old story. The Home Notes Corner seems like a family circle, where each instructs as well as learns. Let us hear more of the various improvements peculiar to each Society, that all may he benefited. It gives us a oneness which should mark our organizations. Not a oneness in inert laxity, but a determination to struggle for the perfect life which was the grand plan of our founders. One of the marked improvements in our Society in the past few years, is the beautifying of our homes by well-kept lawns, and neat paths about our dwellings ; and we hope, to see the boundary line of care widen each year until the mudless village path appears. The home care speaks of interest and vitality especially when it is the work of the young; and of an unselfish interest, when it is blest and aided by those whose whitened locks hint of the home 'over there.' Tidiness in the home, order in its environs, says to the passer-by 'Come;' while long rank weeds and grass out of place reminds one of the pestilent-cursed city where grass grows in the market places and the death knell urges all to pass by rapidly. Our homes are missionaries. What are they teaching of our inner life? The Census enumerator whose duty called him to our Society in June, felt that he had struck a bonanza. So many names in so brief a time, with no wasted moments over suppressed names, ages or employments. He said he had done better in our village than in any part of his district; and should henceforth refute the idea that the 'Shakers were running out.' A. J. C. Center Family. Sept. 9. We finished our grain harvest on the 8th. ult. and judging from the amount of straw gathered should think we will have a large yield of grain. The week previous had 6% inches rain so that the earth was literally soaked and still the rain came and we were almost disposed to worry about it, but to what purpose; it would neither improve the weather nor our spirits, hence the best thing to be done was to bear it patiently. We wonder what has become of the feathered songsters that used to regale us with their sweet music. Birds are to be seen but they give us no notes of joy. Perhaps the singing ones have taken themselves off to a more genial clime to cheer other of earth's pilgrims with their delightful carols. This week Monday we put up our first batch of tomatoes of the season, 20 galls. They are much later this season than common in ripening although we spent much time potting the plants, having an idea that by so doing we should get them eight or ten days earlier. Our people think highly of them cut up and served on the table raw. Elder Danit-1 and Eldress Ann left their Central home for Watervliet on the 25th. and expected to be joined by Elder Giles and Eldress Harriet during the week. Finished digging and storing potatoes. They are large; the quality is excellent and we have a large crop. Br. Alonzo Hollister returned yesterday having spent 4 weeks in visiting the Believers at Gloucester, Alfred, Canterbury, Harvard and Shirley. He conies back to us refreshed and invigorated and with renewed energy. He reports having had a delightful time and expresses heartfelt gratitude to God and to all his kind friends who have entertained him. It will long be, he says, as an oasis of happiness to dwell upon in memory. Sep. 10th. Men commence this morning laying a tile floor in the kitchen department. We hope it will prove a complete success and keep out those pestiferous rodents that inhabit our cellars and gain access to the kitchen to the annoyance of the cooks. T. Eayson. SoTitb. JFatnily-. Dear Editor; � We are great admirers of punctuality, so send Bible answers that you may know we have studied the Sept. Manifesto and like it. We have been busy at work, as usual; but one day last week, (Friday) fourteen persons from our family went down to Lake Queechey for a change. All enjoyed the day very much as it was the finest one of the season. We were rowing and singing on the lake most of the time. At twelve o'clock we sat down to a good dinner. It was prepared by Sister Mary Jane the day before. She has taken charge of over seven bushels of blackberries the past two weeks that were gathered near home. For every blessing we are thankful. There are several improvements we want to make before winter sets in, knowing full well that 'a stitch in time saves nine,' always, neither can we forget the good old maxims, 'cleanliness is next to godliness,' and 'a soft answer turneth away wrath' and 'honesty is the best policy' 'the hand of the diligent maketh rich,' and then, 'waste not want not.' Will close by saying that none are sick among us. We cannot always say this. S. A. C. Nor til Ifamily. Sept. 10. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�Your very kind letter of the 8th. inst. reminds me of blessed Mother Ann, and of the marvelous changes that have been wrought in our own order, and in the outside world. It is now one hundred and six years since Mother Ann passed to spirit life. If changes in spirit life have been effected in Mother and her companions in the same proportion they have here, what glory and beauty there must be unfolded. I think it very profitable to take a retrospective view of the progress that has been made, it gives hope and courage for the future. It is thought that moves the world, without it we are as the beasts that perish. It was thought that brought the steamengine, the spinning-jenny, the reaper and binder. It is thought that has given us the electric light and motor, the telephone and phonograph. It is thought that is developing the bounties of kind Providence, and it is thought that will bring about a system of justice, under which, everybody will be made happy, and the whole earth turned into joyfulness. It is evil thought turned to selfish ends and purposes, thoughts of hatred and revenge, of mocking scorn and uncleanness : tt ese form the hells and create all the misery there is in the earth, while every good thought helps to make heaven, and everybody happy. Within six weeks we have had over one foot of rain. The general cry is, enough. As we come near the apple harvest time, we more fully realize the scarcity Potatoes all around are rotting, and it is so wet it makes very tedious digging. Winter wheat is up and looks very fine. Eye not yet all sown. Have had nearly three in,ches of rain this week, but no rain on Sundays that prevented our meeting together at the meeting-house. The strangers who have met with us, have been exceedingly attentive, and must have received some ideas that set them thinking. If the amount of good done by Believers through their public meetings, could all be Summed up, what a mighty pile there would be. So we will toil on, and pray on ; sow early and sow late; and never forget the assembling of ourselves together. The brightest spots in my life are the blessed experiences with gospel friends in our spiritual meetings : they are living springs from fountains that never fail. In kindest love, and a renewal of every good resolution, I close. D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. Sept. 2. The Manifesto for September is at hand with much to encourage and interest us. In looking over the Notes about Home, I find nolhing from the Valley to inform our Brethren and Sisters in other parts of the vineyard that we are laboring for a full share in the gospel harvest, although as of old the harvest is great and consecrated laborers are few; yet these few are earnest, zealous souls working out their own salvation from sin, and as earnest for the elevation of others who may seek help. The South Family have harvested a fair crop of hay, rye and oats, and now the farmers are preparing the ground for winter grain We have commeuti-d canninu: tomatoes which bid fair to \ ield a g&gt;od crop if these cold nights do not hring on the t arly frosts. We have been moving our canning department to make it more convenient for the Sisters and to economize our time in handling the goods. A small company went last week on an excursion to our Mohawk valley farm and found the B.oom corn and Indian corn looking quite well. The rain came just in time for earing. We had harvested a fine crop of oats and threshed them by steam power while on the field. We obtained 578 bushels. We are now making some more ch:mgi s, and have taken down our old dwelling and are building a new d liry near the family dwelling. O. B. Hancock, Mass. Sept. 10. Beautiful, refreshing anil restful are the lovely days that are at present ours to enjoy. They seem to us like types of the eternal perfect day. Were we always so blest we could hardly wish to change our present situation for one in the life beyond. But ah ! how perishable are the treasures of earth, how transient the joys it offers. Autumn conies to us in her vernal dress, laden with choice and abundant gifts, amply rewarding the husbandman for his arduous labors. All crops, excepting that of fruit, gave a bountiful yield and are of good quality. Br. Ira tells us that the potato crop is superior to any that has been produced in this section during the past twenty years. Also that oats and corn average well. Hay was stored in fine condition and was considered equal in quantity to that of last year's growth, which was, in the opinion of competent judges, the best that has been grown on the hillsides and valleys of famed old Berkshire in many years. Cutting and drying sweet corn will soon be the business of the day. but will be despatched in a brief snace of time, as the quantity raised does not compare with that of former seasons The Brethren have added somewhat to their many home cares by preparing a long bed for strawberries, in which two thousand five hundred plants have already been set, and more will be added later in the season. A two inch water-pipe under fifty-five ft. head has been put down, connecting with other pipes for the purpose of irrigating the plants if necessary. Our blackberry patch of nearly four square rods yielded a fraction over eight bushels. They are of the Snyder variety and added much to the delicacies of our table. In our former note we stated that pears with us were a total failure. Since then our Brethren have found and gathered a small quantity of the choicest varieties. The Bartlett, Duchess de'Angalene &amp;c, for which we feel very grateful, as indeed we do for all blessings. Home improvements for the season have been the erecting of a carriage-house and wagon-shed combined 60x24 ft. Partition made to the Office Barn, 36x24. Newly roofed the family dwelling at second family. They seem to prefer the baptism of fire by the 'Holy Spirit' to the more formal but less effective one produced by the sprinkling on of water; particularly when endeavoring to enjoy 'Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep.' Other buildings have undergone slight repairs. Workmen are now engaged in repairing the brick Tenant house to the Grist mill. Beef cattle have done finely this season. One car load was sent to New York market early in August and two car loads more will foon be transported thither. The stock here mentioned was under our charge. Dairy profits have been light as our herd of cows is small and of inferior grade. The article in Sept. Manifesto ''Be Courteous,' is worthy our most careful consideration. It should be thoughtfully read and faithfully practiced by all. Our kindest thanks to the writer. J. L. S. Enfield, Conn. Some people seem to live more in one year than others do in two. They make the most of time. Brief is the time that we journey here, be our endeavor to grow better each year. To live the greatest number of good hours in a day is wisdom. As we go through each day, let us think of coming days, and make provision for their duties, crosses and trials, by doing our very best work at character building. We want to do our whole duty, come life or come death. A small quantity of onion added to tomatoes when they are put on to stew, improves the flavor, to some tastes. Japanese buckwheat sown June 25th. is now ripening. It is at least two weeks earlier than the common variety. Creiim-colored eggs often command a better price on account cf their richness. Poultry farming, conducted on a proper system and managed in a business-like manner should pay well, the profits being considerably increased by growing food on the farm. We do not feed much corn to fowls, nor fail to provide clean grit to help digest the food. D. Orcutt. Enfield, N. H. Sept. 12. It seems but a few moments comparatively speaking, since we hailed the first signs of an approaching spring; watched the tiny leaves unfold upon the maples in the lane, which really seem like our personal friends, well-tried and true, as we have watched their growth ever since they presented the appearance of bean poles, waiting for the vines to grow and cover them. Now we notice as keenly the first tinge of crimson that foretells autumn. Soon the woods, and even our own door-yard, so convenient for the robins, because of the leafy homes it offers them, will be resplendent with colors of every hue. And so the seasons rotate; who could have planned a better world so far as variety is concerned? Our summer has been far more summerish than was the same period of time last year. We have had a large number of strangers inspecting our premises this season. It seems to be the fashion, just now, to get away from home, even if in the getting away you get into close, inconvenient apartments and wish yourselves back again, as one woman told me was her experience; consequently we have had some intelligent investigators, some well intended pleasure seekers, and more ignorant curiosity seekers than usual. Have they tarried with us for a brief space of time, sufficient to get a dinner, a birds-eye view of the locality, and departed with the antique idea that we sold apple sauce and brooms, did not marry &amp;c? Or have they realized the good influence which should emanate from pure, honest lives, an idea, at least, that here is a Community based upon the radical principles of Christianity, which, with all its defects (not in principles but individuals) is the strait and narrow way, of which, our Savior said, 'But few there be who walk therein?' These are questions that have occupied my mind, as I have beheld the different companies all-absorbing ideas of some description, the effects of which they bear to their respective homes. Our apple crop, according to the estimate of our Br. John Cumings, who for many years has cared for the harvesting of this much-used esculent, is hardly half its usual amount. We who attended the apple cutting last evening, believe this, if tangible proof is worth anything, for we dressed some of such diminutive proportions, that after dressing, we queried which was the good fruit, and which was to be relegated to the offal barrel, but as we were thereby reminded of the economizing virtues taught by our good fathers and mothers in this branch of the 'Vineyard,' it may prove a blessing, making us grateful for 'small things.' E. B. Union Village, Ohio. Dear Elder Henry :�Our long drowth is broken up and we are having nice showers intermingled with bright sunny days. Elder Joseph arrived home from Cleveland yesterday in good health. The potato crop which is now all harvested but an acre or two, though poor will probably be enough for our own use. But we have no fruit. Other crops moderate in yield except grass which was heavy. We are beginning repairs on a moderate scale and if we can only hold on to Elder Joseph, we think in a few j ears we shall be able to shine out with something of our ancient splendor not only, but with many moderate improvements superadded. Let us conclude we have deserved about all the severe chastening we have received and that now we have had about all we need and that we are about to enter on a more prosperous career. We can thus 'raise a tax on our calamity' and find spiritual sustenance from the same until we can get into better shape. We are putting into our Luandry a new washmill, new floor and a new rotary wringer. We have about three hundred swine and two carloads will be ready to ship in about two and one half months. We are also selling off six or seven hundred logs of sugar tree timber to a last factory. We have quite an amount of wheat for sale and that is better than having to buy. Your correspondent has once more finished his annual cutting of weeds over one and one half miles of road, besides going over the yards two or three times. The grass is very green and beautiful since the showers and those sugar trees I set out around the Laundry about the time ycu were here are perfectly beautiful, large and of a deep green and makes a perfect paradise of a place. Here comes the best of all. On the 7th of August our Beloved Ministry from Mt. Lebanon arrived here, and we had a perfectly delightful visit with them. Sister .^liza- beth Cantrell accompanied them and so long as they were our guests we were amazingly blessed and comforted from our sorrows (which were many, just then) and how glad we should b3 if we could only have an annual visit of this kind. But we can, and do, thank God for this much and will try to wait patiently for more to come. O. C. Hampton.
