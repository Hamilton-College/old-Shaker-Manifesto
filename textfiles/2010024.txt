Union Village, Ohio. Dear Elder Henry :ï¿½Our long drowth is broken up and we are having nice showers intermingled with bright sunny days. Elder Joseph arrived home from Cleveland yesterday in good health. The potato crop which is now all harvested but an acre or two, though poor will probably be enough for our own use. But we have no fruit. Other crops moderate in yield except grass which was heavy. We are beginning repairs on a moderate scale and if we can only hold on to Elder Joseph, we think in a few j ears we shall be able to shine out with something of our ancient splendor not only, but with many moderate improvements superadded. Let us conclude we have deserved about all the severe chastening we have received and that now we have had about all we need and that we are about to enter on a more prosperous career. We can thus 'raise a tax on our calamity' and find spiritual sustenance from the same until we can get into better shape. We are putting into our Luandry a new washmill, new floor and a new rotary wringer. We have about three hundred swine and two carloads will be ready to ship in about two and one half months. We are also selling off six or seven hundred logs of sugar tree timber to a last factory. We have quite an amount of wheat for sale and that is better than having to buy. Your correspondent has once more finished his annual cutting of weeds over one and one half miles of road, besides going over the yards two or three times. The grass is very green and beautiful since the showers and those sugar trees I set out around the Laundry about the time ycu were here are perfectly beautiful, large and of a deep green and makes a perfect paradise of a place. Here comes the best of all. On the 7th of August our Beloved Ministry from Mt. Lebanon arrived here, and we had a perfectly delightful visit with them. Sister .^liza- beth Cantrell accompanied them and so long as they were our guests we were amazingly blessed and comforted from our sorrows (which were many, just then) and how glad we should b3 if we could only have an annual visit of this kind. But we can, and do, thank God for this much and will try to wait patiently for more to come. O. C. Hampton.
