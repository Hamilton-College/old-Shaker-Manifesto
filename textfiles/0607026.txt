Relations of the Sexes : By Mrs. E. B. Duffy. Wood &amp; Holbrook, N. Y. This is a bold movement in the right direction, by a brave, high principled woman. She writes plainly upon the theme she has chosen. She will thereby awaken the progenitors of the race to see their duty to themselves and to those whom they would give and have given existence. She visits thunderbolts on the heads of those engaged in sexual abuses, and upon the various apologies rendered therefor; and if warning was sufficient to make the change that nature demands, we might feel better. But, like nearly all writers upon this subject, the authoress grows weak, even to supineness, when attempting substitutes for and preventives of marital distresses. We boldly and forcibly urge the laws of Moses on all generative men and women, as their only hope. While to those good enough to compare well in their generations with the beasts of the field, we recommend the superior life, and angelic career of Jesus — the Christ — if they would be Christians. The North Star and the Southern Cross : By M. Weppner. Weed, Parsons &amp; Co., Albany, N. Y. This is the journey of a woman round the world, and is written with an ability that has made two very interesting volumes. She writes as only a woman can upon subjects, persons and customs of nations, which would be lost sight of by manly travelers ; and thus the work will please the feminine idea of what a journey round the world should treat of. As the guest of very distinguished persons in other lands than ours, she is made much of, and tells her stories of individuals who used her handsomely or abused her inhospitably, with a keen kindness and rich deserving. Compared with the volumes of Seward, Peebles and others, it stands good. We speak for it a ready and extensive sale.
