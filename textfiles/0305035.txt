A CALL TO THE WEARY 1. O, when ye think that the earth-life is dreary, And all its burdens seem heavy to bear, When ye are languishing, toil-worn and weary, And all your strife but increases your care, 2. Those who are toiling for sel fish enjoyment, Ne'er looking out from their own narrow sphere, Feel not the solace that flows through employment No bly bestow'd for humanity's cheer; 3. And while we're bravely pursuing our duty, Feeling that ' labor is worship ' and pray'r, Soon in our pathway will seedbuds of beau ty Shed the sweet fragrance of heavenly air. Turn ye, O, turn from the thoughts that depress you; Let the sad spirit aspire to go free, And it will call down the angels to bless you, Bright'ning your vision true pleasure to see. This is the toil that our Zion home blesses ; Hands that are willing and souls that are true Lift up the weight that the lone heart oppresses, Give to the whole life an aspect that's new. Thus we're up lifted, while truest emotion Thrills ev'ry pulse to its loftiest strain; Glad is the thought, that unselfish devotion, Brings to the spirit an eternal gain.
