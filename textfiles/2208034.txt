THE HILL OF LIFE. (Contributed by M. Keniston.) I had climbed a part of the hill of life, And weary paused to rest, My soul was sick with sin and strife; I had failed in doing my best. I looked around with a restless eye Far up to the hill-tops crest; The human tide'both far and nigh Surged on with ceaseless jests. And some were poor and some were old, And some were young and gay; But rich and poor, and meek and cold, Were traveling the self-same way. And many looked on with an eager eye, To the future so glad and gay, And they trampled oft with a restless sigh The beautiful flowers of to-day. And some wTere lending a helping hand To a friend in need of aid, And leading him from the burning sand To the cool and grateful shade. And some were laughing with careless air As they trod their path in life; And some were solemn and full of care, From contest with sin and strife. A few paths looked so pleasant and clear, That I said in a mournful tone, 'The hardest one that I see here Is given to me alone.' Then came a whisper, 'closer draw,' And I strained my eyes to see, More thorns by far in them I saw Than in that which was given to me. Then slow and with a thoughtful glance I looked back at the path I trod, And thought how 'twas set, not by luck or chance But my heavenly Father and God. The thorns I had found so sharp and cruel Were but lessons I must learn, Ere I can pass from this earthly school, And await at the gate my turn. Then a prayer went up from my inmost heart 'O Father! forgive thy child, Help me, O God, to do my part, To be humble, meek and mild.' Then came hope like a gleam of light, I was strengthened to start anew, Resolved to do with my utmost might What was given me to do. Selected.
