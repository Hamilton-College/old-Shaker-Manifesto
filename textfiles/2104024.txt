Chester Holman [la a letter rocvived fro.n South Union, Ivy., oi' Mar. 13, we have au account of a very sad accident.ï¿½Ed.] Chester Holman, a man of fifty years and an excellent mechanic, ascended to the upper platform of our wind mill, some seventy feet from the ground. Before going up, lie had, as was supposed, secured the machinery from motion, so that no pumping could be done, but a sudden breeze threw one of the twelve feet fans against him, and he fell, head ioremjst, to the ground, striking on a stone walk. His death must have been instantaneous as lie did not breathe nor make a motion. A cannon ball could not have taken life more suddenly. H. L. E.
