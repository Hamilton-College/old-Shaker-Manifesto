Dear Brother G. A. Lomas, I inclose recipe for making unleavened bread... Mt. Lebanon, Dec. 2. —77 Dear Brother G. A. Lomas, I inclose Recipe for making unleavened Bread. The wheat is the starting point. The wheat must be home ground, or you will not have home made bread. We might as well go to Moody and Sankey for pure Christianity, as to go to a worldly miller with our wheat to grind; much less to buy thfl flow to make Shaker whole wheat, or coarse ground, unleavened bread—That is the bread I talk about. The Sisters insist that the unleavened bread cannot be made of the fine ground, or mercantile flour—I believe it. I quite agree with the God of Israel, that the first step in the work of human redemption is to make and eat good bread. 'Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees' should not be made of no practical effect by a pretended spiritualization— Give us the physical and physiological good of the Law, as a basis^ or substance for soul truths—I want something solid and substantial—want to inherit substance—I want to see the redemption of the Stomach, redemption of the land; and the redemption of the creative forces of man and woman.
