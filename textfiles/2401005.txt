A PETITION THE year opens as have so many preceding ones, with its burdens for Zion's interests pressing a little heavier than ever before, but though it brings a remembrance of measures imperfectly filled, yet it seems to instill into our souls, new-born strength and grace with which we may press forward into fuller duty, deeper consecration made outwardly manifest by more effectual work. The theme of all themes interests us, our glorious, glorious mission of furthering the gospel testimony which has proved as the savor of life unto life, for upward of an hundred years, and is as replete to-day with 12 THE MANIFESTO. soul-saving power, as when first delivered to our honored ancestors. We have no doubt that each Society in our Union, has its outposts which radiate its sympathies and the spiritual solicitude of its members. In union with our people elsewhere, we too are absorbed in the diffusion of gospel truth in many directions. On the Pacific Coast, California, the spirit of God is at work. In the interest of this movement, Brother Arthur W. Dowe, visited East Canterbury, during the past summer and convinced us that God is indeed troubling the face of the waters in that city. It is to this end, beloved Brothers and Sisters, we ask in a special manner, through these lines, that a fervent, united prayer rise from every loyal soul, and continue to rise, asking prosperity to attend this mission, and for strength and wisdom to guide and guard its inspired ones. In the name of our sacred calling, we ask in faith, that with one accord, 'Let Zion bowed before God's throne, Raise, O raise one prayer,' that the mission above referred to, may develop into the glory of God through the power of his Christ and a perfect revelation and obedience thereto, become the healing of the sin-sick and needy.
