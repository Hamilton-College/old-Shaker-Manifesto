FAITH AND HOPE. Faith lifts beyond the treasures given, And anchor's Hope in God and heaven ; Foresees the light in darkest day As when the clouds have passed away. Hope like a star lifts up the sight To what is heavenly and bright; And gives the heart an inward trust In God, whose dealings all are just. M. W.
