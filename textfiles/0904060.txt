PRACTICAL RELIGION&gt; A man who has always been a close observer says, the religion we want is that which banishes small measures from the tradesman's counter, pebbles from cotton bags, sand from sugar, chicory from coffee, alum from bread, and water from milk cans. The religion which is to save the world will not put all the big strawberries at the top, and all the little ones at the bottom. It will not make one-half a pair of shoes of good leather and the other half of shoddy, so that the first shall redound to the maker's credit, and the second to his cash. It will not put Jouvin's stamp on Jenkins' kid gloves ; nor make Paris bonnets in the back room of a Boston milliner's shop ; nor let a piece of velvet that professes to measure twelve yards come to an untimely end at eleven and three-quarters. It does not put bricks at $5 a thousand into chimneys it contracts to build with $7 material, nor smuggle white pine into floors that have paid for hard pine, nor leave yawning cracks in closets where boards ought to join.
