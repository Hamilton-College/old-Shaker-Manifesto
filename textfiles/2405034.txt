New England Magazine The wise men of the Massachusetts Legislature, who are wrestling with the problem of municipal suffrage for women, would do well to read the article by Edward Porritt in the April number of the New England Magazine, on 'Women in English Politics,','showing that women in England have long had the rights which American women are now asking for. This article will be read with unusual interest by all who have at heart the political advancement of woman.ï¿½Warren F. Kellogg, 5 Park Square, Boston.
