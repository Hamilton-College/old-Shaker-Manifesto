MISSION By Jane Cowan In perusing the columns of The Shaker, as it reaches our midst, on its Gospel mission, I am forcibly reminded that we need such influences as it brings to bear, to awaken in our minds those latent aspirations for spiritual food which appear to slumber in our breasts, without fully considering, as we should, the great necessity of seeking enjoyments, in a spiritual point of view, and rejecting the fitful pleasures of time, which will perish. Not that the teachings heralded by that paper are wholly or in part different from the faith heretofore taught, and by the faithful lived, in the different Shaker Societies, for a goodly number of years; but I trust the time has now come that light and knowledge will become more widespread, and that, through the columns of this much-cherished paper, many will learn where to look for truth and righteousness, who are walking in darkness without knowing the way of life, or the requirements of God to mankind. Seeing there is a strong desire on the part of the contributors to our paper, to disseminate true G-ospel principles, and not suffer their hands to beoome slack, or their hearts to wax cold, with regard to spiritual things, so, in this light and in this hope, we rejoice that the way which God has marked out to be a ' savor of life unto life, or of death unto death :) to all, may be handed down as an immaculate treasure to those who have not been so favored as ourselves, but who might perchance receive the Gospel, believe and be saved; I concluded, though yery weak the effort, to throw in my mite to uphold, so far as may be, the cause we are struggling to maintain. In casting my eyes around to see the necessity of aspiring for and looking beyond earthly and transitory things, I see those who have walked in a humble, Christ-like manner; in short, have lived simple Shaker lives, and denied themselves of all earthly enjoyments, and have lived pure and chaste before God; their shining examples and virtuous deeds irradiate their countenances, until they seem like diamonds of light in our midst, and reassure us that we too may become the worthy recipients of God's favor, being harvested from the earth by our own virtues and godly life. So, with these views on what does and will bring true happiness to the sojourner here in time, we are much pleased to see the efforts made, on the part of Believers, through The Shaker, to enlighten the minds of mankind as to what constitutes a true Christian; and how nearty the requirements of Believers comport with the life and teachings of the Saviour, who are able to say, 'We are the way, the truth and the life; follow us as we follow Christ.' God's chosen people have ever been called upon to sacrifice their earthly desires and propensities ; consequently, if we reach the goal they reached, less effort by us than they made cannot secure our eternal happiness. Then, how comforting the thought that the way of life is made plain, and that, in addition to the life and example of Jesus, we have the way also marked out by Mother Ann which consummates the way of life, and confirms our faith in the plan of salvation as taught in this our day. There is a fullness of light and peace, beyond which we have no aspirations; but with it our souls can rest secure, feeling sure that, although the number may be small who will become true heirs of heaven, yet feeling conscious that there will always be a remnant who will retain the testimony, and consequently maintain the principles of the Gospel through all succeeding ages. Who then, but an ingrate, can reject so high and holy a calling, to work out salvation here in time, and endeavor with their might to be eyes to the blind, and ears to the deaf, and a light to souls dead in trespasses and sin ? this is certainly the duty of Zion's children; hence it is plain that all our endeavors should tend .to elevate the human race, by ever pressing onward and upward, and in this way be a light to earth's weary pilgrims on their heavenly journey.
