ORIGINAL IDEAS. F. W. Evans. Through Ann Lee and her followers has come a new class of ideas, that have been received and spread broadcast by the press and lecturers ; they are shaking the old heavens and earth all to pieces ;� 1. That God is a duality, not a trinity, and is a heavenly Father and Mother. 2. The Jewish God of Israel was not Deity, but a tutelary divinity. 3. The Jewish Bible, some portion of it, is a record of the word of God. In it we are told what the living ivord of God really is�thus, 'The word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing, even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Heb. iv., 12. 4. Jesus, when bora of Mary, was not yet the Christ, but had to be born again by being anointed by the Christ Spirit, and thus became the Christ. 5. Probation extends into eternity. Whenever a soul is convicted of sin, and seeks the mercy of God, by confession and repentance, it will be met in mercy. 'The mercy of the Lord endureth forever.' But effects must be endured. 6. There is no resurrection of the body : the Resurrection is, rising out of Generation. 'I am the resurrection and the life,' Jesus said. He had risen by the Christ spirit, out of and above the generative order. 7. Atonement must be made by the sinner, not by Jesus. The soul that sinneth, it shall die ; and the sinner that repents, is raised from that death. 8. Man has worked out his own condemnation ; and he must work out his own salvation and redemption. 9. The law is included in the Gospel. It is 'the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb.' The song of the Lamb is the Gospel Testimony of Christ's first and Second Appearing. Luther and Calvin separated them, and repudiated 'good works, as filthy rags.' They substituted the righteousness of Christ or Jesus, in place of their own righteousness�of doing right themselves, individually. 10. Swedenborg was the angel of spiritualism, and Ann Lee of religion. 11. The seven thunders are seven cycles of travail by the Millennial, or resurrection Church itself. The other sevens of the Revelator�seals, vials, plagues and trumpets, are the seven cycles of travail of the great Antichristiaa world�'Seven Churches of Asia'� Gentile Christianity, from the first to the second Appearing of Christ. The history of the Church and State generative, fighting, poverty-creating governments, who have the poor always with them to make soldiers out of; and with the soldiers they fill the earth with violence. 'In her�Babylon�was found the blood of all saints and martyrs, and of all the blood that was shed upon the earth.' 12. The marriage of the Lamb and Bride, is the union of the first and second Pentecostal Churches�Jew and Gentile. The first church has been in the spirit world 1260 years ; and the second, in a wilderness state on earth, amongst the Two Witnesses, for 1260 .years. 13. The kiugdom o� heaven is now being created upon earth, and is fulfill- ing all the promises, both physical and spiritual, belonging thereunto. It furnishes the 'hundred fold' of houses and lands, to those who have forsaken their selfish private property�houses and lands; and it provides, uniformly the 'daily bread'�good, substantial, hygienic food�to all its members. 14. There is no effect without a cause. There would have been no late Civil War�destroying millions of life and property- �if no chattel slavery; and no chattel slavery, if no wages-slavery. There would have been no wagesslavery, if no land-monopoly�single persons holding, and claiming to own, more land than they used. If no landmonopoly, no poor, landless, homeless people. If no poor, homeless people, then no soldiers, and nothing to fight about. For more than a century, these radical ideas and millennial truths have been going forth from Zion. They are creating material for the two OrdersNew Heavens and a New Earth, of Righteousness and Holiness. Appendix. Many notable persons have been ii&gt; terested in the Shaker theological ideas. Theodore Parker adopted 'The Second Appearing of Christ' as his textbook, to preach from He was one of the first to own God as a Father and Mother, and to publicly pray to a dual God. Hepworth Dixou has much to say about Shaker ideas, affirming that 'they have modified the religious thought of America.' He says :�'One man with ideas may be worth a Parliament�nay, a whole nation, without them. The Shakers may not be scholars and men of genius. In appearance they are often very simple ; but they are men with ideas, men capable of sacrifice. No one can look into the heart of American society without seeing that these Shaker unions have a power upon men beyond that of mere numbers. If a poll-tax were decre. d, they might pay into the exchequer less than many of the sects.; but their influence on American thought is out of all comparison with that of such sects. The Shakers have a genius, a faith, an organization, which are not only strange but seductive, which have been tried in the fire of persecution, and are hostile to society as it stands. A Shaker vi'lage is not only a new church, but a new nation. This church is based upon these grand ideas :�The kingdom of heaven has come ; Christ has actually appeared again on earth : the personal rule of God is restored. In the wake of these ideas and dependent upon them, follow many more. Mount Lebanon is the center of a system which has a distinct genius, a strong organization, a perfect life of its own, through which it would appear to be helping to shape and guide, in no slight measure, the spiritual career of the United States of America. Spiritualism. Dixon sees a connection between Shakerism and spiritualism. He says :'When Mother Ann had been lodged in jail in this river town (Poughkeepsie,) she had gathered a little court of curious people around her, to whom she commuuicated her strange experience of the unseen world. Andrew Jackson Davis, a poor cobbler, is the spiritual descendent of Ann Lee, the poor factory girl. Davis sees sights, and dreams dreams ; but his revelations have scarcely gone beyond the hints afforded by Mother Ann. When we essay to judge spiritualisma system so repugnant to our feelings, so hostile to our institutions as this school of spiritualism�it is needful, if we would be fair in our censure, to remember that, strange as it may seem to on-lookers, it has been embraced by hundreds of learned men and pious women. Such a fact will appear to many the most singular part of the movement; but no one can assert that a thing is simply foolish, beneath the notice of investigators, which has been accepted by men like Judge Edmonds, Dr. Hare, Elder Frederick, and Professor Bush.' Bishop Hughes is reported as saying, 'The Catholics have nothing to fear from the Protestants : we know them, their organizations, numbers, and power. But the Spiritualists are a nameless number, an unknown quantity; we know neither their numbers nor their future.' And. that is true. Spiritualism will be the agent to undermine the great Catholic Church ; and Shakerism will crumble it to pieces. It is the fall of Babylon. Mt. Lebanon, Col. Co., N. Y.
