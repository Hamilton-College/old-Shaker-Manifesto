TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH MAIN. No. 2. While in this state of mind, I heard reports about a singular and strange people, who taught a new system of religion. The accounts given of them were various and very remarkable, and seemed to excite much attention among all classes of people. What to make of them I could not tell; but it appeared evident that there was something wonderful among them, or they could not excite such general attention. I therefore determined to go and see for myself, whether they were really good or bad people, and to act accordingly. V\rhen I came there, I was still at a loss what to think of them. They were indeed a very singular people ; their religion was new and strange to me. I disputed them some ; but to no purpose ; they were able to comprehend and answer me. This confounded me still more. I concluded I had better stop and wait till I could discover what they were. And being in a great labor and concern of soul, I did not feel disposed to cavil about things which I could not understand. I tarried several days, and was in a serious aud conscientious labor ; for I felt my soul at stake. All the spiritual sensations of my former experience had left me, and all my past hopes of salvation had failed. And though I had made a public profession of the religion of Jesus Christ; yet I was blinded with antichristian doctrines, corrupted by their practices, and deeply lost in sin ; like thousands of others in this day, who know not the pure gospel of salvation, nor the power of eternal life; and I was, convinced that if I could not find relief, I must sink into despair. As I was passing through a room where Mother Ann was, 1 saw her sitting in a chair, and singing very melodiously, with her hands in motion ; and her whole soul atid body seemed to be in exercise. I felt, as it were, a stream of divine power and love flow into my soul, and was convinced, at once, that it came from Heaven, the source and fountain of all good. I immediately acknowledged my faith, and went and confessed my sins, honestly and conscientiously. I could then say with the apostle, Sin appeared exceeding sinful, even beyond expression. Indeed it felt so loathsome and hateful to me, that I resolved at once never to commit another ski. After this I went and righted all my wrongs, aud set out, once for all, with a determination to live a righteous life, according to the counsel of God through these strange people, whom I verily found to be his true witnesses. In so doing, I have ever found protection; yea, in obedience to the counsel of God, through Mother Ann Lee, and the Elders with her, my soul has been saved from sin. This answers the very purpose for which Christ came into the world ; tht.t is, 'to save his peoplo from their sins.' I then received the gifts of God in very deed ; aud they became an abiding treasure in my soul. J was greatly blessed of God, and received the gifts of vision, prophecy aud revelation, and also the gift of healing. These gifts are sufficient to confirm the Believer that this is the second appearing of Christ. But the greatest gift of all is, salvation from sin. I thank God that I am able, from personal knowledge and acquaintance, to bear witness of the purity of the lives and characters of Mother Ann aud the Elders. I have been with them frequently, in various places, at all times aud seasons, aud well knew the manner of life they lived ; and can testify before all men, that I never saw any thing in them, which gave me the least cause of jealousy that they indulged themselves in anything contrary to the strictest principles of morality, purity and holiness. On the contrary, they always bore a powerful testimony against every evil, in word aud Jeed. Their faithful labors were constantly employed in purging out sin and all manner of impurity from among the people, aud in ministering the gifts of God, and teaching purity and holiness wherever they went. The unfaithful were reproved aud admonished with the most heartsearching power; while the faithful were encouraged and filled with heavenly comfort and consolation. Their testimony was so plain and pointed against the corrupt nature of man, that many who were determined not to take up their crosses, became the violent and bitter opposers of this testimony ; aud therefore levelled all the arrows of their spite and malice against the Mother of our redemption, unto whom was committed the oracles of God for the salvation of a lost world ; and from whom I have received the gifts of God, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, as really as ever the apostles did at the day ot Pentecost. From that same blessed Spirit in Mother Ann aud her successors in the gospel, my soul has often been filled with heavenly blessings, even to overflowing. Thus have 1 ihank of I he waters of life, aud been fed and nourished with the bread of life, for more than forty-six years. 1 hese things are not the dreams of iinagiuatiou, but substantial realities, which are well known to every faithful Believer, who truly follows Christ in the regeneration, ltwho walks not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.' And all such cau bear testimony to these things, according to the measure of their travail and experience in the work of the regeneration. But, however different the gifts and manifestations of Di\ iue power to diffei ent individuals, yet the Spirit is one and the same in all; as saith the apostle :ï¿½ 1'There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.' 1 Cor. xii., 4. Every true Believer is led and governed by the same Spirit, which is the Spirit of Christ; and thus we become one with Christ, as he is one with the Father. As the blood, which is the life of the body, circulates through every member of the body ; so the Spirit of Christ, which in Scripture is sometimes called the blood of Christ, circulates through every member oi' the bodj of Christ, and is the life of his body, which is the Church. Every true and faithful Believer is a member of that body, and receives strength and nourishment from it. These things being well known to us by living experience, and having been confirmed beyond the smallest shadow of a doubt, through a period of many years, we feel ourselves fully qualified to bear testimony thereof to our fellow creatures ; and therefore they need not think it strange that we are able to do it with so much boldness and confidence : for the evidence of experience is the strongest proof that can be given of the truth of any principle whatever.
