Vick's Floral Guide â€” Is a super-excel, lent work of one hundred pages. It contains for frontispiece an elegant colored plate, which of itself is worth more, we would judge, than the entire book costs, which can be obtained by sending five cents to James Vick, Rochester, N. Y. This is the most instructive work of the kind published in the United States that we know of. Its illustrations are very numerous and beautiful, while the finest, choicest paper is used in the construction of the invaluable guide. We recommand those desirous of obtaining a choice variety of seeds or plants, either flower or vegetable, to address James Vick, Rochester, N. Y.
