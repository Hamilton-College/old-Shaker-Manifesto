Marinda M. Keniston:--I have just finished reading your piece... Washingtonville, Pa. Marinda M. Kenistox :ï¿½I have just finished reading your piece in July No. of the Maxifesto 'Whither are we drifting?' I kindly thank you for having exercised your gift in this direction feeling as I do, though an outsider, that Zion's prosperity is humanity's gain. It is quite encouraging to realize that there are still those among Believers who are exercised concerning the perpetuity of this Divine Institution. F. H.
