Holiness of Life Albert Barnes A man who has been redeemed by the blood of the Son of God should be pure. He who is an heir of life should be holy. He who is attended by celestial beings, and who is soon—he knows not how soon—to be translated to heaven, should be holy. Are angels my attendants ? Then I should walk worthy of my companionship. Am I so soon to go and dwell with angels? Then I should be pure. Are these feet so soon to tread the courts of heaven ? Is this tongue so soon to unite with heavenly beings in praising God ? Are these eyes so soon to look on the throne of eternal glory and on the ascended redeemer ? Then these feet, and eyes and lips should be pure and holy, and I should be dead to the world, and live for heaven.

I showed him my garden, and told him it was a botanical garden. ' How so?' said he; 'it is covered with weeds.' O, I replied, that is only because it has not yet come to its age of discretion and choice. The weeds you see have taken the liberty to grow, and thought it unfair in me to prejudice the soil in favor of roses and strawberries.'
