'Who Wonders?' Hie Springfield (Mass.) Republican does not wonder that some former members and the Shakers parted company; for, from the utterances of the departed, it is of the opinion that they would not grace any moral company, but be a disgrace to an}^ respectable community. ' Why go they out from among us ? Because they are not of us; ' they want the world, the fleah, and the excitement of perverted sense. These we deny to all, holding union with us. No honorable Shaker has ever failed to merit and receive the respect of those who differed with him in matters of faith ; while a suspicion follows and distrust rests upon those who depart their principles, and practice the world. It is no honor to anj^ sect, to have a seceding Shaker become one of their number, for they leave us for nothing purer, better. *
