White Water, O. Nov. 1890. Dear Editor:â€”I have neglected my items for December, but will now give you something for the New Year. Br. Henry Gross and the writer spent a few days among our gospel friends at Union Viilage, O. We left home the 8th. of Nov. and returned the 11th. We had a very pleasant visit; attended a singing service, Sabbath A. M. and an hour of worship with the family in the P. M. The service was very profitable and interesting. Elder Oliver Hampton and Elder Charles Clapp, both preached good sermons. On Monday A. M., Br. Thomas Mann accompanied vis all over the place, and in the P. M. Br. James Fennesey, and one of the Ministry went with us to the West and North families, and we enjoyed a very pleasant visit with all the beloved Brethren and Sisters. On Tuesday we started homeward well satisfied with our privilege. We have purchased an Incubator, which holds 300 eggs. Have built a new fence around our Cemetery. This im- proves the place very much. H. W. F.
