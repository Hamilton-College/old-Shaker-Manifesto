Sabbathday Lake. Oct. 183:3. As we see tlie loads of corn drawn to t':e garden house for husking, we are reminded of Whitier's Corn Song: 'Heap high the farmer's wintry hoar 1 Heap high the golden coin ! Xo richer gift has autumn poured From out her lavish horn!' Many blessings are now being poured out to us from autumn's lavish horn, and while troubles are increasing between Capital and Labor in the manufacturing cities around us, all is quiet in our Communal homes. We abide under our own vines and fig-trees and there are none to make us afraid. Four young Sisters from Alfred have lately visited us. They manifested in their deportment a planting of gospel principles which we feel assured will grow and bear fruit for the upbuilding of Zion.' Since their return we have sent a company of our young Sisters to visit them. They spent a number of days in that lovely home and have returned to us renewed in spirit and are telling many stories of the pleasures they enjoyed and of the love and kindness they received. These seem like the golden days, not yet 'The melancholy days, the saddest of the year.' Ada S. Cumminc/a.
