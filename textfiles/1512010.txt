CORRESPONDENCE To Joseph Chamberlain respected friend; I have been... To Joseph Chamberlain, Respected Friend ;�I have been measuring the moral altitude of Gladstone, Parnell, and yourself, as British Statesmen. Gladstone represents the British Government and of course its morality. Its actions in Egypt were but to secure to Egyptian landholders their dividends, (which, as you are well aware, must be paid by the laborers of Egypt) and to keep open a water-way to India through which the wealth annually created by labor may flow into the Thames. The morality of said actions, have no altitude whatever. Parnell represents the worst cared for people within the limits of modern civilization. His position has a certain potential altitude. What does he profess to do with it? To increase the number of land-holders, and to give them the power to control their own affairs. Under this altitude, millions of the Irish people will be as in oth^r parts of the British Empire, denied access to the land; and of course be servants�slaves�commodities, to those who have land. To be denied access to land, is perpetual eviction. And a recognition of the right of the Duke of Argylle to demand that a Gun-boat be sent to Skye to subdue the poor Crofters. Hence the moral altitude of Parnell, is as that of Gladstone, nowhere! Your position is best denned by those who traduce you. ' That you would confiscate, and inaugurate communism. ' Your traducers are blind to the fact, that an evicted man, denied access to the elements of subsistence, is also evicted from under all moral responsibilities. Your position is neither more nor less, than to bring every person within the pale of moral responsibility. Hold that position. 'The gates of Hell shall not prevail against you. Moses the great Law-giver and Emancipator�the type of Jesus Christ; gave to every family a portion of land. He founded his Moral Code, upon a just apportionment of the land of Judea. Hence every Jew was held under moral responsibilities. Point your traducers to Moses the servant of God. Did he not institute the ' Acceptable year of the Lord '�the Jubilee�' A Land Restoration Law? ' � Did he not inaugurate communism? Declaring that every seventh year, the whole land of Judea should be one common table. That the fruit of the olive-yards, vineyards, and fields, should be common property. That the rich, the poor, and the shiftless should all fare alike ! What a glorious year for Tramps, the whole land of Judea is alive with them. Sound an alarm in 'Scotland yard!' Call out the 'Horse guards. ' Let the Duke's Gun-boat take a position ! For ' The reign of Law '�divine law, is inaugurated. The castle of Imeraray shall lose its isolation, and a tidal wave from the Garelough shall wash away the sinecures of the House of the Lome. If Moses was but a shadow of Christ, what will ultimate communism be? Through you, allow me to say a few words to Socialists, Internationalists, and to Dynamiters. You complain, that 'Society ' is organized against you. That you produce, and that others consume the products of your industry. That you sustain Governments instituted to oppress you, and forms of religion for which you have no reverence. Pay interest on enormous debts, which you did not contract. And to support Military establishments designed to oppress you. And to support swarms of idlers, whose chief employment is to devour your substance, and to corrupt public morals. That you are the wealth producers ; yet you have no possessions. You also state, that the enormously productive energies of mechanical and chemical appliances of our times are not the products of a class, and that they belong of right to all. And being destitute of land, your necessities compel you to set and keep these mighty forces in motion till you glut the markets of the world. And that you suffer destitution from the very abundance you have created. Again you complain, that you are denied access to social elevating enjoyments. And that you are degraded personally by enduring unhygienic conditions, alike destructive of morals and of life. On the presentation of these awful verities ; why should not ' Society' be seized with remorse, and rush to embrace you; relieve youTHE MANIFESTO. 275 from such terrible pressure, assuage your anguish, and soothe your broken hearts. Invite you to their mansions, to the luxuries of their conservatories, and to the sweet air of their ample parks. And that all who call themselves 'Society' would unite to bless you for your long endurance of such stupendous wrongs. And wonder, that ir your desperation you had not torn 'Society' into pieces, and strewed your pathways with destruction. And in profound gratitude for all they had enjoyed of the products of labor, crown you as the industrial moral heroes of the ages. ' Society' also has its complaints. Complains that you are ready to do violence. Well we know what Christ said 'Whatever measure ye mete unto men, will be measured unto you again. ' Suppose Mosaic justice is applied in this case. 'A blow for a blow '' would clearly justify applying forms of force, ,,to remove burdens unjustly^imposed. ' Society' has no cause of complaint. If she is dealt with, as she has dealt with you. But stop here, make a halt; consider a few points. Are not the Great Land-holders who rule in their own favor, the fruit of long established usages? would you have done any better, had you been trained as they were? Take you as a whole, where is the man among you who would object to accepting a Dukedom? And where is the average woman who would not like to be a Duchess? Is it not an all pervading, an ever present fact, that man's lower self-hood, with its animal loves and impulses, has created modern civilization just as it is. Suppose you had been so unfortunate as to be a Duke, would you like to have a little bit of dynamite applied to you? There is a better way. Suppose you try force, would not that invite repression, and cause the inevitable coming change to be an explosion? In such a case, the millions whom you represent would most largely be the sufferers. To deplete the population of Europe by ten or twenty millions would be to the 'Law and order men,' a godsend. For war, famine, pestilence, are factors in the creed of their economy. Do not give these men any such an opportunity. Those among yourselves who are the most violent, were they of the favored few, would be the most reckless in applying force to you. ' There is a better way. ' Is it wisdom to meet an army in front, when you can take it in rear? ' The better way ' to subdue armies is, never come into contract with them 'The iron Duke ' fresh from Waterloo, and flushed with victory, tried to rule with an iron hand. Public sentiment spoke six words, ('stop the Duke, go for gold ') and brought the Duke to his knees. Public sentiment can make, or dismiss armies. ' The better way ' is, speak peace to all and maintain it among yourselves ; for the day of your deliverance is nigh. The Law has gone, and is going forth from the Throne of the Eternal, that all men are equally his children, and equally entitled to have access to all the elements of subsistence. Declare that the acceptable year of the Lord is now, the Jubilee, the Land Restoration year. Declare through all nations, that Land being the source of human subsistence, of social and judicial equality; and a regulator of the exchange and values of commercial equivalents ; that every person should have access to land at all times. Declare, that the possession of land operates as a brake upon the fly wheel of destructive competition. And as a nullifier of the causes of Panics, Strikes, Want, and Crime. Declare also, that Gold was not made to grow, nor Mortgages to yield a crop. To have them do so, is to destroy the conditions of human equality. Kossuth remarked 'the Christian nation is not yet' under Christian ideas and sentiments, land can neither be bought nor sold. To do so, is to make those who cannot buy, a commodity, a servant, a slave. The veriest opposite ' of loving the neighbor as we do self.' The Ballot and the Vote, are to the ' landless ' but ' glittering generalities. ' Get land and work it, and the comforts of life will soon be yours. The really useful goods of all nations, are reproduced every few years. And ever remember that destructive modes of acquiring property are demoralizing. The Better way has been shown. Shall I show you the Best�the Higher way. When you get to the land, and have enjoyed a fullness of the good things treasured up in the rich grains, and refreshing fruits, you may be better prepared to listen. However, I will venture now to'do so. It has been stated, that modern civilization is the product of man's lower self-hood. The organic Law of that civilization is, ' Me and Mine. ' Its mode of operation is to get all you can at the expense of others�make servants�slaves� commodities of men, women and children. If they resist, coerce them with the resources of civilization 'the musket, the bludgeon, the crowbar, and said Gun-boat. There is not a single nation on earth's wide circumference, which represents the 'Higher Life' in man. 'The Christian nation is not yet.' There is indeed a phenomenal people ' called Shakers, ' whose mode of procedure is love to the neighbor. They hold to the Mother, and Fatherhood of God. They say, that goodness is religion, And that to be beneficent is to be divine. And that any other kind of divinity is a spurious article. They also state, that their homes are open to all humanity, with this proviso� Restrain the lower�the animal emotions bear a daily cross against them. And come out of the bottomless pit of self-greed. Put your hands to work, and your hearts to the All Central Beneficence�God. And lovingly give of the products of your labor to sustain upon earth the economy of Heaven, 'Unto this last, even as unto thee, will I give a penny. ' With them, there is neither want nor crime. Nor say they, the land is mine. I have the happiness to be your friend, D. Fraser. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. U. S. A. Elder F. W. Evans, Dear Sir: You will greatly... Elder F. W. Evans, Dear Sir:�You will greatly oblige me by answering the following questions, which you may depend upon are not prompted by idle curiosity. First, What is the whole religious creed and doctrine of the Shakers? Second, What are their various rules and regulations and the benefit to be derived from the same? Third, do the Shakers believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God, and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and our only Savior? Fourth, do Shakers believe that miracles can be wrought in modern times as they were of old? Fifth, do Shakers believe science, knowledge and good morals, by their general diffusion, to be the most effectual instrument in the warfare with sin and the lusts of this life? Sixth, do Shakers believe ignorance to be the root of all moral depravity? Seventh, are the principles and rules of the different Shaker communities the same, or do they differ? Eighth, would the Shakers in the case of a boy nearly 17 years of age, who wishes to free himself from his kindred and the practices and modes of living that he detests, and join himself to your noble sect, be willing to pay a reasonable sum of money to his parents to whom he is in bondage until he is of age, in consideration of his services for the interval of four years? I am the said boy. Hoping to receive a speedy and satisfactory reply, I remain yours most humbly. Frederick G. Obermain, THE REPLY. Mt. Lebanon, Jan. 188r&gt;. Frederick G. Obermain, Respected Friend: Yours of the 15th inst. received. It contains a series of well put questions, which I will answer by numbers. No. 1. It would take all the books we have published to give you the 'whole religious creed and doctrine of the Shakers. ' I have not time to write it out. No. 2. Our rules, &amp;c, we can send to you in print. The benefit the Order promises, to an obedient member, is salvation from the comiptions that are in the world through the lusts of the flesh and the mind. No. 3. Do not believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God, until the learned, who wrote and printed it, get through revising it. And then, we, also, may desire to revise it in the light of the revelation of Christ's second appearing, in which we are living. In this light we learn what the apostles did not know, to wit., that Jesus is not the Christ, nor yet the ' Son of God, ' only as his disciples became the Christs and Sons of God, by being baptized with the Christ Spirit, and living as he lived�a celibate, non-fighting, non-private property holding man and woman, and working out their own salvation just as he did. A person can nev- er be saved from any evil except by ceasing to do that evil, and learning to do well�-daily self-denials. No. 4. These signs shall follow them that believe in me. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. They shall restore the blind, speak with many tongues, cast out devils, &amp;c. Are these miracles? Is not the growth of grass a miracle? The ascent of sap to the top of a tree 300 feet high is a stupendous miracle, if a miracle be something for which we can not give a scientific reason, No. 5. 'In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. ' If so science and religion are one and the same. There is no science, except what is falsely so called, without religion And there can be no true religion that is unscientific. Pure and undefiled religion is to gather the widow and fatherless, the sin-sick souls, into the kingdom of Heaven that has come upon earth, wherein they have daily bread, are separated and kept, unspotted by sin, from the world that buy and sell and then fight about it continually. The . lusts of the flesh and of property being the source whence come wars and fightings, rich and poor, male and female, capital and labor. No. C. We believe lust to be 'the root of all moral depravity,' ignorance included. Light�knowledge�is sown for the righteous who deny themselves of all ungodliness and all worldly lusts, living Godly and soberly in this present evil world. No. 7. All Shaker societies have the same fundamental principles. They may stand in different degrees of knowledge respecting the increase of the work of God. One degree of seven is about closing, and another degree is about opening. This makes diversity, as in a school of different classes, without contrariety. No. 8. We cannot take minors without consent of parents or guardian, and we pay no wages, even to adults, much less minors. At the first pentecost, when J-5000 were baptized with the Christ Spirit, they loved one another so well that they converted their private property into community, having all things common, no one calling anything mine but ours. This is the Order of the second Pentecostal Church, now established under the second appearing of the Christ Spirit, the Kingdom of Heaven so long prayed for by all professing Christians. F. W. Evans. West Pittsfield, Mass. Sep. I88f). Beloved Sister Makcia E. Hastings ;�After many months delay we are forming a reply to your most beautiful letter to Sister Deborah.�How passing strange that- Father Time of such vast age, can so adroitly and nimbly snatch away the precious, God given moments of this earth life. It seems a brief space of time since the reception of that welcome missive and lo ! the golden autumnal season is with us in its display of gorgeous apparel, tempting fruitage and almost endless variety of earth yielding products. This hallowed day (Sabbath) is one of unsurpassing loveliness and beauty, with a glorious sky and a balmy atmosphere. All nature seems in harmonious accord with our own uplifted thoughts. It is as though the mystic veil was lifted and heaven's rich glory had descended, flooding the earth with its marvelous light and matchless beauty. In our transport of wonder and admiration we had nearly forgotten the object for which we had taken the pen. Sister Deborah received your word, and will transcribe a few remarks of her own pencilling :� 'Dear Sister Marcia, I think you are as the morning when the sun riseth : even a morning without clouds. As the tender grass springing out of the earth by the clear shining after the rain. Give of my best love to Sister M. whose memory I fondly cherish and whose love is fragrant with Christian grace and heavenly meekness. Finally to all the gospel friends. Your Sister. Deborah.' Sister Deborah is 79 yrs. of age. The writer of this would also be remembered to beloved gospel friends. Affectionately, Julia L. Sweet.
