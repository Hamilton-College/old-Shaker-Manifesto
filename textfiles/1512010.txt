THE REPLY. Mt. Lebanon, Jan. 188r&gt;. Frederick G. Obermain, Respected Friend: Yours of the 15th inst. received. It contains a series of well put questions, which I will answer by numbers. No. 1. It would take all the books we have published to give you the 'whole religious creed and doctrine of the Shakers. ' I have not time to write it out. No. 2. Our rules, &amp;c, we can send to you in print. The benefit the Order promises, to an obedient member, is salvation from the comiptions that are in the world through the lusts of the flesh and the mind. No. 3. Do not believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God, until the learned, who wrote and printed it, get through revising it. And then, we, also, may desire to revise it in the light of the revelation of Christ's second appearing, in which we are living. In this light we learn what the apostles did not know, to wit., that Jesus is not the Christ, nor yet the ' Son of God, ' only as his disciples became the Christs and Sons of God, by being baptized with the Christ Spirit, and living as he lived�a celibate, non-fighting, non-private property holding man and woman, and working out their own salvation just as he did. A person can nev- er be saved from any evil except by ceasing to do that evil, and learning to do well�-daily self-denials. No. 4. These signs shall follow them that believe in me. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. They shall restore the blind, speak with many tongues, cast out devils, &amp;c. Are these miracles? Is not the growth of grass a miracle? The ascent of sap to the top of a tree 300 feet high is a stupendous miracle, if a miracle be something for which we can not give a scientific reason, No. 5. 'In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. ' If so science and religion are one and the same. There is no science, except what is falsely so called, without religion And there can be no true religion that is unscientific. Pure and undefiled religion is to gather the widow and fatherless, the sin-sick souls, into the kingdom of Heaven that has come upon earth, wherein they have daily bread, are separated and kept, unspotted by sin, from the world that buy and sell and then fight about it continually. The . lusts of the flesh and of property being the source whence come wars and fightings, rich and poor, male and female, capital and labor. No. C. We believe lust to be 'the root of all moral depravity,' ignorance included. Light�knowledge�is sown for the righteous who deny themselves of all ungodliness and all worldly lusts, living Godly and soberly in this present evil world. No. 7. All Shaker societies have the same fundamental principles. They may stand in different degrees of knowledge respecting the increase of the work of God. One degree of seven is about closing, and another degree is about opening. This makes diversity, as in a school of different classes, without contrariety. No. 8. We cannot take minors without consent of parents or guardian, and we pay no wages, even to adults, much less minors. At the first pentecost, when J-5000 were baptized with the Christ Spirit, they loved one another so well that they converted their private property into community, having all things common, no one calling anything mine but ours. This is the Order of the second Pentecostal Church, now established under the second appearing of the Christ Spirit, the Kingdom of Heaven so long prayed for by all professing Christians. F. W. Evans. West Pittsfield, Mass. Sep. I88f). Beloved Sister Makcia E. Hastings ;�After many months delay we are forming a reply to your most beautiful letter to Sister Deborah.�How passing strange that- Father Time of such vast age, can so adroitly and nimbly snatch away the precious, God given moments of this earth life. It seems a brief space of time since the reception of that welcome missive and lo ! the golden autumnal season is with us in its display of gorgeous apparel, tempting fruitage and almost endless variety of earth yielding products. This hallowed day (Sabbath) is one of unsurpassing loveliness and beauty, with a glorious sky and a balmy atmosphere. All nature seems in harmonious accord with our own uplifted thoughts. It is as though the mystic veil was lifted and heaven's rich glory had descended, flooding the earth with its marvelous light and matchless beauty. In our transport of wonder and admiration we had nearly forgotten the object for which we had taken the pen. Sister Deborah received your word, and will transcribe a few remarks of her own pencilling :� 'Dear Sister Marcia, I think you are as the morning when the sun riseth : even a morning without clouds. As the tender grass springing out of the earth by the clear shining after the rain. Give of my best love to Sister M. whose memory I fondly cherish and whose love is fragrant with Christian grace and heavenly meekness. Finally to all the gospel friends. Your Sister. Deborah.' Sister Deborah is 79 yrs. of age. The writer of this would also be remembered to beloved gospel friends. Affectionately, Julia L. Sweet.
