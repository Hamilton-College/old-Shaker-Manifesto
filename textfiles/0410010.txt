Turkish Bath Hotel, 41 W. 26th St., ) New York, August 19,1874 Dear Elder Evans : Head and shoulders over Sects, Dogmas, Creeds, Lawyers, Doctors, Priests, Politicians and Beechers, the Disciples of Ann Lee have jumped the fence of bigotry, fanaticism and superstition — holding Church and State, consuming wars, Inundations, Famine and Panics, at arm's length. They are victorious, over the Appetites and the Passions. Startling changes are so near at hand, I seem chained here, as by fate. It may be Revolution. What binds us, in affinity, is Truth. I want to meet you and yours, but destiny keeps me still, a Hermit. Some time I will come, but not now. The Fruit is not yet ripe. The Harvest is not ready for the Reapers. The Dead Carts will soon come round, and Property will have no value. That thins out the diseased, in body and pocket. Beecher's fall leads the way. All your Ideas will prevail. Nobody will eat flesh, use Tobacco, drink Alcohol, chew Opium, nor destroy manhood — by and by. The Nation is Psychologizing, fast. The Electric Current is being magnetized into man, and I cannot move yet. So, say all manner of kind things to your people, and take much good will for yourself. Geo. Francis Train
