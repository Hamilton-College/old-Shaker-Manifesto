AN ACROSTIC. SHAKER MANIFESTO. ELDER A. D. BUCKINGHAM. The Shaker Manifesto, in appearance so small Has this goodly motto, 'Go preach the kingdom' to all t Embarrassed by none, it obeyetb the call. Sailing out in deep waters where dangers assail, Heavy surges are breaking, and darkness prevails, Adding trials and conflicts, the Truth to maintain, Keeping boldly at work, for humanity's gain. Ever prayerful and humble while trusting in God, Reviving new courage by proclaiming His Word. Making paths of bright sunshine, and happier days All along thro' Life's strange and mysterious ways. Never flinching in purpose,- -upholding the Bight, In the many or few who are seeking true light, Forgiving, forgetting all injuries past. Espousing no baneful emotions that blast: Sincerely inviting all souls who aspire To rise, and keep rising, still higher and higher, Out of worldly dissensions- -unholy desire. Watervliet, N. Y.
