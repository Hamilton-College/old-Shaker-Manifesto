STRONG DRINK Beloved Editok.â€”I was led to the follow ing thoughts by reading, in a late journal, an estimate of the extent of the ' curse ' by the retail traffic of ardent spirits in the United States and Territories in 1873, as follows: ' Number of places licensed to sell intoxicating drink, 150,000 ; persons employed in those ' hells,' 300,000; annual cost of liquor to satisfy and increase depraved appetites, $400,000,000! The same author estimates the number of clergymen and school-teachers in the country at 200,000.' Thus, while one class are laboring to advance the people in moral and spiritual life, the other, and by far the greater portion, are plying the work of Death ! Now, when it is considered that the above estimate is based upon the amount of money expended for liquor retailed, which probably does not include more than one-half the amount sold, and when we reflect that the time lost, fines paid, etc., would amount to as much more, the enormous waste of money yearly, for that which produces only evil and crime, is truly appalling! This hydra monster (intemperance), besides sending thousand of people to prison and a drunkard's grave, reduces thousands of children to a state worse than orphans, and spreads misery, disease, crime and premature death throughout the country! Truly, ' the sword hath slain its millions; strong drink, its tens of millions.' If people will not be moved by the moral and social aspects of the case, will they not heed the pecuniary loss ? Think of it, all ye who yield to the seductive influence of the ' cup ' of Devils, inflaming your brain with deadly poison! Think of it, O! ye guzzlers who complain of enormous taxation and ' hard times,' and find the remedy for the burdens you complain of in your own hands. Daniel Orcutt, Enfield, Conn.
