EDITORIAL NOTES OUR MISSION Now is the season, when people can give more thought to self-improvement and religious necessities. TsTow begins the lecture season ; the revival meetings, prayer gatherings, and sincere outpourings of the soul, variously rendered, for more light. 'Let there be light.' We want to take part in the religious meetings of the people ; we want to be in ten thousands of homes simultaneously, through our representative, The Manifesto. We would willingly meet our friends, desirous of hearing verbal, Shaker testimony, in word, in song and in life-evidences. W'rite us for lecturers ; for singers; and do not fail to write us for a renewal of The Manifesto. Permit us to come to you through its mediumship, if by no other avenue, and we will do you good, our brethren and sisters in natureâ€”all mankind. Send to us your personal subscriptions ; add one more to them this year, and make some other person your everlasting friend.
