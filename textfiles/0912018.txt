OUR PECULIARITY That the Shakers started in the Avorld with any ambition to appear eccentric, we do not believe. That the converts imbibed principles that caused ' a change of heart.' to live differently, apart from worldly fashion, fleshly lusts, and away, even from the gratifications of much worldly good, we believe and know. At the beginning they dressed as was the custom, and declined from principle to engage in the changing fashions of following time. In this they were wise and truly religions. At several periods of fashion's market, the dress of the world has very closely returned to ' Shaker Styles.' We honor our forefathers and foremothers, not for any especially grotesque eccentricity nor purposed oddity of dress, but for their inclination and persistence, even to pertinacity to wear a, plain, comfortable, economical and comely divss. We hope all of these points will be held closely to in the future, and we believe they will be fully as operative in the years to come as in the past, even amid the many innovations now being introduced in the way of dress. Oddity and eccentricity may be and will be cast out; but the essentials, plainness and comeliness will be adhered to. But it must be seen that on mere matters of dress, we are dealing with the comparatively non-essential features of a peculiarly Christian life. Purity, extreme purity of life, with honesty of word and manufactures must claim precedence always, and these must exceed the righteousness of Methodist and Roman Catholics, or what, or wherein can there be a desired peculiarity ? Among our most valuable exchanges, Ave prize very highly The Primitive Christian, one of the advocates of the Tunker Church, and it has the following upon this 'peculiar ' subject. While you read, brethren, think whether we, as a peculiar people, cannot be reminded of a dutiful lesson : WE OUGHT TO BE A PECULIAR PEOPLE. It is said that the Brethren are losing many of the peculiarities that formerly distinguished them from other people, especially that of dress. Now while we believe that we should be distinguished in this respect from the vain fashion worshiper, we also believe that we should be a peculiar people in other things as well. We fear that we are losing our peculiarities in some other things as much as that of apparel. How is it about our honesty ? The time was when a brother's word was as goo4 as his note, but is not our reputation wanting ? Are we as peculiar in this respect as we were years ago ? We believe this matter is too much overlooked and that we have much cause to fear that we are losing the distinguishing characteristic of honesty. Our ministers preach 282 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 283 a great deal against pride and display in dress, indeed some hardly ever preach but what this subject comes in, and would it not be well to show up the evils of carelessness and recklessness in business a little more. Brethren, in their aspirations to become rich, rush headlong into debt and as a result, they have not, in some instances, been able to meet their Christian influence which they are exerting'.
