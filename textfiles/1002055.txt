Some one has judiciously pointed out that a large quantity of the acid which exists in rhubarb, gooseberries, currants, and other fruits, may be judiciously corrected by use of a small quantity of carbonate of soda, without affecting their flavor. To an ordinary sized pie or pudding as much soda may be added as, piled up, will cover a shilling, or even twice such a quantity, if the fruit is very sour. If this little hint is attended to, many a stomach ache will be prevented and a vast quantity of sugar saved, because when the acid is neutralized by the soda it will not require so much sugar to render the tart sweet. How TO detect Poison Ivy The annoying casualty, which confined Judge Noah Davis to a sick-room the other day, might have been avoided if the eminent jurist had paid as much attention to the small as to the large things of life. The poison ivy and the innocuous kind differ in one particular which is too easy of remembrance to be overlooked by any one who is interested in thebrilliant-hued leaves of autumn to care for gathering them : the leaves of the former grow in clusters of three and those of the latter in fives. As somebody has suggested in a juvenile story-book, every child should be taught to associate the five leaves in a cluster with the fingers on the human hand, and given to understand that when these numbers agree they can be brought into contact with perfect safety. It may spare our readers no little suffering to bear this point in mind during their October rambles in the fields. Syracuse Herald.
