White Water, O. Nov. 1891. White Water is still improving. We are taking down some old buildings which makes the place look a great deal better. We are putting up a building for farm implements 18x16. Farmers in this vicinity are husking corn of which we have a good crop. The weather is very dry, and we need rain for small grain. Wheat does not look well for this time of year. Farmers in this locality are holding on to wheat for a better price. It now brings ninety cents per. bushel. We are drawing our winter wood before bad weather sets in. The Center Family have remodeled their dwelling some and have put a cornice around the T. part and put on a new roof. The roof is of iron. They also remodeled their Office barn, put new siding and a new roof of iron on and painted it. Eldress Adeline from Pleasant Hill, Ky. paid us a nice visit on the first of October. We have sold one team of horses for which we had no use, leaving us two teams and a span of colts for later work. We have one rail pen filled with corn containing in all about 400 bu. Cold weather is setting in, heavy frosts and cold days. It is cloudy at the present writing and cold enough to stay by the fire. H. W. F.
