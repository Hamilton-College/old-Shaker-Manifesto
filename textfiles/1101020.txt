THE SHOE THAT FITTED The minister hit 'em every time, And when he spoke of fashion, And riggin' out in bows and things, As woman's rulin' passion, And comin' to church to see the styles, I couldn't help a winkin' And nudgin' my wife, and says I, ' That's you,' And I guess it sot her to thinkin'. Just then, the minister says, says he, ' And now I've come to the fellers Who've lost this shower by using their friends As a sort o' moral umbrellas. Go home,' said he, ' and find your faults Instead of huntin' your brother's ; Go home,' says he, ' and wear the coats You tried to fit for others.' My wife she nudged, and Brown he winked, And there was lots o' smilin', And lots o' lookin' at our pew, It sot my blood a bilin.' Says I to myself, our minister Is gettin' a little bitter; I'll tell him, when meetin's out, that I Ain't at all that kind of a critter. Swinburne's Church Canticles.
