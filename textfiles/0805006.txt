MORAL REFORM JAMES S. PRESCOTT There is a work of moral reform going on in Cleveland, O. which appears to be in the right direction. The 'Temperance Movement' is beginning to assume gigantic proportions. One man by the name of Doan has built a Tabernacle at his own expense which cost $9000.00, capable of seating 5,400 people, in stationary chairs, besides a room adjoining, where prayer meetings are held every day at noon, one hour, and in the even- ing before the general Lecture. This Tabernacle was built expressly for the '•''Temperance Movement,' and was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, by calling in fifteen hundreds of the poor of the city—outcasts, reformed inebriates, who had signed the pledge, and all the repenting prodigals they could find who wish to reform, and live higher, nobler, and better lives. It was for this class that a feast was prepared; the fatted calf was killed; the tables were spread, and loaded with all kinds of good things, and these were the guests invited to come in and partake of the feast! THE SHAKER One of the Leaders in this revival is a Lawyer, by the name of Wm. E. Preston ^ an infidel to the orthodox faith, is doing more in my opinion to help this class than any clergyman in the cityhe throws open his parlor doors, and invites in the poor, not the rich, to partake with him at his own table—he goes from the court room from pleading a civil case, to the prayer meeting, and there pleads the case of the prodigal, with all the eloquence and pathos of an apostle. Another Leader by the name of Camp, is fully his equal. North Union., 0.
