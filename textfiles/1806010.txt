Correspondence. Eld. F. W. Evans, Dear Sir:--In coversation this evening... Smith &amp; McNeil's Hotel, New York, March, 22, 1888. Eld. F. W. Evans, Dear Sir :�In conversation this evening with a gentleman who seemed to know much of your Socie'y, I was pleased, beyond my ability of expressing my admiration of its aims and qualities. It is just such an organization as it would be my desire that the whole world might become, of its knowledge and belief. I have a great longing to know more of its aims. If you have books or pamphlets on bye-laws and constitution, that set forth your teachings, please send me such as you have, that I may know who and what you are, and ' how it is that such a Society can exist and be so little known of. I thought I had heard of almost every kind of belief and existence of societies ; but I never heard of yours till to-day. Hoping an early answer, and success to your noble undertaking� I am, with great respect, E. M. Trowbridge. E. M. Trowbridge, Respected, unknown, friend:-- Your note of 22nd. inst. at hand... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Mar. 24, 1888. E. M. Trowbridge, Respected, unknown, friend :� Your note of 22nd. inst. at hand. You are surprised that, with your knowledge of men and things, the order of Shakers, consisting of some seventeen Societies, was to you unknown until a day or two ago. It is because the Order is ' not of the world.' It is not numbered with the sects, but dwells alone, like Israel of old. It is the 'kingdom of heaven,' for which Christians have been constantly praying for the last 1800 years. It has come ; but not as the orthodox teachprs arranged it. The infidels, like Jefferson, Paine and Washington, came nearer to the truth, in constructing a government securing 'to the greatest number the greatest good,' than did Luther, Calvin, or the popes. The son, who said, '1 will not do your will;' but went, and�unwittingly�did do it, was accepted and blessed. While the son, who said, 'Certainly, father, I will do your will;' and then proceeded, in Christ's name, to establish Bible and Tract and Missionary Societies, and to encompass sea and land to carry a gospel to aboriginal peoples�as in the Congo, introducing amongst them rum and tobacco, and the syphilitic diseases, making those simple souls more the children of hell than they were before, and ten times worse than are they themselves�has utterly failed to do God's will. To them, in tones of thunder, comes the voice, from the Christ heavens, 'Depart from me, ye workers of human misery ; I know you not. While directing the attention of your duped, fanatical followers to an imaginary heaven, ye take possession, by means of your unjust laws, of the land upon which they stand, from which they derive their food�their 'daily bread'� anr! thus constitute them your slaves� either chattel or wages slaves. Verily, I know ye not.' Dear friend, the above may be too 'strong meat;' or if it be that you have been taught of God�by his Spirit, and draw towards the kingdom�as those had been to whom, when Jesus saw them, he simply said, 'Follow me,' and they left their nets to become disciples ; if, having read what I sent you, you still are desirous to know more of a people who turn the world upside down in reality, practically�can you not visit us? If so, come to New Lebanon depot, one mile from the North Family. Love to you. F. W. Evans.
