STOCK AND FARM Drying-off Cows Cows cannot be dried of their milk at once, and some cows continue to secrete milk in small quantities for a long time. But in all cases where the animal has ceased to give milk, or is what is termed ' dry,' she should have her udder examined from time to time, and the teats tried, to see if any milk can be drawn. At first the trial should be made at intervals of two or three days, and if there is a particle of milk in the bag it should be all thoroughly drawn. Then the trial may be made at longer intervals. When cows are supposed to be completely dry, the rule should be to go through lie herd every week, making trial of the teats to see if any milk can be drawn. And this work cannot safely be intrusted to 'hired help,' but must be performed under the ' eye of the master.' Many persons are not aware of the importance of drying cows, and hired help often think it a piece of folly to try to draw milk from a dry cow. Many have lost the use of valuable cows by intrusting this to persons in their employ, and there is scarcely a dairyman in New York who cannot trace trouble in his herd to either his own neglect or that of others. Indeed, so large is the loss every year from improperly drying cows, that there is scarcely a subject connected with dairy management of more vital importance than this. We urge it, therefore, upon the attention of dairymen, and we say to them : Be sure that the work is done properlyâ€”trust no eye but your own, and when your herd comes in milk next spring you will realize the value of this advice. Sex of Eggs A correspondent of The Sotithcrn Farmer tells how an old poultryraiser distinguishes sex in eggs. It is related as follows : ' ' Eggs with the air bladder on he sides will produce pullets.' The old man was so certain of the truth of his dogma, and he poultry-yard so far confirmed it, that I determined to make experiments upon it this year. I have done so, carefully registering every 'bladder verticle' or bladder on one side, rejecting every one in which it was not decidedly one way or the other, as in some it was only slightly out of the center. The following is the result: 58 chickens hatched ; 3 are dead ; 11 too young yet to decide upon their sex; of the remaining 44 every one has turned out true to the old man's theory. I tried it myself and found it to be correct, and I think it to be of great practical advantage. I am pleased to give it my full indorsement, though I would remark that other writers make the statement that they tried it and found no such results. I am breeding white leghorns, which seem naturally to give more cockerels than pullets ; at least such has been the case until last year, when I set only such eggs as had the air bladder on one side, anc in nearly every case they were pullets. Late in the season I set a lot of hens with the eggs just as they were laid, and more than half the chicks turned out cockerels.'
