Sex of Eggs A correspondent of The Sotithcrn Farmer tells how an old poultryraiser distinguishes sex in eggs. It is related as follows : ' ' Eggs with the air bladder on he sides will produce pullets.' The old man was so certain of the truth of his dogma, and he poultry-yard so far confirmed it, that I determined to make experiments upon it this year. I have done so, carefully registering every 'bladder verticle' or bladder on one side, rejecting every one in which it was not decidedly one way or the other, as in some it was only slightly out of the center. The following is the result: 58 chickens hatched ; 3 are dead ; 11 too young yet to decide upon their sex; of the remaining 44 every one has turned out true to the old man's theory. I tried it myself and found it to be correct, and I think it to be of great practical advantage. I am pleased to give it my full indorsement, though I would remark that other writers make the statement that they tried it and found no such results. I am breeding white leghorns, which seem naturally to give more cockerels than pullets ; at least such has been the case until last year, when I set only such eggs as had the air bladder on one side, anc in nearly every case they were pullets. Late in the season I set a lot of hens with the eggs just as they were laid, and more than half the chicks turned out cockerels.'
