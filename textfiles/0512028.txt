SPIRIT COMMUNICATION To F. W. Evans : A full basket, when presented, gives pleasure to the one presenting it, and to the receiver more than he can express,â€” hence all the baskets used in such a manner, would tend to liarmonize a multitude, much larger than are assembled around, or in a so-called sacred edifice, where on a Sabbath Day, the so-called Christian world assemble to offer prayers and praises, to a God they know but little of, straining their every nerve to become popular in their utterances. Making long harangues of little import, more than to evoke the ridicule of men, who are good and great from principle, who prefer a respectful silence to the blarney of a proud and ostentatious priest, who seeks the applause of men without a single aspiration to become approved of God and the 'Invisibles.' James Lawrence, Cleveland, Ohio. March 3,1873
