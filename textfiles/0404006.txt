FOR BOOK-WORMS TO THINK OF To form a correct estimate of books and of what should be our relations to them, we must recognize the fact that a book, no matter what its outward form or subject, represents, in its spiritual character and magnetism, the life of the person who wrote it. In reading it we are dealing with the same personal force and character as we should be if we were in actual contact and conversation with the living author. The conditions and perils of fellowship are substantially the same. Reading a book is like forming a personal acquaintance. Wise men are careful about giving themselves up to fellowship with a stranger. Ought they to be less careful in coming into fellowship with a book ? If salvation and damnation are the results of fellowship, and if books are mediums of fellowship, it would be well to inquire whether in this age of universal book-making and reading, men and women are not in greater danger of losing their souls by this kind of fellowship, than by all others together?
