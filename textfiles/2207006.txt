TWILIGHT THOUGHTS. Sophia Wayne. What lovely views the golden sunsets are, They lead our thoughts to that bright land afar, Where we can see the pearly gates ajar To our fair spirit home. And as we watch the daylight fleeting fast, And think of earthly trials that are past, We know we'll gain that blissful realm at last Where trials never come. Our loved ones who have journeyed on before Are watching for us from yon peaceful shore, We soon shall reach the bright forevermore, Where pain and sickness cease. No earthly creeds will gain our passport there, The Spirit whispers, ' 'Tis by deeds and prayer, Dependence on our heavenly Parents' care That wins true joy and peace.'
