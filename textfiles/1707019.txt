Beloved elder Henry: I enclose letters... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. June 29, 1887. Beloved Elder Henry :- -I enclose letters received from Elder Frederick anil Brother James. The Albany Journal as you will see has published James' letter, and has got it in very correctly. Elder Frederick would like, if you would plea.se put it in the Manifesto, with his postscript. Would write more but have not the time now. We received the letters on the 25th. inst. after waiting over three weeks. General time of health. Our Ministry will be home this P. M. and we expect the Ohio Ministry to-morrow. Be so kind as to remember us in your prayers, in the absence of our father. Accept our kindest gospel love and extend as far as you feel. Daniel Offord. P. S. The music splendid in the June Manifesto ; and all is good. D. O.
