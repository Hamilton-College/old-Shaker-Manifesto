Was Moses Mistaken? Was Moses Mistaken? This is the title'of a nicely illustrated pamphlet from II. L. Hastings of Boston, Mass. Someone has taken the liberty, either carelessly or willfully to make the statement, Moses was Mistaken, and things were not as he stated them to be in the Biblical'History. Br. Hastings becomes an advocate for Moses and in this little pamphlet proves to his own satisfaction that Moses was right and that Sacred and Profane History are able and truthful witnesses of the correctness of all that he said and did. Bead what Br. Hastings says on the subject and then if you are not fully persuaded to walk with Moses, you can make farther investigations. H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
