Simple Method of Leveling An exceedingly simple method of obtaining levels is described in The Manufacturer and Builder. At each of two stations, perhaps a hundred feet apart, a pole is driven into the ground. To each pole, near the top, a glass tube is tied. The lower ends of the glass tubes are then connected with each other by means of a sufficiently long piece of india-rubber tubing. Water is to be poured into one of the glass tubes till it fills the tubing and part of the tubes ; it will rise to the same level, of course, in both tubes, and the record of this height can be marked on the poles along*side. The method is capable of surprising accuracy, and will serve where obstacles to vision intervene between the stations.
