SPIRIT COMMUNICATION The spirit communication published in Nov. Shaker, purporting to come from Mother Ann Lee attracted very wide attention, and has been commented upon most profusely, and always favorably. Had the most astute Shaker of today written that message, it would not have Â¦embraced more of the radical, early faith than it did. Many mediums have persuaded themselves to believe that Mother Ann influenced them to write out messages for her. These would almost invariably contain clauses that would imply recantation of her mission, instruction to 'progress' out of so much sexual purity ; aiming at the destruction of the foundational pillars, etc. But here is one we can afford to believe to be genuine, because it agrees with the communications we receive from time to time ; and the fact that it came through a boy-medium, an entire stranger to us as a people, out on the Pacific Ocean, yet true to the letter of our principles ! Spiritualists and Spiritist Free-lovers, take notice !
