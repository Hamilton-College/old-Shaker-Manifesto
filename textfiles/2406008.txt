DOING GOOD. nnHE heralding of good news is, above all other things, the first duty _I_ of the Christian. Like the Apostle, he is not to 'confer with flesh nor blood.*' Duty to God and to man is the divine watchword which makes all of life one beautiful song of praise. It is 'not in this mountain, neither at Jerusalem.' Where God is, there is life and salvation, in some of its phases, and so long as wrong exists in the family of man, so long will earnest souls and willing hearts find enough to do. Religion does not consist in the singing of psalms, nor in the reading of the Old Testament but it does include the whole of man :�All that he may think, say or do. It originates in his nature and circumstances, and is as early in its manifestation, as constant in its character, as universal in its influence, as are sentiment or principle of action marking the history of man. No better illustration can be given of this, than a reference to the life of Jesus. 'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down hi� life for his friends.' The selfish interest in this case is lost from sight, and man becomes interested in the peace and prosperity of his brother man. Every class of reformers, even though their work is but a slight advance beyond the mass of mankind, find it difficult to obtain those who will work in the interest of their special cause. It is sometimes astonishing to see how slowly the world moves in a moral reform, even in the ranks of the reformers, themselves, while they are making a loud noise against those whom they consider on the wrong track. A man's habits, and they may be either good or bad, seem to become in many cases as a part of himself, and to break from the bad, even when admonished by a higher light, is like tearing the flesh from his body. Indeed, these bad habits sometimes become so strong that the powers of the mind have not force enough to resist them. The Methodist church a few years since had reached the conclusion that the chewing and smoking of tobacco was an unclean habit for a minister, and ventured to ask the ministry to lay it aside. All classes of Christians, at an earlier date, had poisoned the air with the fumes of tobacco, and while they were urging the people to be saved from the wicked habits of the world, they were not able to take up their own crosses against this filthy habit and help to save themselves. Now a methodist minister comes forward with his pipe and tobacco box and THE MANIFESTO. 137 wants the privilege of chewing his tobacco while he reads this word of God to his people ;�'Let him that is filthy, be filthy still.' Among the Rules of propriety for our Community, we have published the following :�'The chewing or smoking of tobacco should not be practiced by any Christian Believer.' Others are made to suffer in respect�to health, through this expensive and unnecessary indulgence. The rebuke of the lady in the western wilds was to the point. The traveler drove up to a log house in a storm and asked for shelter. The lady objected for lack of accommodations, but the man persisted and brought the Bible to his aid, that possibly by doing good to a stranger she might be entertaining an angel unawares. This was a case where ignorance was bliss, as she said, 'You can't make me believe that. No angel would come down here with a cud of tobacco in his mouth.' Every phase of a religious life suffers more or less in this same way. Christianity is an exalted term, and those who embrace it are expected to become resurrected from all that is not admissible in the kingdom of heaven. The ltevelator says that nothing can enter the Holy City that defiles or makes a lie. Temperance people are strong in their denunciations against the use of intoxicating drinks, while at the same time they are using a liberal supply of tobacco. A consistent Christian thinks that cleanliness conies very near to godliness, and yet many of the self-styled saints, keep company with the great unwashed. While the race of mankind is on the upward march, and a wonderful progress has already been made in many ways, there is still more room for improvement. It is sad to know that even one individual is willing or is forced to fall into unclean or corrupting influences, and far worse when a family or a tribe is found to be below the beasts of the field. When Col. Samuel Baker made his journey through Africa, and had men in his own company who might have made slight reforms in neatness without harm to themselves, he at that same time found tribes of the natives whose huts were ankle deep with filth. If a score of persons from these families should enter any large church, the stench would be such that a general stampede would be made for fresh air, and the Bible be closed for that day. This however, is only one degree. The more cleanly wish to be excused, and yet in the face of these drawbacks the march is always upward toward God and toward the Holy City where nothing can enter that defiles. Deny yourself daily, said Jesus, and take up your cross and follow 138 THE MANIFESTO. me. This is so simple and plain that it needs no special illustration. Nothing can ever do away with the discipline that is demanded. To follow Jesus on his march toward God, is a daily practice of self-denial, and it bears its own leward. It is like the water that was offered to the woman of Samaria. 'Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.'
