GOSPEL DAY Union Village, Ohio. Canterbury, N. H. The glorions day is dawning, The day of full release; Even now it is the morning Of saving life and peace : The work of Christ perfeeted. In viefry o'er all sin; That of old was oft predieted ; This day has ushered in. 2. And still increasing glories To us must soon unfold ; That eclipse the ancient stories, The fabled age of gold. The Angels are descending. Once more to reap the world, Bearing plumes of peace, unending. And flags of love, unfurled. 3. Then trim your lamps, ye faithful, Let each and all prepare For the advent of the Angel,â€” We have no time to spare The train is swiftly nearing. The head-lights gleam afar ; Of a sweet evangel cheering, Death's prisons to unbar.
