Sonyea, N. Y. April, 1892. For many days we have been looking through clouds of snow for the coming of spring or the 'Resurrection of Life;' now that it has dawned in all its beauty, glory and perfection, the birds of the air wondrously declare that new life is springing up everywhere, and all the earth is glad again. The old mill is in motion from morning till evening. The music of sawing is heard, and many have come from the east and from the west to get their sawing done, for here is the test of good work. Sister Maria Dutcher has left us for a more sunny residence in the 'Summer Land.' Now that she has crossed the bright river of life, we trust she is happy in her new home, with friends who long ago passed to the other side where 'There is no death.' G. D. G.
