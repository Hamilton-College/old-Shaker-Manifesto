THE CHURCH OF GOD ON EARTH Charles Wm. Butler O Church of God on earth ! What strong and holy ties Are thine by virtue of thy birth And Christian sacrifice ! Hush now the strife of words, Bid every war-note cease And deeply sound the music chords That sing the Prince of Peace ! O Church of God on eartli! The?gazing world stands by, She marks the signs of inner worth And sees the glory nigh! Then speak the truth in love, In faith and patience wait, If thou wouldst see the whole world move Within the Church's gate ! O Church of God on earth! Give thou no place to wrong! Prove more and more thy Heavenly birth And stand sublimely strong1! Build in thy temple high and fair The unifying throne! That truth divine, undying there, May glorify its own ! Selected
