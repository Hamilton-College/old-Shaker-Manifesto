'A RARITY.' 'A good Shaker is a rarity ;' was the remark of a kindly disposed neighbor. Wonder not at it. 'A good Shaker,' means, synonymously, 'a perfect Christian !' One who lives in a state of continual self-abasement, self-sacrifice, in behalf of others. No desire nor time for selfgratification nor recreative pleasure, until serving God by saving souls becomes gratifying and recreative. Picture to yourselves the most thorough type of a follower after Jesus ; one walking in the footsteps of Jesus' life, and you may safely point out such as 'a good Shaker' however rare.
