[Introductory remarks of Elder Joseph Holden, Sabbath, Dec. 5, 1898.'] ''BRING THE BEST.' God wants the best. He in the far-off ages Once claimed the firstling of the flock, the finest of the wheat; And still He asks His own with gentlest pleading To lay their brightest hopes and talents at His feet, He'll not forget the feeblest service, humblest love; The Best we have. God gives the Best. He takes the hearts we offer, And fills them with His glorious beauty, joy and peace; And in His service, as we're growing stronger, The calls to grand achievement still increase : The richest gifts for us in earth or heaven above Are hid in Christ; Him serving we receive The Best God has. And is our Best too much? O friends, remember! How once Our Lord poured out His soul in loss, And 'mid the prime of His majestic manhood Gave up His precious life upon the Cross. The Lord of lords, by whom the wondrous worlds were made, Through groaning grief and bitter tear gave us The Best He had. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
