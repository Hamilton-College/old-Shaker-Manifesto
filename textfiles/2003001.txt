THE CHRISTIAN SOLUTION. Giles B. Avery. What is the true Christian's Creed? 'Not my will, but thine 0 God, be dove.' There has been a national call for representatives of all religious denominations, to meet in the city of Washington, I). C, on October 1st. 1889, for two purposes,�1st., to inaugurate or make initiatory measures for the inauguration of a Congress of nations, for the noble and godlike purpose of settling all national strifes and disturbances by arbitration, thus to disband all armies and institute universal peace ! A glorious purpose ! 2nd. To seek a system of universal religion ; meaning one universal Creed, or Code of Faith. Permit us to consider, first, what is necessary to inaugurate this reign of peace,�the boon of Christ's kingdom. It is a tremendous step of progress! Well, true progress operates to purge out the brute of our natures, the lion, the tiger, the wolf and the ape, and to put on the heavenly angelic character. The Apostle James proclaimed a wonderful truth concerning the brutal, fighting nature, thus, 'Whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members ?' It has been truly said, 'The pleasure of the senses easily lapses into the lusts of the flesh.' Therefore, to inaugurate peace on earth, good will to man, the lusts of humanity must be eradicated, both the lusts of the flesh, and of the selfish human will. Lust is abnormal desire ; there is a lust of selfishness, of power over one's fellows, of dominion, of notoriety, of unmerited honors, of fame, &amp;c. The means to subdue a bad weed, is to root it up ; the same course is needful to subdue an abnormal passion. The way to do this is, first to confess it, then deny its exercise, its life ! Now we come to the Christian standard, as taught by Jesus, thus�'If any man will come after me let him deny himself, take up his daily cross and follow me.' Jesus came to inaugurate the kingdom of peace, and his way of doing it, was to walk in denial of self! Thus we have the solution of the question 'What is the true religion?' 'Not my will, but thine 0 God be done.' A very simple Creed ! Yea, true Christianity, is a very simple, straightforward life! It is the one only way to Heaven. The dogmatic career of creeddom, which, for ages, has been called Christianity, is a hydra headed monster; it has not satisfied the human soul, because it has not contained soul food, and nourishment ; has not lifted the soul to God, or to see God ; has not produced purity of heart. 'Blessed are the pure in heart' said Christ Jesus, 'for they shall see God,' and 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the Children of God.' There is a popular song sung by professors of Christianity to-day, the sentiment of which is, 'Nearer my God to thee.' The only way to get nearer, is to get purer; and the way to become purer, is to purge all sin out of the soul by confession to God, in the presence of his angel witnesses, in human tabernacles, then to walk in self-denial of all the temptations and pleasures of sin. To purify a house, we first sweep, then mop and scrub, then air it, then deny the dirt an entrance, thus it will become pure and keep pure, just so of the soul, our spirit house. But, to purify the soul, and keep it pure, the little, as well as great evils must be denied. It is 'the little foxes that spoil the vines.' A trite old maxim is, 'For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; for want of a horse the man was lost, for the enemy came, and took him.' Even thus, for want of self-denial, salvation is lost; for want of salvation the soul is lost; for want of a soul saved, heaven is lost! But, to return to the subject of a Creed. Creeds are not religion ; they are simply the bony skeleton of true religion. They have, so to speak, no muscular power of action, no blood or spirit life.; to do the mil of God, is the muscular power of religion; its soul life is the power and wisdom of God ; and its life's blood is the inspirations of the Heavens ! But, many professed religionists weary of the strife, because they see the flock of Christ to be small, therefore they fear, for the hosts of the servants of sin are numerous. Well, we are here reminded of Bishop Newton's remark : 'But numbers are no mark, that men will right be found, A few were saved in Noah's a&gt;rk, While many millions drowned. Obey the Gospel call, And enter while you may, The flock of Christ was always small; But none are saved but they;' Also we think of the Prophet Elisha's answer to his servant, who, when the King of Syria sent a host to the city of Dothan to arrest Elisha; and his servant saw them, and said, 'Alas my master, how shall we do.' And Elisha answered, 'fear not, for they that be with us, are more than they that be with them.' 'And Elisha prayed to the Lord to open the eyes of his servant, and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. And when the hosts of Syria came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord to smite the hosts of Syria with blindness, and it was done. Then Elisha told them, this is not the way, neither is this the city ; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek.' But, he led them to Samaria. And Elisha prayed for their eyes to be opened, and it was done, and they saw themselves in Samaria. 'And the King of Israel said unto Elisha,' 'Shall I smite them?' But Elisha admonished him for proposing to smite his captives, and told him to feed them and let them go. 'This was done, and it strengthened Israel's hosts.' This was overcoming evil with good. We are also here reminded of the Theban General�Pelopidas, who, when his Captains told him that the enemy was manifold stronger than his army, replied, 'So much the better ; we shall conquer so many the more.' This intelligent self-possession was better than a thousand spears. So Beloved Gospel Friends, our wise course is, to pray to God that our eyes may be opened to see the hosts of the Lord who surround the pure in heart; then, so to live, that we feel that these are with us, and, that we can confide in them to give us the victory over all the powers of evil that afflict us. Then we will have strength to build up the Kingdom of Heaven upon earth. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
