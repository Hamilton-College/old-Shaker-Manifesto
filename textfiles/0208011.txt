Elder F. W. Evans frequently has an attack of admiration for The Golden Age. In a recent letter to this office, he tried to excite our jealousy, we suppose, by enclosing the following paragraphs, but he failed : The Golden Age Is pure, free from love stories, which corrupt the young. Its columns are open to all representative writers, who can condense their thoughts. It concentrates the living ideas or issues of the Age, being the organ of Progress for the day or time. Is independent, possesses strong convictions; impartial in criticism; not fearing even its best friends, but ' 'hears before it strikes.' If all who read The Shaker subscribe for The Golden Age, they will, thereby, assist in actualizing it.
