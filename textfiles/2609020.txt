No one thinks of f eeding them flesh to add to their strength or fleetness. No wolf or other predatory animal can catch a deer, antelope, caribou or moose on a fair run, but by stealth, sly cunning, watching and springing or hunting in packswhere the fugitive doubles an his tracks and they cut across. So of the hounds and hare. A. O'Leary, M. D. in Human Nature.
