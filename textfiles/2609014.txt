Shakers, N. Y. North Family. Aug. 1896. The editorial in August Manifesto has the true tone in the sentiments expressed. Just such testimony should be constantly kept before the minds of religionists of all schools and degrees of thought to remind them that the Church of Christ, does not use the weapon of persecution to enforce its views upon mankind. We have lately finished the perusal of 'The History of the Reformation;' a work of some 800 pages. To view the depth of spiritual degradation and superstition to which the human mind at that time had sunken, it is not to be wondered at that in its efforts to burst the fetters that bound it the zeal and enthusiasm manifest should at times be paramount to its wisdom. We would like to have some one who possesses greater insight into the workings of the human soul tell us why it is that of all the commotions among mankind, the one waged in the name of religion, so called, has been the most heartless and vindictive. On the 21st of July we had a pleasant call from M. C. Schofield, of Guelph, Canada; a mutual friend of the family and an old subscriber to The Manifesto who spent a week very pleasantly with us, studying communistic life in its various phases. 150 TEE MANIFESTO. On the 28th ult. a party of young people with dinner basket and tin pails started for the huckle-berry swamp where we spent the day very pleasantly in gathering the fruit. Hamilton DeGraw.
