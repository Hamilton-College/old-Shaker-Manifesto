MATERIALIZATION Ed. Shaker Manifesto :—Returning from attending the Randolph Liberal League with Elder F. W. Evans, I stopped at Utica, to witness 'Spirit Materializations,'—William. Eddy, medium. First Seance : About twenty persons present, more men than women. Saw about twenty spirits, but none that I knew. Heard them talk and sing, saw them shake hands with members of circle, etc. Meeting continued over one hour. The next day I went to Eddy's house, looked over the building, talked with William and Webster, but could discover nothing to excite my suspicion, or iaise a doubt. Second Seance : About same number in the circle, sexes nearly equal this time. First Spirit out stepped into an adjoining room, where there was a lamp burning and door wide open; nearly closed the door after it; struck its foot against a stool, turned around, picked it up and placed it out of the way, stopped at cabinet-door and gave us quite a long talk, expressing good sense. Another Spirit came out, shook hands with one of the circle, stepped to the lamp on the mantel-shelf, raised the shade, so that we could see its face plainly; it looked like an old woman seventy or eighty years of age. In other respects the seance was very like the first. All things calmly and patiently considered, I do the least violence to my senses and to my common sense, to accept what I saw as being genuine spirit materialization. I am not of that number who can believe or disbelieve, as they choose ; never say like Beecher in his speech on eternal damnation: 'I can't believe and I will not believe such horrible doctrine.'
