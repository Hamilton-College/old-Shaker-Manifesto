Evelyn C. Strowbridge Evelyn C. Strowbridge, at Shaker Station, Conn. June 26, 1892. Age 42 yrs. 2 mo. and 9 days. One by one they drift away Across the crystal sea. Done with the toiling day by day From suffering set free. Our Sister's gone, we feel her loss, All earthly sorrow's past. Is not our lose her eternal gain! Her toils are o'er, she rests at last, Rest, sweet rest, from care and pain. I hear her sweet voice say: 'Call me not back, the sea I've crossed, Beyond earth's shadowy way.
