To live is not merely to breathe, it is to act... To live is not merely to breathe, it is to act; it is to make use of our organs, senses, faculties, of all those parts of ourselves which give us the feeling of existence. The man who has lived the longest is not the man who has counted the most years, but he who has enjoyed life most. Such a one was buried a hundred years old. but he was dead from his birth. He would have gained by dying young; at least he would have lived till that time. Rousseau.
