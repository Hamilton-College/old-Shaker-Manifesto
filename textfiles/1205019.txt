Tunnel Hill, Ga. Feb. 1882 Lizzie M. Stevenson Tunnel Hill, Ga. Feb. 1882 Editor of Manifesto :â€”I feel impressed to write you a f'-w lines. I have had the pleasure of reading the Manifesto some four years, and it is a welcome visitor. From no other source could I get such good teachings, except from the New Testament. I have a love for the Shaker Society : for its purity and self-denials. I am led to believe that the Shaker Church is Christ's Clrurch, as the faith is that which Christ teaches. I think, however, that some of the writers of the Manifesto are very hard on the marriage question. If the married are all sinners against the law and commandments of God, what is to become of them. I am married and the mother of six living children, and yet I am desirous of living a true Christian life. I am seeking for truth and knowledge and earnestly hoping to obtain it, and yet it seems almost impossible to be a Christian while absorbed in the life of the world. My advice to the unmarried, is like that of the Apostle ; if they are able to deny themselves and take up the cross of Christ, to do so at once, and obtain happiness in this world, and the reward of Eternal Life. I send my love and kind wishes to all the good Shakers. Your well wisher,
