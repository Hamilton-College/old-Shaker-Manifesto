THE SHAKERS' DOCTRINE. Extracts from a Sermon by Elder H. L. Eads( of South Union, Ky, What is Meant by the Second Coining of Christ. The following sermon wTas delivered by the venerable H. L. Eads, Bishop of the South Union Community of Shakers, from the text: 'I am the Way and the Truth and the Life ; No Man cometh to the Father but by Me.' John xiv., 16. 'There is nothing more true than the text I have chosen to-day, and I J hope truth may guide me in all I may | say. Oh, truth ! Sacred truth, thou ' art God ! Then let us have it, though it should transpose ideas and beliefs we may long have cherished. I am informed that new truths are causing | other churches to revise their creed, and may not the Shakers have to do the same since some leaders do not agree on some essential points of doctrine? To this I would say firstly, that the Shakers have no creed. Our faith is Apostolic and unchangeable� one faith, one Lord and one baptism. The faith that saved the Apostles will save the world. Speculative theories may lead some in another direction, but all who are saved must come back to the 'faith that was once delivered to the Saints.' Admitting the charges, I shall endeavor in as few words as possible to correct them. One is the denial that Jesus is the Christ which he claimed to be, and to which his Apostles bore witness. 'These things are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.'�Jno. 20-31. 'For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.'�Tim. 2-5. These are truths, incontrovertible. There was no mediator above and between Him and God as supposed by some. It is as correct to say Jesus the Christ as it is to say Daniel the Minister. Another is that the true Christ came from the seventh heaven, entered in and took possession of Jesus at his baptism, and a third is that a Christ of the Universe came, directed and guided Jesus. Both of these postulates are in violation of the first canon of logic, and no man can know his reasoning is sound without having studied this science and complying with its canons. The seven heavens spoken of have no reference to distances in space, as contended for, but they are the seven conditions of our race, one above the other, from animal man up to Christ, who introduced the seventh and highest condition possible to the race, and which his true followers enjoy. Points in space do not make a heaven for any soul. Heaven is spiritual. God's kingdom is within you, and wherever you are, if the soul is in harmony with God, it is in heaven�if not, it is in hell, even though it should be in the company of saints and angels. Heaven and, hell are both here�you ascend to heaven as you ascend in goodness, and descend to hell as you increase or descend in badness. Thus every one will get the reward of the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or evil, for God is no respecter of persons. You do not have to go above the clouds and into the starry regions to find the one, nor descend into the bowels of the earth to find the other. Astronomy shows the falsity of both postulates; it teaches that Alpha in the constellation of the Centauri is the nearest star to the earth, and that it is 206,000 times further off than(the sun which is 95,000,000 miles distant, and that it takes the light of this nearest star three years and four months to reach our earth. Now it is not supposed that any distinct entity, either spiritual or material, could travel faster than light, which flashes around our globe almost as quick as thought, and were the first material heaven spoken of on a plane with this nearest star, Christ would have said to the repentant thief, 'this day three years and four months wilt thou be with Me in paradise ( !)' But, as 1 have said, heaven is here : we do not have to go among the stars to find it. The Lick telescope reveals enough to show that it would take the Christ of the universe millions of years to visit all its parts, thus confirming the truth that such a Christ is a creature of the imagination and has no existence ; and the same of the seventh heaven missionary. To suppose the seven heavens were seven rings at great distances around the earth would be to make this little ball of ours the center of God's universe ( !) when God is as much here as anywhere in space, seeing every act, and knowing every thought of our lives, for all of which He will hold us accountable. So let us all come back from the stars, accept and obey Him who is the way, the truth and the life, as we never can come to the Father but by Him, Jesus Christ, who never made a mistake or blunder. It is thought by some that He was mistaken on the food question, but He was not: yet all should be Apostolic enough to abstain from any kind of food rather than offend weak brethren who do not know the components or properties of the food 'that goeth into the mouth,' and thus support union and harmony. The second coming of Christ is questioned by many, who wish to know something about the marriage of the Lamb and Bride and when and where it took place, and how Ann Lee came to have that honor. According to her testimony, it was about the middle of August, 1770, over one hundred and twenty years ago. She says she saw the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and she (I believe her, for I have had the great honor of seeing Him myself) conversed with Him face to face, as one person with another, and that, in the presence of hosts of shining Angels and Christ Himself there told her that she was the one of God's own choice to carry on his work, not of generation, but of regeneration, when Ann accepted and owned Him as her Lord and Guide, and ever after that her followers gave her the title of Mother. Thus they became one, and the marriage of the Lamb and Bride was completed by God Himself in the presence of angelic hosts without any priestly ceremony, and she humbly accepted Christ, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, which she lived and manifested to the world the second time as predicted, 'without, sin unto salvation,' and thus ended the mystery of the second coming of Christ, and all who are still looking for Him to come bodily through the clouds are doomed to disappointment, for he came as a thief in the night, as predicted more than one hundred years ago, and he now calls to all the world, saying : 'Come unto Me, for I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No man cometh to the Father but by Me.' '
