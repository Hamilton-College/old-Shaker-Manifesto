Kecall to mind those whom you have seen bear such disagreeable occurrences in a cool, calm, and guarded manner. Observe then how truly noble anJ dignifieJ the person of self-control appears under such circumstances, when contrasted with an xincontrolled spirit. When such a being becomes excited, foams, rages, racks his invention to insult and irritate another, and thereby disgraces himself, and disgusts those around him, then is the time to mark the difFerence between a cool, considerate person, and one who exhibits the ravings of a madman. One appears angelic, the other lost, frantic, and demoniac. Moral Instructions for the Young.
