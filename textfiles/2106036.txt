It is recorded of Breego, a celebrated saint, who, wishing to test the divinity of Christna, who was thought by some to be the incarnation of Vishnu, kicked Mm to see whether it would make him angry. Christna stooped and examined his foot with the utmost tenderness: 'This breast of mine is extremely hard,' said he, 'you must have hurt yourself!' Breego wept for joy. Call this non-resistance if you will; it is the stoutest kind of combat, demanding all the manhood of a man. A. W.
