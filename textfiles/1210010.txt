LABOR ANN E. CHARLES To be happy we must grow an interest in some manual occupation, and in this way have a real love for labor. One of the old philosophers remarked, 'If you do not want it for food, you may for physic.' Action keeps both soul and body in health, while idleness tempts one to stray from the path of duty where they are liable to fall a prey to the evil one. It would be iar better to well improve our time, by doing all the good we can, remembering at the same time the admonition of our founders, 'Hands at work and heart to God.' In this we are able to with-stand temptation, and live honestly and honorably before all mankind. It has been our privilege and pleasure to accept with confidence the instruc' tion of those who have walked the 'new and living way' before us, and it has been to the soul a right and noble way, and a beautiful work of progression. We have, by no means, been idle spectators, but have observed the marked difference that existed between those who were active and interested in the temporal duties of the Community, and those who were indifferent and negligent. It may not be out of place to make mention of a visionary dream as related by one of the sisters. In this a reference was made to the reward of industry, and a marked demonstration of thankfulness was expressed by the sister who had passed from earth, for all of the interest and care she had manifested in her manual employment.
