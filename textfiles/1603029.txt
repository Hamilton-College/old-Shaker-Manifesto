ONWARD! ONWARD!! LUCY BOWSES. ' Onward, onward we may press, Through the path of duty; Virtue is true happiness, Excellence true beauty.' Truly has the poet thought this, anc truly have the noble and great of this earth acted it. Idle dalliance will never accomplish the commonest duties of this life, let alone any high aim or worthynirpose ; it is onward and upward, with perseverance against opposing forces that would dissipate the power of good, and weaken the will, directed in the cause of righteousness. Virtue is happiness, excellence is beauty ; personal charms vanish in the grave, but a life of continual uprightness, fraught with acts of charity, kindness, condescension and good will toward all, forms a blameless character and of itself is a beautiful recommendation, and a seal of happy memories of friends, and of one's own consciousness.
