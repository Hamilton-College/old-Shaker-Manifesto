Alfred, Me. June 12, 1892. 'And God said, let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed after its kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass and the herb yielding seed after its kind.' And it has continued to do so to this day, as our fields and pastures covered with their beautiful mantle of green, give evidence. Just now we are anxious that rain may come and give sustenance to all these beautiful creationsanxious, as though there were not a Power above that careth for all these things. The Brethren are now busy with their hoes, killing the noxious weeds that would rob the precious plants. And are we caring as faithfully for our spiritual garden, the heart, that nothing remains there to rob us of our happiness? If so, I believe it will be well with us, for we read: 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.' Since writing 'Notes' for last month we have been blessed with a visit from our Parents, the Central Ministry with Eldress Dorothy Wright from the Church Family, Mount Lebanon. Elder Joseph was never in Maine before. His Christian love and humility call forth our choicest love. Eldress Harriet and Eldress Augusta we had seen and learned to love years ago. The heavenly ministration of love, blessing and charity which they brought with them will long remain with us to strengthen and encourage us to still persevere on in this beautiful way of selfdenial and the cross, each striving to be good and to do good. As we have received love and blessing, so we would extend our choicest love to all our gospel friends. F. C.
