THOUGHTS FOR TO-DAY Abstract Christianity It is well to remember that an abstract Christianity is neither useful nor beautiful. The value of it is only seen when it becomes a habit of living. The most shapely and beautiful garment loses its symmetry and beauty when it is cast off, and laid upon a couch or hung on a peg. Let it be put on by its owner, and you at once perceive its comeliness. Something like this is true of the religion of Christ. It is not meant to be judged or criticised apart from the lives of men. But when the robe of Christ's righteousness is put on and worn its beauty is revealed to all beholders.â€”Sunday Afternoon.
