SLANDER [Contributed by J. S. Prescott.] Anybody can soil the reputation of any individual however pure and chaste, by uttering a suspicion that his enemies will believe, and his friends will never hear of. A puff' of the idle wind can take a million of the seeds of a thistle and do a work of mischief which the husbandman must labor long to undo, the floating particles being too fine to be seen and too light to be stopped. Such are the seeds of slander so easily sown, so difficult to be gathered up, and yet so pernicious in their fruits. The slanderer knows that many a wind will catch up the plague and become poisoned hy his, or her, vile insinuations, without ever seeking the antidote. No reputation can refute a sneer, nor any human skill prevent its satanic and sarcastic influence, because it originates frdrn a false lying spirit, -- the ' father of lies. ' Selected.
