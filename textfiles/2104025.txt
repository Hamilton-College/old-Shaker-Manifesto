HOW THE OLD MAY HELP THE YOUNG. By Mary A. Livermore. [Contributed by A. J. Calver.]No stage of human life into which Nature conducts us by a regular and universal course, can ever be regarded as an evil. Neither can it be destitute of advantages and enjoyments, if one lives in obedience to the laws of one's being. Cicero tells us in his discourse 'De Senectute' written nearly a hundred years before Christ, that 'only those who have no resources of happiness within themselves are uneasy in any stage of life, and that this is peculiarly the case with respect to old age.' It cannot be denied that it is commonly regarded a misfortune to grow old, nor is there any lack of reasons for this belief. Solomon calls old age 'the evil days, when we shall say we have no pleasure in them.' Milton sat in the sun, 'old and, blind,' afflicted and deserted, unloved and unlovely. Dr. Johnson declared that 'old age had brought him naught but decrepitude.' Carlyle's sad and stern life deepened into a cheerless, starless evening, and went out in a night of gloom. If we had no other examples of old age but such ate these, we might accept as true the poet's utterance, that 'the good die first While they, whose hearts are dry as summer dust, Burn to the socket.' But beautiful illustrations of contented and charming old age, abound in history, and glorify life to-day. Cicero said, 'I have well-nigh finished the race, and perceive in myself with much satisfaction, a ripeness for death. I look on my departure not as being driven from the world, but as leaving an inn.' Dr. Arnold says, 'Old age is the holy place of life, the chapel of ease from weary labor.' Another calls it, 'The Sabbath of a life-timeï¿½the rest that precedes the rest that remains.' Gladstone, Oliver Wendell Holmes and John G. Whittier are living illustrations of an old age which is a glorious consummation of a true, useful and unselfish life. 'Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap,' and the old age of any person, man or woman, will be the result of the life he has lived. The whole record of our lives is laid up within us. What we are at fifty, sixty, and upward, is what we have been previous to fifty and sixty. If then we would have a happy and lovely old age, we must prepare for it, as whatever the old age may be, it is the certain result of a life-time. There must be a physical preparation for it, for good health is a great pre-requisite to happy and useful living. To drop into habits of eating and drinking, of dressing or living, that injure the body, and impair the health, is to sin against ourselves, and with those we are associated. For sick people form a part of the waste and burden of daily life, they hold down the brakes on the progress of friends and kindred, they add to the weight of the mill-stone hung about their neck. No virtue is more excellent in an old person than cheerfulness, and old age without it is 'a Lapland winter without a sun.' But it is a trait of character, requiring cultivation, for there is much in life that militates against it. Fretfulness and despondency are very common faults of persons who have got beyond their youth. 'The world would be better and brighter,' says Sir John Lubbock 'if people were taught the duty of being happy, as well as the happiness of doing our duty. For to be happy ourselves is a most effectual contribution to the happiness of others.' To have constant occupation to the end of life is a great help to cheerfulness, as well as a great blessing. 'I have lived long enough' said Dr. Adam Clarke, 'to learn that the secret of happiness is never to allow one's energies to stagnate.' Bodily and mental decay are both retarded, even in old age, by the constant but not excessive exercise of our powers. Michael Angleo at the age of eighty-three wrote exquisite sonnets, and made drawings, plans, and models for use, in architecture and sculpture. Handel at seventyfive, produced oratorios and anthems. Hayden composed 'The Creation' at sixty-five, and at seventy-seven, was moved to tears of joy, by its harmonies when he heard it performed at a concert. Linnaeus was still a devoted botanist at seventyseven, and exclaimed, 'I am happier in my work than the King of Persia!' Humboldt kept young to ninety in scientific studies, and in publishing the results of his investigations. Mary Somerville, Caroline Herschel, and Maria Mitchel, ceased not from their labors though the dusty years lengthened behind them, and they halted only when the gate of death swung outward for their exit from life. But to wTork and to live only for one's self, will by no means promote one's happiness. On the contrary, it is a fruitful source of intensest misery. The secret of many a joyless life, which has gone out in bitterness, suicide or insanity, may be found in the selfishness which dominated it from its beginning to its close. Only that work which is done wisely and lovingly for others is rewarded with perennial joy. For that is to live in love, which is to live in God. It is to work for God, since He has identified Himself with even the least of his children. And to live in love is to live in everlasting youth. Whoever shall enter into old age by this royal road, whether men or women, will find the last of life, the very best of life. The service they can render to the young, of both sexes, will be invaluable, and will be about the same in both cases. Having learned the lessons, and mastered the tasks assigned to this first school of the soul, while awaiting their promotion to nobler teachers and grander studies, they can help the beginners, who in the glamour of youth are overborne by unconquered passion and appetite. They can demonstrate that they do not lament the days that are gone, and the sensual pleasures that have departed, because better days and larger joys have succeeded them. And like the poet Whittier, they can reason from blessing's seen, of greater, out of sight, and so enkindle in the youthful soul, aspirations for a grander to-morrow than we have to-day, which it shall help to bring in. The young prize personal charms above their worth, and have not learned that the highest type of beauty comes from within, and is not dependent on fleeting youth. Those who have grown old in love with all God's children, and in loyalty to every duty, can teach them how a beautiful soul can glorify a face that age has faded and look out cheerily through eyes whose lustre it has dimmed. When the antecedent life has not been misused or wasted, there comes with increasing years, an abiding conviction that death is but a circumstance in a life that is unbroken, and that the soul survives the change unharmed. And as friends drop away, one by one, and cease from the earth, the certainty grows clearer that they have not ceased to live, and what is called death, is but transition. Can there be a nobler object-lesson to the young than the calm sereneness of the aged, who at the close of a good life, await their inevitable turn to pass out into 'that other chamber of the King, larger than this and lovlier.' Fortunate is the young man before whose instructed eyes stands so helpful and beautiful a presence! And happy is the maiden on Avhom descends the perpetual benediction of the motherly spirit, which has been refined, purified and made strong and wise by the experiences of a long and good life. From 'The Chatauquan.'
