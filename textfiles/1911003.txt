SOLILOQUY Agnes E. Newton. Can I stand where others fall, Unless loyal to my call? Can I live unto the Lord, With my soul engaged abroad? Can I reap a harvest fair, From the seed not sown in prayer? Can I build upon the sand,ï¿½ And the tempest's power withstand? Can I act the worlding's part, And be clean and pure of heart? Can I earth's vain pleasures share And for heaven my soul prepare? Can I seek for selfish gain, Covet wealth and name attain? And still claim as Lord and guide, Jesus Christ the crucified? Can I hold another's sin Unforgiven, my heart within? Or resent the unkind word Which hath human passion stirred? Nay ! but by the Christian rule, I must thought and action school; Strait the gait the way so plain, E'en the simple entrance gain. Follow Christ! Most sacred call, Selfish interests one and all; May I for his sake, resign, Claim Eternal life as mine. 'Not my will,' but Thine be done, Is the test of victory won; 'Feed my lambs,' the proof of love, Recognized in worlds above. Canterbury, N. H.
