THE ETERNAL WILL. Ella Wheeler Wilcox. 'There is no thing we cannot overcome. Say not thy evil instinct is inherited, Or that some trait in-born makes thy whole life forlorn, And calls down punishment that is not merited. Back of thy parents and grandparents lies The great Eternal Will! That, too, is thine Inheritance:�strong, beautiful, divine; Sure lever of success for one who tries. Fry up thy fault with this great lever� Will. However deeply bedded in propensity, However firmly set, I tell thee, firmer yet Is that vast power that comes from Truth's immensity. Thou art a part of that strange world, I say; � Its forces lie within thee, stronger far Than all thy mortal sins and frailties are. Believe thyself divine, and watch and pray. There is no noble height thou can'st not climb; All triumphs may be thine in Time's futurity, If, whatsoe'er thy fault, thou dost not faint nor halt, But lean upon the staff of God's security. Earth has no claim the soul cannot contest. Know thyself part of the Supernal source And naught can stand before thy spirit's force. The soul's divine inheritance is best. Selected.
