Water is not only the best drink... Wateb is not only the best drink God has made, at least for this world, but the only drink. Whatever mixture we may swallow, and whether the thirst is natural or diseased it is the water alone that can quench thirst. And hence, as the legitimate object of all drinking is to extinguish thirst, we should forever, if possible, exclude all drinks from our interior but this pure native element. Dr. Alcott.
