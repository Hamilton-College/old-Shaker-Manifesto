Curbed be the spirit that would dauntless be... Curbed be the spirit that would dauntless be, In the fierce strife of crushing out the truth — the light of age, the guiding star of youth — the priceless pearl of life and liberty. Dark would be earth, had truth no victory won ; still dull monotony would beat her round, while spirits wrapt in stoic sense profound, would, like the glacier, coldly spurn the sun. Then shine, O glorious truth ! forever bright; pursue thy course even to the nether sphere, till Superstition's altars disappear, and error quails, and cowers in trembling fear; till love of right displaces rule of wrong, and in thy triumph earth is filled with light. Martha A.
