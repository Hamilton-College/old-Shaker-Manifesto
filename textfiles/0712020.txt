PRAY WITHOUT CEASING As a number of Ministers were assembled to disuss different questions, among others it was asked low the command 'Pray without ceasing,' could be omplied with. Various suppositions were stated, nd at length one of the number was appointed to vrite upon the subject and read it at their next meetng; which being overheard by a sensible little girl, he exclaimed! 'What, a whole month wanted to explain the meaning of that text! It is one of the easist and best texts in the Bible.' 'Well,' said an aged divine, 'Mary, what can you say about it? Can you pray all the time?' 'O, yes sir.' 'What, when you have so nmeh to do!' 'Why, sir, the more I have to lo the more I can pray.' 'Indeed! Mary, let us snow how it is, for most people think otherwise.' 'Well, when I first open my eyes in the morning, ] pray, Lord open the eyes of my understanding to behold wondrous things out of thy law. And when I am washing, I pray that I may be washed, sanctified and justified in the name of the Lord. And while dressing, I pray to be clothed with humility. And as I begin my work I pray for strength equal to my day, and when I kindle the fire I pray that the love of God may burn in my heart. While I sweep the house I pray that my heart may be cleansed from all impurity. And while partaking of breakfast, I desire to be fed with the hidden manna and sincere milk of the word. And when with the children I look up to God as my Father and pray for the spirit of adoption, that I may be his child; and all day, every thing I do furnishes something for prayer.' Selected
