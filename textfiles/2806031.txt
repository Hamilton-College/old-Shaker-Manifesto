Small Families Small Families by H. L. Hastings. In this little work of less than thirty pages there is a fund of information collected from the Bible especially, which may prove a safe and sure guide to the interested reader. Brother Hastings is an able advocate for the cause he has espoused, and if he can persuade those who have either large or small families, to bring up their children 'in the admonition of the Lord,' he will do a wonderful work on the earth. H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
