Alfred, Me. Jan. 1897. The Christmas and New Year greetings will have long been past before this comes to the readers of The Manifesto. Yet is not every day that comes to us a part of the New Year, and shall we not strive to make it a happy one for our fellow men? Lite is made up of such little periods and if we would live righteously one day at a time, not only one year would be pleasant and happy, but the whole lifetime would be filled with true pleasure and happiness. Christmas witli us was a very pleasant season. Santa Claus did not forge t to visit the children, much to their delight; neither did he pass the older ones by; every one from our aged fathers, who are in the eighties, to the little one seven years old. The Christmas dinner was a feast of goodies. Our meeting was a season filled with rejoicing over the victories won through the faith and life of Him whose birth we celebrated. Peace on earth good-will to all was our theme, with many new resolves to walk more closely in the footsteps of our blessed Lord and Savior. In the evening the members of the Bible Class and Sunday School, gave an entertainment, which consisted of singing, reading compositions, written expressly for the occasion, and reciting dialogs, all of which occupied two hours. The time was very pleasantly and profitably filled. At the close, Elder Henry Green made some very appropriate remarks and all were invited to the diningroom where they partook of ice-cream, cake and chocolate, after which 'Good Night to all' was sung and we retired to rest, feeling it had indeed been a Merry Christmas. It is hoped that love and good-will filled the heart of every one. At this writing, the ground is bare. Ice thick enough to cut, but prefer sledding before harvesting it. Two carloads of apples shipped this week to Boston. Health of Society is good. May peace and prosperity attend the inmates of our Zion homes, is the prayer of your Alfred friends. Fannie Casey.
