BEECHER ON CHURCH PROGRESS. Beecher I have lived to see a great revolution. During my ministry I have seen the time when it would have been preposterous to think of a woman speaking in our churches. But we have overcome the barbarism of that notion. When I became the pastor of this church it would have required all my influence to have prevented the expulsion of a colored man who came in and took a seat here. I have lived to see the colored people not sitting in our churches, but they have become our instructors, they hold office, they sit in Congress, they are admitted to juries and they even ride by our side in the omnibus. It has become my privilege to give notice that a colored sister would give instruction in the missions of this church, and that her work is acknowledged of God and approved of men. This is a great revolution. To have lived to see such a change in regard to the mission of a woman and of a race is to have lived in a glorious day. It has been brought about through much struggle and not a little blood. It is a harbinger and auspicious sign of greater victories in the future.â€” Tribune.
