EXCERPTS FROM HOLY WRIT. Samuel Kendrick. 'Through thy precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way.' Psa. cxix., 104. This saying emanated, no doubt, from the spirit of Christ, the psalmist David being the inspired medium through whom it was revealed. The spirit of Christ is opposed to every kind of falsity. 'T am the way,' said Jesus, 'the truth and the life.' His people being filled with his spirit, speak words of truth and soberness and are pained to witness the depravity, the deceit and misrepresentation so prevalent among mankind, as evidenced in the matter of buying and selling. 'It is nought, it is nought,' saith the buyer, but when he has gone his way, then he boasteth, and the vender is equally unscrupulous as I have sometimes found to my sorrow and disappointment. Let us be mindful at all times that 'A false balance is an abomination to the Lord ; but a just weight is his delight.' Prov. xi., 1. 'All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law' and justice seems to require it. The requirements of the gospel are plain, simple and easy to understand. There is no need of any professing ignorance as to their duty. Just let them consent to do God's will and they will soon know of the doctrine and become wise unto salvation. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
