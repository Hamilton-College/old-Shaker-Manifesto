A GERMAN TRUST SONG Just as God leads me I would go ; I would not ask to choose my way ; Content with what he will bestow, Assured he will not let me stray ; So, as he leads, my path I make, And step by step I gladly take, A child in him confiding. Just as God leads I am conteat, I rest me calmly in his hands; That which he has decreed and sent� That which his will for me commands� I would that he should all fulfill, That I should do his gracious will, In living or in dying. Just as God leads I all resign, I trust me to my Father's will; When reason's rays deceptive shine, His council would I yet fulfill; That which his love ordained as right, Before he brought me to the light. My all to him resigning. Just as God leads me I abide In faith, in hope, in suffering true; His strength is ever by my side� Can aught my hold on him undo? I hold me firm in patience, knowing That God my life is still bestowing� The best in kindness sending. Just as God leads onward I go. Oft amid thorns and briars keen ; God does not yet his guidance show� But in the end it shall be seen How by a loving Father's will Faithful and true he leads me still. Selected.
