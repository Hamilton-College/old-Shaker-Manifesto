REJECTING IDOLS. HARVEY L. EADS. Keep away, keep away, let my spirit have rest, 1 All ye vanishing follies which tend to molest, And to hinder my progress in Heaven's highwaj, From my soul, from my soul, keep away, keep away Keep away, keep away, all ye idols of time, That are only a hind'rance and clog to the mind, That would be of no use, but would lead me astray.] From my body and soul, keep away, keep away. Keep away, keep away, let my spirit go free, That no heavenly gift be withholden from me, And that I may keep pace with the light of the day, 1 From my soul, from my soul, keep away, keep away,. ] Let me live with my Brethren and Sisters in love, And with them in sweet m,ion and meekness improve By rejecting all evil by night and by day, Where all bondage and death keep away, keep away, O my soul keep awake, and be ready to flee, And to hide from the evil which you may foresee, And to be in your duty, this word you'll obey, And from all that is wrong, keep away, keep away.
