The Sun's Orbit. A Tennessee philosopher has made the discovery that our solar system travels about the star Alcyone, in an elliptical orbit, taking twenty-two billions of years for the trip. He claims that this huge cycle has its spring, summer, autumn and winter, and that in its changing seasons the vegetable and animal life on the earth are liable to be ex- tinguished, to be followed by a new order of things-. These are very nice contingencies to contemplate, but the process is so terribly slow that we have little hope of being there to see.
