THE COMING YEAR 1. Hail! hail the glad New Year! Its comingjoy our hearts will cheer; The errors of the past we leave, And truth's advancing light receive. By whose diffusion we may see, The Lamb and lion yet agree, This happy coming year, This happy coming year. 2. Though labors new await our hands, We will not bind in iron bands The talent God to us hath given To make our home on earth a beav'n. But sow anew the precious grain, And scatter broadcast o'er the plain, This joyous coming year, This joyous coming year, The seeds of goodness, love and peace, Of kindness with its rich increase, These in our hearts' best soil shall live, Till blossoms sweet their perfume give, While rlpen'd grain in sheaves well bound, Shall in our garner-room be found, This joyous happy year, This joyous happy year.
