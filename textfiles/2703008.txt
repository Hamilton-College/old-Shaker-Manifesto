Through a drizzling rain we again went to the Church to attend meeting. Our meetings there are always fraught with a living inspiration. We realize that we have indeed 'One Lord, one faith and one baptism' and feel the bonds of union strengthened in sustaining our precious cause. Our family gatherings also abound with food for spiritual, intellectual and social needs. In temporal affairs we have nothing unusual to report. Duties incident to the season are carried along by willing hands and devoted hearts. When prime apples are taken over mountain roads and delivered at $1.00 per. bbl. straw and oClier farm produce at corresponding rates, it is quite easy for us to understand the apparent cause of the thousands of mortgaged or deserted farms. Many students of Political Economy agree that the real cause lies in those vast systems of monopoly which will be impossible when the land, like air and sunlight, shall become the birthright of the people. May not the same necessities which will compel the masses to co-operate for mutual blessing, also urge those within our Order to take measures for a breader communism and fuller manifestation of Christian brotherhood? As a people are we not suffering from a narrow-mindedness and lack of spiritual faith in many among us who are not developt to an appreciation of the spirit of our founders or a capacity to grasp the principles and work understanding^ for their increase? We exist not as a sect, an institution or a community, but as a Church; therefore the sources of our life must be spiritual. With the injunction to 'Seek first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness' was given the promise that 'all other things should be added.' Have we ever yet suffered any lack in the latter when we had been faithful in the former? God is just and his laws are unchanging. Catherine Allen.
