Weekly Memorandum Calendar The 'Weekly Memorandum Calendar' from the office of Stockbridge and Sanders, 'is a thing of beauty and a joy forever,' or rather so long as the year 1896 may continue with us. Thoughtful minds have ornamented every page with beautiful red figures and then provided ample room for a record of all the good things we might do, and for the anticipated hopes of what we would like to do.
