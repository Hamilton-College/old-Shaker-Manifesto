FAINT NOT. ' I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with him an hundred, forty and four thousand.'� Rev. xiv., 1. Enfield, N. H. With, the hundred four and forty thousand I will stand on Mount Zion with the heavenly Lamb, Bearing the seal of the true overcomer, In sacrifice rendering all that I am. Why fear the elements surging around me? I need not faint in the heat of the day; There is an arm that will surely sustain me,�Trusting I'll toil, oh, I'll watch and I'll pray.
