EVENING STAR BIBLE CLASS. Held Dec. 20, 1896. By Cecia Thorpe. Our class, twelve in number, met as usual, at 6-30 o'clock Sunday evening. The lessons for the last quarter have been teaching us about Solomon. But on this occasion it was to learn more of the life of Christ. We opened our school with the song 'Seeking for Me.' Then followed the Lord's prayer. Tor class Bible reading, the subject, 'Christ.' A report of the lesson of Dec. 13th was given. Memory exercises were next repeated consisting of bracket verses, nail heads, teaching practical thoughts, etc. The lesson story perused was upon the Birth of Christ. Text�'And the Angel said unto them, Fear not; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.'�Luke ii., 10. This great joy was the birth of a Savior, who was ushered into the world for the redemption of mankind. Jesus was born in the days of Herod, in Bethlehem, and a manger was his cradle. Yet, strange enough, no enquiries after him; even Herod, only enquiring when he became alarmed for his throne. Herod was the son of Antipater, and had obtained the Kingdom from the Komans to whom Palestine was now subject. He was called 'Herod the Great,' because of his splendid talents, and we might say, because of his splendid(?) sins! He was so afraid that Jesus was the lookt for Messiah, and would take the throne that he ordered all the infants killed, to make sure of his own safety as King. But this did not secure him, for God's plan can not be overthrown by man. Jesus is King to-day. No one need feel so poor, so young, or so outcast but they can find in him a Father and a Friend. Therefore let us draw near to him, follow his footsteps, in the uplifting element of meekness, purity and love. We then listened to a piece from one of the pupils, giving her ideas of the lesson and how we could learn to follow his beautiful example. After the closing song, we parted, each feeling spiritually benefited by what he had heard and received. East family, West Pittsfield, Mass.
