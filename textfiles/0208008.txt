Faith BY F. W. EVANS ' Believe in the Lord your God individually; so shall ye be established in your organiza- tion.' Believe his Prophets, in and as an organization ; so shall ye prosper and grow, ' increasing with the increase of God,'—of Truth Divine,—in your collective capacity, as a living body of Christ, ministered unto by Christ Spirits, those of the Resurrection Order, who never touched the generative life in human beings in the past, except to prophesy of its future death ; and who never touch it in the present, except to kill it, and to elevate the powers and faculties involved therein to higher uses, on a spiritual plane—the Resurrection Order. After Jesus passed beyond John, who, as a Jewish priest, had been his Elder under the Jewish Law, and was baptized with the Christ elements, he ' trod the wine-press alone,' like Adam or Noah, or Abraham, or Moses had done in his day and Dispensation; and as all godly Reformers have ever done in the degrees of the Dispensation in which they stood and labored. Principles are eternal, and Prophecy is of no private interpretation, but is of universal application to humanity. Thenceforth Jesus had no Elder on the earth, unless he came short of the glory of God in any one of the planes of progress in the natural order; then he would have been amenable to the Elders of that plane or order. As ' the Resurrection,' he was ministered unto by the Angels of the Order of God that is eternal in the heaven of heavens.
