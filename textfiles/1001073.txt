JESUS ' We have heard so much preaching about His journeys and sorrows and miracles,' says the Merrimac Visitor, ' that we are apt to think of Him more as a wandering priest, who, when he was thirsty, turned water into wine, and when he was hungry made bread of stones, than a mechanic, the carpenter of a Jewish village, busy with his saw and hammer, and seldom going away from his home. As the representative of humanity, he took the condition not of the few, but of the many ; and though his heart may have gone out for the rich, he had no promises to give them, while his hand was ever extended to the poor, and upon the working masses were his blessings showered continually. There is no character in history, throwing out all considerations of his divinity, that deserves so much to be studied and loved by the laboring people as that of Jesus. To them he was prophet, king and saviour ; to them he was love and wisdom ; to them he was light and life. He drew near to them in their humblest estate ; and he drew them near to himâ€”to his very bosom and fondest embrace. He sat at meat with them, slept in their cottages and wept over their sufferings. We can see how a rich man might be infidel to the teachings of Christ, but why any poor workingman should be is passing strange.'
