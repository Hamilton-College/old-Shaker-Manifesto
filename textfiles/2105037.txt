COMMUNISM OF LAST GENERATION. PHILOSOPHICAL AND BELIGIOUS IDEAS OF UTOPIA CONFLICT IN MANY ESSENTIALS. The writings of Charles Fourier, in many respects vague, chimerical and impracticable, contain certain great generalizations which appealed to the rational, reformatory spirit of his day, and while few could follow him in his arbitrary analogies respecting the origin and destiny of the visible universe, there were many who saw in his writings a prophecy of a purer, freer and more righteous social order. But Charles Fourier drew his inspiration from the philosophical rather than the theological source, and therefore, to such men as Adin Ballou, he did not seem to furnish the inexhaustible spiritual requirements necessary for so radical a social change as he advocated. The labors of the famous Frenchman, therefore, resulted rather in opening the doors of general social reformation to other original thinkers, than in winning proselytes to his own particular scheme. The same was largely true also of the efforts of Robert Owen, who as an enterprising and philanthropic manufacturer, distinguished himself at New Lanark, in Scotland, as a radical reformer in the realm of industry and social science. Then there were also the Shakers, and the Perfectionists under John H. Noyes. From 'Hopedale and its Founder,' by Lewis G. Wilson, in New England Magazine for April.
