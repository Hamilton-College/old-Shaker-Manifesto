DEEDS OF KINDNESS Will deeds of kindness perish, And fall unheeded by the way, Like flowers early gather'd That droop before the close of day ? Or like the young child's picture Impress'd upon the snow's white crust That warming sunbeams (kissing) Blend snow and picture both in dust ? Are words of love, once utter'd [heal'd, Which like sweet balm some wound has Of little worth â€” to perish; Nor yet their own soft incense yield ? Nay, verily ! Such sowing Of seed immortal cannot die ; But life, in rich profusion, Will bloom to greet and cheer the eye. Each act of kindness given, Each utter'd word of tender love, Each injury forgiven, Gleams like the golden rays above. A sigh for others' sorrow, A smile when frowning glances fall, Are pearly tear-drops gleaming. These write a true reward for all. The instruments of heaven, Whose strains vibrate through courts above, Give forth their sweetest music When gently touch'd by deeds of love. The song of grateful praises That wafting breezes bear aloft, Floats out o'er fields Elysian, And mingles with their music soft. 'Tis angels' work we're doing, When ministries of love we fill; 'Tis angel strains we're swelling, When breathing forth 'Let come who will.' Be mine the mission ever To pour sweet balm on hearts distress'd, And, o'er life's stormy ocean, In his name whisper ' Be at best.' Maria Wheeler, Union Village, O.
