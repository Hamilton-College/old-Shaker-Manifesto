Correspondence. Frederick W. Evans, Dear Sir:--I learned from the report... Zolliken, Zurich, Switzerland. Aug. 7, 1891. Frederick W. Evans, Dear Sir :� I learn from the report of the second International Congress, London, 1890, that your little Community is based upon the principles of vegetarianism, adopted by you for its conformity with your religious and scientific persuasion. Now, it is the intention of myself and some friends of mine, all adherents to the doctrines of Jesus Christ and the natural diet of fruit and vegetables, to reform both our spiritual and bodily lives, as much as we can. We are young men about twenty-five years old, and occupied, hitherto, in commercial and official affairs: but, bred in the country and acquainted with country life and rural occupation, we have studied besides, theoretically, the best methods of growing fruit and vegetables at a profit. So, we mean to retire from town, where it is so very difficult to make any progress in the sanctification of the soul, and the improvement of our health, and to take our residences in the country, growing all we want by cultivating the soil and establishing our lives on the basis of brotherhood, after the model given by the first Christians and being described in the second and fourth chapters of the Acts of the Apostles. We know that there are many doubts as to our aptitude for such an enterprise; we are even fully aware that our character is by no means developed enough to equal the glorious example of the first Christians. But our aims are pure and we will earnestly endeavor to proceed in sanctification and education, as well of ourselves as of our families ; and Jesus Christ being ever before our eyes, his holy example inciting us, day by day, to shape our lives after his own, could it be too bold to hope that our endeavors would succeed, at least more than in our present circumstances? So we wish soon to be able to let you know of the starting of our settlement ; and as your principles seem to be the same as ours, we should be very happy indeed if there could be established more intimate connections between you and us, in order to help each other in all aspirations tending to improve mankind, and to secure a flourishing and blessed state of our communities. We are not likely to begin our reform before the lapse of some years : nevertheless, I should be very thankful to already enter into relations with you and the families of your village, and to profit as much as possible by your experience and knowledge. You will oblige me very much by letting me know the statutes, principles and administrative views upon which you arrange your external affairs. As to our respective religious persuasions, I do not know whether they are the same or not; but I can scarcely imagine that the difference, if there be any at all, is very great. Perhaps you will let me know the title of some book wherein I may find all the details in this respect. Hoping to be favored with a kind reply, I remain, dear sir, Yours fraternally, Friedr. Fellenberg. Friedr. Fellenburg and Friends :--Your interesting letter... Mount Lebanon, Col. Co., N. Y. Sept. 11, 1891. Friedr. Fellenburg and Friends :� Your interesting letter of 7th. ult. came to hand in due time. We are very glad to hear of, and from you; and to learn that you are dissatisfied with what is, and are looking for something better. We know how to sympathize with you, having been in the same hoping condition : but now� having found that good thing, which has been so long a subject of prophecy�we enjoy a sabbath of rest. The testimony of Jesus, manifested in the first appearing of the Christ spirit to humanity, in the male part, was a 'spirit of prophecy,' of hope in the future. The early Christians 'knew in part, prophesied in part, and saw, as through a glass, darkly.' They knew God as a heavenly Father ; they were a kind of first-fruits of the tree of redemption ; they looked for a second appearing of the Christ spirit, to effect a more perfect work of God upon earth; they prayed continually for the kingdom of heaven to come. To us, it has come. Christ�not Jesus�has made his second appearance, 'without sin unto salvation.' In the first appearing, the heavenly Father was revealed; in the second appearing, the heavenly Mother is revealed ; it is 'the day of the Lord.' Hitherto, all governments, civil and ecclesiastical, have had male rulers; church and state were united, like Pilate and Herod; and woman was kept in abject subjection. Even under the infidel, secular government of these United States, where all men are declared to be created equal, and en- clowecl with certain inalienable rights ; woman is deprived of those rights, and has not any part in legislative assemblies, 'whose just powers are derived solely from the consent of the governed:' woman's consent is not asked, and has not been given ; she is a slave. You are young men�the princes of the provinces�and intend 'to reform your lives, bodily and spiritually.' Vegetarianism is to be a plank in your platform of principles. That is good; it is better than orthodoxy, founded in the blood of butchers' shops, phys.ically, and in the blood of Jesus spiritually. In orthodox Christendom� Babylon�is found ' 'the blood of saints and martyrs, and of all the blood shed upon earth.' Buddha says, 'Thou shalt not kill:' is not that better than Babylon Christianity, wherein all creatures are killed and eaten, and wherein church and state agree to train all the able-bodied and healthy young men, for several years, in the art of killing each other? Nine millions of men in Europe are now separated from social life, from agriculture, from marriage, who ought to be the very ones to propagate human beings, instead of killing them : and what of the corresponding nine millions of women, who have a natural, inalienable right to husbands, who should be the noblest of the race ? Now they have to marry the debris of manhood, that the doctors have rejected as physically unfit for soldiers, to kill and be killed. Dear friends, look closer, deeper, if you would succeed in 'establishing your lives on the basis of brotherhood, after the model given by the first Christians;' as shown in Acts ii., and iv. We will refer you to seventeen companies of men and women who have lived in brotherhoods and sisterhoods for one hundred years ; as Peter referred those who had arrested them, to the impotent man who had been healed. In all of these Societies, no one lacks food, care, clothing, house nor land. Are not these what you seek to secure, in process of years? Why seek ye the living present among the dead past? Wherefore are you like the Jews, looking for the Messiah, when the Messiah lay in a manger, or talked to their wise men in their temple; or, like the antichvistian world�Greek, Catholic and Protestant�who keep praying for Christ to come and establish the kingdom of heaven upon earth, do ye go about, to seek that which is found, and to creuce that which exists, already, in glory and overcoming power? Rather, come and see what God hath wrought, as the queen of Sheba came to see Solomon's temple; and you shall find that 'a woman has compassed a man,' and has established a system of redemption, more perfect than the Pentecostal model church�a spiritual temple, which Solomon, in all his wisdom, attained not unto, any more than, in all his glory, he could clothe himself as the lily of the valley was clothed. Christ has come into Christendom's dark ages as a thief, in the night, works his will, while the occupants of the house are in deep slumber. 'Watchman, what of the night? The morning cometh, the day is dawning, the sun of righteousness has arisen, with healing in his wings,' not for one poor, impotent man, but for the saints under the altar, who were crying, 'How long, O Lord, shall we have to wait for the fruit of our labor and suffering, for our reward ?' And answer was given, 'Be patient, until other saints and martyrs, like you, shall be killed by those who think their infernal, inquisition torturing and killing them, is doing God good service, under church and state governments.' These are now supplanted by an infidel, secular government, which was founded by Thomas Paine, Jefferson, and fifty like them, who signed the Declaration of Independence. Under a republic, there is peace and safety, liberty of conscience, and none to make free men and women afraid. Glory to our Father and Mother God, in the highest! Could not some one or more of your company come over, as the spies to the land of Canaan? We have room and work for all of you, if you are ripe for so spiritual a work as we have devoted our lives unto. � Perhaps, some of you would prefer to marry and be given in marriage : let such remain, and form a co-operative society, but not attempt a community. A community is where the Lord began to show his city, at the day of Pentecost; on that basis, 'no man's building will be able to stand.' Try it, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Co-operation belongs to the new earth: community to the new heavens�the Shaker order. I will send you some of our writings ; and if, upon further acquaintance, you are still interested and attracted toward the Shakers, 'upon whom the ends of the world have come,' we shall be pleased to continue the communion of saints thus commenced. Much love to you from your Shaker friends, by F. W. Evans.
