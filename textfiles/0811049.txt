Our Diet â€”Chemical analysis discloses the fact that among the many articles used as food there are only two, wheat and milk, which contains all the elements of the human body, and in the proper proportion. Other articles, such as butter, sugar, syrup, and fat of all kinds, are wholly carbonaceous, or heat producing, so that if a human being were to attempt to live on these articles alone his brain and muscles would starve. By actual experiment it has been found that a man could not survive two months on such a diet.
