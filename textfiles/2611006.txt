WHAT IS TRUE LIFE? By Lucy S. Bowers. To eat, to drink and sleep, to tread the mill Of habit day by day with lack of thought, We know is not true life, nor is it wrought By the mere lapse of years, by selfish will, Nor does the strife for gain life's ends fulfill. When earnestly faith's battles all are fought, When in our strife another's good is sought, Then does sweet blessing on the soul distill, The merry laugh that vibrates through the heart, The hopeful prayer that brings the future near, The struggle, yea the tender tears that start, The cares that end in trust, the songs that cheer, These are of true life certainly a part, If thus we live, death brings no gloom or fear.
