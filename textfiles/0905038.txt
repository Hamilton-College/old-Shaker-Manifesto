Lime water A handy thing to have in the house is a jar or bottle of lime-water. Pour water over unslacked lime (the quantity; is not important, as only a certain amount will be slacked), and cork up for use. A spoonful of the clear liquid stirred into milk, cream or bread sponge in danger of souring, will prevent that catastrophe. It also cleanses bottles, etc., that have an unpleasant odor. A person who needs milk, but whose digestion is so weak as not to manage it, will find no inconvenience if into a glass of the lacteal fluid is stirred a wineglass of lime-water. The difference in taste is not perceptible.
