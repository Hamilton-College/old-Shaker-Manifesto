Sabbathday Lake, Me. March, 1896. While we are aware that the time draws near for Home Notes, we can think of nothing but the happenings of the past week, and these every newspaper in New England has described, therefore all there is left for us to tell is,'The rains descended and the floods came and the winds blew,' and beat upon our home and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock. During the eight days of fearful storm we were saved from disaster,held, as it were, in the hollow of God's hand. Indeed, we feel grateful for his Omnipotent power that so kindly shielded us through danger. Who was not glad to see the brave 'Toil On' which the Feb. Manifesto announced to its readers? Your efforts are appreciated, beloved Editor, and we in t!;e east, have all concluded to 'Toil On' with you, thanking God that the Believers are still able to publish our paper. Our aged Sister, Mary Jane Jones has happily passed to Spirit life. She had been feeble for a long time and one morning when we little thought of death, took her departure. The fear of death she did not know, The grave had lost its sting! Triumphant now, o'er all below, With the redeemed she'll sing. Ada S. Cummings.
