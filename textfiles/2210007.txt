THEY SAY. Margarett Hopkins. (Contributed by Maria Witham.) What heart that throbs without some pain; What day that's gone can come again, What troubles come, what sorrows fall, Into the pathway of us all. Trample with scorn this serpent foe, That meets us all where'er we go; Lock fast the door of house and heart, Speak kindly or without remark. Find life too grand, the years too fleet, To plant sharp thorns in others feet; Come out, come up, keep far above, All words that mean not Peace and Love. I would that Woman work, and pray, To fill her place as best she may, And scatter seeds of love each day, For heaven will hold no dread they say.
