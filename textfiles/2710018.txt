Sanitary. THE DIETETIC INFLUENCE OF SALT. The excessive use of salt is a most common dietetic error, and yet one which, curiously, is seldom referred to by writers upon dietetics. The reason for this may be the fear of criticism in view of the experiments of Boussingault, which have been so frequently quoted in physiological treatises that they have assumed almost equal authority with the classical experiments of Harvey upon the circulation of the blood. The observation of many travelers, as well as many facts of common experience, contradict the conclusions of Boussingault regarding the necessity for the addition of salt to the food of human beings. For example, Mungo Park found the native tribes among whom he traveled living entirely without salt. The natives of Siberia make no use of salt; and in all Central Africa, salt was unknown until introduced by travelers and missionaries. The native tribes of North America, when discovered by white men, and so long as they remained in a primitive state, made no use of salt. Travelers have observed that the antelopes of South Africa do not visit the salt licks, as in some other parts of the world, and it is well known that the herdsman on our Western plains never give salt to the thousands of cattle that are there raised for the Eastern market. In certain parts of England it is the habit of farmers to give their herds no salt, yet the cattle produced in these countries have the reputation of being the finest in the world. The conclusion drawn from these observations is that the use of salt by human beings is rather a matter of habit than of necessity, nature having probably exhibited the same wisdom in regard to the amount of salt placed in our food as with reference to the other salts required by the system. It is evident from these facts that the use of salt as a condiment is injurious to digestion in two ways;� 1. It diminishes the amount of hydrochloric acid present in the gastric juice by provoking the secretion of a large quantity of neutralizing alkaline mucus. 2. It diminishes the disinfecting power of the hydrochloric acid which is unneutralized. In view of these observations, it must be clearly evident that the amount of salt used should be reduced to a minimum. The presence of so much of it as exists in the urine and perspiration is evidence that it is not utilized in the body in the same way as organic food substances,�in other words, it is neither changed nor retained in the body, but is rather discharged from it; and it may be easily conceived that additional injury may arise from the excessive eliminative work required of the kidneys in consequence of its excessive use. For many years the writer has found it wise to urge upon patients suffering from indigestion, the importance of lessening the quantity of salt taken with their daily food. Several eminent French and German authorities have been investigating the influence of salt upon digestion, and find that it does not in any way encourage either the secretion of gastric juice or its activity; that it deteriorates the quality of gastric juice, and hence interferes with digestion. This is true even when the quantity of salt used is small. It has been found that so small a proportion of salt as four-fifths of one per cent, not only diminishes the activity of the gastric juice, but increases fermentation in the stomach by neutralizing the anti-septic properties of the hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice. So, no more shaking of the salt-dish in the dining-room! Good Health.
