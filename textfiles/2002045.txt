To the Manifesto:--Hope is the morning star of life... To the Manifesto : ï¿½ Hope is the morning star of life, shilling forth to illuinine our pathway, and guiding us to scenes of- -future usefulness. It sustains us in all trials, and under all circumstances, and ic an anchor to the soul. O beautiful harbinger of the future, I love thee! When our Gospel Parents left their native land, and sailed over the broad waters of the Atlantic in anticipation of securing a Home where they could enjoy freedom of thought, -hope was exercised through all the hardships and perils they were called to endure. And have they not experienced the full fruition of those hopes? Words fail me to express my appreciation of its power and strength, for it, has blessings for both body and soul. Thosre who are suffering from the stern hand of oppression, and want, are comforted with the hope that the sun will soon break forth from beneath the dark clouds, and they hear the command to hope on, and to hope ever. Without gospel vision we could not see why we meet so many disappointments, and so many hopes are thwarted. These we do not comprehend until 'we open the vojume of inspiration. Time bids his minstrels play continually the plaintive air of hope. And has not Divine goodness made the flame to burn bright upon the altar of devotion and mount to the very gates of the heavenly city? We plough in hope, we sow in hope, we reap in hope. Surely then is it not an element of happiness, her soothing anodyne is always ready. Remove it and from the mental -horoscope is expunged one of the brightest stars that illumines our pathway which otherwise would be forever dark. God has given it to us, bidding us allow its inspiration into our souls to enrich them. Enfield, Conn. Maria Witham.
