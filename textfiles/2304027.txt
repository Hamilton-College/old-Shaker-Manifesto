-Alfred., Maine. March 12, 1893. Febetjaey gave us all the snow desired. I presume the clerk of the weather got tired of so much complaining and concluded to send down enough which he surely did. The teams were out nearly all of one week breaking roads. It took some little time for the roads to get in condition for travel. The Brethren have well improved the sledding, for one hundred and forty cords of wood have been cut and hauled, ready for sawing, also one hundred thousand feet of lumber. To-day's rain has taken much of the snow, and before long we hope to enjoy the warm sunny days of spring. The Editorial notes in March Manifesto were excellent. May the strength and blessing of heaven sustain the faithful watchmen of Zion, and may their days be prolonged for Zion's sake, that the principles and truths of this gospel may be proclaimed and maintained, is the prayer of a humble and sincere laborer in the vineyard.
