'WEARY NOT, 0 CHRISTIAN PILGRIM.' RICHARD FLETCHER Who says the Christian pilgrim wearies ? Surely not in spirit, in this bright day ! One may be so weary in body, from zealous temporal labor, that the best affections are robbed of their share of the richest elements, and droop earthward, instead of climbing God-ward. Does scarcity of numbers dishearten 1 What are numbers, when the weight of the spiritual universe is on one's side ? The census of the innumerable throng would add a long string of ciphers to the right hand side of our present figures. No earthly statistics have as yet found room for the count. Let those weary who dissipate in building hopes of happiness on selfish pursuits, on the sands of trashy amusements. It belongs to the bubbles, on the surface of the stream of life, to weary of circling round and round in the frothy scum until they vanish. Let the bubbles whirl and sparkle at the foot of every little brookfalls, to amuse the eyes and lull the drowsy ears of idlers. Yet we all know the useful under-current of the stream is the hope of the miller, as it quietly throws off the glittering bubbles and hastens on. Happy are they who can see the nobility of living like the Christ; they receive a rich, hundred-fold reward in return for the sacrifice of a life of a transient pleasure and animal sensations. It is well worth the labor to be so consecrated as not to be even tempted to waste a moment in sighs for the bubbles and trash of life. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
