RELIGION. [Contributed by Sister Mary Whitcher.jGod has given to man religion, the most priceless gift that flows from his boundless love, but alas ! what horrible, what detestable things have gathered around it J Religion, what crimes have been committed in thy name! we say, What I religion guilty of wrong! it is not, it cannot be. Religion! it is of God, divine and holy. It is pure light, undarkened by a single shadow of wrong. Religion I it is the pure heart, the tender love and sympathy, the devout and aspiring soul, the Christ, embodied in human flesh, bowed in reverence and adoration before the God of infinite truth, love and goodness. Religion! it is an angel of light and peace, in whose serene countenance is no taint of evil passion, no sign of bitterness, but with its radiant and divinely illumined presence ever pointing and lifting men upward and ever upward to that rift in the clouds of sin and misery through which streams forever a ray from the everlasting light and peace of heaven. What is it then that taints the fair name and reputation of that which should be above all reproach or suspicion, what is it that permits the scoffer or the skeptic to pronounce the holy name of religion with a sneer of ridicule and contempt? It is this monster theology that has all along clung to its garments surrounding it with all the hideous distortions of human passion and error. It is theology that has burnt heretics at the stake; it is theology that has led armies forth to scenes of blood and carnage, shamefully forging the sacred name of religion to inscribe it on their brutal banners ; it is theology that in all the ages have made men narrow, hard and cruel, and if anywhere in religion past or present there has been anything lowering, weakening or degrading to human life it can be traced back to this destructive parasite of doctrine and creed which has all along well-' igh strangled all life and fruitfulness out of this delicate and tender plant rooted as it is in the finer elements of the human soul. Oh theology what crimes against religion hast thou committed, what terrible wrong and injury hast thou done to this divinely sent messenger that would fain lift men up from their small and sluggish ways of living I I have seen it crush all the religion out of a soul that otherwise might have been religious. I have seen conversions which were nothing but conversions to a peculiar belief or dogma produce a change for the worse and not for the better. I have seen it transform a natural hearty and buoyant life into an artificial, sanctimonious socalled professor of religion. Instead of making the soul broader and larger, more open and receptive to truth and goodness wherever found, theology narrows and darkens the mind, and fosters only distrust and enmity toward anything not labeled with its own little petty creed and profession. Theology again is skilful and cunning in its power to counterfeit religion. It permits a person to live thirty, forty or fifty years under the delusion that he is living a religious life, when there is nothing of religion about him. Forty years of religion, what would that mean? Why, it would mean forty years of uninterrupted growth and progress toward divinity. It would mean forty years every day of which would make the heart more tender, loving and generous; the temper sweeter and more subdued, the spirit quickened and alive to holier influences, the very countenance transfigured with love to God and man. Why, I believe that if there was among us to-day one single soul that for forty years had professed religion pure and undefiled that soul would be fitted to the homage and worship of man as was Christ himself. We should flock around that soul as did sinners of old around the Master. We should strive to gain one touch of his garment, to hear onï¿½ gracious word from his lips, to catch one glimpse of his face. And from that vision of a life made divine as from a vision of the Father we should turn to take up our cross and follow in his footsteps. Why do we not see something like that as a result of Christian discipleship? Why, because there has never yet been a life-time consecrated to pure and undefiled religion. There have been lives consecrated to theology usurping the sacred name of religion. It has been a belief, a dogma that through all those years has led and governed the life. For that dry, hard doctrine they have lived and fought and contended ; for that they have hated and denounced as heretics all those who did not agree with them; on account of that belief they have congratulated themselves upon securing God's grace and salvation; on account of that profession of the one true creed they have looked forward to some sort of a heaven that awaits them hereafter. Theology has driven out religion, the letter has driven out the spirit, the form has dried up the very fountains of life. And it is only by. and by in that great day when all scales shall fall from the eyes and the soul shall stand clear and full before the eternal light, when it shall be seen that God judges not by what a man believes but by what he is, it will then be seen how utterly useless and contemptible is all the theology that the world contains in comparison with one single spark of pure and undented religion.
