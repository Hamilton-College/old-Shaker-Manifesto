A Paris Journal states... A I'mis Journal states that the bad smell and taste of Butter may be entirely removed by working it over in water mixed with Chloride of Lime. Take a sufficient quantity of water to work it in, add twenty-five to thirty drop! Chloride Lime, for every ten lbs. Butter. When thoroughly worked in this solution, it should be worked again in pure water, when it will be as sweet as when first made.
