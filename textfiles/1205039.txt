A LESSON IE ECONOMY What could be more disagreeable and dee dedly uncomfortable, than stiff, hrrd boots and shoes, made so by constant soaking, and the lack of greasing. Whenever we see little boys or big boys with such comfortless coverings for the feet, we feel just like giving- them this simple lesson in economy. Do you know that your boots and shoes are made from the skins of animals? Now Nature has supplied the skia of all creatures with an oil to keep it soft and pliable, if the oil which is natural is allowed to waste by constant wetting, and none added to supply this waste, the leather in consequence becomes hard, unpliable, and very soon unsuitable to be worn at all. To remedy this, if your shoes get wet, thoroughly grease them ; then place where they can dry, but never near a hot tire, where you cannot bear the hand. It is a better plan to oil the shoes before wetting them, and the water will not be so readily absorbed into the pores of the leather. Castor oil, and neat's foot oil are Doth good. Canterbury, N. H.
