My dear little sister Emma Bell; Four years ago on a... Shaker Village, N. H. 1885. My Dear Little Sister Emma Bell;- - Four years ago on a bright October day a little girl was brought here by her father to claim a place as your sister. Now, you have gone from home. Although she has a great many more sisters, yet she misses her own little Emma Bell and prays every evening that no harm may come to her, but that she may return again safely. Do you know who this little girl was or is? Well, I have never regretted the day nor the working of the good spirit that put it into the mind of my dear father to provide me with such a good home and so many dear little sisters to love, and who, I am sure, love me in return. Then the dear, dearer and dearest friends, who are each day caring not only for all my physical wants but the wants of my soul as well. Just think, Emma, you and I will some day be women and what place in our home do you think we can fill? I am studying music a little and would like to be a music teacher, would not you? I have been sewing during the past week. Sometimes I have changed this work to help the sisters assort the winter apples, and once or twice have assisted Sister Sarah Frances and others. AVe have set out the tulip bulbs that will bloom this Spring. These are the first flowers that bloom after Winter, as you know, and I think they get more notice than any other flower, because they are the first. As I look from my window I see some very pretty trees. In one or two places, they are so placed that they look very much like bouquets of flowers. Would you not like to see this pretty picture? Please accept the love of sisters Mabel, Josephine and my dear teacher Helen for Sister Dorothea, Mary Ellen and yourself, also my kindest love. Your Little Sister, Lizzie Horton. Age, 13 yrs.
