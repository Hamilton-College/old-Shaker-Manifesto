LET BYGONES BE BYGONES LET BYGONES BE BYGONES. Let bygones be bygones; if bygones were clouded By aught that occasioned a pang of regret, Oh, let them in darkest oblivion be shrouded; 'Tie wise and 'tis kind to forgive and forget. Let bygones be bygones, and good be extracted From ill over which it is folly to fret; The wisest of mortals have foolishly acted,â€” The kindest are those who forgive and forget. Let bygones be bygones; oh, cherish no longer The thought that the sun of affection has set; Eclipsed for a moment, its rays will be stronger, If you, like a Christian, forgive and forget. Let bygones bo bygones ; your heart will be lighter, When kindness of yours with reception has met; The flame of your love will be purer and brighter, If, Godlike, you strive to forgive and forget. Let bygones be bygones; oh, purge out the leaven Of malice, and try an example to set To others, who, craving the mercy of heaven, Are sadly too slow to forgive and forget. Let bygones be bygones; remember how deeply To heaven's forbearance we all are in debt ; They value God's infinite goodness too cheaply Who heed not the precept, ' Forgive and forget.'
