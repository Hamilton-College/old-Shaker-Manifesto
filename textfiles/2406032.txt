A young woman... A young woman thinking that her mission lay in wearing a black frock, and telling little children all about heaven, became a nun. In six weeks she was ready to return to her father's home. She was home sick. There is a time in the life of most girls when the humdrum, everyday home existence seems not worth living. Commonplace tasks seem unworthy of such consideration as her mother requires of her, if she is a good housekeeper. The girl longs for a more spiritual existence; thinks to find it in talking with poor little outcasts about God. It usually takes more than six weeks, however, for her to find that life upon this earth is likely to be a pretty practical one in whatever sphere it is cast. Before a Little Sister of the poor can consistently talk of the better life beyond to a ragamuffin she must wash its face, probably with her own hands, and provide clean garments for it also with her own hands. Then she may have to go from house to house asking for food for it. Into the busv business offices these women go, and gladly accept small sums of money, for which they literally beg. Somebody has to do such work, and all honor to those who are faithful in it, yet it is pre-eminently a practical life, full of the petty disagreeable duties which are so hateful to the girl who goes away to be a 'Little Sister' because her work at home is too earthly. ï¿½Selected.
