Union Village, Ohio. Dear Elder Henry;ï¿½On Friday night April 11th, our wood-house containing an oil room and two other rooms for agricultural instruments was burned, together with a garden house standing about a rod south of it and separated by a wagon road. The wood-house was 90 feet long by 22;W&gt;' wide. The garden-house was 18 by 18, and two stories; both frame buildings. The woodliouse stood 54 feet south of, and parallel with our dwelling-house and the miracle of all miracles is, how we saved our dwelling. The whole roof seemed covered with blazing cinders, and the belfry burned, and cinders flew over to our Brickshop 8 rods to the North and set the roof on fire, and yet we saved both buildings. The Center and North Brethren and Sisters, Ministry and all were soon on the ground and for three or four hours we fought the ghastly foe and finally arrested his ravages. The fire commenced about two o'clock in the morning and was subdued about five A. M. Our good Brethren and Sisters from tin; Center and North, remained with us, drying up inundated rooms and halls carrying in the furniture, bedding &amp;c, which was carried into the street until we were all tidied up once more and for their love and sympathy so practically demonstrated we say God bless them all. Also, it would be wrong to fail in giving just and righteous credit to our hired friends for their almost super-human exertions in saving us from temporal ruin. I can say in truth if it had not been for the assistance of the hired help from our own, and Center and North families our whole premises would have gone down before the devouring element. If the property had been their own they could not have exerted themselves more to save it. Finally, as Eldr'ess Adaline said to me, the next morning, 'We still have a beautiful' home' and that is so many fold better than it might have been, that we feel able 'to raise a tax on our calamity' and feel thankful for this sweet Home and the blessings left to us. The damage done to our Dwelling House will amount perhaps to fifty dollars fully covered by insurance. Happening to be flush of water, the wet winter and spring which we complained of so much, was the very thing that saved us, for all our exertions would have been futile without an immense amount of that grateful element. The fire is a profound and inscrutable mystery. No one can tell how it came. We planted a patch of early potatoes last Friday. The Center family are planting four or five hundred young apple trees and some cherry and plum trees, to make up the deficit, caused by the Cyclone. We are about to plant some cherry trees ; and already have several hundred apple trees. Now dear Elder Henry this is about the best we can do in the way of tidings this time. Love to all. Pray for us. O. C H. April 2.
