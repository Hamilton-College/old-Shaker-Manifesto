DUTY. JOHN WHITELEY. Think oft, of your dutj to God, Though sorely afflicted you be; Not through fear of the rod, Nor yet because danger you see. Think more of your duty to man- - Your brothers and sisters on earth; The surest of ways that you can Prove your claim to heavenly birth. Fail not in your duty to do, Nor yet in your duty to know; Words may be well, prayer \h, too; But add to them works, and keep low. The true 'faith which worketh by love,' Has no ne^d for fear of the rod; Our duty, below or above, Will lead us in safety to God. Shirley, Mass.
