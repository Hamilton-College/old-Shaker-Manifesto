SPECTACLES. [Contributed by Harriet Hastings.] If within our own homes we would use the same 'specs' That we use when we visit next door, And search for the flaws as we did over there, I think we would find many more. If we'd use the same 'specs' when we look at ourselves That we don when our company's near, I fear we would need what would magnify less, Or astonished we'd be, never fear! But I find all possess (where'er they may live) For their own use a kind deftly made, With the glasses all darkened, to hide half the view, So their own faults remain in the shade. But the ones which they use when at others they glance Have the glasses transparently clear, With a power to magnify things twice the size [appear That the same through the dark ones Now I think that the world would much happier be If the 'specs' once for all, we would change, And within our own rooms use the spectacles clear, [range, With the dark for the much broader Then, the faults that appear to us jaggedly rough, Would melt into outlines so fair We would find that the world was a beautiful place, And good people lived everywhere.
