GOD'S PLOWING. [Contributed by Amelia Tait.] I was walking once in the early spring along the country road. Just over the stone fence yonder there was a broad field, smooth as the floor, and most exquisitely arrayed in the fresh spring greenness of its grass. It seemed to me my eyes had rarely fallen on a sight so lovely. But ripping right through that smooth and pleasant greenness there was being dragged a plow, and the fresh beauty of the fair sward was being turned under from the sun and air, and only the ugly brown soil was being turned outward, and all the fair and radiant scene was being changed and scarred. 'Why?' I asked myself. I do not have to wait long for an answer. The 'chastisement' of the fair field was in order that the autumn might find it golden with the more precious harvest of wheat. Well, God's ploughshare cuts; but never for the simple sake of cutting; always for the result of characterï¿½fairer, sweeter, nobler. There is benign design behind our chastisement. Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees. The Christian Witness.
