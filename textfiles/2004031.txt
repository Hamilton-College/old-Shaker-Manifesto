NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North Family. Mar. 3. 1890. Another link in the chain of time has been looped and welded. It is short but mighty. Its experience we never want repeated, although we have learned some very valuable lessons. Sometimes we think we have learned, but amid time's changing scenes we often find we do not remember till afterwards. There seems to be in all of us an innate desire to pry into the future; but wisdom keeps it concealed. 'Who can lift the veil that screens the future from our view, Who can pierce the misty shadows that obscure the good and true; Hath not the Father wisely kept the fount of knowledge sealed, And only for our present need Ms boundless love revealed? Yet we wander not in darkness, nor wear the shrond of gloom. God's light our way illumines, and flowers immortal bloom: Faith triumphs in earth's conflict, is strong amid the strife That fits the soul for pure abodes, in blessed realms of life.' It seems to me that we can, if we will, reason from cause to effect and look a long way ahead, but the exact manifestation of the effects, few can foresee. Our new boiler and steam works are in full operation and I think will prove very satisfactory. It reflects great credit on the firm of Robbins, Gamwell &amp; Co., of Pittsfield, Mass., and the men who did the work were the most respectful and quiet of any men ever employed on our premises. This was fully appreciated by the Sisters who were passing through an ordeal of affliction that cannot be written. We have made out to get our wood home and are nearly ready to work it up. Are laying a new floor in our wood-house, over the old one and putting tarred felt between; this we do to keep out the frost and prevent the mice from getting into the cellar below, which we are going to make into an apple cellar. The weather has been very favorable for our operations most of the time, but we have no ice in yet, which causes some anxiety. We use one hundred tons or more, and how to keep from spoiling without ice, we shall have'to learn in the future. Our beloved Mother, Eldress Ann E. Taylor, we are happy to learn is very much improved. She contracted a severe cold in passing from Lebanon to Watervliet Let all our aged friends learn by her experience, when passing from the warm cars to ride in the open air to put on extra wraps : and we that are young, whose duty it is to convey our gospel friends from place to place, should not forget the extra wraps, and when possible provide a covered carriage with noble, trusty steeds attached. When long journeys are to be taken, a warm soapstone put in will be very acceptable. These should be heated or warmed in the oven, and not on a'hot stove. By so doing they will not get hot enough to burn. Mar. 9. On account of the peculiarity of the season, we have been having quite a new experience. Up to the first week in March, and no ice. We began to feel somewhat alarmed; for ice is not now a mere luxury, but a necessity. Well, on the 5th. and 6th. we had a splendid snow; the first to make sleighing this year, and on the 7th. the mercury fell to 11 degrees below zero and on the 8th. to 4 below. Such a fever at that temperature was never known before. Every man and every team was called out to the ice harvest: but to harvest ice enough in two days to supply our large Society could not be done. So it was suggested that we use the Sabbath and gather the harvest, and we did use it in good earnest. (I write now, only of the North Family.) We secured forty-five loads from our reservoir and packed it away. It was real music to witness the quiet zeal and harmony that pervaded the whole company. The only discordant note, was when one of the little boys slipped into the water. Now the question is, was there anything in this proceeding contrary to our religious faith? Speaking for myself, and of the faith planted in my soul, there was nothing out of harmony In the first place Sabbath, (Sunday, the first day of the week,) is only a man-made institution. Second, the ''Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.' Third, the Sabbath of the God of Israel, of the scriptures, was established to curb the selfishness and over-reaching element in unprogressed humanity, and pointed toward a perpetual Sabbath. Fourth, we have entered that Sabbath, by taking up our crosses against selfishness, and consecrating all our time and talents to the benefit of the household of faith. Thus, our labor is worship; and such labor is far more acceptable worship than going to church to display our outward adornings and cultivate our pride. There is a mighty effort being made to establish a national Sunday law, which u only the thin edge of the wedge to open the door for God to enter the constitution of the United States. Already in many of the states Sunday laws are enacted, and are in active operation. These are the beginnings of the preparation for a mighty religious war; that will as surely come as did the war between slavery and freedom, unless the powers of good, working through the more progressed part of the people, shall keep the ascendency. The Sabbath day is a blessed institution and has done a great deal of good; but when a sectarian fence is erected around it, and a few would-be monopolists undertake to drive everybody into their sectarian pen, the blessing the Sabbath was intended to bring to the people is lost, and turned into a curse. Let us make every day a Sabbath, by resting from our own selfish ways and wills ; have all our time religiously devoted, and on Sunday let our devotion be more interior. Use the time to cultivate our spiritual natures, but not laziness; then can we sing in truth, 'Blessed day of rest, the holy Sabbath.' ( I want to thank you for that page of P. O. addresses in the March Manifesto. It was very much needed. From our home kindest love to all, Daniel Offord. Center Family. Mar. 10. 1890. Since the exit of La Grippe the health of our family has been on the upward scale although we were not much troubled here by his unwelcome visit. We are doing our best to secure enough ice to carry us through the summer. The blocks are about nine inches in thickness, nice and clear. Brethren expect to finish to-morrow�the weather is growing warm and uncertain for such business. Yesterday was one of the most beautiful winter days I ever saw, not a cloud was to l�e seen in the sky and the temperature was mild and balmy. Recently we have had quite a rush in putting up medicine for a New York firm. Yours. Timothy Rayson. Soixtli 3Ta.mily. We are interested in the Bible questions and so send a tVw answers VVe made preparations for getting our ice, but the rains came and the ice melted away. Our potatoes have kept very well. Elder William always rolls thorn in lime before putting them in the cellar. S. A. C. Watervliet, N. Y. On the 18th. of Fell, we had a severe thunder shower, with sha'p lightning, and ever since the weather has been cold and warm; and between these intervals of winter and spring we have managed to secure enougu ice to fill our ice house. It was from four to nine inches thick. March came in cold and blustering. Not much of any news. We are engaged in the usual duties of the season ; cutting, drawing and sawing wood for the nerds of another season. Roads are very rough; hard on horses and wagons. No snow; have to draw fire-wood on wagons and it is now Mar. 3rd. Sleigh rides will have to be postponed for the future. W*1 have had a i'ew cases of the La Grippe. Considering the havoc it has made in some sections, we are thankful to say we have been lightly visited and all are recovering. We wish a spiritual La Grippe would prevail among the people and grip them so hard that they would feel the necessity of taking hold of the gospel work in earnest. But unless they were real sick, so sick that they themselves felt the need of the Great Physician's help, we fear their recovery would be very doubtful. Zion needs earnest, sincere workers, not drones nor doubters. Hancock, Mass. There was a beautiful, spiritual atmosphere surrounding us during our morning service. My heart responded to the good words spoken by the Brethren and Sisters, and I made new resolves to be true to my faith, and to strive more earnestly to purify my heart. Emoretta H. Belden. Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Editor ;�And do you expect us to call upon you regularly each montli with our little or big notes about home? Should you miss us if we did not come with the slight olive branch of assurance that we still live and hold our city celestial and terrestrial? Sometimes well done, and sometimes not so well but that we may improve, very much improve. We are in the last state now, needing improvement, and mean to win the 'Well done' from the power that appointed us to the trustWe have many points of good breezy matter that we could note the present month, but conclude to give you only a short story. Our Society enjoys more than usual good health, yet should you closely investigate, you would find remaining some sensitive throats, affected by trachial and bronchial inflammation, as reminders of the sins of the past or the ravages of and by ilLa Grippe.' Not every post righted, but improved�no relapse. We could tell you of wood sawei1 and being split and housed, of maple trees tapped, and slowly yielding sweet, (not salt) tears. Work not sufficiently advanced to give exact data. Also of increasing pro5perity at the barn, consequently the Dairy is looking up, which means blessing for kitchen sisters�result�plenty of good food for the.table, and plenty of dressing whicli 'was once hay (hardly wood or stubble.) We can tell you all this and yet,not touch the things we love best and the things which love us best, stay with us and comfort us when the fountains fail and the fig tree yields but leaves. We bt gin to hear the piping of spring birds, some of which regile us with pleasant songs, and then again we hear warblings from that celestial summer clime where branches are never verdureless. The words of one of these we think will please you. 'Lion-hearted, brave and true God hath not forgotten you, And his arm is sui e to do What his love hath promised. Standard-bearers, forward press By the light of holiness; Ah, no foe, no wilderness Can separate you from Him.' Enfield, Conn. Mar. 1890. There is but little of interest to communicate at this season. The severe storms of rain and wind which prevail almost continuously, prevent outdoor business going on to much extent. In the field north of the barn a large washout has caused some work, as it uncovered the water pipes, a depth of four feet, and was a long distance badly washed. The wood houses are nearly filled with the yearly supply of wood. As yet no ice has been secured, but this month may bring a cold wave with ice upon its surface. There has been very little snow. Mar. 3rd. the ground is covered with snow three inches deep, and the air is cold and at freezing point. We hope the fruit trees may not be damaged by the sudden change. One of our orchards has been cut down, to be replaced by new trees, and different varieties. M. Witham. Spring comes but once a year and we must make the most of it. 'It is better to wear out than to rust out,' but there may be such a thing as too much work, as there may be too little thought. Better not till too much land. Stick to what can be done well. Concentration may be wiser than expansion. It is the quality of work that tells in the end, just as brain work tells better than muscle. What is the use of a brain if it is not exercised? To cultivate the land may not be 'the chief end of man,' but it was the first work given him to do, and that he might keep it in mind for all time, a promise was given him that seed-time should not fail. As he sows so shall he reap. Whole grain should be fed to fowls at night, because it is slowly digested and fills up the long interval between sunset and morning better than soft food. Early maturity in hens is of more importance than size or weight. If two hens are set the same day the broods can often be put into one, and save time and labor. Is not a hen's time worth something? Yellow fleshed fowls are the ones most sought for in the market. Milk is excellent food for liens. When thickened with wheat bran it is a nourishing diet for chickens. Roup, cholera and chicken-pox are three dreaded diseases. D. Orcutt. Enfield, N. H. We have had some cold weather since the advent of March, and just now it looks as if 'Winter might linger in the lap of Spring,' yet there is no 'accounting' for weather in these days of change, any more than there is for 'tastes,' which trite saying, we know to be a fact. Parties from abroad, have been shipping ice from Lake Mascoma north of our village, yet the water will close over the space, and roll as majestically as ever, just as the world will continue to move when the atoms of humanity now forming its motive power have ceased their striving for the things of this world, leaving'only their influence, for good or ill, as a legacy. Our Society have tapped about 3,*775 maple trees, and now it remains to be seen how kind the fates will be in giving us the flow of sap necessary for the sugar making. Next month we may give you some estimate of our success or failure in this line. We are pleased that so able a writer as the author of the lines entitled 'Encouragement' in Mar. Manifesto, has unearthed her God-given talent, so greatly needed and appreciated. We have long wished it might be revived, and welcome this angel messenger as a foretaste of good gifts yet to come. We hope so. E. B. Groveland, N. Y. Mar. 4, 1890. This the sixty-third day of the year eighteen hundred and ninety with us, or we with the day, comes as a reminder of the swift march of time, telling us that we are also marching forth toward the great beyond; that this is not our abiding home. Only for a brief time are we permitted to dwell here. As we read the account of the last acts of devotion bestowed in memory of the dear brother Elder Elijah Myrick, we were deeply impressed with his parting benediction, 'Your abiding Brother.' Grand and comforting is its import to his many friends on this side. Though the 'clouds of heaven opened and received him out of sight' yet he will abide with us forever. About three years ago a large colony of honey bees sought refuge in the South chimney of the Church building; they are still ''Holding the Fort,' and defy every attempt at interference. Every sunny day they may be seen flying around and hovering over their 'adopted home' seemingly jealous of the slightest intrusion. Their protective agency is of such powerful force, that no one can be found brave enough to encounter them. Perhaps it is best not to disturb them, as they place before us tliis valuable lesson. Keep as busy as a bee While the moments swiftly flee. But some say, How shall we secure the honey? That is the question. How shall we secure it? One way it's too high, another too low, And also contrary wise. Now its too low, then it's too high 'To mansions in the skies.' So to the bees, we'll give them all The honey in the chimney tall. The winter intended for this locality went south a few weeks before the holidays and has not returned. Strayed away and got lost as most wanderers do. In all probability it will not appear again this season, if it should it will prove certain blight to the Peach, Apricot and some other fruits. At last accounts the fruit buds were reported unharmed. What the later record will be We shall have to wait and see. Yet 'tis a truth most absolute We'll not get ice if we have fruit. Again if ice we reap this spring A small fruit harvest we shall bring. Our pond and sun minding streams have frozen several times to the great depth of three and one half inches, hut only for a day ar two. We have not had one day's sleighing through the past season. Lugs that were intended to be drawi to mill are lying in the woods. With present prospects they will continue lying there, till the coming of another winter. What then? Will the year 1891 provide us with a winter? G. D. G. Union Village, Ohio. Dear Elder Henry;�We are still trying to keep our heads above water though mud and tide are often against us. We have been afflicted to a considerable extent with La Grippe, but it has passed on and our general health is good at present. This winter we have made, in our Family, ten or twelve new gates, and during 1889 we made a very neat picket fence along our street front, and quite an amount of repairing of fences has been done this winter. The good Sisters have lately had the whole kitchen whitewashed, the ceilings and mouldings painted in lively colors, and these processes have improved the appearance of things, thereabout, wonderfully. Yesterday Elder Joseph Slingerland and I measured off and marked places along our street between Center Family and cross-roads south, for an avenue of over one hundred sugar trees, (Acer Saccharinum) which in a few �years will be quite ornamental and refining in their influence, like the sweet harmonizing influences of instrumental music. We put new wringers in our Laundry during 1889, and toward the end of the year, and partly the present year, we have torn down and removed the debris and cleared up around two unsightly buildings which were not worth repairing. Yesterday received a boy 18 years of age into our family�his two sisters have been here a number of years. Br. Thomas Reider who made our new gates painted some red and some a fine blue, and where they stand near each other the variety produces a fine effect. Br. Thomas is very industrious and interested in seeing things ship-shape about the premises. O. C. H. South Union, Ky. We are having northern weather, and if it will only stay three days we may get some ice. I wish it would, seeing the fruit is mostly killed. Snow is four inches deep and the mercury at 12 degrees above zero. I do not remember when it has been so cold at this season of the year.
