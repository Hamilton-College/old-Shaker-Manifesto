L0, WISDOM CALLS! Benign 's the call. List, Wisdom's voice ! Come up, true life enjoy. Flee false and base, obscene, unchaste, Which life and peace destroy : Leave death's dark shades, where lost, be- tray'd, Thro' pleasure's luring guise ; Come up, frail man, thro' heaven's just plan, To life divine arise. Pure, peaceful minds, discreet, benign, Oppression, wars, disown ; From discord cease, so cherish peace ; Good will, good cheer have grown : True patience grown ; ne'er frown, ne'er scold, Though friends or foes annoy ; Though long opposed, and tried like gold, Mild suasions still employ. True friends to all, from loss and thrall Would extricate the race. Bless'd Wisdom calls, wins, gently draws, Through renovating grace. List, heed the call; rise from the fall, Progressing upward, on : Weights, idols, cast, and speed on fast: Go free ; discard all wrong. Oh, let's well heed, press on with speed, In truth, in spirit rise ; Christ quickens, guides, with oil provides Chaste virgins, pure and wise. Thus all who toil taste blissful joys â€” Hope, gladness, love, peace, rest: These live the Christ, true virgin life, Are truly greatly blest. The faithful, wise, advancing, rise, The uphill grade still tread; These fain would warn the proud who scorn, Who're willing captives led : Oh, pause, reflect, false life reject; Thence, prove true life indeed : The truth reclaims from error's chains, Hence captives thus are freed ! Progressive minds, grown lib'ral, kind. More needy ones befriend ; While Christ refines with fire divine, These toil, progress, ascend. While now's our day, who 'd long delay ? Let's hasten, lo, the prize ! From vice refrain, so win, maintain The life that never dies. Dyer Slack, Enfield, Ct.
