Office of the Free Press, Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, Dec. 10, 1880 Publisher Shaker Manifesto, Shakers, N. Y. : By whose favor am I the recipient of The Shaker Manifesto, which comes to me regularly, and which I have enjoyed reading very much? I feel that it has made me a better man ; that since reading it I have taken a step forward in the onward march toward the goal which I am striving to reach. I want it to continue right along, and when the time expires for which it is paid, please send bill, and I will at once remit for another year. Yours very truly, James A. Throop, Editor
