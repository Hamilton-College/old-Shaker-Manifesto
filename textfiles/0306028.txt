NATURE AND GRACE I'd rather be a quarried stone, And be disrobed of all disguise, Than cover'd with the prettiest moss That in the shady woodland lies ; Hewn out from nature, carved and smooth'd, A pillar in the house of God, A ' polish'd stone ' which cann't be moved, Or fitted for the tents abroad. Blest Zion be my dwelling-place, Though pitying turn my eyes away, To see the suffering human race Grope darkly in the light of day. And oft my cries ascend to Thee, O God of love and holy pow'r, That thy salvation, full and free, May triumph at no distant hour; May bring thy wand'ring children up From degradation, sin and strife, To Nature's order ; thence above To Grace the higher Angel life ; And make this earth a place of peace, Where none shall give or take offense; But all shall stand redeem'd in love, In purity, and innocence. Mary Whitcher, Canterbury
