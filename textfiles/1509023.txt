THE BROOM. I have thought that this useful article was quite undervalued because of its commonness and yet how soon we should discover its loss should we occupy a room void of this article. I have learned that the word broom was first given to a kind of short bushy shrub which grew in India, finally it became the custom to gather this broom and tie it together to use for sweeping purposes. It is of the leguminous species because it bears a legume or pod which is divided into two divisions or valves having the seeds attached to one suture like the pea pod. More recently broom corn lias become more popular and is used quite extensively. It is a tall reed with jointed stem, the head only being used for brooms. I have read that Dr. Franklin planted a single seed in this country which he took from a whisk of broom corn in England and from it have sprung all the broom corn plants that have been raised in this country. The plant that is most commonly cultivated is nearly twice the height of an ordinary man and resembles Indian corn very closely but the head or brush from which brooms are made is much larger than that of Indian corn. It bears no ear, the seed being all on the brush, but these seeds have to be taken off before it can be used and quite frequently they are given as food to horses and poultry. The handles are made of several kinds of wood. Mary Ellen King.
