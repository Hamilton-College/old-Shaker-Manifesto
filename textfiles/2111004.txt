IN MEMORY OF THE DEPARTED. Maria Witham. It is well with our Sister, her soul now unbound, O'er the bright fields Elysian can roam, Why then should we mourn, the parting must come, For the angels have beckoned her home. Float upward O freed one, rejoice in thy call, To bid all that's transient adieu, And join with the music that's sweet to the soul, In regions enchanting to view. We all shall soon meet in that heavenly land, Where no earthly troubles annoy, United forever a pure happy band, Where sorrow is ended and parting's no more. Our moments are gliding so swiftly away, Soon we shall be called from this house of clay, Then I would prepare with my Sister to dwell, And to earth's fading pleasures bid a final farewell.
