Hancock, Mass. Aug. 21. This has been a season of almost perpetual rain, and our large oat crop has been very much damaged. We have harvested some of our potatoes and think we shall not have more than one third of a crop. Sept 3. Sisters, Eliza A. Stratton and Julia Briggs, of Canterbury have been with us for a few days. We are all pleased to meet with our beloved gospel friends. Sept. 7. Berkshire hills and dales, have yielded an abundant supply of Blackberries this season. The East family Sisters have canned nearly or quite three bushels, for home use. A delicious substitute for apples. L. W.
