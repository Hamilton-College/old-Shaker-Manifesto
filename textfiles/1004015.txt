The Pope on Marriage In a recently issued encyclical letter of Leo XIII, upon the sanctity of marriage, the following curious passage occurs: * * * ' Jesus Christ, the author of the New Testament, transferred marriage from a natural function to a sacrament, and attributed to his church all the legislative and judicial control of it as a binding instrument!' Now we know, as far as the Pope can tell us, who it was that first made marriage a sacrament in the Christian Church! The records of the New Testament had informed us of the Virgin Celibacy of Jesus, and of his demands upon, all of his disciples, to forsake marriage, war, private property and worldly entanglements. We are therein made aware, also, that his immediate disciples did ' forsake all to follow him; fathers, mothers, wives, children, houses, lands, and even their lives after the flesh.' And in the absence of any information therein as to who changed this Christian arrangement, the flesh-loving 'followers' (?) of Jesus will render thanks to the Pope. We opine, however, that the New Testament account of Christ's life and teachings will take precedence of the Pope's, and that all sensible professors of Christianity will simply admit that marriage, private property, war and worldly contamination, nowhere find any recognition as elements of Christianity in Jesus nor disciples, but were compromises of Paul's with the ''foolish Galatians' and ' carnal Corinthians' of his day, and whose successors demand these privileges now as ever, as an assuagement to their worldly, but unchristian lusts. Mark the distinction : ' The children of the world marry; ' but my children— 'the children of the Resurrection J&gt; — 'I am the Resurrection — do not marry,' but live heavenly, like the angels ; very much as the Shakers profess to and ought to live. The Shaker Manifesto in its turn issues an older, original, Christian, encyclical letter : Marriage is not of Christ ; nor the works of marriage; but belong to the worldly order, the followers of the first Adam.
