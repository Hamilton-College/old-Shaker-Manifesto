Now And Then Learn impatient soul, Heaven's profound decree, Wise the firm control That restraineth thee. Impulse is but blind, Mad is strong desire, God to thee is kind Plucking from the fire. Justice beareth sway, Love uplifts the hand; Now thou must obey, Then shalt understand. Vain to rage and fret, Weak to wish and pine, Dare not question yet Higher will than thine. Wouldst thou stand at ease? Hear the bugle play! Forward! victories Crown the closing fray ! Wouldst thou choose thy post? One surveys the field, Where he needs thee most, Patient service yield. Wouldst thou lead apart From the sounds of strife With thy books and heart Self-communing life? Up, and self forget! Forth! to gain and give Payment of the debt Due to all who live. Work, submit, obey, Smile, and be content, Cast thy will away, Take the burden sent, To thy sentence bow, Badge of fealty wear, Child and servant now Then the lord and heir.
