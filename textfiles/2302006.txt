Our delight and pleasure may be imagined... Written by Sister Corrinne Bishop of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., to a friend at Canterbury, N. H. 'Our delight and pleasure may be imagined in the presence of our precious gospel kindred during the memorial service. They brought life and strength. Elder Henry and Eldress Joannaï¿½ their very names bring cheer, and the memory of seeing and hearing them will be a comforting thought for a long time and we shall live on it. Dear Elder Nicholas and Eldress Eliza we have not seen for so long a time, we were more than delighted. Elder Abraham seemed like one translated and Elder Hiram we include among the blest number. I wish many others could have seen the two ranks of hoary-headed Elders, as they were seated in the church during the time of the funeral service. They seemed like angels, or messenfrom a sphere above ordinary mortals. Never before were so many representatives gathered from so many Societies at Mt. Lebanon; and yet we are reminded that they, too, will soon follow on.'
