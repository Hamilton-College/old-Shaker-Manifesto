NOW, CHILDREN, SAY YOU WILL! Life is a contest! In for the fight! Up and at it with all your might! Dread no hardship ; talk not of luck ! Off with your coat and show your pluck! Up and be doing! Stir up a dust! Ply up your muscles ; rub off the rust! Take hold of plow, spare not the hoe ! Turn up the earth and make things go! Always be frugal, don't run in debt, E'er shun the race-course, and do not bet Always be prudent, do not get 'tight! ' Avoid the wrong! Pursue the right! When with the vile, dare to be odd! Act like a man! and fear thou God! Search for the good. Strive to be wise. Only workers can win the prize! Then push ahead! Always keep moving! Gaining ground daily, daily improving! And at the close, your work well done, Receive the plaudit, ' Faithful son! ' Selected.
