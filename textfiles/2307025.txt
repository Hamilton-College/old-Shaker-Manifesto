Sabbathday Lake. June, 1893. June is the most lovely month of the year, and we are glad to welcome these bright, sunny days which so soon leave us to make way for more fruitful seasons. The blossoms have already left the trees and the little apples are discernible. The birds are busy and so are Believers. Both birds and Believers lead busy lives. Memorial day our little girls had an ep- THE MANIFESTO. 171 isode which pleased and amused us. They found in the grass an oriole which from some cause had just departed this life, and tenderly laid it in a box; took it with their hands full of flowers, to the cemetery where they had a little funeral. Sung: 'Hushed are the strivings of nature,' and 'I shall know my own in heaven.' Each made a little speech, then the leader said: 'Would the Brethren and Sisters like to take a last look at the deceased?' At this ti me they were all weeping, and the bird was buried on Sr. Mary Ella's grave. Finally they strewed the flowers on that and a number of other graves and marched back to the house in a very solemn manner. The Sisters have set out a new strawberry bed of one thousand plants, which are growing finely. The flowers also are coming along nicely and will repay us for our labor both in profit and beauty. Elder William has a kitchen garden which we have an eye upon with 'great expections.' Ada S. Cummings.
