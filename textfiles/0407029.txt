INDIVIDUALITY AND COMMUNISM When Jesus, after instructing his handful of followers, that they were the salt or saving principle of the earth, said further to them, ' Have salt in yourselves,' he was giving the most direct confirmation to the idea of individuality. The righteousness of Noah or David was nothing to them, nor even his own, vicariously. Enough of this salt, or saving princi- ple, in the soul, to make the individual invincible to all the attractions which lower the tone of goodness is essential. How can the salt retain its savor and be resistant to the putrefying and destructive elements around ? A slight sprinkling of salt gives a relish and zest to some articles of food and is a stimulus to vegetable growth; even as the society of individuals, polished by some of the Christian graces, is highly prized, even by worldly men. But the integrity of the salt itself is lost by entering into chemical combination with the elements to which it is thus subjected; and unless in quantities sufficient to be decidedly unpalatable, is not saving. But, if gathered to its like, and sheltered from all unnecessary-exposure to the elements, it can retain its characteristics and be ready, if needed, to furnish the evidence of its savor, pungency, and use. Continually are operating on our spirits the unselfishness or the ambition which will transform the latent good into pollution or decay, if the testimony pungent and strong is not burning within us, which prevents all compromising with evil, or amalgamating with deceit. Perfect transparency, as illustrated by those whom the Kevelator saw ' standing on the sea of glass,' is desirable. E. H. Webster, Harvard, Mass.
