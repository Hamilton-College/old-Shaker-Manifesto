BAKING POWDERS, SALERATUS, SODA AND SALT. DANIEL FRASER. Solon Robinson in 'Facts for Farmers' tates 'No one would thiuk of eating potash, mt we eat saleratus ! Soda rots cloth, and akes the skin off the hands of washer-womn, yet we put it into bread and cakes. Our omachs were not made to digest metals.'' e adds 'One of the signs of the Millenand other physical demonstrations pro duced by religious enthusiasm, wer often witnessed. When undertaking t heal the sick, the elders would anoin the patient's whole person and also ac minister a large dose internally. The they would lay their hands upon the suJ ferer and pray with all the fervor tha only those who sincerely believe in th efficacy of their instrumentality can pos sess, for the removal of the disease tha God's power might be manifested to th world. Often were they^compelled to wrestle many hours in this manner be fore success rewarded their efforts. The songs of a people are always considered to be true indicators of the sentiments and aspirations that produced them. Listen to the following : The morning breaks, the shadows flee; Lo ! Zion's standard is unfurled! The dawning of a brighter day Majestic rises on the world. The clouds of error disappear Before the rays of truth divine; The glory bursting from afar, Wide o'er the nations soon will shine ! The Gentile fullness now comes in, And Israel's blessings are at hand: Lo ! Judah's remnant, cleansed from sin, Shall in the promised Canaan stand. Angels from heaven and truth.from earth Have met and both have record borne; Thus Zion's light is bursting forth To bring her ransomed children home. It is said that the strains of the old Mormon hymn below would often arouse the assembly to the highest pitch of enthusiasm : The spirit of God like a fire is burning! The latter-day glory begins to come forth; The visions and blessings of old are returning, The angels are coming to visit the earth. We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies of [heaven, Hosannah! Hosannah to God and the Lamb ! All glory to them in the highest be given, Henceforth and forever ! Amen and Amen ! A noteworthy feature of Mormonism is the missionary zeal developed by it. Without any provision, often unacquainted with the language of the country, enduring every privation, they invaded every country of Europe and succeeded to gather 100,000 souls to their faith within one generation. The story of their persecution in Illinois ; their heroic pilgrimage of 1500 miles across the pathless desert; their industry that caused the barren wilderness to smile with fertility, are well known. The order and sobriety and general thrift maintained in their settlements have received the praise of every unprejudiced observer. Such achievements are accomplished only by convictions that have a nobler purpose and a higher aspiration for their sustaining &gt;ower than any sentiment springing from )olygamy only can ever produce. Let us hope that the Saints of Utah may be blessed with a further revelation hat shall enable them to get rid of the obnoxious feature of their system and ;hereby become entitled to fall into line with the many agencies that are working or good, for God and humanity. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. mum, will be a kitchen that sends forth food conducive to health, and be an aid to Christianity. ' We read of a good time coming ï¿½when ' The pots in the kitchen would be holiness unto the Lord. ' Be consecrated to the fulfillment of Hygienic Law. Therefore, Hygienic Institutions must be the beginning of that day. That it may dawn in every household in the land, is the object of this paper. The time was when neither saleratus nor soda, or any kind of baking powders were used in food. Any person on reflection, rejects the idea of being daily dosed with powerful drugs, even should h^ be ignorant of their mode of operation. THE CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE METALLIC SALTS. They combine with any kind of fatty matter and form soap; and readily attack all kinds of animal tissue. They are also used in making glass ; they help to melt the sand. WHEN USED AS BAKING POWDERS, they are the carbonates of Soda or Potash, as the case may be. In plain English, these alkalies are fully charged with carbonic acid gas (the gas of death) for which they have a strong affinity. The acids of these powders under the action of heat and moisture, liberates this gas, and it expands the dough. This gas, whether given out as in fermented bread, or from baking powders, is not known to increase the digestibility of bread, but the contrary. THESE ALKALIES WHEN TAKEN IN FOOD, pass through the digestive processes, form new compounds, and float off into the circulation, impressing every drop of blood with their saline affinities. The inhering power of saline solutions is to soften, relax, and consequently to injure in the blood, the muscular and other tissues about to be formed from the vital fluid, as will be shown hereafter. SALT AS TAKEN BY MAN and other animals, operates as a solvent in the blood. The salt water of the ocean is also a solvent, not a preservative of animal matter. In the use of salt, imitate the animal creation. They take enough at once to move their bowels, and then let it alone; hence but little enters the circulation. With man, the case is otherwise, minute doses do not move the bowels ; hence the salt takes a more circuitous route. SALT TAKING IS AN ACQUIRED HABIT and may so far prevail in a family, till the entire circle of cookery becomes saline. No animal stays long at a salt-lick. Let us so cultivate ourselves as to be true to the fitness of things; then we will enjoy the natural flavor of all the grains, roots and vegetables. If a dose of salt is needed, take it; but do not live in a salt-lick. SEVENTY FIVE HEAD OF HORNED ANIMALS. The herdsman for a special purpose gave to the cows oft repeated doses of salt. After a while lameness took hold of the herd; and a fine growing heifer could be seen limping along to pasture. The salt was discontinued and the herd got well. In feeding salt to animals be careful not to induce foot-rot. THE QUESTION IS NOT SALT, OR NO SALT ; but the proper use of it. The worst possible way of taking that article, is a little at a time. What would we think of a sheep taking a pinch of salt with every mouthful of grass? Under the force of habit, silly humans do so daily. WHY IS NOT SALTED MEAT AS WHOLESOME AS FRESH? Is answered by Dr. Holbrook in his admirable work ' Eating for Strength' page 138. ' It carries far too much salt into the system. Much of the impaired health farmers have in spring comes from this source. It would be better for them to substitute oatmeal, molasses, cream and fruit, for salted flesh. With this diet they would rarely have the debility so common in Spring. ' At the end of a chapter on salt, he states 'Its use on almost everything, is a mere habit.' And advises, 'To learn to use some articles without it. '' Those who have not seen his book, their education is not finished. THE CHEMICAL OPERATION OF THESE METALLIC SALTS ON THE BLOOD. See these highly colored cakes, they are almost yellow. That color indicates that the flour has been chemically attacked by the potash of the saleratus, and impressed upon the flour its own affinities. An affinity for oxygen the life-giving gas of the atmosphere? Not in the smallest degree, but for carbonic acid gas, the gas of death. These salts, and all saline solutions in the circulation operates, as already stated, to soften, relax, and to dissolve They have another effect, they impress the vital fluid with an affinity contrary to that of venous blood for oxygen. This twofold action breaks up the coagulating power of the blood, makes it watery; and induces a diminished vital cohesion of that important fluid, thereby impairs bodily strength, causing langour and debility. As is evidenced in every household in the land where saleratus, soda, and baking powders are in use; and by the frightful ravages of scurvy at sea caused by salt provisions. PROF. YOUMAN'S OPINION of soda, saleratus, and of course, of baking powders. 'They are not nutritive, and exert a disturbing action on the organism. In the common use of these substances much of the alkali enters the system in its active form. Their habitual use, we consider injurious and unwise.'
