TRUST ELIZABETH B. HARRISON Life seems to be a matter of continual trust — we constantly trust, and are trusted. We are taught to put our trust in God, and truly, we need no other reminders of this necessity, than the ordinary affairs of life. We needfully and thankfully trust one another, and are ever most grateful, when we know that our trust has not been misplaced. We have, by the provisions of the gospel, been placed in trust of large temporal possessions; and if we abuse our trust, we shall be recompensed by an equal feeling of want. There are many effects of mistrust, that will need the correction of the spiritual world. Thank God, I know how to trust my Ministry, Elders, Brethren and Sisters — those in temporal care, and those bearing spiritual burdens. Those who are trusted in largest confidence, will not so easily betray trust, as when suspected. The greatest trust committed to any, is the pure gospel of Christ, and being placed in this trust, even so would I live, not as pleasing self, but God who trusts, yet will try all our hearts.
