THE LANGUAGE OF CHARITY. WATSON ANDREWS. I see thee as tliou art; Not as in days of yore A wicked blameful man But as a fruit on Nature's Tree. Result of godlike plai An embryonic fruit, And it doth not appear, I cannot see or know What may be latent in that embryo-. I see thee, not as wrong, But as imperfect still; Lacking, not good, but growth Decades of discipline To demonstrate thy worth. A royal animal, A prince in swaddling clothes ; To live to fill a throne, Or die a slave unknown. ' To die, that is to sleep,' To sleep in slavish fear In slavish ignorance, A slave to appetite A slave to circumstance, Or, conqueror of thyself And hence of all beside. The animal in thee outgrown, And thou set free. The beastly, harmonized; The human angelized And the Divine, in love, Be seen to rest on thee Descending from above, The love of God supreme, And fellow-man as selfï¿½ Preferring him to self, In pleasure, fame or pelf.
