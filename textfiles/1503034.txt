SPIRIT I COVET. Help me when the night is darkest, When upon the desert waste; Give me pow'r to calm the tempest, While upon Time's billowy sea. Then like thee, I'll tread with firmness, Duty's paths in trials' day; Ready to renounce all pleasure Which a selfish heart would crave. Guiding, the mid trackless waters, Pointing on to realms afar; When the day seems drear and cloudy, I would have ray words and actions Like thee I will stand unyielding With thy influence for my Guardian, Prayerful, Peaceful, Steadfast, Holy, And sweet hope her pow'rs resign, Bend subservient to thy will; To the lurking charms of ease; I can for all others care, Loving and Forgiving free, Blessed Savior, bo thou near me, That should wrath my bosom enter, Over self will reign triumphant, Joy with them when joy aboundeth, Blessed Spirit of my Savior, Prayerful Spirit, be thou mine. I can whisper, 'Peace, be still.' Seeking God alone to please. Likewise of their burdens share. O, I pray thee, dwell with me. 1. Praying spirit of my Savior, In my heart 0 find a place; 2. Peacefill spirit of my Savior, Canst thou find a place with me? 3. Steadfast spirit of my Savior, Let me feel thy scepter's sway; 4. Loving spirit of my Savior, Let me in thy fountains bathe; 5. Blessed Savior, thy example E'er shall be my 'Polar Star;' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
