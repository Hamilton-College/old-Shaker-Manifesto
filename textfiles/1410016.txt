Dear Manifesto; Perhaps sone of the readers... New Gloucester, Me. Deau Manifesto ;ï¿½Perhaps some of the readers of the ' Letter Box, ' would like a pen picture of the pretty home, where I live and I will try my best to draw one for your pleasure I hope, and for my own improvement in writing as well. Within the Southern limits of the state of Maine you will find what I am pleased to call ' my Home ' nestled down in the peaceful quiet town of West Gloucester. On the North arc pleasant hills which command a fine view of our little settlement. On the East lies a beautiful lake formerly called Sabbath day Pond which affords fine pickerel, trout, and pout. On a cool summer day when one would like a little recreation and there is seemingly no place to go, just take the second thought and you will propose going to the lake. South of us there lies a quiet neighborhood where all seems to be as busy as a hive of bees. In the same direction lie 'Centennial Springs.' On the North are the 'Poland Springs ' where a large house has been constructed for the accommodation of invalids, that they may drink of its waters and thereafter enjoy good health. For miles around us you can see magnificent trees of varied kinds. In the midst of certain trees is another lake which supplies the mill. People come from the surrounding cities to spend their vacation in our section, and amuse themselves with hunting and catching small game such as partridges, wild ducks, and gray squirrels, much to our inconvenience ; and others come for the purpose of viewing the scenery, enjoying the fresh air, and the quietness which pervades the country: Near our home stand-; the modest little Church wherein is held 'public service' each Sunday, unless foul weather prevents. Large companies come from cities throughout the United States to regain their health at the celebrated Poland Springs, and then attend our service. The mill which lies North-east of us is a great accommodation to the people throughout Cumberland Co., it does many different kinds of work like sawing, grinding and planing. The orchards and gardens around, supply us with fruit yearly, the fields yield an abundance of hay, and pasture lands afford fine feed for cattle. Our Home has been greatly improved by the construction of a stately brick building which stands facing the road. Two magnificent elm trees one at each corner and the little birds build their nests in the branches; and when the gentle breezes blow, each tree makes a courtesy to the passer-by, and seemingly says ' Good Morning' or 'Good Afternoon' as the case maybe. The road is lined witli beautiful trees which make a fine appearance. Near by is the Cemetery where many of the consecrated builders of our home have been laid away peacefully. The body is dead but the soul is immortal, it can never die! The many prospects of the coining year lead us to hope that it will be a fruitful onf. Eva L. Franks. 14 yrs.
