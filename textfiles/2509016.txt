We fear we are late for even our little say for this month; but the days whirl by so rapidly, that our would be correspondent, pressed with orders for work did not realize that 'time's up,' until the usual day for sending was past. In early life we were often counseled to 'Take Time by the forelock,' but in these days of swift travel if we can catch a glimpss of his queue as he vanishes from sight we are fortunate. The one thing worthy of notewhich perhaps others have mentionedis the severest hailstorm of July 13, known in this locality for sixty years. The ground looked more like April than July, and in some places the hailstones were drifted several inches deep, and did not melt until the next day, the thermometer falling from 08 deg to 48 deg. in twenty minutes. Still in comparison to other sections of the country the storm was tempered to us. Leaves which presented a large surface such as beans, squash, corn and melons, also the ripening blackberries and raspberries suffered the most, but had the hailstones been large as well as numerous, there would have been no harvest of anything grown or growing. So in this as in every misfortune there might have been a worse, and we will bless the 'powers that be,' and count the blessings that are ours, instead of cumbering ourselves with discontent over those which we imagine are denied us.

We have nothing unusual to report at this time; the crops already gathered are very good, especially cherries, which yielded a large crop, but owing to unfavorable weather, rotted on the trees badly consequently we did not realize so much as last year on them, pears are very abundant the trees being loaded. The weather is warm and dry although we have had many showers during the summer. The spiritual atmosphere seems quite as dry as the physical; scarcely any inquiry as to our faith or principles. People are more interested in our contemplated move to Florida than in anything we have done or said in years gone by. Our Pittsfield friends do not like the idea of our leaving these spendid homes here on the hill-side for such a warm climate as Florida. Well we are not gone yet and no one can tell when the trumpet may sound for TERMS. 2H 212 THE MANIFESTO. us to do as did the children of Israel, pull up stakes and move on, Are we ready? If the hand of the Lord be in the movement then it seems wisdom to go wherever His spirit may lead; there alone is safety and protection. Can we sing with the immortal P. P. Bliss, I know not what awits me, Uo;l kindly veils my eyes, Anil o'er each step of my onward way He makes new scenes to rise; And every joy He sends me comes A sweet and glad surprise, Where'er he leads I'll follow, My trust in Him repose, . And every hour in perfect peace I'll sing, He knows, He knows. Timothy Ray son. South. Family. Aug. 1895. 'They that trust in the Lord shall be aw Mt. Zion, which can not be removed but abideth forever. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even forever.'-Psalms cxxv., 1, 2. Great and many have been the blessings of the present year. Our fruit and vegetable gardens are yielding beyond our anticipation. The mountains have furnished a liberal growth of blueberries which we delighted to harvest, and sunny days found us securing the luscious fruit which is ever healthful and refreshing. Fruit trees of the peach, plum, pear and cherry varieties were planted during the past season and old ones shorn of their unprofitable members causing a rejuvenating element to dwell in the midst of our beautiful home. The month of June was made especially beneficial by the visitation of Sisters from Canterbury and Enfield N. H., and on the 18th of July a renewal of the same by the coming of Sisters Isabella White and Louie Bussell from the Groveland fa mily at Watervliet. We are much in favor of the new method for manufacturing ice-cream and when convenient shall adopt the Daisy system, which will be superior to the old plan of employing a crank to perform the work.
