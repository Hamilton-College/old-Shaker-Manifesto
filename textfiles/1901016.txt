MONDAY, DEC. 31, 1888 Mary Whitcher And lo ! the year has ended ! And I am left to ask How have my labors tended And how performed my task? Have I been truly faithful To do the little good, And ever anxious, prayerful For more, whene'er I could Perform a further labor For Zion and Her cause, With care for sister, brother, And for Her sacred laws. Doth injury to self-hood Affect mj7 feelings more Than to the cause of Zion And those who've gone before? Let this reflection prompt me To greater zeal and care For Zion and Her int'rests While self doth disappear. Let me renew my patience My love for all that's true, My thankfulness and earnestness Dear Sisters, 'long with you. Canterbury, N. H.
