Faith is not merely belief... Faith is not merely belief, but it is the confidence derived from love to the Lord. The devils believe, but they have not faith, because they love not the Lord; they are not willing to intrust all to him. There can be no faith without love or charity; and the effort to get into a religious life by trying to believe that God will save us by so-called grace or the atonement of Christ, is not the right way. Learn first to love God, which is to love that which is good, and then you can trust Him, which trust is faith.
