SONG OF PRAISE JULIA JOHNSON While God inspires my heart to sing, Or gives it life to beat, Praise offerings I will freely bring And lay them at his feet. He feeds my soul with hope and faith, And love which never dies; And sheds on it a living warmth, From his celestial skies. His precious power my spirit fills — My highest themes inspire; His presence, all my being thrills With ardent, pure desire. His blessings, hourly, on me pour His chastening and his love; And mercies rich — an endless store — From his white throne above. His fires are kindled in my heart, Extinguished ne'er to be, Till I from sin and death depart, All stainless, pure and free. I'll do his bidding evermore — While life and strength are given — That I may find when time is o'er A rest with him in heaven.
