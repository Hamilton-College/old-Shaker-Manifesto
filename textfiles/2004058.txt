Is it Mary, or the Lady of the Jesuits? 'Of the making of many books there is no end,' and one among the many has this singular title page. 'Is it Mary, or the Lady of the Jesuits?' By Justin D. Fulton, I). D. The work spea,ks for itself and the careful reader will be interested in the perusal of its pages. It is, indeed, a fight with Rome, over a subject that will in all probability remain a disputed point so far as the Catholic and Protestant Churches are concerned. This theological pugilism into which the Christian Churches enter with so much zeal, becomes sometimes, the subject over which non-professors are left to wonder, and to speculate on the advantages of Christianity. The worthy Dr. proves to his own satisfaction that Mary, the mother of Jesus is nbt entitled to the honor which is accorded to her by the Catholic Brethren. He Contends that Mariolatry and idolatry are the same; that 'the Virgin Mary of the papal church and that of some Anglicans worsh p is a heathen goddess.' The Doctor's zeal for Protestantism is equal to that of Peter's, and if he carried a sword, some people would be likely to lose one of their ears.
