Enfield, Conn. We are hastening to get ready for winter, by banking and closing our buildings. Cold weather may overtake us before quite prepared, though at present it is moderate. The water from the drinking-trough into the horse barn has rotted the sill, and in conse- quence, a new sill has been put in which involved refitting the whole side of the barn. Grain is threshed, and a good yield. Corn is excellent and all husked ; the fodder will be in the barn the coming week. Boot crops are all harvested. More than twenty acres of land are being fitted for sowing down just before the ground freezes; this method insures a good catch, although weeds often THE MANIFESTO. 19 come in the first season : a liberal amount of large red clover seed will be sowed on the same land on the last snow of next March. We could use two weeks of open weather yet to finish our fall work. Many improvements could be made were tirce and opportunity available. M. Witham
