In Memory of EMMORY C. BROOKS. Genevieve DeGraw. It is finished, it is finished, The last work here is done, And our faithful, loving Brother Has found a restful home In the many pearly mansions In our Father's house on high; There he'll wait and watch our coming, For we're going, Bye and Bye. He who spent his life in service; In the service of our Lord, Now is reaping richest blessings, 'Tis 'the honest soul's reward.' Clothed in raiment bright and shining, Crowned with jewels from God's hand, Dwells our Brother with the angels In the blest 'Sweet Beulah Land.' Now he's living, more than ever, And his living is more real, Since his spirit hastened onward To the upper land, the 'Leal.' With the Angel choir singing, With the ransomed throng to blend, Unto him it now is given Glory and power forever, Amen. Sonyea, N. Y.
