A TRIBUTE OF LOVE. Sacred to the Memory of good Elder Austin. Dear Friends ;- -The Angel of death has again invaded our ranks, and taken from our midst, a kind father and friend. One who has spent a long life of usefulness and devoted himself body and soul to the Cause he chose in his youth. When but sixteen years of age, he embraced the faith, and united with Believers with his father and mother, two brothers and two sisters, all of whom proved good and true Believers. Our dear father, has been an Elder to the family for over forty years, fulfilling the duties of the place with honor and an exemplary life, a spiritual guide and friend to all,- -always extending a hand of love and kindness to every one. For the aged he always had a kind and affectionate word, to cheer them in their declining years ;- -for the middle age, those who were bearing the burdens of life, words of comforting love and encouragement, and many many youth will rise up and call him blessed. The children always loved him,- -he carried out Christ's teachings and example ' Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. We might enumerate his many virtues and gospel graces, indefinitely and then, only satisfy, the fullness of our hearts in his Christ-like and beautiful life character. Dear Father,- - We shall miss you in many ways And when we join in songs of praise, We hope and trust you will be near, With love and strength our hearts to cheer, Kest thee,- -dear father rest in peace, From earthly cares you are released; To join with happy saints above, And dwell in everlasting love.
