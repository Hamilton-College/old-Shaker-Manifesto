Dear Elder Henry:--I have been reading 'Be Courteous'... Union Village, Sept. 25, 1890. Dear Elder Henry :ï¿½I have been reading ''Be Courteous' by Sister Annie R. Stephens in Sept. No. of the Manifesto 1890. I think it a very important subject and well handled. I write to show my appreciation of it and to thank her for writing it. I think if we all would take especial pains to put in practice her suggestions it would make us all happier, would help lift the burdens and improve the health. I have thought much on this subject and wondered that it is esteemed so lightly by some. We cannot overestimate the value and importance of cultivating this spirit of courtesy and kiudness and consideration one to another. I think it would be a stimulus with many who come in with us to remain. 'The Lord is full of pity and merciful.' James v., 11. See also 1 Peter III., -8. Hos. xi. ,4. 'Draw them with bands of love.' Mic. vi., 8. 'To do justly, and to love mercy.' We are often, very often exhorted by writers of the Holy Scriptures, and also well-bred, good principled and real Christian people to a fellow feeling for others ; and those who possess the most of it can do others the most good. 'By love serve one another.' Gal. v., 10. See Job vi., 14. 'To him that is afflicted pity should be shown from his friend.' xvi., 4. 'I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.' 'But I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.' 'Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity.' Heb. xiii., 3. Civility comes from the heart, and this being right, all will work together for good, peace, love, harmony, heaven. Good nature and intelligence suggests politeness. That which operates most against good manners is an insensibility to or want of regard for the happiness of others, and is not this an evil heart? 'Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.' Rom. xii., 16., also Prov, xi., 17. 'The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh,' Knowing how much a pleasing method may do to comfort and reconcile, I do not think I could impeach my worst foe if he treated me with consideration and courtesy. James ii., 13. 'For he shall have judgment without mercy, that showed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.' If all our study was to so conduct as to solace others nod voluntarily and constantly make the sacrifice needful to insure it we would need little or no disciplining in behavior more than a little trial. We would soon find out how this deed or that wounded or caused distress to our companion and while there was nothing wrong in the act would for the sake of our associate shun it in future. Eph. iv., 32. 'Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.' How sweet to feel the holy influences of the spirit of love and forgiveness. It is balm to the wounded soul which nothing else is equal to ; and we may all dwell in love if we will keep our souls pure and clean, and be humble looking to God for it we shall be filled to overflowing. The Manifesto is very interesting and profitable. I love and appreciate it very much. Your article on ''Gentle Manuers' in the April No. is excellent, also your Editorials. Your quotation from Lytton is true and beautiful. 'What a rare gift Is manners ! better for one to possess them than wealth beauty or talents ; they will more than supply all.' I love Alother Hannah Kendall's exhortation 'to be kind to each other and be very careful not to hurt the oil and the wine. We should reverence God in each other and respect our Brothers and Sisters and treat them with good manners. When we speak of our- Brethren and Sisters we should call them Brethren and Sisters. We should leave all profane language, all jesting and speaking unkindly of each other to the children of the world. Our words should be seasoned with grace, that we do not say that which is wrong.' Elder Win. Leonard's writings are beautiful ; also Br. D; Orcutt's, Str. Mary Whitcher's, Martha J. Anderson's, L. B. Settles on 'Little Kindnesses,' M. Witham's, Selections fr^m J. G. Whittier, Forgiveness, Maxims contributed by O. N. Haskins, ;;nd a great many others too numerous to mention. Yours Truly, Harriet Shepard.
