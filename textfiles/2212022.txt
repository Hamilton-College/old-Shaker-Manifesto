Ayer, Mass. Nov. 1892. Grand, indeed, would be this world if all would live to tlieir opportunities of usefulness. Happiness would be more universal and misery would have a smaller space in the lives of men. The old maxim, 'The more good you do, the more good you'll be,' lias much truth, if not poetry. We find every time we attempt to carry grace and sweetness into the lives of others, we have imparted to our own lives a brightness and buoyancy that will increase with every such act, and be to us a continued growth of goodness. Our opportunities for doing good, are far more plenty than for which we give credit. We have always among us, the aged, whose long life of usefulness begins to tell upon them physically. Their infirm condition calls for many little acts of kindness; let us assist them all we can. Every kindness done to others is one step nearer the life of Christ. How good I feel enthusiastically exclaimed a little boy, who had helped a class-mate over a rough obstacle,'I wonder why it raises one up so to help any one who needs help.' And others, older in years and experience have wondered. 'What I give, I take with me when I cross the dark river.' This is a great truth. Our good Eldress Ellen Green, has been very ill for some weeks past. Our little school observed Columbus' day, and the children did honor to themselves and teacher. A. D. B.
