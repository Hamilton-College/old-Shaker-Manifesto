NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, New York Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Aug. 6.�Oats are standing in the fields. They are black and decaying. We have more or less rain, every day. Potatoes are being injured by the wet weather. We have had a lovely and profitable visit with our dear Sisters from Canterbury. They attended our meeting on Sat. evening. A. W. Aug. 15. It is rain, rain, rain. The earth is literally soaked, yet we rest in hope of a change for the better. We commenced haying in June, and closed in good season, but the harvesting still hangs on. We will strive to be patient. The crops still growing look finely, especially Sweet Corn, Beets, Carrots, Tomatoes and Turnips. At the Center Family we are doing a little toward beautifying our Mt. Zion. The Old Dwelling is having a coat of light paint. The horse barn roof is being changed, from that of a flat, gravel roof to a gable roof to be covered with slate. T. R. Watervliet, New York Watervliet, N. Y. Aug. We have had a very wet season so far. Our string beans almost an entire failure. Oats very much hurt. The hay crop was not so good as was anticipated. We shall not have a full crop of apples. Enfield, Connecticut Enfield, Conn. It has been hard work to secure the hay this season. The Brethren went to turn one lot and found some of it quite under water. Apples and peaches will be quite plenty. If the rain does not hurt the peaches, we shall have a good supply, but some of the early ones are now decaying on the trees. Canterbury, New Hampshire Canterbury, N. H.
