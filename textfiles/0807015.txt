MATERIALIZATIONS BY SPIRITS The excellent reports we have received of the materializations of scores of Shaker spirits at Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. give large credit to the ideas that such materializations are possible, and genuine facts. In rooms that were quite unused for such representations, and from cabinets arranged under Shaker supervision, there proceeded very many evidences of materializations, by the spirits of whilom, life long companions, whose representations and conversations forbade the idea of fraudulent imposition. We are not sure of the fact, but Mt. Lebanon may yet become a Mecca for those who are now, materialistic unbelievers in truths of spirit returns and physical embodiments.
