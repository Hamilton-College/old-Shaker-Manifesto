NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. . JS'ortli If&amp;mily. 'O what beauty there is in thee Ziou, lovely Zion; May thy strength and honor be Of an untold weight from heaven.' Our visiting company are all at home, having enjoyed a very profitable season with gospel kindred in seven different Societies. We could but notice that in every Society and family they had something different from every other. A peculiar manifestation of the beautiful spirit of love; a special spiritual gift and ministration; and when these meet together in the spirit and testimony of Mother's gospel we have the music of the spheres. One feature of our journey was specially interesting to me; and that was the graveyards ; they show real progress of spirit, and a gradual growth of understanding. This may not have come about from our designing, but it has come. The disposing of the mortal remains of our loved ones, has in times past, and is now, calling forth a good deal of exercise of mind. In passing by our burying places, and also many which did not belong to our order, I felt as though we might make the institution called death very interesting and profitable to the living. Instead of costly attire, expensive caskets and monuments of stone ; or wooden marks and tall weeds and briers, neither of which have a savory effect upon the living or upon the departed loved ones, 1 would like to set apart a room in which to place the shadow of the person who has just passed through the vail, with name and age, when they came among Believers, and any points of their history that would be of interest to the rising generations. Take, for instance, the aged saint, Elder Timothy Eandlett, sitting in his chair, patiently waiting the boatman's call; his countenance full of goodness and love; what pleasant thoughts and feelings it would excite to go into a room adorned with such shadows. A grave-yard is to me a place of sadness, and if the graves were opened, it would be a place of horror and disgust. Bury the body decently and in a place where it will do good and no harm, level the ground and keep a record and plan of the same, but do not put up costly marble slabs, or anything else. The angels set us an example in the disposing of the body of Jesus. Let us follow it. The hay and grain harvest about completed which has been very good. We have cut over 300 tons of hay, and some 50 acres of grain. Rye and wheat were excellent; oats generally light. If our machines and tools are all put away in good order, it will save time and vexation when we need to use them again Potatoes very nice; and though there are some things rather scarce, we have enough to fill every reasonable heart with gratitude and thankfulness, and to exercise ourselves in kindly Christian love towards everybody. D. Offord. Soutli ITa/mily. Dear Editor :�Not long since we told how many potatoes we had planted; now we must tell how wonderfully they have yielded. We do not find any nicer ones in market. We got fifteen very large ones in one hill, and if other crops have failed us, the potatoes have not. I think we have gathered two bushels of blueberries while we usually have three times two bushels. We will be twice glad to resort to the New Hampsnire syrup this year as that was not a failure. Since our last shower we have not been too warm. Those who have trouble with table salt should try putting in one cup of corn starch, in eight cups of salt. The people of Mt. Lebanon have proved it and like the way as the moisture is done away with. We have not been obliged to stay at home one Sabbath day this season on account of the rain. We are quite fortunate, as all meetings are together one day in seven which seems like the proper thing to do, some of the speaking and singing is excellent as it tends to union; 'we must dwell together in unity.' S. A. C. Hancock, Mass. August 12, 1890. We always hail with gladness the arrival of the precious messenger, which comes to us usually so punctually, and so neatly appareled. Mentally we exclaim, God bless its able Editor and worthy contributors. Long may it live to herald God's truths. We think each successive number of the Manifesto surpasses in excellence the preceding one. The Editorials in each number are most valuable and instructive. The August No. contains several most interesting articles. Letter from Dr. Carl, Instrumental Music, and the beautiful sentences in 'Our Lord's Prayer' so ably treated, are, in our opinion, super-excellent. Notes about home we find very pleasant reading and always turn with avidity to them, for we are anxious to know how the dear friends in other portions of God's vineyard are prospering. Observing the absence of notes from our beautiful home in June and July numbers, and knowing that vacations were in order in these days of excessive heat we fancied that our note-collector might be enjoying a vacation. But lo! on receiving Aug. No. we were agreeably surprised to fiivl that one writer at least, still remained at home. Produce from our vegetable garden is abundant. Green peas and new Irish potatoes headed the list of esculents that covered our dinner table on the first ot July; which is something unusual in this section of country. Elder Louis must have t ngagt-d tli.� services of tact, skill and perseverance to have been so successful. He was wonderfully prospered in raising a large fluck of chickens until they became quite sizable, when a large number of them disappeared, having been destroyed by some rapacious anim.il. Most kinds of fruit are unpromising this season. Pears are a total failure. Apples lew. Plum trees altogether fruith.-s. Small fruits not plenty excepting the blackberry which seems to yield well. Looking from our window we can see busy hands engaged in gathering this variety of berry from a nice little briar patch that was planted two years ago last spring by our venerable father, Elder Albert, and has been mostly cared for by him since. Should he live until the coining October he will have been eighty years an inhabitant of this earth sphere. He is a model of industry, frugality and temperance and is, in the true sense of the word, a Christian. A colony of busy workers have quietly come, as it seems, with the intention of making a permanent settlement. They belong to the class that a son of Erin once described as having a hot fut, (foot.) At present they appear inoffensive and if left undisturbed, will, we trust, remain quite peaceable. They have reared quite a structure for themselves and we think are well satisfied with their location. They may have emigrated from Norway as they have selected a Norway Spruce in which to build their residence. Is this an omen, and if so, is it for good or ill? can you tell us? Before closing our note we must tell you how displeased we are with your change of position, for we greatly fear that duty will not call you in the direction of our home as frequently as heretofore, and we well know that home duties will not be neglected by you for pleasure seeking. We all sincerely wish that you might give us a call, we think you would find that Old Berkshire maintained well her reputation for beautiful scenery and healthful climate. J. L. Sweet. Enfield, Conn. 'To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heavens,' so the Bible tells us'. We cannot find a niore truthful saying, yet there are many people who live as though they believed it not, and never find out how true it is,. Still, it takes most of us a good many years to learn the 'time to every purpose,' and the 'season for everything.' The sooner we learn to apply this God-given principle in our daily lives, and make it our rule to be systematic in our daily occupations, the better it will be fcr all concerned. Our crop of hay is large and of good quality. Ensilage corn is doing well. Japanese buckwheat looks strong and vigorous. Jumbo strawberries were large and good, vines healthy. Tobacco dust when used liberally in hen's nests will free them from vermin. Nests that are mo'veable are convenient and quickly cleaned. Nothing is better ;for moulting fowls than ground oats, meat and bran mixed with milk. Wheat is excellent and helps to form muscle, something needed during the weakening process. Cool shade is essential while hens are moulting. It costs more to keep a poor old hen than a good young one, while the profits from the latter are three times those of the former. D. Orcutt. Elder John Whiteley of Harvard, Mass., and Elder Robert Aitken of Enfield, Conn., sailed on the 8th of August, for England, and will be absent about two months. Harvard, Mass. Aug. 10, 1890. We begin to realize our loss by the long drought. For seven long weeks through the hay season and before, the blessing of rain was withheld from mother earth, and right in the time our potato crop needed it the most. We Khali realize from our late potatoes a reasonable crop. But early ones are very small. Apples are scarce. Corn is looking beautiful and the largest crop planted for many years. The hay crop was harvested without a drop of rain which makes it of excellent quality. Garden vegetables are good. Onions will be an excellent crop. This sums up the temporalities. Our dear Elder John Whiteley started for England, the home of his boyhood, on Saturday the 9th of August. He is to be gone two months and we pray he may have a happy time. Our prayers shall be many and fervent for him that he may find some noble minds who will come, and like him live out the principles of self-denial. Health of Society quite good, none on the sick list. One more effort to beautify our home. The twelve acres of land lying between the Church and South Family which had grown up to bushes and was spoiled even for pasture is now being cleared and the intention is to make it into a meadow equal to any which lies aside of it. We felt a little of the cyclone which commenced in Harvard and did such damage in South Lawrence. What protection we are under! JFor almost one hundred years this Society has not met with any serious calami- ty by flood, wind or fire. Why should we not sing hymns of thanksgiving? This morning many spoke of the protecting power which has been so liberally extended to us. Our meeting is filled with good gifts, and our songs ring out the spirit of thankfulness. A. Barrett. Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Elder Henry :�The not too much of a good thing, which it has been our fortune to enjoy since we wrote you last, is the visit of Brothers Daniel Offord and Charles Greaves, with four sister companions from the North Family at Mt. Lebanon, who were at Canterbury from July 29 to August 5. It was only too good to last, as the children say, and so at the latter date they left us for a brief tarry at Shaker Station, as they journeyed homeward. It was not hard in their presence to believe that 'the pure in heart see God.' We blessed each other, as only the loyal who know the worth of loyalty can bless. How sweet the comfort of spiritual gifts and how blest the interchange. Bro. Daniel Offord spoke to us on the Sabbath, as a brother speaks to his friends where no cloaks are worn. One of our Brethren said in appreciation that he had heard many persons strike each side of the nail and in fact all around it, but never so squarely on the head as Bro. Daniel had done or did, upon the subject of 'Our United Inheritance.' Shall we send inquiry for Bro. Alonzo Hollister, who we hear is to journey this way? Rain fell nearly all day on Sat. July 26. On Thurs. July 31, took place the thunder shower and wind squall which did so much damage north of us. Two slight rainfalls only within the last two months. Hay is of extraordinary quality and stored in the barns in excellent condition. Corn is growing fast; sweet corn already ripe and White Rice pop corn eight feet tall. The pear and apple crops are light. Bro. George Clark speaks of 'a full crop of peaches' which we hope to realize. Blackberries plenteous and gatherers busy. We have little cause for complaint at any season, and are only desirous to forget earthly selfish interests and send out our sympathies in kindly solicitude for the relief of those who suffer and for the welfare of all mankind. We are thinking especially just now of the 'blessings in disguise' attending our dear western friends at Union Vill ge, Ohio In the death of one of their ablest leaders, we remember them in more than words, but whether we sorrow or rejoice, let us often sing 'To-day, though the vintage may fail, And answer to prayer seem to wait, Still let thy faith cheer thee to-day, God's blessings can never be late.' Two of our Sisters attended the Universalist camp meeting at the Weirs N. H., and responded to the kind invitation to take an active part. Enfield, N. H. Aug. 12. As the question presents itself, what can we say for this month, (and the months march on with greater rapidity, than before we engaged in this enterprise,) the answer comes, Write, or rather attempt to write our thanks, to the good people of Mt. Lebanon, for sparing from their ranks, the lovely souls who have recently sojourned with us. So we formally, but sincerely tender our thanks to the household that sent out these ministers of blessing, as added burden must have been borne by other willing hands in their absence. Words can never tell the amount of good such angel visits accomplish, and every time we are thus blessed, we question afresh, why must they be so 'few and far between?' On Aug 1st. we had the nearest approach to a cyclone, which the people in ti.is vicinity ever witnessed, and although pea vines, which our faithful brother Simeon Childs, had spread before the kitchen piazza fo dry, were the only things that were lifted bodily, we were perfectly satisfied, not to experience a full blown one: clouds of dust filled the air at intervals before the rain fall which came in torrents at first, but subsided into a refreshing summer shower, that brightened the face of nature wonderfully. Br. Thomas Stedman who ought to be authority in the hay line, reports the harvest one third less than usual in quantity, but superior in quality. Cereals a failure. On Aug. 6 th. the Anniversary of our Mother's landing �n American soil, the sisterhood of our Society enjoyed a profitable meeting, indeed, the spirit of these gatherings, can never be placed upon paper, but the pure, hallowed influence realized therefrom, is a power for good, and we believe every effort to bear the standard high, is recorded by angel messengers. We sang '' God's Love is at the Helm, ' in unison with our dear sisters elsewhere, thanks to the author of this suggestion. E. B. Groveland, N. Y. It is decidedly uncomfortable to-day with the mtrcury climbing above one hundred. It's too hot to work, too hot to write, So we're inclined some plans to slight. A very unreliable form of weather prevails out this way. During the spring and early summer rain storms visited here daily, the most prominent feature of the mornings was rain, noons were the same, and nights were a repetition of both. But those rainy days, those rainy days, Have now all disappeared; A scorching sun with withered grass, Predicts a drouth 'tis feared. The five past weeks have been noted for excessive heat and dryness, only a few light showers and those but a trifle more than a sprinkle found their way here. Perhaps the rain-clouds that covered the sky for the first half of the year have sailed across the Continent to give the inhabitants there a spray from the mighty sea above. Now if some of them would return and favor us with a dashing and splashing once or twice each week, we would thankfully send our thanks skyward. The harvesting of hay and grain is the daily occupation of farmers, and is proving a successful success. The song of the reaper and mower is heard from morn till eve, making music pleasing to hear, giving evidence that industry and enterprise reigns, and that the Earth with its fullness of fruitage, Declareth God's wondrous skill, His goodness forever surrounds us And ever, forever it will. The delegation that left here on a bright June morning returned on the ninth ult. glad and happy to reacli home and friends, (their Ark of safety.) Peaches have not proved an entire failure as some foretold. A few bushels have been secured and preserved for winter comfort, while occasionally a breakfast or dinner has been decorated with the delicious fruit which is ever healthful and refreshing. Easpberries and currants have grown luxuriantly, but the English sparrows too well know Where the best of all fruits grow; Plucking first the ripened cherries, Then to currants and to berries, So their wicked bills we see Stamped on every bush and tree. Last Tuesday morning the twenty-ninth ult , Sister Ann Work awakened into Spirit life or embarked for the region far away, (but always near,) happy in the freedom from earth and earthly things Wednesday the following day her funeral was attended in the family Hall, some of the family accompanied the remains to their final rest where, Dust to dust and earth to earth, To her soul means life and mirth. G. D. G. Union Village, Ohio. August 1890. Our harvest is ended. Crop fair. Weather dry. Corn suffering for rain. Separateness, or want of oneness with God, is the bane of all existence. At-onement with God is the sum of all bliss, all peace, all contentment. Our school district numbers thirty pupils. O. C. H. Union Village, Ohio. Aug. 1890. Beloved Eldress Dorothy :�We took the cars at Albany, N. Y., at 1-4:5 P. M. and reached Union Village, at 11 A. M., the next day. There are many who mourn the loss of Beloved Elder Matthew, and yet they bear their burdens quite manfully. Elder Napoleon B., Elder James R. and Eldress Jane C. have been on a visit to this place, but will return to their homes in Ky. on the 11th inst. It is very hot and dry. No rain has fallen since June. Wheat and oats are a medium crop. Corn and potatoes will be light on account of the drought. The apple crop will also be light. Although my time is well filled with the many calls of the hour, yet I always look to your dear home with great pleasure and send kindest regards to all the friends at Canterbury. May God bless you now and forever. Accept kindest love from the Elders, and also from the writer. Your Sister in the gospel. Elizabeth Cantrell. White Water, O. North. Family. Aug. 1890. Well here I am again for the month of August I must have something to write about our home, must say we are shining up pretty well here. We have been white-washing the fence along the highway and painting the gates, some a bright red and others a light blue. I have been painting our laundry engine, so it looks like a new one again. We have had our cistern fixed in the front yard, it had caved in last spring, so we are getting things fixed pretty nicely. We have started in the sheep business again, with a start of twelve head of very fine sheep all young frora one to four years. The weather has been very hot for the past week. We are selling off some of our cows and investing the money in the sheep. We are taking care of the cows ourselves now, we used to pay a man $ 18. per month. We have but one hired man at this family. We are also working our road tax and have about four days to work. Our home begins to look very nice. We also put up forty-four rods of combination fence. We will have very short crops of corn here if it does not rain soon. It is very dry. The center family have been taking sugar melons to market. They get from $2.50 to $3 and $3.50 per bushel for them. They have also been in the rabbit business for the past year, they have what they call the german or scotch hares, they have some that would weigh about eight or ten pounds. They have about fifteen young ones and five old ones. They are a fine sight to see, every body admires them. People in this section are plowing for wheat. The center family bought a new creamery witli a crank to raise all of the cans at one time out of the box. Their herdsman has been fixing the cowbarn floor lie is taking out the board floor and putting in stone and gravel floor. H. W. Frederick. South Union, Ky August 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�The August Manifesto was a very interesting number. Eldress Anna White hit the nail square on the head. Elder O. C Hampton's 'Soliloquy' was good. The Editorial, and in fact I might name them all, are good. From a wheat field that was fertilized they obtained 19 bushels per acre, while from one without this extra care they obtained 8 bu. pr. acre and from another 10 bushels, so the fertilizing paid well. This has been a great fly year and a fruitful year for rabbits. In the evening the rabbits are running around the yards almost as tame as cats. H. L. E.
