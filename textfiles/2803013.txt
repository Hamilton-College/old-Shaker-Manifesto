Sabbathday Lake, Me. Feb. 1898. Mid-winter is here. Snow lies in huge banks all about us, and it is often remarked,'We are having a real old-fashioned winter.' Several fierce storms have visited this vicinity lately making prisoners of us for a day or two and weather severely cold at the same time. Now the days are growing longer and we are rejoicing in the thought that winter will not last forever. The Brethren succeeded in harvesting a quantity of fine ice before the big storm came. At present some are engaged in lumbering. A brother has lately felled an old growth pine, four and a half feet in diameter at the base. Since last Nov. we have been studying the rules of music. An hour each day for the different classes has been spent under the careful training of Sister Ednah Fitts, to which we gladly respond. We most certainly appreciate the kindness of our brothers and sisters of Canterbury who are so lovingly bestowing upon us from their fund of knowledge. Elder Wm. Dumont and Br. Wm. Paul are kindly giving their time caring for our aged Father Samuel Kendrick who is still lingering with us,'Only waiting till the shadows are a little longer grown.' Ada S. Cummings.
