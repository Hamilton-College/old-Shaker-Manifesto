Beloved Brother Daniel Orcutt:--Through the columns of the Manifesto... Pleasant Hill, Ky., 1889. Beloved Brother Daniel Orcutt :ï¿½ Through the columns of the Manifesto I take the liberty to address you; knowing its mission is to publish good news unto all. I can express the thanks of myself and little friends for the many beautiful letters of kind advice, which we have had the pleasure of reading month after month. Perhaps you would like to hear something about us in our southern home. The weather is remarkably mild this winter, not any snow at all. I go to Sunday School every Sunday and like it very much. Last year our lessons were from Exodus to Ruth; this year they are and will be in Mark and Luke. I have not missed a single Sunday. I feel that it is a great benefit to us little folks, and I feel that we should do all we can to show our appreciation to our dear kind teachers, who do so much for our good. Elder Francis Pennebaker is our Superintendent. He is so kind and good, we like him very much. Our Sunday School has seventy-five members. Dear Brother Daniel, 'Kind words can never die,' so may yours that are so kindly given, be implanted in the hearts of all Zion's children to return again unto you. Please accept the love and thanks of your many little friends of Pleasant Hill. Hoping that we may hear from you again, we will faithfully strive to merit the love of all, by following your precious advice. Sincerely, Maude Ambrose,
