THE SPEAK-NO-EVIL CLUB A very novel society which has been started in England is called ' The Speak-no-Evil Society.' Its members are enjoined before speaking evil of any one to ask themselves three questions : 'Is it true? Is it kind? Is it necessary?' These simple questions, if answered by all evil-speakers before uttering the remarks derogatory to others, might result in a new society of most delightful qualities. Often people speak evil, not from any motives of unkindness, but from vanity. They think that by pointing out the faults of other people they will cause their own virtues to shine out in a brighter light. Nothing could be more erroneous. By speaking evil they create the distrust of those who hear them and lose a position of dignity which true reserve always brings. When evil speaking is necessary to warn others against placing confidence in the evil doer, the circumstances of the case are changed and the necessity of the criticism will cause the critic to be respected. On a similar basis with the ' Speak-no-Evil Club ' is a club proposed by 'Good Housekeeping' for a mind cure. Its rules are : Personal ills are not to be mentioned. Anything like gossip is to be avoided. Nothing depressing or gloomy is to be allowed. The first rule is a valuable adjunct to the speak-no-evil questions. One who continually speaks evil of himself is not only selfish but discourteous to others, but a boor who does not put in practice the first rule of polite society. His complaints are mistrusted and his criticisms made an object of amusement. Unselfishness makes the rules which prevent the speaking of evil bright and attractive. Boston Journal.
