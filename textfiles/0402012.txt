Taking Cold If a cold settles on the outer covering of the lungs, it becomes pneumonia, in- flammation of the lungs or lung fever, and in many cases, carries off the strongest man to the grave, within a week. If cold falls upon the inner covering of the lungs, it is pleurisy, with its knife-like pains and its slow, very slow recoveries. If a cold settles in the joints, then it is rheumatism, with its agonies of pain, and rheumatism of the heart, which in an instant, sometimes snaps asunder the cords of life, with no friendly warning. It is of the utmost practicable importance then, in the wintry weather, to know not so much how to cure a cold, as to avoid it. Colds always come from one cause, some part of the body being colder than natural for a time. If persons will always keep their feet warm, and never allow themselves to be chilled, they will never take a cold in a lifetime, and this can only be accomplished by the exercise of due care in warm clothing, and an avoidance of drafts and exposure. While multitudes of colds come from cold feet, perhaps the majority arise from cooling off too quickly after becoming a little warmer than is natural, from ex- ercise or work, or from confinement in a warm apartment.
