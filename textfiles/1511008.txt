THE SABBATH. MARION JOHNSON. The blessed, holy Sabbath,ï¿½ What joy and p ;ace it brings; To guide us onward, heaven-ward, On its celestial wings. Tts brightness o'er us streaming. Dispels all gloom and care : And soothes the troubled spirit, With tranquil thought and prayer. Thy sun in splendor shineth, Thou golden Sabbath morn; The air, perfumed with fragrance, Sweeping o'er the flowery lawn. The birds in tuneful chorus Are warbling sweet thy praise, And leafy groves are ringing With rich melodious lays. 0 may thy influence holy Flow into every soul; Baptizing deep the spirit, With love's supre;ne control. May Angels bright descending With blessings on their wings, To heaven our souls be leading, To dwell ' mid better things. ' Canterbury, N. H.
