Canterbury, N. H. Oct. 18, 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�We left home notes when you began with the meeting in the Oct. number. Wishing to hear from each Society, we would not send you too much at one time. However, as good things, friendly calls, visits and precious associations of Gospel kindred, do not lose flavor by keeping, we will note an enjoyable season of call and visit in one unbroken chain of satisfaction which came to us, Sept. 11, and finally closed Sept. 26.�Brother Samuel Kendrick, accompanied by four loving Sisters from Gloucester, Me. [The length of this tarry may puzzle some who do not understand the efficacy of rain at such seasons; but visitors, or 'visited' can readily explain.] Brother Samuel lived in Canterbury from boyhood to middle age, when, being one whom the Lord and his Brethren and Sisters loved, hence chastened, he was asked to give his services in other parts of the vineyard. The good Brother is a host in himself, and is thus able to inspire from his wellsecured treasures of love and wisdom. He cast no shadow, but comfort and peace followed him, proving that a consecrated Christian life may be fraught with rays of mirthfulness which often add pleasure to the passing day. His companions stirred afresh our love for all Gospel friends. Such loyal daughters are above price as virtuous women�standard-bearers in Zion ! A call from Br. Daniel Orcutt and two Sisters from Enfield, Conn., pleased us much, as well as Brethren and Sisters from other Societies. We have been not only pleased, but crowned with blessing by these messengers of peace, who have been more in number than for several years past. Come again, good friends. Do not forget us during the winter months. We shall have sunshine ever in our hearts. Br. Daniel, the 'children's friend,' was especially welcomed by our youthful class, who have for so long a time treasured the gems of counsel, so regularly contributed to the Manifesto. Continue to write, good Brother. With our friends and neighbors we have harvested medium crops of apples, pears and potatoes, and have surprised ourselves in gathering about eighty bushels of peaches. At one period there were fears of potatoes suffering from rust and rot, but with a change of weather, hope and potatoes have revived. Our herdsman in lis care for the food of the milch cows during the winter has harvested 100 bu. of carrots, 100 bu. of Gate Post beets, and 200 bu. of Jumbo beets, and the Dairy tells the benefits. We have made more extended repairs in several buildings than we anticipated in early spring and rejoice to-day in many added conveniences, among which are several canopies over outside doors. General Good Health is with our Society and we engage him for the winter. Our Brethren and Sisters of the North Family conclude to meet with us for worship every fair Sabbath during the winter, also contribute to our evening schocls. Don't fail.
