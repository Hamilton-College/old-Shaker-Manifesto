In Honor Preferring One Another. JULIA PEARSON. Should not this be the law written on our hearts where we could feel the importance of it daily, yea, hourly? How much trouble and ill feeliug is caused by putting one's self before others in small matters. Of course we should not go contrary to the laws of Zion, or sin against our consciences to please another ; but there are many things that are non-essential to right and wrong that we push for, to the harm of our friend's peace of mind. Or we with hold little acts and kiod words because we think they will not be appreciated ; that is not for us to judge, it is our duty to cultivate that God-like love, which can fill our hearts with peace and kind thoughts for all. Do we expect that our Heavenly Parents will not heed our supplications before the throne of grace, because of our faults? Then why should we disown any of our brothers or sisters as unworthy our thought and consideration for their welfare even in little things? O, when shall we reach that state when we shall not allow a slight from another to alter our tone and manner towards them ; when true love shall fill our hearts to the exclusion of bitterness and strife throughout the Temple.
