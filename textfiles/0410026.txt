Revision of the Bible It appears, from recent developments, that another revision of this book is now going on by a body of English scholars and theologians, and so thorough is the work to be done that it is expected to occupy altogether some eight or ten years. There is little doubt the bible needs an extensive revision, and there is much in it that, if left out altogether, would greatly improve it. But if it be truly the Word of God, how about these changes? Cape Ann Advertiser
