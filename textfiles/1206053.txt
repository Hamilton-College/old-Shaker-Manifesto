Truth .—Truth will never die; the stars will grow dim; the sun will pale his glory, but truth will be forever young. Integrity, uprightness, honesty, love and goodness, these are all imperishable. No grave can ever entomb these immortal principles. They have been imprisoned, but they have been freer than before ; those who have enshrined them in their hearts have been burned at the stake, but out of their ashes other witnesses have arisen. No sea can drown, no storm can wreck, no abyss can swallow up the ever-living truth of God. You cannot kill goodness and truth and integrity and faith and holiness ; the way that is consistent with these must be a way everlasting.—Spurgeon.
