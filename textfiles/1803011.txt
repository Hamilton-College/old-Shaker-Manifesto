QUERIES. Sahah F. Wilson. What the record of the year? Past, yet fresh in memory; As is present hope or fear Or the joys of yesterday. Where the hearts by thee sustained Who would ask a blessing thine? Where the souls thy voice hath gained To a love for truths divine? Where the needy ones supplied From the treasures of thy mind? Should they ask for mercies wide Would they sweet forgiveness find? Like the Good Samaritan Hast thou sought out the oppressed? Or hast given oil and balm To relieve the sore distressed? Can there rise from out the throng Surging through life's crowded street, One to say,ï¿½ 'From paths of wrong Thou hast turned my wayward feet.' This thti mission of the Christ Succor for the suffering; Balm and comfort to impart Asking not, but minist'ring. Thus the queries thick and fast 'Fore my mental vision rise; Chide they solemnly the past Yet, they're blessings in disguise. Canterbury, N. H.
