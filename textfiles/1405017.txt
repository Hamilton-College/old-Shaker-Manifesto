WOMAN'S RIGHTS. F. W. EVANS. . The enclosed article is good. Coining from Secretary Folger, it will have a place in the history of the successive steps by which women will yet become American citizens. It is only a matter of evolution�time. God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. But politically, woman is not yet created. Man has existed and ruled, by virtue of his superior physical force. Wars, and rumors of wars, constitute the backbone of his history,�all human history. When woman exists politically, with man, there will be Peace ; the council of peace will be between them Wars will cease to the ends of the earth, and the nations will learn war no more. Kindreds, tongues and people will be linked together by so many interests, that no two nations can war each other without warring with all the nations of earth at the same time. And, to all the non-interested, national spectators, the impending quarrel will look as insignificant as such quarrels usually look to posterity. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
