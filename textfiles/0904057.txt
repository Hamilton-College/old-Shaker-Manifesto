LIFE'S UNFOLDMENT Martha J. Anderson Mount Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Not all a dream, a passing dream, Is life's unfoldment here; 2. Behold a silent work goes on, In nature's vast expanse; 3. Who clothes the lillies of the field? And marks the planets' course? 4. O, what a glorious destiny, Awaits the human soul! Earth's brightest glories are but gleams, Prom out the inner sphere. Where germs upspring in beauteous forms, By law, and not by chance; Makes earth a fruitful harvest yield? Renews each secret force? Beyond a brief mortality, Where higher powers control. What hopes and longings fill the heart, And lift the mind on highâ€” fTis thus the spirit's laten! force, In ceaseless action strives, That same ereative power, beholds With tenderness and love, And step by step, a starry way Will mark its progress on; THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 95 They tell that the immortal part, Can never, never die. And fed from truth's eternal source, In growth and beauty thrives. His noblest works where life unfolds, Like types revealed above. Rejoicing in unclouded day, Where perfect victory's won.
