DIOTREPHES. [Contributed by Chas. A. Cook.] Among the portraits sketched by inspiration, which have come down through the ages to us, is that of Diotrephes, drawn by the beloved disciple John in his third epistle. Where Diotrephes was born, or lived, or died, we are not informed. He has left neither works or words behind as his memorial. No books embalm his thoughts, no traditions communicate the story of his good deeds. All we know of his story is embodied in these brief words: 'I wrote unto the church : but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore, if I come, I will remember lie deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words : and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. Pie that doeth good is of God ; but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. ' Diotrephes was a church member, that seems plain. How he got into the church is ï¿½ not known. It was a poor fisherman who caught such a fish. But he was in, and was inclined to stay in, no matter who else might be shut out. He was probably an office bearer, perhaps an elder in the church. How he obtained office we do not know. We can only guess by comparing his career with that of others of similar character. Somehow, perhaps by smooth talk, apparent zeal, or a profession of piety and humility, he got himself into office; and once in, he cmild 1 -e trusted to stay there. He magnified his office, and magnified himself as the proper man to fill it. He not only filled his own office but run over into others, until he controlled the church. His predominant characteristic the apostle intimates, when he describes him as one who loved 'to have the pre-eminence ' among them. And as John in his old age was revered and beloved for his worth and labors, there was no place for him in the church where Diotrephes reigned; and so the aged apostle could say : he ' receiveth us not.' The epistle which John wrote to the church was treated with contempt by this stiff-necked demagogue, whom the apostle describes as ' prating against us with malicious words; ' and not content with maligning and abusing the apostles of the Lord, he would not receive 'the brethren' and forbade them that wov.ld, and cast them ' out of the church. ' Diotrephes loved pre-eminence and attained it. He coveted power and usurped it. He evidently desired notoriety and he has it. His likeness is framed and hung up in infamy before the gaze of the ages. His exalted position only enhances his disgrace. Let the descendants and imitators of this ancient demagogue take warning, lest in seeking to be famous they become infamous, and not only bring upon themselves present dis* grace, but at last receive the condemnation of the Lord in the judgment day.
