TRUE HAPPINESS. NO. 1. Emil Schreiter. We all wrish to be happy, but very few seek true happiness ; that happiness which never vanishes, which lasts forever. True happiness can be found only in conscious union with God our Heavenly Father, therefore, my daily, continual prayer is, that God may be with me and with all my Brethren and Sisters ; that he may enter into our hearts, that bis spirit may be united with our spirit, that they may be like one, then will true happiness be ours, then shall we really be at-oned. What is the meaning of this ? God our Father in Heaven, is the great spiritual sun, the center of the universe, from which streams out to every particle of creation, to every being, the highest and the lowest, the essence or substance of Divine life, which is love, wisdom and holy will. Will or energy, is the active (that is creative and preservative) principle of Divine substance. If we wish to be at-oned�that means to be one with God or united with him,�then his love, his wisdom and his holy will must take dwelling in our hearts ; we must strive to equal him in every respect. But we cannot reach this perfection through our own power and will, without his aid and assistance. God assists only those who seek his help by prayer. The first step toward Divine perfection therefore, is prayer : not only once in a while, but daily, continual prayer for Divine help and assistance in our endeavors. 'There is an Eye that never sleeps Beneath the wing of night; There is an Ear that never shuts When sinks the beams of light; There is an Arm that never tires, When human strength gives way; There is a Love that never fails, When earthly loves decay. That Eye is fixed on seraph throngs; That Ear is filled with angels' songs; That Arm upholds the worlds on high; That Love is throned beyond the sky. But there's a power which man can wield When mortal aid is vain, That Eye, that Arm, that Love to reach That listening Ear to gain : That power is Prayer, which soars on high, And feeds on bliss beyond the sky.'
