LAY DOWN THY LIFE By Frederic M'Kechnie Lay down thy life, if thou wouldst live! I heard a heaven-angel cry, Lay down thy life! and they shall give, God's holy ones who dwell on high, The life that nevermore shall die. Lay down thy life! with all the lust To have, to hold, to fight, to win; And for thou willst, not for thou must, Put far away each darling sin, And let the power of God come in. Lay down thy life ! small is the loss, But large the prize and great the gain; Thou carriest but a passing cross ; And bearest but a little pain, For joys that wax and never wane. Lay down thy life ! they call for thee ; The valiant souls who steadfast stood; Shake off thy fetters and be free, They say, who faced the fire and flood, And gave ungrudged their heart's best blood. Oh heed, my soul, and let the world, The foolish world, drive blindly on, No longer in its eddies whirled, On with thine armor, and be gone ! A kingdom waiteth to be won. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
