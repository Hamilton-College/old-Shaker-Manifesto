A New Jersey paper says that ninety years ago it was regarded as a settled point that corn in drills gave a larger product than in hills, but that now, after much discussion, it remains unsettled. The remark would not be made by any one who had informed himself on the subject. We have thoroughly tested this question by measuring the results and find almost uniformly an increase of 25 to 30 per cent with drill corn over hills, provided the proper distance is given for the plants. It would be easy to obtain a diminished amount from the drills if too thinly planted ; or ears of an inferior quality if too thick. John Johnston informs us that after long experience he arrives at results precisely similar to those we have mentioned.â€”Country Gentleman .
