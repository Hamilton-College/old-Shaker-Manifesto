THE SHAKERS IN LYNN Having seen, by the papers, the Shakers were to speak in Lynn, I took the cars, Sunday p. m. May 31, and there found Elder Vance, from Maine, and Elders John Whitely and William Leonard, of Harvard, Mass. ; Catharine B. Walker and other Sisters gathered at Oxford Hall, occupied by the Supervisors. Elder Wm. Leonard spoke at some length on the confession of sins, to Elders and Elderesses, and was listened to with marked attention. The meeting was addressed by Elder Vance, and by J. M. Peebles, the champion of Spiritualism, setting forth the doctrine of practical religion, by good works, and of doing to others, as we would others should do to us, taking the Bible and Inspiration as our only rule of faith and practice. The singing was truly delightful and enchanting ; the faces of the audience seemed to shine with admiration. In the evening, Elder Vance spoke, at some length, on the true marriage question, as taught in the Scriptures — and as practiced at the present day, showing the absurdities and misery growing out of the latter. Sister C. B. Walker gave a deeply interesting account of her experience — why she became a Shakeress. She spoke in a clear tone of voice, that seemed to carry conviction to the hearts of all present. Every word seemed to be clothed with inspiration and love. She said it would be impossible to convey to the human soul the joy and peace of mind that thrilled her heart, in self-consecration to Shaker faith. I never saw an audience so completely spell-bound and delighted as on that occasion. The time has fully come, I think, for the Shakers to go out into the world, and let their light shine. The world is in darkness and needs the light. I have visited, and been conversant, with the Shakers, more than a score of years, and have ever found them truthfnl, kind and honest.
