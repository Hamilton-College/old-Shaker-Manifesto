The beautiful summer has passed, although the harvest is not ended; and yet how brief seems the period since the sowing and planting time. Really 'Time flies' and we fly with it, hardly having an opportunity to secure the precious moments, ere they elude our grasp. Surely 'Now is the acceptable time' should be the motto of each who would make life worth the living. Our blessings the season past have been manifold. The sowing and reaping of temporal blessings, have been sure, while others of our dear friends near by have suffered the loss of crops by the devastations of wind and hail. Our garden yields productively, by faithful care. We had two-fifths of a mile of pears, as much by measurement of raspberries and blackberries, with an occasional specimen of the dewberry, a running blackberry, the average size of which is an inch and a half long, and three inches in circumference. To these are added all the nutritious vegetables, indigenous to our climate. Yet amid all these blessings, we are puzzled by a problem which we wonder if any of our sister Societies have solved. When we add healthful food, regular meals, and temperate habits, the sum or amount is perfect digestion, consequently good health. But when we subtract therefrom�as we are obliged to�imperfect mastication caused by rapid eating, the remainder is sure to be indigestion, with its attendant ill-omened figures; and to econcile these antagonisms, is as impossible as it is for the defaulting cashier to meet the demands of his bank, when he has subtracted the funds placed in his charge, for his own selfish use. 'Bolted' food is wasted food, since it is not what we eat but what we digest that makes us strong. It is said that those who properly masticate their food, never eat too much. Under these considerations economy would balance the scales, and add health, strength, and virtue which would far outweigh the little increase of time. Our summer school term of seventeen weeks ended Sept. 1st. Good teachers, interested pupils, and satisfactory results, is the verdict of all who have visited the school, or have been associated with the children out of school. On the last of August we little people had a delightful visit and picnic, with our dear friends at Hancock, who entertained us beautifully. Our- - - - - - - -to be continued in our next. Amelia J. Calver. North Family. Sept. 1893. We read with much pleasure the very excellent and thoughtful editorial of the Sept. Manifesto. The opening sentence of which is the key to our thoughts at this writing. The love and the peace that flows from the spiritual union of Brethren and Sisters, brought together by the love of purity is more precious, saving, and uplifting than any other gift under heaven. 'Though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains,* and have not charity (or love) I am nothing.' We feel the importance of gathering and cultivating this beautiful gift of divine love. Where pure love is, the love of God, the love of the divine in Brother and Sister, there is freedom and confidence. Nothing is more helpful to the growth and strength of this union and the quick- THE MANIFESTO. 239 ening of this divine love than the blending of our gifts and aspirations in our spiritual meetings. Let us keep the altar fires of our spiritual meetings burning brightly and we shall surely increase in love and zeal and devotion. St. Paul, writing to the early churches says;�'Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.' We feel the force of the admonition in this last quotation and know the consequences of neglect. Since last writing, the Brethren and Sisters one day, and the boys and girls another day, enjoyed their usual summer ride. These are very enjoyable days, when the weather and all other appointments are favorable, as this year. Had our first frost on the 3rd inst. We began cutting ensilage corn on the 11th. Walter S. Shepard. Shakers, N. Y. North Family. Sept. 1893. We were reminded recently, in one of our spiritual meetings, by the testimony of the Elder, of the importance of laboring first, for a spiritual interest in the cause, and if we did the temporal would not lack support. To seek first the kingdom of heaven, and all else would be added. In our experience we have observed that those who are deeply solicitous that the spiritual gift be upheld, are faithful in temporal things. Our weekly Society meetings are seasons of special blessing, in which the gifts of the spirit flow abundantly; and may we always be in a condition to receive their benefits. The old saying that 'one extreme follows another,' is applicable at present to the weather. It rains 'just as easy' and we are getting a superabundance of it, but it is better than a drought. On the 23rd of August, the different Sabbath schools in this vicinity, had a picnic in the Church family's grove. On a liberal estimate, more than a thousand people assembled. As there was to be speaking by different clergymen, and as we were anxious to see from what fountain they drew their inspiration, a small delegation from the North family attended. We were pleasantly disappointed. The remarks made were directed to the practical duties of life, urging the young, as they were the ones soon to hold the destinies of the world in their grasp, to set the standard of their life high; to have a laudable ambition to be known as those who had lived to help lift human society to a higher plane of thought and action. The absence of the dry forms of theological discussion was very marked. When we look around and see the vast estates of Believers and know that thousands are suffering for the mere necessaries of life who could have the benefits of a peaceful home, if they were willing to make the sacrifice needed, the dying words of Captain Lawrence seem to sound in our ears from the immortal shores, 'Don't give up the ship.' The testimony of eternal truth is at present, as never before 'smashing the godless shrines of man,' and those who are faithful to the higher life, will yet rejoice with an exceeding great joy. Hamilton DeGraw. Second Family. Sept. 1893. We are having good weather to secure crops. Aug. 29th we had the worst storm of the season�a half grown cyclone, it not only blew fruit off the trees, but took trees and all, in some cases. What few apples we had, were nearly all blown from the trees. We have had a slight frost in some low places, but not enough to do any damage. Are busy canning tomatoes and drying sweet corn. As crops are late, we shall drive the harvest to secure them before Jack Frost steps in for his share. With all this we do not lose sight of our spiritual duties. Our Society meetings 240 THE MANIFESTO. give strength to the faithful as well as encouragement to the weak. Although outnumbers are comparatively few, we strive to keep the gospel by testimony and daily practice. As 'the darkest hour is just before the dawn,' we have the faith that daylight will soon be here, and with it a renewal of conviction, and a pentecostal baptism. Isaac Anstatt.
