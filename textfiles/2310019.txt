Shakers, N. Y. North Family. Sept. 1893. We were reminded recently, in one of our spiritual meetings, by the testimony of the Elder, of the importance of laboring first, for a spiritual interest in the cause, and if we did the temporal would not lack support. To seek first the kingdom of heaven, and all else would be added. In our experience we have observed that those who are deeply solicitous that the spiritual gift be upheld, are faithful in temporal things. Our weekly Society meetings are seasons of special blessing, in which the gifts of the spirit flow abundantly; and may we always be in a condition to receive their benefits. The old saying that 'one extreme follows another,' is applicable at present to the weather. It rains 'just as easy' and we are getting a superabundance of it, but it is better than a drought. On the 23rd of August, the different Sabbath schools in this vicinity, had a picnic in the Church family's grove. On a liberal estimate, more than a thousand people assembled. As there was to be speaking by different clergymen, and as we were anxious to see from what fountain they drew their inspiration, a small delegation from the North family attended. We were pleasantly disappointed. The remarks made were directed to the practical duties of life, urging the young, as they were the ones soon to hold the destinies of the world in their grasp, to set the standard of their life high; to have a laudable ambition to be known as those who had lived to help lift human society to a higher plane of thought and action. The absence of the dry forms of theological discussion was very marked. When we look around and see the vast estates of Believers and know that thousands are suffering for the mere necessaries of life who could have the benefits of a peaceful home, if they were willing to make the sacrifice needed, the dying words of Captain Lawrence seem to sound in our ears from the immortal shores, 'Don't give up the ship.' The testimony of eternal truth is at present, as never before 'smashing the godless shrines of man,' and those who are faithful to the higher life, will yet rejoice with an exceeding great joy. Hamilton DeGraw. Second Family. Sept. 1893. We are having good weather to secure crops. Aug. 29th we had the worst storm of the seasonï¿½a half grown cyclone, it not only blew fruit off the trees, but took trees and all, in some cases. What few apples we had, were nearly all blown from the trees. We have had a slight frost in some low places, but not enough to do any damage. Are busy canning tomatoes and drying sweet corn. As crops are late, we shall drive the harvest to secure them before Jack Frost steps in for his share. With all this we do not lose sight of our spiritual duties. Our Society meetings 240 THE MANIFESTO. give strength to the faithful as well as encouragement to the weak. Although outnumbers are comparatively few, we strive to keep the gospel by testimony and daily practice. As 'the darkest hour is just before the dawn,' we have the faith that daylight will soon be here, and with it a renewal of conviction, and a pentecostal baptism. Isaac Anstatt.
