Break forth into singing ye heavens above, Ye mountains 4. The children of Israel their voices shall raise In songs of rejoicing and gladness is heard, The Bridegroom and Bride have to all who will call upon me, A lamp to the wanderer, rejoice in a sonnet of love The hills and the valleys thanksgiving and anthems of praise, To heaven's Protector now uttered their voice, And all their companions in union rejoice. a couch to the frail, A certain protection that never will fail, in rapture may tell, Jehovah hath comforted all that do well, and Zion's great friend, From whom unto mortals all blessings descend.
