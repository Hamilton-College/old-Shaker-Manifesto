EDUCATION. No. 5.-Its Tendencies. CALVIN G. REED. 'Lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time. ' ' Of all the causes which conspire to blend Man's erring judgment and misguide the mind, What the weak head with strongest bias rules, Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools.' It lias been truly said : ' Nothing is ever settled in thij world until it is well settled. ' We find among the accepted maxims of mankind, and these should be considered well settled: ' Tis education forms the common mind; Just as the twig is bent the tree's inclined. ' The human soul, like marble in the rough, may possess inherent beauties, virtues, embryo perfections, incipient worth, and regal powers, which without the aid of education, can never be made lo appear in their symmetrical grandeur and radiant dignity. The statue, monument, or figure is in the stone, the statuary only finds it. The sculptor's skillful hand works off the superfluous covering, polishes the surface of the sculpture, and brings to view the varied colors, with every ornamental vein and cloud of beauty that lay hid within it. So education unfolds and brings out in strength, vigor, and symmetry, all the faculties and powers of the immortal mind, imparting to them the refined refulgent radiance which is the peculiar characteristic of the truly great and good, who : 'As some tall cliff, that lifts its stately form [storm; Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the [spread, Tho' round its breast the rolling clouds are Eternal sunshine settles on its head. ' Perfection is the ultimatum of education and is the result of continued repe- tition, forming by practice iixed habits of action, establishing in the understanding and instating on the throne of reason the spirit of that, , ' Divine philosophy, by whose pure light We first distinguish, then pursue the right; frees, Whose power the breast from every error Weeds out all its vices by degrees. ' Incentive is the motive power of action. Until Incentive exerts her magnetic influence and awakens interest and arouses desire, action is inert. Without action there is no effect. Effect is the consequence of adequate cause. The cause of voluntary action, is thought. The obtaining of thoughts and the ability wisely to use them is education. The tendency of education is to modify or change existing conditions of human society. Every new idea that comes to light, claims a place in the domain of thought. As, new ideas are multiplied, correspondingly new phases take place in the life, character, and institutions of mankind. . This constant influx of intelligent life, produces new growth and expansion of the mind, impelling it to seek broader fields for the exercise of the unfolding powers springing from this new life infusion. We find, in the rapid transition of thought in these days, that no two generations are alike. They each have marked peculiarities of ideas and methods. This undoubtedly has been the order of progression from the beginning of creation but with a less marked change. The effects of education, is, to refine, elevate, enlighten, and fraternize mankind {rendering them more liberal, Iuk inane, affectionate, pacific, just, and consistent. Its tendencyis to break dbwn and renaoyQ tjje. narrow sectal barriers formed by creeds and dogmas which have made aliens and enemies of those who, otherwise would, like kindred drops have mingled into a fraternal communion. Education is ennobling, carrying the race God-ward, away from low vulgar, immoral, debasing conditions and practices, and elevating it above the animal plane of tyranny, usurpation, bigotry, superstition, persecution, human butchery, duelliug codes of honor, and all the degrading impulses of ignorance. Education is a wealth-increasing power. It develops and fosters new and lucrative industries ; it patronizes inventive skill and practical ability in science and art, and brings into use, in the various departments of human industry, the vast resources of material treasure deposited in the earth. Education is labor-saving enabling its possessors to perform more and superior labor in a given time than as though they were ignorant. It brings to our aid useful labor-saving machinery by the means of which the necessities and luxuries of life are rendered more abundant and cheaper. This readers our homes and our social' relations more pleasant. Education is a better and surer defense and protection to a nation than armies and navies. This was evinced in the late civil war. The North had the former aud the South the latter at the commencement of the conflict. .Education breaks the chainsof tyranny and oppression, leaving no: place for aught but peerless Freedom, who with exulting triumph shouts : \ , : . ' Go, tame the wild torrent, Or stem with a straw, &gt;� i! ! The proud surges that sweep O'er the sands that confined them'; But presume not again .; . : To give free^nen a law, , : &gt;. � Or.thhxk, with the chains' i i They have broken ;to bind them. ' tup: manifesto. These lines apply well to the Freedmen of the South. They have learned to prize their liberties and are making good progress in their intellectual development ; are becoming better citizens ; and that section of the Union has been increasing in wealth and prosperity since the period of the reconstruction of these states. The Freedmen ai'e becoming year by year more self-supporting, as the following statement in the 27. Y. School Journal shows. 'The Rev. Dr. Orr, State School Commissioner of Georgia, in a recent speech before the North Georgia Conference, stated that the colored people of Georgia pay into the treasury of the State all that is appropriated to their education except about $20,000. 'This is really wonderful for a people who have had only about fifteen years opportunity to do for themselves. It shows in the battle with ignorance and darkness, the colored people only need a chance. They put a value on education that outruns the whites. ' Education is the true magnetic pole of man's redemption ; for only through culture and refinement are we fitted to enter the dominion and share in the exalted joys of a pure and holy God. This is an age of progress, and all who would be numbered in the ranks of the onward march of advanced and advancing ideas in the world's Godward progression should put shoulder to the wheel and roll forward the car of man's civilization, salvation, and redemption. ' In the world's broad field of battle, In the bivouac of life, Be not like dumb driven cattle ! Be a hero in the strife ! Trust no future howe'er pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act,�act in the living present! Heart within, and God o'er head ! ' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
