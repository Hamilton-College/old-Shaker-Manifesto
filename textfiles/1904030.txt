Juvenile. Dear Children:--'Those who have clean hands shall be stronger'... Enfield, Conn., 1889. Dear Children :�'Those who have clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.' Clean hands come only by daily heavenward living. Clean hands and clean hearts are synonymous terms, and without the one the other is impossible. Clean hands�clean hearts ! Do you consider what the words imply? To have clean hands you must live above sinful desires, above selfish strivings and impure thoughts. You must 'keep your record clean,' for clean hands can only be an index of a clean life, a life devoted to holy purposes. Those who have clean hands and pure hearts of shall see God,' and feel his love and protection day by day. Pure hearts and clean hands are acceptable offerings. A sure way to love purity is to practice it. Think not to gain clean hands without selfdenying struggles; you must have 'deeds good and true,' not dream them; you must have the courage to resist temptation, as comparatively few do have. 'Pray God that your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless.'' It is well to pray, but better still to watch and work and to remember that 'God helps those who help themselves.' Good deeds are sincere prayers. Let your constant prayer be, 'Give me a blameless body,' and your daily endeavor be to use those means that will give answer to your petition. 'Beautiful hands are those that do, Work that is virtuous and true.' And clean hands, or they could never be beautiful, could never 'do work that is virtuous and true.' Clean hands forever! Corning to angelic manhood and womanhood un.-tained by any thought of evil. Oh, glorious hope of heaven, full and joyous evermore ! Thank God for it. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
