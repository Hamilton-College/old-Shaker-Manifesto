A LEGEND BEAUTIFUL. FROM THB ARABIC. [Contributed by G. T. Sproat.] 'Twas thus the Dervish spake : ' Upon our night There stands, unseen, an angel with a pen, Who notes down each good deed of ours, and then Seals it with kisses in the Master's sight. Upon our left a sister angel sweet Keeps daily record of each evil act; But, great in love, folds not the mournful sheet, Till deepest midnight; when, if conscience racked, We lift to Allah our repentant hands, She smiles, and blots the record where she stands; But, if we seek not pardon for our sin, She seals it with a tear, and hands it in.
