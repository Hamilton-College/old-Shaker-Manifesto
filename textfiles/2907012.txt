East Canterbury N. H. June, 1899. Hojie Notes seem so almost indirect in their communication between the inmates of our several gospel homes, that it is with pleasure we remark upon the almost tangible nearness of the mansions at West Pittstield, Mass, and Enfield, Conn. Safely ensconced in the former, our beloved Editor is at date, and it is satisfactory through this column, though narrow, to greet him in behalf of home friends, who throng to the pen-point with loving congratulations and best wishes for a healthful sojourn. We are also especially mindful of the genial, hospitable friends who were so successful in their persuasions, and to whom we are attached by the bond which is dependent upon no human expression, yet may be manifest in every human expression. Sometime they may try the effect of our climate, as they have not recently done so. Someone ventures to suggest that Canterbury air is especially good in case of asthma, and we think so, too. At any rate, most of us are entirely free from the complaint, and this is no meagre testimonial. Our kind welcome, long imprisoned in the heart waiting for action and circulation, is now upon the lip, but not till the 21st shall we have occasion to express it in the hearing of our beloved friends from Enfield, Conn, who have agreed to visit us in the name of the gospel interchange, so necessary to maintain the firm, equal pulsations toward the 'exceeding righteousness,', which true progress demands of our life forces. Weather, drouth, crops, June roses and whippoorwills are prominent on the home almanac, but the Home Note rule forbids more extended mention. We and the robins must furnish the last word, however'More wet.' Jessie Evans.
