Useful thumb We clip from the N. J. Messenger the following about the Useful Thumb : Do you know how tisef ul your thumb is to you? If you do not, suppose you bind it up a while, and see how helpless your four fingers will be alone. We say when we are particularly clumsy, that our ' fingers are all thumbs,' which is a slander on the hardest worked, most useful one of the five. The thumb is also a sign of intelligence; an idiot's thumb is said to be almost useless, and is always shut inside of the fingers, while the same member belonging to others is always shut outside. He who cheerfully takes advice may be greater than he who gives it. ' In this life,' says a spirit, ' I am not advanced as I might have been if I had cultivated the art of peace instead of the art of war.' New Jersey messengeR
