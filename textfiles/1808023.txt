THE LORD' PRAYER. Man all, his Father in heaven, sacred thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy laws the earth set on same ax heaven. Day by day food give us. Rub out our works bad same as we forget those who do unto us bad. Lead us not in roads bad; keep us in roads good, for Thine the Kingdom, Thine the power, Thine the glory, forever. Done.
