SONNET Is future life a shadowy dream A myth that puzzles still the brain ? Or closely folded as a ream Of unwrit leaves, without a stain? Closed volume, to material sense, That governs with imperial rod, And brings the meagre recompense A final home beneath the sod ? * * * The soui recoils; a secret spark Flames with the light of endless day; No longer veiled in dungeon dark, Or screened by perishable clay, It rises up on Hope's bright wing, Of immortality to sing.
