Dear Editress — Although I have not been a contributor to the bright little Herald of Truth (The ' Shaker and Shakeress '), I have felt a deep interest in its growth and prosperity, and have read its pages fraught with so much good, with real satisfaction. And my prayers have been fervent, my hopes firm, and my faith strong, that it may, and will be, a Light-spreading medium, and that it may be a means of raising the banner of truth higher, which must eventually prevail over error. I have felt for a long time past, that God is at work on the earth (though somewhat out of sight of the natural mind), to bring about an effectual change. And when I read the first published account of the ' Temperance movement,' I was impressed that its origin was spiritual, and I was glad to learn through the columns of our paper, that my feelings were in unison with those of my brethren and sisters, in this respect. I fully believe that earnest, soul prayer, will be more effective in pulling down the strongholds of sin, and conquering the dragon power of intoxicating drink, than any carnal weapon or destructive instrument that men can invent. Let our united prayer be, that the work may increase until the evils which flow from intemperance may flee the land. In faith, let us say unto this great sin which has become a mountain, ' Be thou cast into the sea,' or abolished. And to my sisters, who compose the Virgin Band, I would say : Let us toil on—pray on — hope on. We will not be faint-hearted; for God is with us. If we work for Him, He will hold us as in the hollow of his hand, and keep us from all harm. Louisa Young, Groveland, N. Y.
