LANGUAGE. M. J. Anderson. Oh power of speech! thou woudrcras gift to man, Thou potent messenger of good or ill; With joy or sorrow thou the heart dost fill, Bring'st peace or discord to the social clan. The mind may fields of knowledge amply scan, But were it not for th}' inventive skill That stirs with eloquence the listless will, How vain and futile were each mental plan. Ah, may this lesson, wisdom to us teach, Through his creation, man excels the brute ; This glorious gift, this lofty power of speech, Lifts him above God's creatures strangely mute; Destines to lofty hights he yet shall reach, Where language bears its richest, sweetest fruit.
