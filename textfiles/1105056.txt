To Get Rid of Cockroaches .—A correspondent writes as follows: ' I beg to forward you an easy, clean and certain method of eradicating these loathsome insects from dwelling-houses. A few years ago my house was infested with cockroaches, or ' clocks,' as they are called here, and I was recommended to try cucumber peeling as a remedy. I accordingly, immediately before bed time, strewed tlxe floor of those parts of the house most infested with the vermin with the green peel, cut not very thin, from the cucumber, and sat up half an hour later than usual to watch the effect. Before the expiration of that time the floor where the peel lay was completely covered with cock roaches, so much so that the vegetable could not be seen, so voraciously were they engaged in sucking the poisonous moisture from it. I adopted the same plan the following night, but my visitors were not near as numerous — I should think not more than a fourth of the previous night. On the third night I did not discover one ; but, anxious to ascertain whether the house was quite clear of them, I examined the peel after I had laid it down half an hour, and perceived that it was covered with myriads of minute cockroaches, about the size of a flea. I therefore allowed the peel to remain till morning, and from that moment 1 have not seen a cockroach in the*house. It is a very old building, and I can assure you that the above remedy only requires to be persevered in for three or four nights to completely eradicate the pest. Of course it should be fresh cucumber peel every night.'—People &amp; Patriot, Concord, N. H. [Perhaps Croton bugs had better be fed on cucumber rinds?—Ed.]
