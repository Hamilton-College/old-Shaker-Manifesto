Lafayette, Ind., Dec. 6,1874 Highly Esteemed Editors : In the multiplicity of life's duties, I have neglected one, that to me, is very important, — the renewal of my subscription for your valuable, ah ! priceless little monthly — twenty of which are taken in our great, fashionable and rapidly growing city. I am fully convinced that you have entered into the great and final work of redemption, designed by our Lord and Saviour for the elevation and salvation of man. Your communities are certainly paradisiacal abodes, for the care-worn and sin-sick soul. I believe in an overruling power — a rewarder of all souls, according to their works; and that you will ere long reap an abundant harvest from the precious seeds of truth you are sowing, through the ' Shaker and Shakeress.' The temperance ladies here read extracts, and sometimes whole documents from your paper. We believe, with yourselves, that gluttony is twin brother to strong drink ; and we highly approve your sentiments on the subject. May the Lord in wisdom direct both you and us in the great work of reform. Inclosed please find one dollar for two copies of S. and S., and much oblige a true friend and sister in the work of reform. I see a great spiritual revelation just at the door. Yours for Progression, Sarah A. Nagle
