Letter Box My dear Shaker friend Agnes; I believe... Maple-wood, June, 1883. My Dear Shaker Friend Agnes ;—I believe I owe you a letter. I have had to take my books home a great deal on account of examination. Our vacation begins soon. I am going to take two parts in two different dialogues the last day, and speak a piece alone if I get it learned by then. It has been a very pleasant day here. We are all well, Charley is as healthy as ever. Emma says she would like to see you ever so much. Father and Mother are very busy. I had the mumps they lasted me a day and a half, I am all well now and able to go to school. The Summer is very cool here. Is it very warm weather up there? I suppose your planting is all done. We have no garden this year. We send bur love to you all. Good bye. Your Friend, Gracie Wells.—Age, 11. Gracie Wells
