TO OUR CHILDREN We purpose in the future, a few simple talks with the children upon subjects that will interest and instruct them. While we have tried that the ' Grotto ' should not be neglected, we mean to do better still, and digest the wisdom of the wise, and bring it to the comprehension of our juveniles. Let our boy and girl readers trust us, and we will tell them some things in the future they will be glad to hear.
