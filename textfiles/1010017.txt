OUR NUMBER FOR OCTOBER Will be found brim full of beautiful contributions. Once more will be found the familiar pens of Elders Evans and Eads — two valued veterans of the cause The Manifesto would represent. The ' Correspondence,' although not directed to this office, is absorbed by us for the benefit of our readers, and will be relished, especially that from the noble Fishbough, the foster father of the inimitable A. J. Davis. The thoughts given us by the sages Fraser and Hampton are well worth reading and remembering, and the vision of Mother Eunice is very truthful and instructive. We challenge the genii of music to present a more beautiful 'gate' than the ' golden ' one we sing this month to our listeners. We ask kindly charity for our personal, editorial briefness this month. Our duties in this line are simply labors of love — our pastime, not employment — and our time has been limited this month by the pressure of other duties. And yet we long since determined there should be no issue of The Manifesto but would contain a digest at least, of our faith and principles, which even the casual reader might ' read as he runs ' just what many dear friends would know of Shaker life and principles.
