LOVE FOR ALL MARY WHITCHER We would the 'wise and prudent, ' even. Could know the path that leads to heaven ? That they might sacrifice their dross, And find the glory of the cross. Our God so good, so great, humane, Extends to all of every name The blessing his, and theirs to be By sacrifice and purity. Not pure by being held to right. But pure through love and sweet delight From heart made pure by death to sin Which souls may long have traveled in. But if the inside cup be clean, The outer will not bear the stain ; But pure at heart and clean of hands Doth meet the gospel's full demands. Canterbury, N. H.
