BERTIE'S VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC Bertie My Father came to America from England, about six years ago and got acquainted with Believers, and he returned to England to bring us, [a boy and two girls] to live with Believers ; so we would grow up and become good brothers and sisters. It was six years before he made his return to Believers. He said he would be much happier here, than he would in England. Now I will tell you about our voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. It was very stormy coming over here, for I was very sea sick, and at night I could hardly sleep a bit. All day we were coming in sight of land, there was a man on the look out to see how far distant we were from land; and when he could tell how far we were from land he would shout to the man at the helm, and he would steer the ship in the right district. Now I will tell you about the man who stands at the compass, who tells the man at the helm where to steer too. He has a whistle which he blows so many times to tell the man where to steer. When we got to land we rode to the station and met a brother who was looking for us. We had our dinner and got into the train to go to C— when we got to C— we rode with S—to the Village.
