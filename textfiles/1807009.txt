Only through consecration and sacrifice has any truth been attained... Only through consecration and sacrifice has any truth been attained and placed on the altar of service, a blessing to humanity; and only thus may we become the recipients and ministers of increasing degrees, which not only draw closer the reins of self-discipline, but give souls corresponding liberty. C. Allen.
