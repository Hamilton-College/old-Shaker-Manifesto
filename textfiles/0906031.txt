LOVE OF GOD NOTES. There is too commonly made a remark by some who would seem to be religious, that they ' love God.' It is Avell for us to remind every one, that the seal of Christian discipleship depends on the love which one disciple bears anotherâ€”'by this shall it be known, etc.' There is in scripture the following passage, which, from many appearances, will be new to a great many conceited individuals: 'If any say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar!' And this commandment have we from him: 'He who loveth God, loves his brother also.' Who hath ears to hear this, govern your actions- accordingly, and so love God.
