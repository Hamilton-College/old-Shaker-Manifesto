Enfield, Conn. Mar. 1883. Dear Children ;â€”No education is worth anything that does not include honesty. You had 'better not learn to read, better not know a letter in the alphabet, and be strictly honest, rather than being learned in all languages, and in all sciences, to be at the same time deceitful in heart and counterfeit in life.' Be honest. Be pure in thought, word and deed. Impure persons, poisoning their associates with sinful examples, are plague spots, moral ulcers. Shun the malaria of vice, as a pestilence. Oh ! the misery and woe of an impure life. Be masters of your passions, rulers of your appetites. 'Blessed are the pure in heart.' Purity is very essential in forming a true Christian character. Be virtuous, and heavenly joys will flow into your spirits. Grow wiser and better ; develop pure hearts, strong minds, healthy bodies. Forget not the duties pertaining to a holy life ; their faithful performance will insure you real happiness, while their failure will bring death to your souls. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
