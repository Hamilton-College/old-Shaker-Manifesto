KNOWLEDGE vs. RELIGION Religion is the salvation or the curse of mankind. What is religion, but the inpourng or ottipouring of the soul — action, moion ? All the actions of a man or woman is lis or her religion. Every action that brings lappiness —heaven — is true religion; while every act that results in unhappiness —hell — is false religion. There may be as many degrees of heaven and hell, as there are of aeat and cold. Knowledge is the saving or Christ principle, which deters human beings from doing what ignorance would leave them to do, wrong. The great cross of to-day, for mankind, is work; to work for their bread, and to work for knowledge that will bring lasting happiness. Men work for knowledge to get money, to obtain land, to secure the notice of other persons, and to be honored one of another; to become politicians, lawyers, doctors, preachers — any thing that is popular with mankind. But to seek and work for that combination of physical, moral, intellectual and spiritual truth, which would result in human happiness — heaven —is a cross that not many can bear. So few are willing to find heaven here upon earth, that they seek not for it; but look away into the future, to some great place above. Friends, heaven is no particular place, but a condition as attainable on earth as in any other place, or sphere, or world. Reason and experience teach me that the only way to heaven is right living; and that the knowledge and practice of right living is religion. Aaron Evans
