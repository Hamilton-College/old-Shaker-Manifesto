Farmers In comparison with the longcontinued prostration of other industries and the severe depression of general business, farmers may congratulate themselves that at least, through long hours of toil and the practice of close economy, they have been able to secure the necessaries of life for the support of their families and themselves. A bushel of corn is worth just as much to-day in the feeding of a family as ever it was, while it will buy as much sugar or as many yards of cotton cloth as in the average year, and it is only when sold for cash, or when applied to the payment of old debts, that the farmer really suffers from its low market value. Brighter days are coming, and the severe lessons of economy and struggle with debt will have a salutary effect in avoiding new liabilities in the future, and in making all classes more cautious and more thought- ful in their plans.â€”Com Adv.
