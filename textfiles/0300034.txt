PLEASURE Grace Bowers, (10) Now the last month of summer has come, and Nature still retains her beauty. The azure sky above, the beautiful verdant grass below, and the sunny air all around, still continues to make the earth a pleasant habitation,— a home of pleasure and happiness. But what of winter? Jack Frost's icy fingers touch every thing beautiful on earth, and cause its verdure to fade, and the pleasure that it brings also. Yet there remains a pleasure that is not blown to and fro by the winds, or caused by the earth's revolution ; but that which is felt in the human heart, and is caused by the knowledge of having done right. One way to make pleasure, is to watch every chance to do good for others, although it might seem disagreeable to me at first, and cause me to deny myself of many things which I might enjoy ;—but, by trying to please others, I gain their love, and this brings great pleasure to me. Another way is, when I am tempted in any way, to do that which I know is not right, to resist it, and this I will strive to do. I will also strive to be so good and respectful toward my brethren and sisters, that it will be a pleasure to them to have me in their company. After the above three children had well spoken their respective pieces, they, standing together, recited the following lines, by Lucy Bowers: Beloved Ministry, Elders, and friends very dear, We kindly would thank you for consenting to hear Our simple expressions, and heartfelt desire For knowledge, and growth in a life that is higher. So, humbly we ask you for blessing and love, A treasure we value as sent from above, The wealth it contains is more precious than gold, O bless us, and own us as lambs of the fold.
