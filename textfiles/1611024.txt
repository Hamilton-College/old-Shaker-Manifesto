A NEW SONG. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Let us sing, let us sing, Sing unto the Lord a New Song. Let 8va us raise a joyful sound a joyful sound to the Rock of our Salvation. Give unto the Lord the glory due his name, Bring an off'ring and come into his courts. Give unto the Lord the glory due his name and worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. Say unto the world the Lord reigneth Say unto the world the Lord reigneth, Let the heavens rejoiceï¿½Let the earth be glad, Let the fields be joyful and all that is there-in. Exalt the Lord and worship at his holy shrine. For the Lord our God is holy, And his people must be holy.
