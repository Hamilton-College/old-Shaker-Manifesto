THE CHILD'S VOICE. By Jr.hur E. Mnssey. The voice of a child In a wilderness wild Came floating on dew laden air, It rivaled all sound, And made my heart bound, Till all things lookt wondrously fair. The heavens seemed brighter, My steps grew much lighter, I breathed a soul prayer void of speech; 'Twas the voice of Great AUM Spake through that child form, A sweet lesson my sad soul to teach. It said; 'Be a child, Pure, humble and mild, Consider the lilies of earth, Bid all care depart, That Christ in thy heart May now seal thy Spiritual birth ' Narcoossee, Fla.
