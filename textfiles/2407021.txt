Pleasant Hill, Ky. June, 1894. We are enjoying good health, for which we return thanks, to the 'Giver of all good.' Truly we do live in a chnnce world, for in the month of May we had chilling winds and frosts to blight what little remained to us. A writer said 'this is a Rose winter.' The rose, in all her queenly beauty, looked out of place when the mercury was at 38 and 41 deg. A snow 33^ inches deep fell on the twentieth of May. The wheat which was so heavy and tall bent by the pressure and for days the grain crops were prostrate. The wheat is doing fairly well, but the rye is injured, and will have to be cut by hand. The beautiful days that we now have are suggestive of the wonderful power of the Creator, who has made this beautiful earth for man. Then why not live to praise him with our hearts' best gifts and with the brightjstars be found singing,'The Hand that made us is divine.' The June Man ifesto gave us much comfort and to all the writers we say 'come again.' James W. Shelton.
