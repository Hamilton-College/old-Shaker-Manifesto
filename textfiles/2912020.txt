Sabbathday Lake, Me. Nov. 1899. A few days ago we had a short visit from Elder Joseph Holden and Elder Ira Lawson who called here on their mission of love and good-will. We were glad to have them w ith us if only for a short time and were spiritually benefited by their presence. As these are to be the last Notes for Tmo Manifesto we think they had better not be too lengthy, therefore we shall have to write our final adieux as The Manifesto dies with this issue. How sad it is to part with a friend and such a helpful friend, too, as The Manifesto has been! Is there no doctor that can be called in to administer the right kind of medicine that would restore it? If not we must bid all our readers a kind farewell, for the little book on whose pages we have scanned the growth and prosperity of our various homes, will be no more, Add S. Cummings
