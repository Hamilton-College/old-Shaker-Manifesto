COMETH A BLESSING DOWN Not to the man of dollars, Not to the man of deeds, Not to the man of cunning, Not to the man of creeds, Not, to the man whose passion Is for the world's renown, Not in form of fashion Cometh a blessing down. Not unto land's expansion, Not to the miser's chest, Not to the princely mansion, Not to the blazoned crest, Not to the sordid Avorldling, Not to the knavish clown, Not to the haughty tyrant, Cometh a blessing down. Not to the folly blinded, Not to the steeped in shame, Not to the carnal minded, Not to unholy fame, Not to neglect of duty, Not to the monarch's crown, Not to the smile of beauty Cometh a blessing down. But to one whose spirit Yearns for the great and good ; Unto the one whose storehouse Yields the hungry food; Unto the one who labors Fearless of foe or frown ; Unto the kindly hearted Cometh a blessing down.
