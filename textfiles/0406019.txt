Lafayette, Ind., March 6, 1874 Much Esteemed Editkess : â€” Your beautiful and well-laden little sheet has (for some cause unknown) failed to reach me. I am truly sorry to miss a single number, as it contains so much truth and spiritual food. I believe true Shakers are nearer the Kingdom of God than any others. Most of their doctrines I fully indorse, and trust that their works agree therewith. My firm conviction is, that God is now raising up instruments in the great ' Woman's Reform,' or uprising of the people in the Temperance Cause. We, the Ladies of Lafayette, are holding daily prayer meetings, often twice a day, which are very largely attended. This great Temperance revival is spreading, not only through our State, but in Ohio, Illinois, and other Western States. May the God of Heaven grant wisdom and strength to those devoted workers for the elevation of man; and this accomplished, many will be prepared to join you in a higher, holier cause. Now, I do not wish to dictate to you ; but I would suggest that it would add a number of names to your list of subscribers would you treat more largely on the evils of intoxicating drinks. I solicit the attention of many persons to subscribe for your valuable paper; and the uniform response is, Does it treat on the temperance movement ? any thing to encourage that warfare let us have. We are an earnest band here; and our motto is, victory or death! In this noble cause we are banded together in one great Sisterhood, all denominations (Catholics excepted), without distinction of sect, mingling our hearts and voices together in prayer to Almighty God for the destruction of this great evil, Intemperance. Please give us your sisterly aid in your next. Go on, beloved Sister and friend; for a great work is before thee. May the angels of God hold up thy arms. Thine for the truth's sake, P. S. Pray for our cause. Sarah A. Nagle
