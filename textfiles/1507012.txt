Correspondence. Robert Aitken, Dear Friend; Your letter of March... Eustis, Orange Co., Florida. Apr. 9 1885. Robert Aitken, Dear Friend ; Your letter of March 17th. was duly received, and I have taken time to consider it, and weigh the arguments contained in it. I am glad to find the commendations you bestow on my statements and the spirit of my inquiries, and that it I can satisfy myself on a few more points I shall be a good Shaker. Perhaps none would be more difficult, you say, for me to see than the necessity tor a life of virgin purity. I must admit, that had it not been for celibacy the order of Shakers would have been overrun with all kinds of libertines, free lovers, and cranks. But this self-denying article of belief has turned aside the tide which would otherwise have overwhelmed them. This much I can plainly see. The Oneida Community lived many years despite their license and libertinism, but it finally succumbed to the inevitable march of events. Your observations on the Spiritual and the moral, and the distinction between the two, I kind of perceive darkly, as I understand it the Spiritual Divine is a state of mental clearness and serenity, the result of inspiration, which is not passive, but active and aggressive. On the other hand the Moral is good, but deficient in Spirit. . As to Spiritualism of the present day, 1 have no faith whatever in it. Judging it by its fruits I should say it was the offspring of lewdness and disease rather than purity and health. I remember the J. P. Greaves you refer to, of Ham Common. If I re- member right he published a paper called 'The Healthian' which I took and read with great profit. As you remark, how little is left of the great Socialistic movement of Robert Owen's time. Many you say joined the Shakers ; many left, but some remain. Still, the seed sown by that great and good mat), has produced fruit in the co-operative societies of the present day in England, which may yet resolve into producing societies, on somewhat the same principle, as Robert Owen advocated, but with perhaps more individual or personal liberty. I take it then that you place Spirituality above mere, morality. In this too I agree, if by spirituality you mean Inspiration. But still we must have morality and the deductions of intellect to guide Spirituality, or it may lead us into grave errors. You say that perhaps you ' do not express the ideas of Shakers generally on this point.' That 'we look at it differently, i. e., the practicability of a new condition of society on any other ground than a virgin life of purity. ' If then this be an open question it may be fairly asked ; What is purity ? Certainly at the present day there is no purity in this respect. But is total abstention from all sexual intercourse the only axiom of purity? Can we not rather kill lust and have love in all its purity ? If Inspiration be all-powerful, cannot that, in conjunction with thorough conviction, be sufficient to effect the object? I speak deferentially on these matters, as I know you must necessarily have had more experience than I on all these subjects. I have never been a Quaker, and am not thoroughly acquainted with their doctrines, but I understand that while they discourage all prudery and false shame, at the same time they suppress all levity in members of either sex, in either words or action. I notice that in the seven fundamental points which you enumerate they somewhat vary from the seven in the ''Brief Exposition*' published in 1879, though not materially. As you will perceive from the address of this letter, I am just now in Florida. I have now been here about sixteen months. If a second Eden is to be established, I think the Shakers, of all sects, are the most likely to carry out the mission, or at least to pioneer it. Where I am located is about midway between the Atlantic Ocean on the East and the Gulf of Mexico on the West. I do not think it the best for spiritual welfare, however it may be for material. In Summer the winds from the Atlantic on the one hand and the Gulf on the other meet about here, and we have too much calm weather. In the absence of a breeze the heat is very oppressive. On the East coast the Ocean breeze sets in every day and keeps down the temperature. There is a Mr. Quinby, a Quaker, who owns a large tract at Aurantia, on Indian River. Indeed, there are several towns, or settlements from Aurantia on the Indian River to Ormond (formerly called Little Britain) on the Halifax. To revert back to celibacy, I think men and women would enjoy each others company and conversation more in a state of celibacy than at present. But I do not see how the population is to be kept up. I have been rather long in replying to your letter, but I have had but little leisure of late. It has not been for want ef interest in the subject, and I have been very deliberate in expressing myself. Sincerely Yours, Joseph Doubavaud. Dear Friend; Yours is duly received... Shaker Station, Hartford Co., Conn. April 1885. Dear Friend ;ï¿½Yours is duly received and I feel much pleased with your candid reply. As regards the distinction between the Moral and the Spiritual ; to my view it is thus : Jesus Christ said, ye miiot be born again before you can enter into the Kingdom of God, that is out of the natural into the Spiritual. The Highest the natural man can attain to is the moral, but the spiritual man embraces or takes in both. You do not, in my view, put it in order when you say the spiritual is aggressive, passive ; as I view it, it is passive, active against all sin and wrong. The spiritual is what is needed to guide and rule the mental and the animal in man, to bring all things into order. The spiritual man is under increasing inspiration and is God-guided in all he says and does ; the natural man gets all he knows not by submission as the spiritual man, but by outward observation through the sense medium. You ask me, What is purity? I would reply, it is obedience to all moral and divine law. Man can be pure as a natural man, as he walks in obedience to moral law. The spiritual is a step higher, and embraces the moral, takes that in as a necessity ; for, though man can be moral but not spiritual, he cannot be spiritual without being moral. The difference between Virgin Purity and moral purity is, when man keeps moral law as a generative man, that does not make him a Virgin character: it is only he who follows Christ in the regeneration that can be termed a Virgin ; for regeneration involves a ceasing from generating. You ask, if all were to do this, wonld not the race run out? Most assuredly it would ; we do not profess to have any revelation as to what God intends with the continuance of the race of man, but we do say that He has revealed his mind and will to us that, as professed followers of Christ, in order to follow him, we must cease generating or we cannot be Christian or spiritual. We then leave it to God to dispose of, how the race will continue to exist. There is one thing sure if man goes on in violation of all moral law as he is doing, it is only a question of time as to the continuance of the race. Robert Owen and J. P. Greaves, were two great and eminent characters, and I am much indebted to both those men for what I am to-day. As you observe there remains some of the fruit of their labors in the co-operative movement, and there is a very extensive movement in dietetic reform, that is the fruit of the labors of J. P. Greaves and others in England to-day. You will I think perceive the difference, from what I have said, between the natural and spiritual, and between the order of Christ's Kingdom and the order of the world. The two cannot be blended ; flesh is flesh, and spirit is spirit, and the one is antagonistic to the other ; for the flesh lusteth against the the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the. other. You observe truly that were it not for a life of Virgin Purity we should have been overrun by all the various schemes afloat at this day. I was formerly acquainted with a number of Oneidan members. From the first of my acquaintance with them I saw they were doomed to fail, if they adhered to their disgusting idea of male continence. But such was their delusion that they had in that idea something of a far more self-denying life than we could lay claim to. My experience in two attempts at community life, before I joined the bhakers gave me ample evidence that the relation between the sexes must be pure, or there could be no success. I have good reason to believa that failure m this respect was the cause of the end of both the experiments I was in. You remark that Shakers are the most likely of any of the sects to introduce an Eden state or be pioneers of the same. I would here say, that we are full believers that by taking up our cross against all wrong in our knowledge we are enjoying that state, and that it secures to all, who truly live out the self-denying life of Jesus Christ, a condition of blissfulness and rest from the fruit of sin. It is admitted by all who profess the Christian name that sin is the root of all unhappiuess and misery ; even we socialists perceived that it was the violation of the laws of nature, that was the source of all unhappiness, and as sin is a violation of law it follows that all man needs is the power to live above all sin. This we can confidently affirm to our fellow man, that we find in the life we live, and we see no other way 'whereby man can live a happy and justified life. It is easily to be perceived that so far as man in the order of a worldly life, lives up to a moral standard of right so far he enjoys its fruit, yet it would be impossible to find perfect happiness under any condition in the order of a worldy life. I send yovx a pamphlet that may give you further insight into the grounds of our life. We have larger works that are more elaborate and explanatory of our life, faith and principles. Should you like to examine further I shall be happy to furnish you with the loan of them. You say truly that an association of virgin brethren and sisters can enjoy each others society far better than it exists at present in the order of the world ; and I would add that even were the world to enjoy all that a pure generative condition would give they would then come far short of that which is to be enjoyed in the order of the Kingdom of Christ. Inasmuch as the natural man understandeth not the things of the spirit of God, these being spiritually discerned, so all out of this order of life are incapable of knowing the higher relationship that exists between brethren and sisters in Christ. Hoping that these few remarks may aid you in your investigations after truth, I will pledge myself to do all that is in my power to aid you in your honest pursuit of truth. Were you acquainted with William Galpin, who was Secretary of the Ham Colonization Society? He lived at the Ham Society when I was there. He died among the White Quakers in Ireland. Spring is just opening upon us, it is a very late spring. With sincere regard I am yours in the truth. Robert Aitken. P. S. 'The Healthian' was pub- lished at Ham. When I was there, there was a printing press and we published a weekly called the New Age. Altogether there was a deep movement in that affair, and its effects are still leavening into English society. I hear through the Vegetarian Society that the Pater is deceased, but his widow still lives in England.
