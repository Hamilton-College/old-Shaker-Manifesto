REFLECTION. Agnes E. Newton. While passing years are bringing Our Spirit Home so near; That loving voices greet us Beyond earth's narrow sphere,ï¿½ This chain of soul communion Unbroken we' d secure; The needed strength for service And wisdom, harmless, pure. Unto our God we'll render The gifts that He has given; Presenting them with usury Before the throne of heaven. No joys of earth can ever The sacred hope transcend. Where Christ is in the heart enshrined The soul's unchanging friend. Like as a father pities, Forgives and loves his own; So to earth's erring children God's loving care is shown. Through all life's varied mazes When devious paths we tread; His strong arm ne'er forsakes us In safety we are led. Thus far the Lord hath guided Well may his children sing; And to his throne of mercy A grateful tribute bring. Still keep us Heavenly Father O draw us nearer Thee With thy seal of love, impress With true humility. Illume life's inner temple With rays of light divine; May fleeting years bear record That we are truly Thine; And when our earth-life closes We ask as robe and crown, The blessing of the faithful, The joy of duty done. Canterbury, N. H.
