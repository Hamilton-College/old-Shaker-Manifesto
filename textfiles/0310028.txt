WOMAN'S REIGN When error's cloud o'erhung the sky, And superstition fill'd the land, The life of Woman knew a blight, And cower'd neath sin's stern demand. She was down-trodden and oppress'd — A slave to Man's ignoble reign: Her will — her strength — to his must bend, Whate'er the loss, whate'er the pain. Yet through the struggling tide of years, The cause of reason claim'd the day, And bade her trusting spirit wait Till truth should sweep the wrong away. And, through the heat and wave of strife, She cherished still her lofty aim— To be a bright and guiding star, And thus the sinful heart reclaim. The powers above in earnest strove To form on earth a home of love, And woman was the temple sought For the white-breasted, spotless dove. The angels bore unto her soul The power to lift the fallen race ; They cloth'd her with the gift of God, And in the truth gave her a place. A Mother in her sphere she rules, Unbias'd by inferior power ; And nobles own her life — her love — And seek it as an angel dower. Her worth unto mankind is known; Her inspiration has been felt; She leads the wand'ring to the truth, With penitence the heart to melt. Unto her Order thousands bend, To feel her touch of holiness, And prove, with her, that Virtue's cause Is full of joy and blessedness. Her name shall spread throughout the earth, Till all shall know her influence true ; And, through a Mother's strength of love, Their life in God and Christ renew. Charlotte Byrdsall, Mt. Lebanon
