Farm and Garden Our Opinions of Vegetables &amp; Fruits We have heretofore been favorably impressed with the Trophy and Canada Victor tomatoes. Acknowledging these to be good' I still, we have proved this season that the ! Acme is superior to any other variety known 284 THE SHAKER 'The Types of Christ,' which appeared a our August No, has been put in pamphlet to us. If there is a better, we would be glad to know it. We have tested the New Melon, The Surprise—and were disappointed at finding it inferior to the Sills' Hybrid. This latter, while not so juicy as the Green-Fleshed * Nutmeg, is every way its superior; and as a universal Musk-melon, we should deem it unequaled.

The United States cannot raise all the wool it consumes, because it does not raise all kinds. This country can, however, produce all the wool it needs when it ignores ¦ Paris as the headquarters of fashion.
