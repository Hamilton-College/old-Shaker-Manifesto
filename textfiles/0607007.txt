THE LIGHTED TEMPLE MARY WHITCHER ' Cast the team, out of thine own eye.' Subdue thyself, then beauty will appear Where now thou seest it not; For when the mental sight's not clear, Motes will be seen, and many a seeming blot. Only by light within, and heart made free From sin and all the stains of sin, Art thou prepared to rightly see, And cast thy brother's beam from him. So near to God, then let my spirit move — So full of goodness let my motives be — That I may kindly see, and truly love My fellow men, as God hath love for me. Shaker Village, N. H.
