Some one has judiciously pointed out that a large quantity of the acid which exists in rhubarb, gooseberries, currants, and other fruits, may be judiciously corrected by use of a small quantity of carbonate of soda, without affecting their flavor. To an ordinary sized pie or pudding as much soda may be added as, piled up, will cover a shilling, or even twice such a quantity, if the fruit is very sour. If this little hint is attended to, many a stomach ache will be prevented and a vast quantity of sugar saved, because when the acid is neutralized by the soda it will not require so much sugar to render the tart sweet.
