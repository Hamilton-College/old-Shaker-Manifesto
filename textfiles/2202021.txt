Alfred, Me. Jan. 1892. Beloved Eldek Heney:I see by the Jan. Manifesto, which came to us to-day that 'La Grippe' has visited your home as well as ours. We sympathize with you and hope by the time this reaches you that all may be restored to health. Many in our Society have been afflicted and some are still suffering with it, but hope it will soon leave us. Wish it would go to the North Pole and there stay never more to return. On the 5th of Jan. we were blest with the privilege of meeting with two Sisters from Enfield, Conn. Eldross Sophia Copley and Sr. Emily Copley. They stopped with us over the Sabbath and we enjoyed their presence very much. Their chief object in coming was to see our dear Sr. Eldress Mary Vance once more. We all knew she could not stop with us but a short time. But to our loss and her gain, her time with us was shorter than we expected. 'La Grippe' must have attacked her. A week ago she was able to dress herself and go from bed-room to sittingroom. Thursday the 7th she began to fail and went down very rapidly. On the 13th at one o'clock she passed very quietly to her Spirit home. How we shall miss her! Yet we could not wish to call her back to earth to suffer! We know she has gone to a beatif ul Mansion which she faithfully earned by a life of true consecration. She has been a member of Society twenty-seven years. None knew her but to love her. She has been an example of godliness and every goodly virtue. In her we have lost one of the truest, noblest and most loyal members in our little Society. As yet we have had but few days of winter weather. No snow to speak of and the ice in the pond not thick enough for cutting. F. C.
