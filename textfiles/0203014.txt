Notes on Plato Plato was born B. C. 429 years; and died B. C. 348. His mother, Perictione, was a de- scendant of Solon ; and his father, Aristo, was of an eminent family. He studied eight years with Socrates, and was the youngest of the Senate at the time of Socrates' arraignment; but could do nothing to save his life. Upon the death of Socrates he fled, with others of his disciples, to Italy; where he gave himself to the discipline of Pythagoras, chiefly to the continence, chastity, and knowledge of nature possessed by that school. In his school he thought it all important to accustom j'outh to 'take delight in good things; otherwise plea- sures were the bait of evil.' ' Education should be conducted with a serene sweetness, never by force or violence.' His studies did not sour his temper, nor mar his interest in mankind. His ordinary conversation was extremely winning. He lived single, yet soberfy and chastily; temperately; abstaining almost entirely from animal food. He slept alone, and disapproved very much the opposite manner. Of his prudence, patience, moderation, magnanimity and other virtues, all bear good record. He was wont to say: ' See to it, youths, that you employ your idle hours usefully. Prefer labor before idleness, unless you esteem rust above brightness.' Being asked how long he meant to be a scholar, he replied: 'As long as I am not ashamed of growing better and wiser.' Being asked what difference there was between a learned man and one unlearned, he replied : ' The same as betwixt a physician and a patient.' Hearing that some one spoke ill of him, he answered : ' No matter, I shall live so that none shall believe him.' He owed no man anything. He died on his 81st birthday, of old age, which Seneca ascribes to his temperance and diligence. In his ideal republic he afforded the same chances to women as to men to become its rulers, thus representing the whole interest. E. H. Webster
