How to be Happy I am well aware is not a new subject; but, as it is one that interests us all, I give my experience, which is simply this: To live up to the highest light given, and obey the purest convictions of duty. I cannot conceive of true happiness short of this. But lest it should be thought too brief, I will add: As all for happiness aspire, I know no wiser way Than do by others as I would That they should do each day: The Saviour's rule, when well lived out, A blessing rich will prove ; Our words will be the words of peace, Our works the works of love. We do not live for self alone, But have a higher call: Not me and mine, but we and ours, A bond of good for all. By consecration unto God, A holy life to live, Our time and talents, great or small, Our all to freely give. I know of nothing that doth yield Such perfect joy and bliss, As when to others we can be A source of happiness: When we can soothe the troubled mind, Assuage another's grief, Unto the aged be a staff, To orphans give relief. A gentle word, a loving smile, Though all we have to give, Which costs us nothing, yet to such Diffuse a hope to live. Henceforth I will my time improve, And all my powers bestow, To shed new sun-beams all around, That brighten as they glow. Laura A. Prentiss, Watervliet, N. Y.
