DANIELITES. The latest sect in England is that of the Danielites. It had its rise in 1876, and its founder was T. W. Richardson, a student of medicine and a vegetarian. The organiza-tion has a form of initiation, degrees, badges, scarfs and all the paraphernalia of a secret society. The person who desires to become a member takes a solemn vow to abstain entirely from fish, flesh and fowl, from spirituous and malt liquors, from snuff and tobacco. When this promise has been taken and a solemn pledge of secrecy given, the candidate is ushered into the 'garden,' which is the Danielite name for lodge. The head of each garden is called the chief gar-dener. The sect has no theological system. A member may believe what he chooses, so long as he affirms the existence of a Supreme Being and maintains a vegetable diet. The initiation fee is two shillings. It is said that the order has many adherents and is spreading in England.
