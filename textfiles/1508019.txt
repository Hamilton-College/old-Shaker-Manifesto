PANSIES. I think pansies are a very pretty flower they have very pretty colors, some are yellow some are dark red some are spotted yellow and red and some are purple; they look very pretty in the gardens, they smell very sweet. This is all I know about pansies so I will tell all I know about violets. I think violets are very pretty flowers some are purple and some are yellow, they grow wild, they grow down the road as we come and go to school. Gertrude.
