OUR TITLE DEEDS. [Contributed by F. W'. Evans.] Judge Theophilus Harrington, of the State of Vermont, who has been houored with a memorial tablet in Westminster Abbey, refused once in a court of justice to admit the validity of a certain slave-holder's title to the ownership of a runaway slave because NO DEED OP SALE FROM GOD ALMIGHTY could be produced transferring this negro to the claimant or his predecessors in title. There was evidence enough that the claimant had once got this human chattel by methods sanctioned by usage and by statute law, but the just judge perceived that the title was essentially defective. Whatever the claimant, or his father, might have paid for the negro ; how many hands soever the title might have passed through, it remained a kidnapper's title, for a kidnapper's title was all it was to begin with. The negro, like every other human being, had an inalieuable title to himself; �a title written, not on parchment, nor with the finger of man, but in nature and reason by the finger of (he Eternal. A common-place judge would have been satisfied with the slave-holder's title, because it was admitted valid by usage and statute law, and would have been blind to the negro's title to himself, because this was ignored by usage and statute law. But it was the glory of Judge Theophilus Harrington that, iu advance of his contemporaries, he believed in an Eternal Law of Righteousness, and held it to-be supreme. Those who now, like this righteous judge of a past generation, look beneath aud beyond human traditions and customs to eternal principles, see A DEFECT IN EVERY LANDLORD'S TITLE. 'The earth is the Lord's aud the fulness thereof; the world and they that dwell thereiu: for Hh hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods.' (Ps. xxiv., 1, 2.) No landlord can produce a deed of sale or of gift from the Almighty. No shred of evidence has he to show that what he calls his estate, and on which he wrings a heavy tribute from the toiling poor who till it and improve it, was designed by the Creator lor him rather than for his more induetrious brethren ;�no evidence that the coal for every ton of which he exacts a royalty was placed iu the bowels of the earth for his and his family's special behoof. His title, how ancient soever, or what price soever he may have paid for it to his predecessor, can be traced back historically to an origin in force or fraud�to an impudent usurpation of others' equal rights. Over against the essentially defective titles of the present landlord class to the exclusive ownership of the laud, there stands eternally the perfect title OF EACH HUMAN BEING to an equal share with all his fellows iu the natural opportunities and forces on the earth on to which he has been boru �a title written indelibly in nature and in reason ; and this title; of each can be practically recognized�in the present advanced state of civilization, under a system of division of labor, wherein most people do not earn their living by agriculture but by other forms of industry�only by the land bein' treated as the common property of communities, and the rent of advantages of fertility, mineral riches, aud convenience of situation, where these ar.� conceded to individuals, being paid to tue community aud used for the benefit equally of all the members. Our judges aud our legislators, for the most part, reflect average ignorance and stupidity. They acknowledge the defective parchment titles of the landlord class and ignore the perfect natural title of each human being aud of communities. But public opini&amp;u is advancing, aud with it law and judgment will have to keep pace. The fact that the private ownership of the land of a country by a few of its people is according to parliament made laws, and has been so for centuries, is no more proof that the institution is a just oue, than the fact that slave-owning was once legal, proved that slave-owning was right. Slave-owning was abolished in Englishspeaking nations, though long defended even by pious and well-meaning people, because it was at length seen by most citizens to be an iniquity. Land'ordisin will likewist be abolished among us, despite the clamor of slow-moving Conservatives, and of equally slow-moving Whigs, when the vast awakening democracy of these islands begins to see that Landlordism too is an iniquity, mother of more iniquities, and of the poverty aud misery in which so many crowded and crushed toilers live aud rot and die.
