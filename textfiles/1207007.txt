GOD BLESS THE LITTLE CHILDREN BY LILLIE B. BARR. God bless the little children, Wherever they may be ! Far on the silent prairie, Down by the sounding sea— Like flowers in the crowded city, Like birds in the forest free, God bless the little children, Wherever they may be ! Whether they walk in splendid homes, With satin-sandalled feet, Or wearily run barefooted Adown the busy street; Whether they kneel at eventide Beside a mother's knee, Or lonely sleep in orphan homes, Still tenderly pray we, 'God bless the little children, Wherever they may be !' God bless the little children, No matter whose they are ! The peasant's child may come to be, In wit, in wealth, or war, Far, far beyond our dreaming; For poverty's no bar. God bless the little children, No matter whose they are ! 150 SHAKER MANIFESTO. God bless the little children, No matter where they be ! They sit like angels on our hearths, And angels soon may be. A week bonce, or a day hence, They may be gone away ; Oh, guide them with a solemn love While yet awhile they stay. God bless the little children. For yet we do not see What good men, what great men, These little ones shall be— What preachers, and what poets, What men of noble mind; What true and lovjng women. What wives and mothers kind ! God bless the little children, For in their bauds they hold The t'ui ure of this hopeful earth, The coming age of gold ; For they must carry on our work When we in quiet sleep, And where our hands so hardly sowed, Their happy hands shall reap. So tenderly and graciously Let little children grow ; They may be linked with hosts above, Or heroc s be below ; For as they sit around our hearths, Who can their future see? So may God bless them, every one, Wherever they may be! Exchange.
