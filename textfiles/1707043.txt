Deaths. Lavinia Salisbury Lavinia Salisbury, at Watervliet, N. Y. April 22, 1887. Age 88 yrs. and 6 mos. A Tribute of Love to Sister Lavinia. AURELIA WHITE. Gone ! but not dead is the tremulous voice, As we bend o'er the cold silent form; So grand in its loving, so noble and true, The spirit that this did adorn. [grasp Dear Mother, be with us, hold our hand with that You often expressed while yet here, To lead us along till we join you at last In heaven, with love and good cheer. From youth to old age her whole life was given, A willing and full sacrifice, To follow the Savior, and gain that bright haven, Prepared for the good and the wise : A Teacher and Leader, wise, generous and true, Her counsels were loved and believed; And many will bless her, ever will and now do For the guidance and strength they received. Watervliet, N. Y. Primary
