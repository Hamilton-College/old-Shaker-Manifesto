THE BRIDGE OF PRAYER. The bridge of prayer, from heavenly height suspended Unites the earth with spirit realms in space; The interests of those separate worlds are blended For those whose feet turn often toward that place. In troubled nights of sorrow and repining, When joy and hope seem sunk in dark despair, We still may see, above the shadows shining, The gleaming archway of the bridge of prayer. From that fair height our souls may lean and listen To sounds of music from the farther sh.ore, And through the vapors sometimes dear eyes glistei: Of loved ones who have hastened on before. And angels come'from their celestial city And meet us halfway on the bridge ï¿½f prayer; God sends them forth, full of divinest pity, To strengthen us for burdens we must bear. O you, whose feet walk in some shadowed by-way Far from the scenes of pleasure and delight, Still free for you hangs this celestial highway, Where heavenly glories dawn upon the sight. And common paths glow with a grace supernal, And happiness walks hand in hand with care, And faith becomes a knowledge fixed, eternal, For those who often seek the bridge of prayer. Ella Wheeler. T
