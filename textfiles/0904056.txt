EXEMPTION FROM EPIDEMICS In case of the London small-pox epidemic the remarkable fact has been noticed that only one case of this frightful disease has engaged the attention of the medical officer of the Jewish Board of Guardians. The same exemption from epidemic diseases has been noticed among the Jews in all countries, and is attributed to their mode of living. It is an interesting question, in a sanitary point of view, to what extent mortality from such diseases may be limited to pork eaters. Bilious disease is largely attributable, it is well known, to the use of pork. But the Jews not only reject pork from their dietary, but they also, under their religious laws, exercise extraordinary care to secure the meat of animals that are in a perfectly sound and healthy condition when killed. In our markets, for instance, they deal only with certain butchers, who provide them with meat from, animals selected and killed under the conditions of Jewish rules.
