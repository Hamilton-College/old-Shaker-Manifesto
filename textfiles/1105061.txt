FUTURITY LORENZO D. GROSVENOR The scenes of this earth are not man's destination ; Life is not a bubble of time's transient wave ; The spirit, designed for immortal duration, Fears not the dark shadow of death, nor the grave. Our ardent desires for the endless fruition Of hopes and of pleasures that earth cannot give, The soul's aspirations and keen mental vision Declare that our spirit shall not cease to live; â€” Else why do the clouds and the rainbows come o'er us With beauty and lustre which none can define, Then leave us to muse on the picture before us, And trace the fair semblance to regions divine ? Or why do the stars in the heavens suspended, That range through immensity, smile in our view; (Their movement, their origin, uncomprehended) And teach us that death will our spring-time renew. We are formed for a destiny bright and unshaded. Unlike to the transient enjoyments of time ; Where strays the bright rainbow, with lustre unfaded. Reflecting the rays of that beautiful clime | Where the stars are spread out like the isles of the ocean, Presenting unchangeable worlds to our sight; Where those who here vanish rejoin our devotion , Remaining forever our constant delight.
