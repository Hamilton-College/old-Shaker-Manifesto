SET THE HOUSE IN ORDER MARIA WHEELER With the opening of the present year I felt earnestly invited by a higher aspiration to 'set my house in order,' by burying ill-feelings, and cultivating more largely love and good-will. As I regard truthful, the beautiful sentiment of the Poet who wrote that 'Every inmost aspiration is God's Angel%undefiled;' so I accept this invitation as coming from the heaven of heavens. I believe it is a beautiful condition to have the 'house set in order' to live on earth, as beyond the earth, I am earnestly engaged in this work. What helps we all may have from the good words and works of those who have long secured to themselves a welcome in that 'home not made with hands, eternal in the heavens;' and also what mutual aid and encouragement among dear companions likewise engaged! When we are prepared to receive heaven's blessings how often will the golden gates be left ajar, and sweet and holy inspirations flow into our souls from sacred fountains of strength and consolation beyond our human comprehension. And I would not exchange the balmy fragrant breath of inspiration for all the cold philosophy the world has ever known. And I would share with kind readers, this little germ of truth, which has been wafted to me this calm Sabbath morning. One grain of ill-will entertained within our hearts toward any human being, if it be not larger than a mustard seed, will bar our entrance to the heavenly fields of peace and lasting happiness.
