A Mystery BY JOHN G. WHITTIER The river hemmed with leaning trees Wound through its meadows green; A low, blue line of mountains Showed the open pines between. One sharp, tall peak above them all Clear into sunlight sprang; I saw the river of my dreams, The mountains that I sang! No clew of memory led me on, But well the ways I knew; A feeling of familiar things With every footstep grew. Not otherwise above irs crag Could lean the blasted pine; Not otherwise the maple hold Aloft its red ensign. So up the long and shorn foothills The mountain road should creep; So green and low, the meadow fold Its red-haired kine asleep. The river wound as it should wind; Their place the mountains took. The white, torn fringes of their clouds Wore no unwonted look. Yet ne'er before that river's rim Was pressed by feet of mine; Never before mine eyes had crossed That broken mountain line. A presence, strange at once and known, Walked with me as my guide ; The skirts of some forgotten life Trailed noiseless at my side. Was it a dim-remembered dream? Or glimpse through aeons old? The secret which the mountains kept, The river never told. But from the vision ere it passed A tender hope I drew, And, pleasant as a dawn of spring, The thought within me grew, That love would temper every change, And soften all surprise, And, misty with the dreams of earth, The hills of Heaven arise.
