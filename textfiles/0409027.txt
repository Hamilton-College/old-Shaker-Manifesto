FOR LIFE WE RUN Behold the straight and narrow way To life eternal leads; To win we run, improve our day, Nor to temptations yield. All base desires we banish hence, True freedom to secure, The word of God is our defense, By which we life insure. The tempter, thus we overcome. The world within subdue, This victory first our Saviour won, His inward foes he slew; Yea his disciples do the same, Still learn his yoke to wear, Endure the cross, despise the shame, Hence his salvation share.
