Receptacle For Soiled Linen .â€”Take an ordinary flour barrel, line it with paper muslin, and on the outside cover it with cretonne laid in dox plaits. Around the top finish with a lambrequin made of turkey red, with cretonne flowers transferred on the center of each point. Cover the lid with cretonne inside and out, and put a full plaiting of the same around the edge. For the handle on top use an iron trunk-handle. By leaving the handle off the top, and having the lid made large enough to fit over instead of the ordinary way, the barrel can stand in a rooir, and be used for a table.
