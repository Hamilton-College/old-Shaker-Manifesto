What is Right If any thing could convince people of the absolute puerility of most of the discussions about religious forms and symbolism, it would be the fact that the Dunkards of Johnson County, Missouri, have split on the question as to whether in celebrating religious feetwasliing both feet should be washed or only one. Will the era of common sense never commence in religious matters ?â€” Christian Union. Our brave and illustrious contemporary, The Christian Union, hits hard, both right and left. The feet-washings, the communism, the nearly hundred, or more, of arranged performances, may be essentials of salvations, and we will not say they are not; but we will say as our contemporary almost observes, that in this age, it is below the dignity of matured religious enlightenment, to consider such inferiorities Christianity ; let us have Christ Himself represented, and all these inferiorities will be unostentatiously, imperceptibly, but inevitably involved and represented. Essentials are good ; but the essentials are in doing good things in the right spirit; and the right spirit is the good essential thing, regardless of what any may consider essential.
