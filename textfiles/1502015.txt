INFLUENCES. GEORGE BAXTER. To understand readily how to receive and give forth a good influence is our sacred duty, as there are many souls dependent upon those who have this bread of life. Proper conditions, physical and spiritual are the first to take into consideration. They are also the most impor^tant, as with only a healthy body and a sound mind can a pure spirit be developed. Without this all efforts will fail to comprehend clearly the beauty, the ever 40 changing and ever growing variety of nature and the progressive spirit of this age, or the receiving of communications be they by impression or by inspiration. We should cultivate the spiritual faculties which must rule over the earthly propensities that the violation of all laws may be mastered. These can only be ï¿½overcome by having a pure spirit which will be manifested by the cultivation of good influences, the results of which will be a pure external life. Then will be accomplished a grand work by those who receive and give pure influences. Many will be resurrected from the sea of sin, a life of carnal pleasure, and from false teachings. These will be brought under the rays of God's holy light where they can see and know that life is not aimless, over which roll ciouds of darkness, but that there are clouds lined with gold, agloAv with a sunshine of everlasting glory. Let those that arc sheltered beneath the canopy of trnth give to others of that stimulating influence, byword* perfumed with the sweetness of purity, and the results will be revealed to you by those over whom you have cast your influence. This will aid in elevating them spiritually and all will perceive the brilliant achievements, caused by your duty to God, which is well spent employment. We know that worth will win, and that all the pure influences we give are finely blended within the soul according to God's holy work. Let us cast these good and pure influences, Sisters and Brothers in Zion's home. Canterbury, N. H.
