IT DOESN'T PAY TO WORRY If you would keep a book, and everyday put down the things that worry you, and see what becomes of them, it would be a benefit to you. You allow a thing to annoy you just as you allow a fly to settle on you and plague you, and you lose your temper, and you justify yourself in being thrown off your balance by causes which you do not trace out. But if you would see what it was that threw you off your balance, and put it down in your little book, and follow it out and see what becomes of it, you would see what a fool you were in the matter. The art of forgetting is a blessed art, but the art of overlooking is quite as important. And if we should take time to write down the origin, progress and outcome of a few of our troubles, it would make us ashamed of the fuss we made over them, and we should be glad to drop such things and bury them at or.ce in eternal forgetfulness. Life is too short to be worn out in petty worries, frettings, hatreds and vexations. Let us think only on whatsoever things are pure, and lovely, and gentle, and of good report. Selected
