MATERIALIZATION Is there any Law, under which Spirits can so clothe themselves, with earth elements, as to be tangible to the senses of mortal men and women ? This is one of the great issues of the last half of the 19th Century — to be tried by the jury of intelligent minds. As a scientific fact, is it not wonderful that so much time and patience should be expended, in deciding whether a certain speaker to an audience of 25 or 30 persons be an inhabitant of this world — or only a visitant from the other ? Hear — 1st — the following testimony of R. D. Owen. 2d — the Late Expose. 3d — Dr. Orcutt's report, after a two weeks' investigation. And finally, take note of the oft-repeated Prophecy that ' Large assemblies will yet be addressed by materialized speakers, from the Spirit world.'
