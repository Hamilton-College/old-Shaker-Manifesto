A beautiful thought God knows what keys in the human soul to touch, in order to draw out its sweeter and more perfect harmonies. They may be the minor strains of sadness and sorrow ; they may be the loftier notes of joy and gladness. God knows where the melodies of our nature are, and what discipline wrill bring them forth. Some with plaintive tongues must walk in lowly vales of life's weary way ; others, in loftier hymns, sing of nothing but joy, as they tread the mountain tops of life; but they all unite without discord or jar, as the ascending anthem of loving and believing hearts finds its way into the chorus of the redeemed heaven.
