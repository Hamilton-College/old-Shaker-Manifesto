THE EASY ROAD. By the road of 'By-and-By' Stretching on forever, One who travels comes at last To the house of 'Never!' Very tall, and very high, Iron barred securely, Those who enter find themselves Guarded very surely! 'By-and-By' 's an easy road; Through soft fields and mosses, No high hills, no sandy soil, Anywhere it crosses If hard places come between, Round them it goes winding, Very slowly leading on, Smoothest travel finding! Looking on ahead, one sees But a soft mist showing, While on either side the scene Ever fair is growing. But there comes an end, some day, Where one sees forever, Dark and grim the iron gates Of the house of 'Never!' ï¿½Selected.
