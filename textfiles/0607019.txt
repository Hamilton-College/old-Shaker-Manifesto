Our delegate Our Delegate. We were pleased beyond measure to read in the Voice of Peace that Elder F. W. Evans, Mt. Lebanon, N.

We congratulate all who will be fortunate enough to hear what ' the Spirit' shall impress him to utter in behalf of Peace and against the barbarisms of any people barbaric enough to learn and practice war.
