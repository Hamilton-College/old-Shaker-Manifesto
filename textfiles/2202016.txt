Shaker Station, Conn. Jan. 1892. We are experiencing a very mild winter. Some parties lately come from New Brunswick report a similar condition there, so that a moderate winter seems to prevail quite extensively. We are improving the mild, open weather to clean up scattering wood in woodlots, and also in repairing buildings. The fear of a short supply of water has passed, and now our thoughts run on ice. Two years ago a similar condition prevailed and we were able to cut but very little ice. We made 2872 spaces of cream in Dec. from 20 cows. This leads to the inquiry whether it is not more profitable to make more cream in Dec. and Jan. when cream is worth 4 cts. a space than in May and June when it is worth about 2 cts. Several questions enter into the debate: We have to feed roots and rich nitrogenous food and must study out a properly balanced ration; but on the other hand we get a great increase in the dairy products, and also in the fertilizing constituents that tend to keep up the farm. Some feeds, like cotton seed meal, which are highly concentrated and must be fed with judgment, lose only a small percentage of their fertilizing constituents by feeding. It seems quite clear we must leave the old ruts both in farming and religion, and on this point a passage from Dr. Tarbox in Christian Science Magazine may be appropriate. 'Whether we wish it or not, we shall have to meet the inevitable fact, that the people of this and coming generations will not rest content with theological systems constructed centuries ago. The Bible is a book which will abide unchanged in all essential particulars. But theological systems are made by men; and if we are not in a better condition to judge of these systems than were our fathers two, three and four centuries ago, we certainly have not improved our privileges and opportunities. At any rate let us try, ever so hard to keep those old standards unchanged, we shall fail. Truth is always better than error. The things which are just and pure and righteous are to be carefully sought for and cherished. Who can tell how many generous and noble natures have been repelled from our religious systems and kept from our sans tuaries by those arbitrary and cruel features in our ancient creeds which were meant to honor God, but served only to dishonor Him?'
