Agricultural Old Cato the Roman Senator, was not only a Senator, a true republican, but also a farmer. He wrote a book upon farming. 'Our ancestors,' said Cato, ' regarded it as a grand point of husbandry not to have too much land in one farm, for they considered that more benefit came by holding little and tilling it well.' Virgil says, and this was after the empire had begun : ' The farmer may praise large estates, but let him cultivate a small one.' And Curtius, the Roman orator, went so far as to say : ' He was not to be counted a good citizen, but rather a dangerous man to the State, who could not content himself with seven acres of land.'
