Apple Custard Pie—The nicest Pie ever Eaten —This recipe is hardly in season, but our readers can keep it for reference when needed. Peel sour apples and stew until soft and not much water left in them; then rub them through a cullender; beat three eggs for each pie to be baked, and put in at the rate of one cup of butter and one of sugar for three pies; season with nutmeg. One egg for each pie will do very well, but the amount of sugar must be governed somewhat by the acidity of the apples. Bake as pumpkin pies, which they resemble in appearance. Dried 'apples are very nice by making them a little more juicy. You can frost them, and return them to the oven for a few moments, which will improve their appearance.
