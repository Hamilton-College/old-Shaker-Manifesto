HOME WORK The following hymn was written by Garret K. Lawrence— the Shaker poet, physician and faithful brother — in 1835. It has been in constant song ever since. We commend it to general use, even if some may think ' there's more truth than poetry ' in it; for be it remembered, this has ever been the very just charge against all Shaker religion and life. — Ed. This is the burden of my song — Neve?- to look abroad for wrong; I find enough to do at home, With all my best exertions; Then why seek evil in another, Or try to injure a dear brother? Such are not children of our Mother, But slaves to basest passions. How easy for the carnal mind, Evil in other souls to find; While to their own, how very blind — They're scarcely worth observing. But when old nature don't confound us, And we survey the saints around us, We fliid the good, the just surround us; Of heaven how deserving! O, may I evermore be wise, And make a right use of my eyes; Not be a fool, and miss the prize For lack of self-denial. This search of self, if you believe me, And my experience don't deceive me, Is solemn work; then do not leave me, But help me bear the trial. Henceforth, be this my daily toil: At home to cultivate the soil; A faulting serpent shall not coil Within my breast, I'll kill it! This work will make me kind and clever To all around me, yea, for ever; Then love, and joy, and peace, will never Forsake my soul, but fill it. Now, in this resurrection morn, We can't believe they're heaven-born Who shun the rose, but pluck the thorn, That they may torment others; For here, in Zion's fragrant bowers, Where heaven sends such lovely showers, We seek the buds, the opening flowers — Kind Sisters and kind Brothers.
