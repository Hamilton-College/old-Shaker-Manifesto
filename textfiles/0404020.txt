LAMENTATION A wild cry arises from memory's haunt, From depths of conditions of woe! Where children of darkness, of sorrow and want, No ease for their sufferings know. There is cursing, and wailing, and anguish of heart, A writhing in torment and pain ! O why this injustice ? what aid will impart The pow'r that will freedom obtain ? This cruel oppression that crushes the poor, And gives to the wealthy their weal, This un-christian spirit turns from the door, - The needy to starve, or to steal. 'Tis asked, ' is it true that the houseless descend To join with the ruinous train, Whose brief lives of vice in infamy end, And this for some slight paltry gain ? ' 'Tis true, ah, too true, we are forced to reply, Fair virtue to mammon doth bow, For gaunt destitution is still waiting nigh, To stamp with starvation the brow. We look for the soul â€” that is buried from sight, And dross is piled up in its place ; Like gold in the ore, 'tis obscured from the sight, But little of it we can trace. Yea, the ' seed bud of beauty ' is withered and crushed By storms of adversity's hour, And the small voice within is stifled and hushed By passions strong pleading for pow'r. But ye who can shake from the rough, iron hand, The chain of oppression so cold, Go, unbind the weak and the poor of the land ; Be fearless, undaunted, and bold. 'Tis God fires your purpose, ye noble and brave, And angels inspire you still on ! For truth, that's almighty and able to save, Is seen in the work you have done. No more be ye faint at the sight of distress, Dismay'd at recitals of woe, Which now from the lips of the suffering press, Whose hearts only bitterness know. For happier days we are gifted to see Dawn o'er this sin-blighted race ; When men in a brotherhood equal shall be, And poverty find not a place ; When the standard of purity higher is raised, And the blind are enabled to see That only through holiness God can be praised, And only the truth maketh free.
