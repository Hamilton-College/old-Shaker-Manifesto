What's a million... What's a million? Scarcely conceivable at times, and yet often accepted with composure. For instance, a million suns, a million worlds, a million Egyptian pyramids, even, are hardly conceivable; but a million dollars lost in Wall street is another affair. Tell a Jerseyman of a million mosquitoes, and he Avon't tell you he is 'somewhat of a liar himself;' on the contrary, he will put you down as altogether too good and moderate for that climate. There are 60 million people, and possibly 10 million families in our country. Of the thousands of different kinds of lamps sold in the last 150 years, not every family even has one, for many use gas, and some still use candles. A lamp is something that stays by; it does not decay, and there are hundreds in the country 50 years old or more. And yet in the short period of 5 years, every fifth family has bought a 'Rochester' lamp; for the manufacturers report that over two million have been sold within that time.
