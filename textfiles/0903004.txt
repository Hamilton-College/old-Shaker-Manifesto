NO TIME FOR HATING Begone with feud ! away with strife ; Our human hearts unmating ; Let us be friends again! This life Is all too short for hating ; So dull the day, so dim the way, So rough the road we're faring— Far better weal with faithful friend, Than stalk along uncaring. The barren fig, the withered vine, Are types of selfish living ; But souls that give, like thine and mine, Renew their life by living. While cypress waves o'er early graves, On all the ways we're going, Far better plant where seed is scant, Than tread on fruit that's growing. Away with scorn! Since die we must— And rest on one low pillow ; There are no rivals in the dust— No foes beneath the willow. So dry the bowers, so few the flowers, Our earthly way discloses, Far better stoop where daisies droop, Than tramp o'er broken roses ! Of what are all the joys we hold, Compared to joys above us, And what are rank, and power, and gold, Compared to hearts that love us 1 So fleet our years, so full of tears, So closely death is waiting, God give us peace for loving grace But leave no time for hating.
