A SIMPLE THOUGHT. MARY WHITCHER. And what am I, a household plant? Not resting on the solid earth, For spread and strength of roots, more scant Than that which nature gave by birth? And doth my sunlight come through glass, My moisture from some tiny hand; While all the showers from heaven pass Me over, given to earth's broad land? No gentle dew on me distils Eefreshing from the covert cloud, While I am taken from the ills My kindred share,ï¿½in love bestowed? Could I not trust my God to deal With me, who tempers every breath? Could I not stand in woe or weal And give my life, for fear of death? Ah ! weakly, sickly household vine, Restore me to my pristine home; And winds that blow or suns that shine Be mine to strengthen in their turn. Transplant me not from common soil Lest I should miss the general good; But trust my God and Maker still, To deal my daily life and food. Canterbury, N. H.
