FORKS. Some of our readers may be surprised to learn that the use of forks at the table was not introduced into England earlier than the reign of James I., and that this piece of refinement was derived from the Italians. The fact appears from the following curious extract from a book entitled, 'Coryat's Crudities, hastily gobbled up in five months-travels in France, Savoy, Italy, Rhoetia, Helvetia, (Switzerland,) some parts of High Germany, and the Netherlands. ' The book was first published in 1611. ' Here I will mention ,' says the traveler, ' a thing that might have been spoken of before in discourse of the first Italian towne. I observed a custom in all those Italian cities and townee through which I passed, that is not used in any other country that I saw in my tiavels ; neither do I think that any other nation of Christendom doth use but only Italy. The Italian and also most strangers that are commorant in Italy, do ahvaies at their meales use a little fork when they cut their meate. For while with their knife, which they hold in one hand they cut the meat out of the dish, they fasten their forke, which they hold in their other hand) upon the same dish. So that whatsoever he be that sitting in the company of any others at meale, should unadvisedly touch the dish of meate with his fingers from which all doe cut, he will give occasion of offense unto the company, as having transgressed the laws of good manners ; insomuch that for his error he shall be at least browbeaten, if not reprehended in words. This forme of feeding, I understand, is generally used in all places in Italy, their forkes being for the most part made of yron or steele, and some of silver ; but those are used on\j by gentlemen. The reason of this their curiosity is, because the Italian cannot by any means endure to have his dish touched with fingers, seeing all men's fingers are not alike cleane. Hereupon I myself thought good to initiate the Italian fashion by this forked cutting of meat�-, not only while I was in Italy, but also in Germany, and oftentimes in England since I came home ; being once quipped for that frequent using of my forke by a certain learned gentleman, a familiar friend ot mine, one master Laurence Whitaker, who in his merry humor doubted not at table to call me Purcifer,* only for using a fork at feeding, but for no other cause. ' The use of forks was much ridiculed in England, as an effeminate piece of finery; iu one of Beaumont and Fletcher's plays, 'your fork carving traveler' is spoken of with much contempt; and Ben Jonson has joined in the laugh against them in his 'Devil's an Ass. ' Meercraft says to Gilthead and Sledge, ' Have I deserved this from you two for all My pains at court to get you such a patent� Gilthead�For what ? Meercraft�Upon my project of the forkes. Sledge�Forks ? What be they ? Meercraft�The laudable use of forks, Brought into custom here as they are in Italy. To the sparing o' napkins. ' *Purcifer literally meant a slave, who for punishment of some fault, was made to carry a fork or gallows upon his neck through the city, with his hands tied to it, hence it came to signify generally a rogue; a villain.
