THE WAY, TRUTH, AND LIFE Would any know what these are to the people called Shakers? To come out from the world, by the practice of unworldly habits and relationships; beginning with the confession of our sins, accompanied by a repentance which ever means a departure from, and a cessation of sins ; to do unto others all the good we can in the relationships of brethren and sisters in Christ; to live purely, as we imagine the purity of Christ and angels to have been and now is, and to live eonsecratedly, through hand labor, heart labor, and in incessant works of mercy, charity and justice. These are ' the way' unto every one who feels called to be a Shaker! To unselfishly feel another's and others' woes; to administer testimony which speaks of Christ and Christ crucified unto a sinful world ; to deem it duty to keep our life-lamps trimmed and burning, and to let our lights so shine that others can see them, and safely find a guide by them unto all Christian life ; to v'go preach the kingdom of God, and the power of his Christ,' through the word ; through The Shaker ; through every spare penny and spare day oi devotion to its circulation ; and a determinate resolution that knows no such word as surrender, until others know and experience salvation. These are 'the TRUTH' to every one who is a Shaker ! To count life as already ' not of this world,' but as belonging in advance of death to the ' kingdom of heaven' on earth; fulfilling the prayer of u Thy will be done on earth as in heaven ;' to use life for others' good, and not selfishly ; to realize life as saved from sin and condemnation, and to be saviors unto others who want present salvation ; to love our neighbors as well, and better than ourselves; and with a love, chaste, resurrected, unworldly, uncarnal and Christly in its every lineament ; to so sorrow for the erring, that we will aid them at the expense of all selfishness ; and in every other character imitate the meek, lowly, virgin, peaceable, self-denying Jesus. These are 'the life' unto every genuine, thoroughliving Shaker !
