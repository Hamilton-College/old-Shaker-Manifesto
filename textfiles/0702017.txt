Punctuation Points Do you know the origin of the various punctuation points used by printers and writers? Greek literature was not punctuated until B. C. 365, and there was no space between the words. The Romans at a later day put a kind of division between their words, thus— Publius. Scipio. Africanus. For some time after the invention of the art of printing, arbitrary marks were used to divide sentences. Up to the end of the fifteenth century, only the period, colon, and comma had been introduced. The latter came into use latest, and was only a perpendicular line, proportionate to the length of the preceding letter. The colon is first found in the 'Acts of English Worthies,' published in 1550, and ^the semi-colon in ' Hackluyt's Voyages,' which appeared in 1599. The parenthesis was introduced during the sixteenth century. The marks of interrogation and exclamation were introduced many years after. To Aldus Manvitus, an eminent printer of the seventeenth century, we are indebted for the present form of the comma. He also laid down rules for its use. Inverted commas (') were first used by Mons. Allemont, a French printer, and were intended by him to supersede he use of italic letters, and it is said he French printers now call them by hat name. It is not known by whom he dash and apostrophe were invented. — Gospel Banner. A. A. p.
