Beloved Sister J:�I propose to write you a letter, beginning it on this calm Sabbath afternoon. The day is warm and light clouds are sailing over the blue sky, sometimes intercepting the sun's rays for a few moments and then continuing their course eastward across the pure, cerulian expanse. A slight breeze stirs the green leaves of the trees, and the singing of the birds breaks the stillness and dreamy monotony of the scene My dear friend, the immortality of the soul and a wise efficient preparation for another and better life, are the most momentous questions which can possibly engage the human mind. All otner interests sink into insignificance when compared with the salvation of the soul and a final home among the saints of the Most High, in that heaven 'where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. ' It is now four o'clock and thirty three minutes, P.M. [ intended to write this letter very leisurely, but as we have to be somewhat steadily on the wing, I shall have to finish it immediately, or wait till I return from North Union. J.�if I were going to express in three words the entire substance of Christ's evangel and the testimony which Mother Ann preached, those three words would be, Love, Purity, Obedience. If you can thoroughly and practically become imbued with these three virtues, not only will your salvation and acceptance with God be insured, but all other virtues, such as patience, forgiveness, and concession be gradually added to your already priceless treasures, and you will never regret the days of your life on the earth. I know you cannot appreciate to their full extent the privilege of instruction in holiness and peace and the faculties for the practice of the same which you enjoy in your sequestered home. ' What millions are lost in the dark, And carelessly run the broad road; While you are secure in the ark, Whose great master builder is Uod. ' Never be surprised at any amount of suffering you may be called to endure and above all try to arm yourself with patience and to believe that you are just as worthy of victory and blessing as any one. Never become disheartened. Now while I will not so cruelly deceive you as to try to make you think the path of virtue is one of unalloyed pleasure, flowers without thistles, roses without thorns, yet here I will give you two rules which the young do not generally know, because it has to be many long years in coming into their experience. ' The path of sorrow and that path alone, Leads to that land where sorrows are unknown.' This is the first rule and is worth its weight in gold. The second is, Though we must meet many temptations and trials and even sorrows, yet in our travel to the celestial mansions we shall find that the scenes oi suffering will come to be farther and farther apart and continue for shorter and shorter periods, while the scenes of peace and tranquil enjoyment will occur nearer and nearer together, until a serene and continuous heaven eventually results as the fruits of all our toil and self-sacrifice. You will see that I have written this letter as a kind of guide along the road of what I presume will be your future experience. We are in a state of ordinary prosperity. Your Brother, O. C Hampton.
