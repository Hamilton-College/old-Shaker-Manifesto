'ABOMINABLE HEADGEARS.' The abominable style of dresses and headgears now worn by women are too immodest to mention, yet professing Christians run after them with the zeal of a turkey after a grasshopper. If an angel from heaven, dressed in plain white, without ruffles, flounces, trails, and ornamented head-cover, was suddenly to drop among some Christian congregations nine-tenths would vote for its speedy ejectment, because it is not in the fashion. Very well, anangel will thrust in the sickle of death some of these times, and then these devoted clothes-worshippers will send up a wail of despair too fearful for mortal ears. We class this clothes religion with drunkenness and all other pernicious vices. It is tolerated simply because popular. It is sin, and we have no patience with sin.â€”Brethren at Work.
