SYSTEMATIC ARRANGEMENT Oliver C. Hampton 'Behold all ye that kindle afire, that compass yourselves about with sparks. walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have kindled, this shall ye have of my hand; Ye shall all lie down in sorrow.' Isa. /., 11. 'And without all contradiction, the less is blessed of the better.' Heb. vii, 7. Many have tried the among Believers, of 'kindling a fire and compassing themselves about with sparks.' Not being satisfied with the bright purifying flame of the Altar they start a separate illumination composed of a strange fire. A systematic arrangement of spiritual fire and illumination is ;is necessary in the Church as in any department of its general system. Wisdom is extremely profitable to direct in this matter. Some honest individual thinks he has a special revelation, a new and important illumination. He is soon compassed about with the sparks that he has kindled. And then what? His fire and light are so dazzling he loses sight entirely of the great and vivifying Altar fire of the Church. He thinks his few sparks have quite ex8 experiment THE MANIFESTO. 9 tinguished that, and should be substituted in its place. When this point is reached he is about ready to ulie down in sorrow.' And he is dead sure to do this unless reclaimed from his state of separateness from the altar fire and light of the Church. I have been privileged to enjoy a membership in the Church for a great many years (sixty-nine) and have witnessed the 'lying down in sorrow' of many from this cause. Our Church which we call, and which is, a second appearing of Christ's Pentecostal arrangement on the earth, has never ceased to be illuminated and warmed by the sacred altar fires of cleansing and perfect purification of all its inmates who calmly submitted to their renovating and cleansing influence. Those who are, or have been, called to conduct these sacred illuminations have never suffered them to go out day or night, for over one hundred years. Those to whose care these sacred fires have been entrusted, have uniformly been chosen in accordance with a great and sublime law, which has flashed through the universe ever since its evolution from the mind of God. 'Without all contradiction the less (experienced) are blessed of the better (or more experienced.)' This sublime law of the universe involves a systematic arrangement and organization of the Church of Almighty mag- nitude and importance, inasmuch as it has so far saved from guilt and sorrow every sincere spirit wrho has submitted him or herself to its elevating and salutary discipline. To this statement there is absolutely no exception. If any one doubts thereof he can know of its sublime certitude and efficacy by doing the works therein involved. The whole process of divine service consists in being saviors to one another in the different duties, orders, situations, places from highest to lowest, (if there be any highest or lowest, though there be less and greater according to experiences.) We who know by long experience and trial the blessedness of the gospel of Jesus and Mother Ann, feel almost like going forth and compelling others to come in and share with us the manifold blessings of such a life. You will not need to kindle little rush-light fires and compass yourselves about with sparks only to lie down in sorrow at last. It is so good to enjoy the Eternal Now and not have to live on sickly hopes of the future. To know that present at-one-ment writh God insures an eternity of present bliss and invulnerable peace and contentment forevermore. O ye who have not so far found the peace Christ promised, give us a call and see if we cannot put you in possession of the same. You need not stay if you do not like it, but we cannot help believing many of you would like it who are disgusted with the sins and shams and sorrows of the rudimental plane. Union Village, Ohio.
