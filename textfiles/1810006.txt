[The following interesting, social and theological letter, is from the pen of our beloved brother, Elder William Leonard, of blessed memory, and will no doubt give pleasure to many of our readers. Ed.] HAND LABOR INTRODUCED INTO THE MOST WEALTHY GENTILE CHURCH. When Paul came to Corinth he was impressed by the Holy Spirit to tarry there, sow the seed of faith and reap a harvest of souls in rudimental Church Order. It was not his first business to seek out some palace of ease in some Metropolitan Hotel, but true to his Christian faith and instruction, he sought out some humble workshop where he could make arrangement to labor with his hands. 'When Paul came to Corinth, he found a certain Jew named Aquila with his wife Priscilla and he came to them ; and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and worked, for by their occupation they were tent makers.' Paul had now entered his field of labor right, 'hands to work and heart to God.' He stood up like a man on praying ground for others. He toiled through the labors of the week, 'and he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath day;' and being in the way the Lord met him. He was miraculously delivered from persecution. 'Crlspus the chief Ruler of the synagogue with all his house, aud many of the Corinthians hearing believed aud were baptized.' Paul was now proving the blessing of his own obedience. The promises which the Holy Spirit had made to him were rapidly fulfilling. He had been uncertain about gathering souls in this rich, wicked city, but all was suddenly made plain to his understanding. For, 'then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee. for I have much people in this city.' His field of labor now widened to that degree that 'He continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them.' Acts xviii., 11. By following strictly the example and testimony of Jesus and working hand labor faithfully into his theological instructions, Paul placed his Christian character in such a light that all were bound to respect it. He stood independent in uprightness before the Church and was clothed with great power among his followers. Paul saw that the Corinthians were worldly and wealthy, and were sunk deeply in the prevailing sins of the Gentiles. This city is said to have been the richest and most corrupt of any at that age where the gospel was preached, in that quarter of the world. Therefore he never compromised his religious principles with their riches. He walked among them with more than usual circumspection, self-denial and charity. As the Apostle feared God so he seems to have feared to become entangled with Corinthian gold and silver, for when his spiritual labors became so great that his own hands failed to supply his wants he arranged matters in the following order. He would receive no kind of aid from that church, but nought h 'lp from another quarter, as appears from the following : On a certain occasion he said to them, 'When I was present with you and wanted I was chargeable to no man : for that which was lacking to me, the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied.' 2 Cor. xx., 9. When the rich man came to Jesus inquiring, 'What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?' Mark, x., 17. He pointed him to his own law and found he had observed it strictly. Jesus saw his condition and loved him. He then said, 'ï¿½Go thy way, sell what thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up thy cross and follow me ; and he went away grieved for he had great possessions.' Jesus here invited him to come down from a life of wealth and ease to a life of dependence and labor. He seized this occasion when the rich man went away sorrowing, to teach the twelve what they and we have long since proved. Jesus said, 'how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.' And the disciples were astonished asking who then can be saved? 'But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children how hard it is for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God.' 23, 24. As they advanced with their ministry they were taught by Ananias, his wife and others, thoroughly, the meaning of his word. They saw that none could be fully consecrated who held on to riches ; or come into gospel equality and be saved from ease and indulgence who trust in gold and silver. Paul clearly saw all this and washed his hands clean from the riches of the Corinthians. ACTIVITY IN BUSINESS RECOMMENDED AS A FOUNDATION FOR GOSPEL CHARITY. Paul's theologj- on labor was universal. He wrote to the Roman brotherhood recommending them to untiring zeal in business, clothed with the authority of the word of God. As a father he thus warned them, 'Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another ; not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. Distributing to the necessity of saints, given to hospitality.' Rom. xii., 10, 11, 18. Paul here places activity in business before fervency of spirit in the service of God, the same as Mother Ann placed hands to work before hearts to God. He well understood then, what we as well understand now, that a slack, indolent being in temporal labors, is the last man that can be roused up to fervency of spirit in serving God. Paul carries the idea clear that he who will not labor for his own bread, when able, will never labor for the true bread that cometh down from heaven ; simply because Christ taught his first little flock that hand labor to supply our earthly wants is a foundation gift in serving God. But the beauty of this passage lies in showing the need of honest, faithful Christian diligence in raising the means to supply the necessities of the saints and to extend hospitality to strangers. Can the tyrant who grasps the toil of the bond-man do this ? Can the stock gambler or crafty speculator perform this Christ-like liberality? He who steals, and with prodigality gives the labors of another, or scatters with a liberal hand what is wrung from the down-trodden, the widow and the fatherless, performs no charity iu the sight of heaven. But whoever bestowed liberal donations from the fruits of his own honest labor that did not find it was more blessed to give than it ever was to receive? The fruits of such liberality is beautifully expressed by Job, '-When I went out to the gate through the city, the young men saw me and hid themselves ; and the aged arose and stood up. The princes refrained talking, the nobles held their peace. When the ear heard me it blessed me, and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me. Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless and him that had none to help him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and 1 caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.' Job xxix., 7, 13. Let calamity or great losses overtake such friends of humanity and they will feel like the kind-hearted old philosopher who when reduced to poverty wept and said, 'I thank God I have saved all I have given to the needy.' A child can see that honest industry underlies all Christian generosity and liberality. It is the solid basis on which it rests. It stands l:ke a great balance wheel to carry steadily and powerfully all Christian charities that extend out from spirits rendered kind-hearted and liberal by the spirit of God. THE GENTILE CHURCHES COMMANDED TO SECURE MEANS BY LABOR TO STAND INDEPENDENT OF THOSE WITHOUT AND TO SECURE ALL EARTHLY COMFORTS. VTheu Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, his testimony, respecting the daily toils and business of life was as simple as the teaching of Mother Ann. He says, 'We beseech you Brethren that ye increase more and more. And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own busiuess, and to work with your own hands as we commanded you. That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye nay have lack of nothing.' 1 Thess. iv.. 11. 12. Paul exhorts his followers '.o labor diligently in some honest employment and gather means to enable them to stand free and out of debt with the world. That they must do a cash business. The simple truth here preached by Paul is part of the very testimony brought out by Mother Ann. She said, 'Do not over-reach in trade, right all wrongs, pay all just debts.' Paul said work with your own hands that by a life of honest industry you may abound iu plenty and lack nothing. While Mother Ann said, 'By industry and frugality you will be blessed in your basket and in your store.' Jesus said to the Jews, ''The word that I have spoken the same shall judge him ia the last day.' The Elders brought out the same truths uttered by Jesus and the Christian teachers under him eighteen centuries ago. They are all embodied in this testimony for the judgment of the world. Now we make excellent theology out of the virgin life, the confession of sin and united inheritance, as taught by them, then why not make as good theology out of hand labor on which all these principles rest, and which cannot exist without it. All who follow out strictly the rule of life here practiced and laid down by Jesus and his first followers find themselves under the blessing of their own obedience. All who deviate soon find themselves under the curse of their own disobedience. They find that God has ordained that an earthly inheritance or the honest labors of the saints once consecrated to God must never again coin under the power of the world or the worldly minded, to bring the true heirs of the kingdom into worldly bondage. paul's closing scene with some of the gentile churches. The time finally arrived when Paul was to take his last farewell on earth of the Elders and people of certain of the Gentile Churches. He was followed by many leading Elders and others to a certain landing-place, where he was to take passage and bid them a last adieu. In this interesting, closing scene, 'He sent to Ephesus and called the Elders of the Church.' Acts xx., 17. These men stood as pillars to the Churches they represented. They had seen Paul from the beginning of his labors in those quarters. They honored him as their father in God. They were witnesses of his untiring zeal, his patience in persecution, endurance in trials among the false-hearted, and his long-suffering among the weaker members of his flock. He met them at a celebrated ancient city called Miletus. It had been the birthplace of several ancient eminent men. It lay about twelve or fifteen leagues from Ephesus. Here in solemn counsel and many warnings he stated the great probability that after his return to Jerusalem 'They would see his face no more.' Acts xx., 25. This upright leader was in the very state to present to his gospel heirs the spiritual light and his fields of labor. For, he said, 'I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel. Ye yourselves know tb 1 these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me. I have showed you all things how that sojaboring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive.' 33 to 35. Paul was in an enviable condition to balance accounts with these Gentile brethren. It could be said of him that he committed to them the gospel without money 0' price. When they saw him dividing equally his slender earnings with those who sojourned with him, like Jesus with the twelve, he taught by example as well as precept that the family of Christ was and is one, and that the strong should bear the infirmities of the weak. Paul's honorable poverty, and his hand labor beautifully blended with his gospel life and ministry, clothed him in raiment 'clean and white.' His character will shine through all ages as a star rising upward toward the new heavens of exceeding brightness. If any man in early ages could stand erect and present a Christ-like specimen of self-denial and consecration and feel the dignity, it was Paul at Miletus in this closing scene with his Gentile brethren. How sacred must have been the spot where this good old, well-tried Apostle kneeled for the last time with his brethren ? How tender and solemn must have been their parting with this man of God when 'They all wept sore and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him. Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more.' Acts xx., 37, 38. Remembering his labors to plant the seed of faith, his labors to sow peace in their churches, and his toils for Ms daily bread, this scene would bring back to their recollection what he said : '-Though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ yet have ye not many Fathers.' 1 Cor. iv., 15. Scenes like this we have all witnessed when a true-hearted leader or member has been called suddenly away. Their diligent toil associated with Christ-like virtues have so long proved the sincerity of the absent one that like Paul's Gentile brethren we have sorrowed most of all that we should see their faces uo more and should miss their bright examples. The honorable course of Paul in matters spiritual and temporal did much for (he up-building of Christ's kingdom in his period. The primitive church laid a foundation in their age for us ; and the witnesses brought down that spirit through racks and fiery torture to us. But to us is entrusted the golden opportunity to do far more. A Believer consecrates a whole life of the most disinterested labor spiritually and temporally for himself his Brethren and Sisters and for the gospel cause. However few may be our numbers at times ; however dark the period through which we pass : however the new heaven and earth may seem to be remodeled, our labors will count and our works will be known. What the primitive Church did scatter in individual capacity stands to their account. What we do in collective order as one joint body of Christ however severe the trial will stand through eternity.
