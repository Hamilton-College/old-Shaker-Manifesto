THE BIBLE AND ARCHEOLOGY. By 'Observer.' Archaeology is throwing a great deal of light on the Scriptures. To Sayce, Rawlinson and other eminent Orientalists the Christian church is indebted. Passages of Scripture which were severely criticised by infidels have been vindicated by the researches of the arch geologist. The existence of Edom was repeatedly denied until a few years ago, when Prof. Sayce discovered the n:imo of Edom on one of the cuneiform tablets, and the question was settled. The Old Testament speaks of the existence of the Hittites as a great nation of antiquity. One of the principal arguments of infidels has been, that had a nation really existed so powerful as the Hittites are declared to have been, profane history would surely have referred to its existence; and as there is not the least mention of such a people by secular historians, the Bible record is purely a fabrication. Archaeology has, however, settled the matter. The Hittites are described on the monuments, and skepti- cism is forced to acknowledge the Biblical references. Christians, who have put the promises of God to the test, have no need to seek confirmation of their faith in the historical evidences, as they have the 'Witness within.' But as infidelity is widely propagated, it is the duty of every believer to familiarize himself with the subject of Christian evidences, and theieby be prepared to confute unbelief. Of prophecy and the proof of its fulfillment afforded by archaeology, no evidence could be stronger. The present state of many Oriental lands as brought to light by the antiquarian, marvelously proves the truth of prophecy and the inspiration of the Scriptures. H. L. Hastings, the anti-infidel writer and publisher of Boston, tells us in his essay on 'The Inspiration of the Bible,' of a skeptic to whom he gave a copy of a work on prophecy and which resulted in his conversion. Mr. Hastings well knows how to deal with infidelity and after years of acquaintance with infidel methods he declares that altlio error is widely circulated by unbelievers, and therefore does harm to the ignorant, yet infidelity makes as much impression on the truth as peas would fired against Gibralter. Let us all familiarize ourselves with the argument for Christianity and show skepticism that unbelief is founded either on ignorance of, or enmity to the truth. The following, from one of H. L. Hastings' tracts, may well be given in conclusion ;� 'Lord Shaftesbury tells of two sailors, cast away on a cannibal island, who were in great fear; but while creeping cautiously around the island they came upon a cabin. There was no one there, but on venturing inside they found a Bible. That book banisht all their fears.' 'Every one knows that where this book has influence it makes things safe. Why is this? If it were a bad book, we should expect to find it in the hands of the worst men. In New York there is a kind of rogues' museum,�a place where they have all kinds of skeleton-keys, jimmies, brass knuckles, dirks, pistols and implements of mischief, which they have taken away from roughs and criminals. Do you suppose there is a single New Testament in the whole lot? Why hot? If it were a bad book you would expect a rogue to have a revolver in one pocket, and a New Testament tucked away in another. There was a quarrel the other night, and a man used a�Bible? No! it was a bottle! Where the Bible bears sway, quarrels do not come.
