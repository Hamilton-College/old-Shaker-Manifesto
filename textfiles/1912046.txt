To the Cape Codder, like the Icelander and the Swiss, his native province is the best that the sun shines on. So unique, emphatic, and personal the Cape and its towns have become to those reared here, that a Cape man ftnds nowhere else so glorious a home, so full of such sweet memories. The Cape colors him all his life�the roots and fibre of him. He may get beyond, but he never gets over the Cape. Make him a merchant at Manilla or Calcutta, a whaler at the North Pole, a mate in Australian waters, a tmllionnaire on Fifth Avenue, a farmer in Minnesota, and the Cape sticks to him still. He will feel in odd hours, to his life's end, the Creek tide on which he floated inshore as a boy, the hunger of the salt marsh in haying time, the cold splash of the sea-spray at the harbor's mouth, the spring of the boat over the bar when he came home from fishing, with the wind rising on shore out of the gray night-clouds seaward, the blast of the wet northeaster in the September morning when under the dripping branches he picked up the windfall of golden and crimson apples ; and he will see, in dreams perhaps, the trailing-arbutus among its gray mosses on the thin edge of a spring snow-bank, the bubbling spring at the hill-foot near tide water, the fat, crimson roses under his mother's windows, with a clump of Aaron's rod or lilac for background; the yellow dawn of an October morning across his misty moors, and the fog of the chill pond among the pine trees, and above all the blue sea within its headlands, on which go the white winged ships to that great far-off world which the boy had heard of and the grown man knows so well.�From '�'�Sandwich and Yarmouth,' ly Rev.
