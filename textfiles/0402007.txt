To the Shaker and Shakeress : I have spent a portion of my leisure moments in reading, very attentively, the Shaker and Shakeress of several months' issue, and am fully persuaded in mind, and decided in feelings, that it is a pure and wholesome sheet, breathing a purer air from heaven, and a more Christian spirit than can be found in any other journal in our land. Peace, truth, kindness, and love, dwell within its columns; such as was never taught but by the divinelyinspired and lowly Nazarene. How very harmonizing it is to the weary soul, in times of trouble, a panacea for every earthly ill. The Christ principle is here more fully inculcated than I have ever seen it before. We shall never see the dawn of the great and glorious Millennial day, so long as we instruct our children in the art of war. How long, O how long, shall we continue to tread in the footsteps of our predecessors, and follow the counsels and dogmas of the dark ages ? The law of progression tells us that there is to be a turning and overturning in the political and religious world, when war and strife among nations will be abandoned. This grasping after power and wealth, oppressing the poor, and aggrandizing the rich, must have an end, and every man and woman must be free, and entitled to hold and occupy land in common; as God, in his wisdom, hath dealt out to each his blessings of sunshine, air, and water. Then all will be recognized as the children of one Father and Mother. Our souls must be fitted for the society of redeemed spirits before we can enter into the blessings and joys of eternal life.
