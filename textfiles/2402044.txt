It is said that 'a good man out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things.' It is these good things that we want on our pilgrimage through this world. Things that are good for both soul and body, and that will make of us better men and women. 'Leisure Moments' with its nearly four hundred well filled pages of short, interesting and profitable articles, will be all this and much more to those who possess it. Read what is said about being Content. 'One man can not do everything, be everything, nor have everything. We have, each of us all we can attend to, to do our own business; why should we envy others their talents, their work or their wages? 1'hey have their duties to do, and to their own Master they ï¿½stand or full. We have as many talents as we shall improve, as much prosperity as we de serve, and all the responsibility we shall wish to answer for in the day of judgment.'
