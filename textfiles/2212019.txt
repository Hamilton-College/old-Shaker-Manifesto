We certainly are living in very extraordinary times, and a mighty revolution is upon us. The conditions are upon us that will try men's souls and women's too. Every thing, external and internal, is calling for energy, and the consecration of our best talents. No time to waste in idle dreaming or vain speculation. The revelation of truth, and a practical application of it to every-day life is the only thing that will save from sin and bring the kingdom of righteousness in the earth. They that do right are righteous: those who compromise with the right for expedience, or worldly advantage, are heaping up fuel that will burn only to their discomfort. Let us be careful, watchful, and prayerful. The year is drawing to a close. I wish all my gospel friends a healthy, temperate thanksgiving, a truly pentecostal Christmas and a New Tear filled with the glory of God's summer that has passed and the harvest that has ended. We have many things to be thankful for, a few to regret, which in the coming year we hope to improve; and some bright hopes that fill our souls with courage and determination to work more faithfully in the vineyard of the Lord, and bring about that good thing which will make this earth a paradise, and thus fulfill the prayer of the Savior. We have our Separator set up, and in fine working order. We obtained a fourteen inch Motor of our Koreshan friends, set it up temporarily to prove it on the Separator, and found we had more than double the power we needed. Having a twenty-two inch Backus Motor to drive our sewing machines, and it not giving us quite as much power as we wanted, we took it out and set up the Teed Motor, and found to our surprise that the fourteen inch Teed Motor gave us more power than the twenty-two inch Backus, with the same size stream of water, and the same pressure. The size jet used in both wheels is three eighths of an inch under about sixty pounds pressure. D. O.
