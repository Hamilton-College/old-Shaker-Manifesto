The Key to Church Unions The Rev. Thomas K. Beecher writes : 'I have noted that theories, philosophies, theologies' and even sciences change. Churches, rituals and usages change. But I detect one fact and one testimony that never has changed and never will. I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and am at rest. Nothing shall separate me from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, my Lord.
