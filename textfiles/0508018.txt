GOOD INTENTIONS How many there are who begin life's varied pursuits with good intentions, looking to the future with bright and sanguine hopes for success ; and yet how many fail, sadly fail, of realizing those anticipations. Meaning to do well they become, in a measure, satisfied with their intentions, instead of actual good works. Thus they pass along till overtaken by misfortune, or the accumulation of neglected duties, while many of the most valuable years of health and vigor are squandered, and golden opportunities lost. We have never heard of the individual who became accomplished mentally or morally without a constant effort and application, meeting trials and disappointments withal. Let us learn endurance, and though we often fail of reaching the desired object, what has been accomplished may be again, with the same patience and unflinching courage. Each failure should serve to stimulate the mind and renew the energies for greater action. If 'All real good is on the mountain top,' then we must go up there to get it; and our trials and failures may prove, in the end, to be the very stepping-stones or means of our ascent to its summit.
