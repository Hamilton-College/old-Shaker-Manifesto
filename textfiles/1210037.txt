Red ants may be banished... Red ants may be banished from a pantry or store-room by strewing the shelves with a small quantity of cloves, either whole or ground. We use the former, as not so likely to get into the food placed upon the shelves. The cloves should be renewed occasionally, as after a time they lose their strength and efficacy.
