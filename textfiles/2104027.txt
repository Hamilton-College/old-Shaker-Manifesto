SUBMISSION. Florina Harding. When life's morning breaks in splendor, And brightly beams the rising sun; O how easy then to whisper,� Thy will, Lord, not mine be done. And when its golden rays fall gently On the pathway where I go, While the crystal streams beside me, Murmur softly as they flow, AVhen the pathway I am treading Seems decked with flowers, bright and fair; And their perfume rich and lovely, Floats upon the balmy air, O how easy, then, to whisper While these glories deck the way; Whatever thou wouldst have me do, Lord, I willingly obey. But when doubts and fears oppress me, And the storms are gathering nigh, When the clouds hang dark and heavy, O'er the once blue, sunlit sky;� When the murmuring, laughing streamlets Rise like billows by the way, And I stand in fear and terror Longing for the light of day; When the way is dark and dreary, Through its mist I fail to see; Am I willing then to whisper 'Lord, I'll follow none but Thee?' Teach me then, O Lord, I pray Thee Through the storm and bright sunshine To adore and love Thee, ever; And to say, Thy will, not mine. Hancock, Mass.
