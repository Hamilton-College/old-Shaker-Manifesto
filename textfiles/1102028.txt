The Children's Grotto THE GOLDEN LADDER M. R. BUTLER The children watched the sun go down, And in its gleaming changes, The west seemed first a sea of fire, Then golden mountain ranges. And Fannie asked, ' what are the clouds ? They look like hills of glory,' ' The steps of Heaven ' Prank replied, ' It is a sweet old story. ' A guardian angel, every day, To each of us is given ; And every night they climb to Heaven, Up o'er that Golden Ladder. ' And then the gates of pearl swing back Upon their gleaming hinges, And all the sky seems melted gold, With red and purple fringes. '' But when the doors are closed again, The guardian angels gather In solemn silence, with their books, Around our Heavenly Father. ' And when I close my eyes and think How, in that sinless dwelling, Will sound the story of the life My angel must be telling. ' Some days, I know, my angel takes The record of my sinning ; But then I always try to make The next a new beginning. ' So, when at night our Father calls, My angel may be bladder, And he the first to climb to Heaven, Up o'er the Golden Ladder.'
