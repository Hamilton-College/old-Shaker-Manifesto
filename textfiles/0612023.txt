AGRICULTURAL The Austrian system of making sour hay is very simple The Austrian system of making sour hay is very simple. It consists in digging long graves or trenches, four feet in depth by six or eight in breadth. The newly cut clover and grass is crammed into the trench and tramped tightly down. When the trench is quite full, so that the contents are a little above the surface, the whole is then covered up with a foot or fifteen inches of earth, just as a heap of potatoes is covered. Prof. AVrightson states that the preservation is complete, and the wetter the fodder when it goes together the better. No salt is mixed with the grass. He further states that this 'sour hay' affords a capital winter fodder, and when cut out with hay spades it is found to be rich brown in color and very much liked by stock. Pulp left in the manufacture of sugar from beet is also preserved in the same way, and, it is stated, will keep fresh for five or six years. Although Prof. Wrightson does not say so, still we imagine that green vetches may also be stored by the same method. When we formerly referred to this matter, we expressed a wish that some of our readers would make a careful trial of the Austrian mode of preserving green fodder. London Times.
