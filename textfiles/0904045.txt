The Mexicans have a method of subduing fractious horses... The Mexicans have a method of subduing fractious horses and such as are inclined to run away, which might be introduced here with profit. A hood or winker is so arranged that the driver or rider can in an instant draw it directly over the eyes of the animal, effectually blindfolding him. When this is done the horse instantly becomes quiet, and a repetition of the blindfolding two or three times gradually results in his becoming permanently quiet and docile. Such an arrangement would be a valuable appendage to the headgear of such horses as are disposed to run away.
