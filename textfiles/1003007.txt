MEEZHAHQUOD: The Millennium of the Indians GRANVILLE T. SPROAT Many of the north-western tribes of the American Indians cherish a belief in a coming millennium—a day of universal peace and love—when the red men shall be gathered into one common league of friendship and brotherhood—a perfect Indian community. The place of meeting they call the ' Long House,' or ' Keche Wahkiegun,' and say that it will reach from one great ocean to the other. This belief was very forcibly expressed in the presence of the writer by Keche Behzeke, a chief of Chippewa nation in 1837. It was spoken in his own wigwam, in a council of chiefs, in reply to the question, ' What are the hopes of your people for the future?' It was delivered in the Indian dialect, and abounded with beautiful tropes and figures, so characteristic of the red men. We have endeavored to render the thought, with many of the metaphors expressed, into English, in the piece before us, and have chosen, as best adapted to the subject, the poetic diction.
