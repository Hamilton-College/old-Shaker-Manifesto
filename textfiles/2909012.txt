East Canterbury N. H. July, 1899. The Shaker Church was established one hundred and twenty-five years ago. The landing of eight persecuted souls in New York, Aug. 6, 1774, opened the history of our church work on this continent. It has long been our custom to commemorate this important event, and the current month brought no exception. The Sixth occurring on Sunday, the anniversary exercises were presented to the society between the hours of 1-30 and 3-30 p. m. in our Old South Church. Each number on the well-arranged programme was especially appropriate to the occasion, the following giving particular pleasure:__ In our Home of Many Mansions. Chorus. A Historical Summary of the Church. Why Do we Commemorate this Day? Our Mother's Way. Trio. The World's Good Women. Our Mother. Acrostic. A Bouquet of Flowers. Little Girls. Art thou Watching over me My Mother? Quartette. Choice Gems from our First Elders. Thy Kingdom Come. Children. What will Bring the Heavens Nearer? Chorus. 144 THE MANIFESTO. Links in Mother's Golden Chain. Youth. Mother's Crown. Little Boys. Our Mother Ann of To-day. Our Mothers Last Hymn. While blessings rich and many are ours to-day, may we ever hold'in.sacred memory the names and testimony of those pioneer spirits, who suffered that our communal Christ homes might be established in this land of freedom. Temporal prosperity is still vouchsafed to us. Beloved Elder Henry has been heartily welcomed home. No good friend or friends accompanied him from that lovely hospitable home at West Pittsfield, however. This would have been a pleasant sequel to a pleasant stoi'y. Haying has closed at this date.
