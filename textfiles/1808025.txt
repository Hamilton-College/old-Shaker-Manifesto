THE SURRENDER. Annie Armstrong. I had long of sin been weary, And my heart was very sore, When I stood one early morning Outside a chapel door. And the chant came floating outward, 'Leave all and follow me.' And I thought if I should enter Perhaps I should be free. So I knelt low at the Altar, And laid my treasure there ; One by one, with sadness, slowly, For some were very fair. But one was so very precious That I kept it, I was weak. And I thought, sure all the others Will give the peace I seek. I rose and left the Altar, Hoping I should be blest, But my heart was just as heavy And my soul received no rest. Then I built a grand cathedral, And gave alms far and wide, But my wishes were not granted, Nor my bright hopes verified. And none of my mighty efforts, None of my patient thought Gave to my spirit comfort, Or brought the boon I sought. And I journeyed the wide world o'er In search of the missing peace, Toiling from morn till ev'ning, And rinding no release. Till I came again one morning To that little wayside place Where I had left my treasures, Hoping to meet his grace. And I heard again the music Of the chant, 'Leave all for me,' And I cried, ' I will, my Master, If thou wilt make me free ! ' Once more I kneeled at the Altar, And bowing low my head, I dropped my cherished treasure ; Then all my sadness fled, And suddenly all around me With radiant glory beamed, And my heart so filled with rapture And wonder, that it seemed That the very gates of heaven Were ope'd unto my soul, And the peace that passeth knowledge, Came down and made me whole.
