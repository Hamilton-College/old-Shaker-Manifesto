STAND FOR THE RIGHT OLA L. WHITCOMB Stand for the right with unwavering will, Stand firm and be true, but never stand still, The pathway is rough, 'tis trod by few feet, And many, the ills all pioneers meet. From friends we love well sometimes we must part. Although still in sight, heart beat8 not to heart. No two see alike, but Black is not White, And whatever the shade, stand thou for the Right. Stand firm, and be true, and never retreat, Be sure at the start Persecution you'll meet ; But rubbing makes bright the silver and steel, And your mind may need all the friction you feel. But stand for the right, for somebody must; You'd better wear out, than lie still and rust ; The Lord must have help â€” be steady and true ; For should He come this way, He might want you.
