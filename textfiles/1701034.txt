BEAUTIFUL WORDS Cast thy bread, vpon the waters; for thou shah l it after many day-s.'—Eccl. xi., 1. Mid the losses and the gains, Mid the pleasures and the pains ; 'Mid the hopings and the fears. And the restlessness of years, We repeat this passage o'er— We believe it more and more— Bread upon the waters cast Shall be gathered at the last. Gold and silver, like the sands, Will keep slipping through our hands ; Jewels, gleaming like a spark, Will be hidden in the dark; Sun and moon and stars will pale, But these words will never fail— Bread upon the waters cast Shall be gathered at the last. Soon like dust to you and me, Will our earthly treasure be ; But the loving word and deed To a soul in bitterest need, They will Hot forgotten be, They will live eternally— Bread upon the waters cast Shall be gathered at the last. Fast the moments slip away, Soon our mortal powers decay ; Low and lower sinks the sun, What we do must soon be done; Then what rapture, if we hear Thousand voices ringing clear— Bread upon the waters cast Shall be gathered at the last.
