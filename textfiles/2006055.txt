Heavenly-mindedness comes from a contemplation... HEAVENLY-mindedness conies from a contemplation of those things that are pure and holy; from a study of God's word, and an application of its precepts to our daily life. While the windows of the soul are darkened by sin, we cannot expect that the sunshine will pour in to cheer and lighten, its innermost recesses, and draw its thoughts to commune with God. We have a certain port to gain, and a pilot who knows how to guide it here in serenity and peace. M. Witham.
