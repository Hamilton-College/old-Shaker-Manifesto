Conversion We believe that the tendency of the race of humanity is upward. Larger comprehension of what good is; keener apprehension, with charity, of what wrong intends, noble feelings of what human nature is capable of, are features to be observed more than occasionally. To be converted, means to he changed, changed from something to something else. Conviction of what is wrong is inevitably accompanied by the conviction of 'the better way.' Conviction is not conversion. It is an easy matter to be convicted; but to become converted to the better way, changed from what we were, to what we ought to he, like Christ, the pattern, is a conversion worth having, and one seldom heard of in the bubbling effervescence of modern revivalism.
