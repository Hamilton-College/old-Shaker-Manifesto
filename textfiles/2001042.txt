The Philadelphia Musical Journal The Philadelphia Musical Journal for December has a portrait of Addie Reed Fleming, the contralto Soloist; of Emma Juch, who has in possession that even quality of voice, which, combined with bird-like execution, intelligent phrasing and charming manners contributes to her popularity; of Marie Halton and of Pauline Hall. Open Questions will be studied with interest by the readers of the Journal, as it is to be a free discussion of subjects of great importance to musicians. Other valuable contributions will be found in the number for December. Gould &amp; Woolley, 1416 Chestnut St., Philadelphia, Pa.
