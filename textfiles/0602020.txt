SECTARIAN FOLLY Methodist Bishop Haven, having nominated President Grant for a third term '(poor business for a bishop), the New York Tribune says: Would it not be well for Bishop Haven to be a little more explicit? Else there may be danger of having Baptist and Presbyterian and Congregationalist, and nobody knows how many more sectarian candidates for President, which would be a very sad state of things; for when it comes to that, who knows but that the Roman Catholics may hold a convention and nominate the Pope? And thenâ€”great heavens! where are we?
