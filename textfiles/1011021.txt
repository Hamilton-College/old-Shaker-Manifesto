KIND WORDS HELEN HARCOURT Kind words' are of value, though nothing they cost; By harsh, bitter accents, many souls have been lost. Then deep in thy heart this memory bear, Nor drive, by unkindness, a friend to despair. Refuse not forgiveness, for, oh, then, alas ! Thou breakest the bridge over which thou must pass. With the set of the sun let thy anger go down, And banish away every stern, bitter frown.
