THE DEAD SOUL. [Contributed by G. B. Avery.] I dreamed such a horrible dream last night, It smote hie through with a cold affright, And would not go with the dawning light like other lies; For in dreams men often meet a guess, Or a wandering thought in bodily dress, A visible 'No' or a tangible 'Yes' to some dim surmise. What was the horrible thing I dreamed? I met a man�or a man he seemed, As the noonday sunlight over him streamed, till, thrilled with dread, I saw when my soul looked his soul through. As only in dreams a soui can do, That, though brains and body lived and grew, His soul vas dead. Yes, there he stood, a creature indeed, That could walk and talk and drink and feed, And add up figures, and write and read, And work and wed� And all with automatic neatness, Smiling even with studied sweetness, And quite enjoying life's completeness, The life he led. Till at last as I saw him standing there, With never a hope and never a care, His dead soul set in a stony stare, �'Poor soul,' I said, 'And wilt thou never feel again Divinest joy, most God-like pain, Love in which self is lost and slain? Art thou quite dead? And then in my pity I cried aloud, '0 give to this poor dead soul a shroud, And hide him away from the living crowd In some narrow bed� Oh, merciful heaven, give him a grave, Or send some fire that will cleanse and save And quicken again the soul that God gave, The soul that's dead!'
