Friendship It is commonly the case, when we meet with trials of our faith, to feel that we have no friends. But, do we realize what a true friend is ? Are we able to appreciate true friendship ? We all want friends ; yet are quite unwilling, sometimes, to recognize them in those 'who tell us of our faults and show us how to correct them.' Those who are willing to bear with our faults, while we are exerting our THE SHA.KER. 31 selves to overcome them, are true friends; while those who are indifferent to our evil ways, bad habits, unchristian behavior, etc., or who chastise us merely to display authority, are not our friends, but enemies to our souls' best good. To be worthy of the forbearance of true friendship, I realize T must give evidence of an improved disposition ; that there is a proper length to forbearanceâ€”a point where mercy is encouragement to vice, rather than an illustration of Christian friendship. Those who are ever singing the need of more charity, are too often chanting desires for continued indulgences ; while to grant them such charity would not be friendship; but rather, as President Lincoln expressed it, 'mercy to the individual is murder to the State !'
