Love BY D. F. CABLE In our bright happy sphere. Or in heaven above, Where all virtues appear, There is nothing like love I It ennobles, refines. The rough nature of man ; And in woman it shines Asâ€”nothing else can ! 'Tis the lamp that illumes The dark hours of strife; 'Tis the rose that perfumes The fair garden of life; 'Tis the landmark that guides O'er the ocean of care, And the dark rolling tides Of a gloomy despair. 'Tis a heaven of rest; 'Tis an eye to the blind; 'Tis a boon to the blest; ' Tis a calm to the mind. 'Tis a link that unites us In heart, tho' abroad ; 'Tis the glory that lights us To a knowledge of God.
