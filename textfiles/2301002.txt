THE OLD YEAR Margarette Davis Now the dear Old Year is ended, Joy and sorrow both have blended In its passing days. And 'twas best so, both were given By our Father wise in heaven, Render we sweet praise. Backward as the leaves we're turning, Precious lessons we are learning, Ne'er to be forgot. Here are words unkindly spoken, There are obligations broken, All for want of thought. Sad the hours we thus have squandered, As from duty we have wandered, In forbidden ways, Yet the heavens bear us witness, How we've yearned for angel fitness, 'Mid these trying days. Yearned for faith that is abiding, For a trust always confiding, In our God above, Who will give when earth shall fail us, And when inward foes assail us, His protecting love. Gracious Father, we surrender All to Thee, our sure defender, Whatsoe'er betide. Where Thou leadest we will follow, Each to-day and each to-morrow, And thy wisdom bide. Cover in thy loving-kindness, Missteps taken in our blindness, Often do we stray. Yet we seek thy kingdom holy, Though we make the journey slowly, Lengthen out our day. Counting up our gains and losses, Merged in love are all the crosses, Of the good Old Year. Cancelling all claims and debts, As friends we part without regrets, Faithful, good Old Year.
