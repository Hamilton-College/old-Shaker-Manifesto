THOUGHTS OF LIFE O, if every one were happy, Joyful — happy — I would be ; But the sufl 'rings of another Ever take my joy from me. What a world of bitter anguish I What distressing scenes of woe, Mortals born in pain to languish. And but slight releasement know. Just the best, and the most holy, Are afflicted and oppress'd ; Just the kindest, and most lowly, (Seemingly) are most distressed. As I find of pain each token Sadden'd, I behold the cause ; For, in depths of ill unspoken. Much is ours through broken laws. Violation of the Spirit, And of Nature's perfect way, With the weakness we inherit, How proceed the debt to pay ? Toils that seem to yield but little (While we walk in present light) Shall fulfill each jot and tittle, And establish truth and right. Mountains are composed of atoms, And by atoms worn away : So, by little acts, we render Righteousness for future day. Let us labor for salvation; On the present it will tell; Add to every generation Something more, till all is well. Till the work of God's completed, And a new relation given, Where the laws of life are meted With the blessed peace of heaven. Keep thy calling, O Mount Zion ; Keep thine inner life secure ; Draw the power thou canst rely on, To protect from the impure. Mary Whitcher, Canterbury, N. H.
