Alfred., Me. Jan. 1894. The January Manifesto came to us laden with good gifts but no Home Notes from Alfred. The omission came in p-ut from time being so well filled with home duties, and partly because there seemed to be so little to write that would be of general interest. We are a little Society way down in Maine and nothing wonderful transpires. We attend to our daily duties, and strive to be faithful in what our hands find to do, and at the same time give our hearts to God. We are told, 'Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God,' and with such we hope to be numbered. The snow: the beautiful snow, came to us early in December, and enough to give us sleding, I say sledingas that is the most important use we have for the snow, sleighing being a secondary consideration. The Brethren say they have already done more in the woods than all last winter. The ice harvest for ourselves and townsmen was finished the 3rd the crystal blocks being 12 inches thick. There is but little frost in the ground and not a great body of snow although the inch that fell last night, makes the fourteenth snow-storm. La grippe has come near to us but kindly passed us by. Light colds are all we have to complain of. Our Covenant was read to us yesterday which reminded vis of the full consecration we promised to make when we placed our names with our forefathers. We renewed our vows of consecration, pledging that the present year should find more of the Christ spirit abiding with us, than any of the years that have preceeded it. With this accept our love and prayer for the prosperity of Zion. Fannie Casey.
