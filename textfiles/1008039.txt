LEND A HAND Life is made of ups and downs — Lend a hand; Life is made of thorns and crowns ; If you would the latter wear, Lift some crushed heart from despairLend a hand. Crowns are not alone of gold ! Lend a hand; Diadems are bought and sold ; But the crowns that good men own, Come from noble deeds alone — Lend a hand. Many crowns that many wear — Lend a hand ; Never in the sunlight glare; Diamonds never in them shine, Yet they hold a light divine — Lend a hand. Hold a light that ne'er shall fade — Lend a hand; Beauty, art hath never made ; For these crowns that good men wear, Everlasting are, as rare — Lend a hand. Would you own so bright a crown ? Lend a hand; When you see a brother down, Lead him from the deep, dark night, Place him in the morning light — Lend a hand.
