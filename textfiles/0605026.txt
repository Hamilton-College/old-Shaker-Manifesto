Cracked wheat pudding [From the Country Gentleman.] CRACKED WHEAT PUDDING. NANNIE MINOR. Some one has asked for directions as to the various modes of cooking cracked wheat; but among the numerous replies I have not seen one for making a dish which our family consider particularly dainty and wholesome. I take a large coffeecupful of boiled cracked wheat; four eggs ; four heaping tablespoonsful of coffee-sugar; one pint of new milk ; one piece of butter of the size of a walnut, and one fresh lemon (if I can get it). Mash the wheat with the potato masher (to avoid lumps); add the yelks of the eggs and sugar well beaten together; the butter after it is melted, then the milk, and lastly, three or four slices of the lemon, being careful not to allow the seeds in, as they will make it bitter. Rake one-half hour or until the custard is set, stirring once or twice after it becomes heated, to prevent the wheat from settling to the bottom. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth ; add a little pulverized sugar, and flavor with the juice of the lemon that is left. When the pudding is baked spread this on the top, return to the oven and brown lightly; serve hot, with cream, or it is equally good when cold. Cracked wheat simply boiled is a daily dish on our breakfast table, and as it is almost impossible to cook just enough, we often have a small saucerful left. In two or three days enough will have accumulated to make this puddingâ€”and to use these precious bits I have improvised this, which has now come to be one of our standard puddings, and which I now offer to your readers In return for the many practical hints I have received through the columns of your valuable paper.
