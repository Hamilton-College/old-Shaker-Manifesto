TRUE ESTIMATION If is often said that knowledge is power, and this is true. Skill or faculty of any kind carries with it superiority. So, to a great extent, wealth is power, and genius has a transcendent gift of mastery over man. But higher, purer, better than all these, more constant in its influence, more lasting in its sway, is the power of character — that power which emanates from a pure and lofty mind. Take any community, who is the man of most influence ? To whom do all look up with reverence ? Not to the ' smartest' man (physically), not to the cleverest politician nor the most brilliant talker, but to him, who in a long course of years, tried by the extremes of prosperity and adversity, has approved himself to the judgment of those around him — of all who have seen his life as worthy to be called wise and good.
