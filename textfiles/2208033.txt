SCRIPTURE TEXT. Was the spirit of Jesus preaching to the spirits in prison while his body was in the grave? 1 Peter iii., 19. By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison. The prison-house of these spirits was a state of disobedience to known light. In an earlier dispensation they refused Grod's call, and as Noah wTas a preacher of righteousness they could not progress nor enter another dispensation until they had been faithful to that light already received. The object of the preaching was to urge the hearers to repent and do their first work, and then they would be prepared to accept the testimony of the Christian dispensation. The apostle evidently wanted to show his brethren the universal mission of Jesus. He preached not only to men in the body, but also to those out of the body, in the world of spirits. After the death of Jesus, some think that he was preaching to the souls or to the spirits in prison as is said by Peter, 'that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.'
