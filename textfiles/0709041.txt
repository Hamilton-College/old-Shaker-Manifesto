Faith may sometimes exceed reason... Faith may sometimes exceed reason, but not oppose it; and belief may be often above sense, though not against it. Beware therefore, not only of an implicit faith, but of being too closely tied up to reason, where faith is required. Do little helpful things and speak helpful words whenever you can. They are better than pearls or diamonds to strew along the roadside of life. They will yield a far more valuable harvest, as you will find after many days.
