Germination from old seed In the silver mines of Laurium, only the slags left by the ancient Greeks are at present worked off', in order to gain, after an improved modern method, silver still left in that dross. This refuse ore is probably about two thousand years old. Among it, the seed of a species of glaucium, or poppy, was found, which had slept in the darkness of the earth during all that time. After a little while, when the slags were brought up and worked off at the melting ovens, there suddenly arose a crop of glaucium plants, with a beautiful yellow flower, of a kind unknown to modern botany, but which is described by Pliny and others as a frequent flower in ancient Greece.
