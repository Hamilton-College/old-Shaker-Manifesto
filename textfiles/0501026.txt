A SUGGESTION Ministers often hold conventions, to which delegates are sent from various churches, lo- cated in different parts of the country. Would it not be a good thing for ministers' wives and some earnest, pure-minded women, to hold conventions also, and take counsel together, and construct some rules of propriety to be observed by the spiritual leaders of the people, and exert a saving influence, over the Clergy, in this way ? By timely effort in this direction, they might do much to save the reputation of their husbands, ward off shame, confusion and disgrace from the churches; and be help-meets, in a spiritual point of view, as well as in the domestic relations of life. Where could man look for an impartial ad- vocate and supporter of his character, if not in the partner of his life, if she be a true woman V In his ministerial duties, she might shield him from temptation, in many ways, and also be a Mother, in a degree, in the Church over which her husband presides; to whom burdened, suffering females might find access, and unbosom their griefs and sorrows and find some relief. If they would become ensamples to their sisters in the Church, in dress and manners, and strive to silence the tongue of slander â€” discourage envy and jealousy, I be- lieve God would bless their efforts.
