MANNA, THE HEAVENLY BREAD Mr. Cole, a missionary of the American Board, in Eastern Turkey, in describing a journey from Harport to Bitlis, says : ' We traveled for four days through a region where had newly fallen a remarkable deposit of heavenly Bread, as the natives sometimes call it,ï¿½manna. There were extensive forests of scrubby oaks, and most of the deposit was on the leaves. Thousands of the poor peasants, men, women and children, were out upon the plains gathering the sweet substance. Some of them put into kettles of boiling water the newly cut branches of the oaks, which washes off the deposit until the water becomes so sweet as to remind the Yankee of a veritable sugaring oft in the old Granite State as he takes sips of it. Other companies of natives may be seen vigorously beating with sticks, the branches, that, from having been spread on the ground, have so dried that the glistening crystals fall readily upon the carpet spread ready to receive them. The crystals are separated from the pieces of leaves by a sieve, and then the manna is pressed into cakes for use. The manna is in great demand among these Oriental Christians. As we were traveling through a rather dry region, the article came in play for our plain repasts. Scientific American.
