WHAT AN APPETITE There is no accounting for tastes. No person with a natural appetite can tell why another likes food which is rank, or partially decayed, nor can bees tell why, when they are sipping nectar from the flowers, buzzards should be flying overhead looking out for of- fal and carrion. These are simply matters of taste and nature. So there are men who are inclined to smut and filth and scandal, and who smile and smirk and grin and gloat over vice and vileness, and who continually pry and peddle in this line. One can hardly be in their company for an hour without listening to smutty talk, questionable stories, and scandalous reports. They gather such things from all quarters. What they cannot gather they invent. What they hear from others they embellish, and what they have gathered, invented, and embellished, they peddle. There are men who profess to be ministers of the gospel who need a conversion that shall give them clean hearts and clean tongues, for so long as men lack that purity of heart which God bestows by the power of the Holy Spirit so long will the results of early education, vile surroundings, bad training, exhibit themselves ; until they are thoroughly and soundly saved, we shall find such persons, whatever their professions or positions may be, returning to the blackguardism of their early days like the dog to his vomit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. â€” Good Way.
