Kind Words Washington, D. C. June. 1884 I gather much comfort from the teachings of the Manifesto. Religion is made to live out the Christian life, which the great body called Christians have only in theory. I hail the time when the great majority will obey the teaching of our Christ and King, and to this end I like to study and get comfort from the Manifesto. Your friend, J. G. Toepper Bangor, Me. Aug. 1884 For some reason my Aug. Manifesto did not reach me. Will you please forward it at once and oblige. I feel at a great loss without it and do not feel willing to have one number drop out. Yours truly, Simeon Emery
