'ACT YOUR FAITH' If we meet with opposition from within or from without, let us endeavor to act according to the best spiritual instruction and belief. It is an unsafe caution for us to 'act our faith ;' as evidenced by that earnest defender of consecrated property, who, during the visitation of the Ohio Mob to the Shakers, was stationed at the head of the stairs, with instructions to prevent any one ascending. On the approach of two ruffians, he cried out: 'Elder Benjamin, what shall I do?' '¦'¦Act your faith;' came back in response, with all expectation that he would act upon the principle of non-resistance—refraining from physical violence. But iiAll right!' was his response, as raising a chair, he brought it violently down on the head of the leader, at which all fled. The result of this misunderstanding was no doubt fortunate; but in acting our faith, we should, as Christians, act Christ nevertheless.
