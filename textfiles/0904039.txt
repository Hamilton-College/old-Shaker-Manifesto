Keep Good John Bunyan It is an easier matter to begin to do good than to continue therein; and the reason is, there is not so much of a Christian's cross in the beginning of a work as there is in a continual, hearty, conscientious practice thereof. Apples and flowers are not made by the gardener, but are an effect of the planting and the watering. A life full of good works is the only way on thy part to answer the mercy of God extended to thee. The heart that is fullest of good works hath in it least room for Satan's temptation. Every promise in the Bible is thine to strengthen, quicken and encourage thy heart.
