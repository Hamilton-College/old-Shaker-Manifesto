TRUST. Florine Harding. It is a trusting and reverent heart that God loves, on such his fullest blessing rests. If we pray to Him how willing He is to give ear to our pleadings. He has promised if we trust Him, He will remove the burden and give strength to bear it; to clear the path, or guide us through it; to lighten our sorrow, and give us comfort. With all these precious promises why should we not love and trust our Heavenly Father? The Savior set the example of a trusting and prayerful heart, he 'leaned not in his own understanding' but trusted that the Lord would guide him through all temptation. It is said 'God had one son without sin but no son without temptation,' but he resisted only by his Father's help. This teaches that of ourselves we are weak, and if we wish to overcome the wrong in ourselves we will follow the example our loving Savior set, to seek guidance from God and trust all things to his keeping. To those that love and trust him he has given the promise, 'I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.' Hancock, Mass.
