CORRESPONDENCE Dear Children: A happy new year... Enfield, Conn., 1886. Dear Children :�A Happy New Year to you all. How swiftly the years pass away. Make the most of this one. Turn over a new leaf in the volume of your lives, and on it write virtuous deeds. Each new year seems like a golden promise, and may this one hold a germ of abiding joy for you. What of the past year's journey? Have you made progress heavenward, or taken steps backward? There is no standing still. The question is a serious one for you to consider. So many things left undone, so many neglected opportunities dropped along the wayside never to be recovered, you would gladly turn back and gather them up. But alas ! only the present is yours. In reaching for things that are past, you too often reap 'a harvest of vain regrets. ' It is time for good resolves, for better endeavois, and a purer life. Virtuous living is worth more than resolutions. It is not enough to mean well. Do well. 'Live unspotted from sin. ' Never put off vows of amendment. 'One moment today is worth two tomorrow. ' No day like today. If your today is well spent, lasting' happiness will be yours. Time well improved brings peace to the spirit, Cherish a noble ideal and strive to live up to it. Grow better today than you did yesterday; better this week than you did last; better tins year than you did last year. [n eternity you will appear in the garment that you have formed during your earthly pilgrimage. There may you meet, sometime, and there may you greet each other in the happiest of all New Years. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt. Beloved elder: Prompted by love as... Shaker Village, N. H. Dec. 1885. Beloved Elder :�Prompted by love as for a gospel parent, I in this express my gratitude for the sa:r,e. I never come into the presence of souls purified by the gospel without an impression is made which opens an avenue of thought in relation to my own condition and purpose. Our meeting of last evening was replete with testimonies against the spirit of the world in its every form. The one theme of thought that has occupied my mind since then, is that of the loveliness of young men and women, possessing the adequate faculties for every worldy pleasure, and who in obedience to light and conviction, are endeavoring to crucify every carnal propensity, that they may become true Brethren and Sisters in the virgin relation. I love this relation because of intrinsic value to the soul and I feel determined to square my life by the testimony which makes a separation between flesh and spirit. They are opposite elements and cannot coalesce and any endeavor that any one may make to combine them will not only prove futile, but if persisted in, will eventuate in the spirit of the world. I trust and have reason to believe that every one is endeavoring to do right, and yet my first and great concern should be and is, that I am trying, faithfully, to discharge every duty incumbent upon me both spiritual and temporal. Accept the love and gratitude of a gospel child, Arthur Bruce.
