Beloved elder: Prompted by love as... Shaker Village, N. H. Dec. 1885. Beloved Elder :ï¿½Prompted by love as for a gospel parent, I in this express my gratitude for the sa:r,e. I never come into the presence of souls purified by the gospel without an impression is made which opens an avenue of thought in relation to my own condition and purpose. Our meeting of last evening was replete with testimonies against the spirit of the world in its every form. The one theme of thought that has occupied my mind since then, is that of the loveliness of young men and women, possessing the adequate faculties for every worldy pleasure, and who in obedience to light and conviction, are endeavoring to crucify every carnal propensity, that they may become true Brethren and Sisters in the virgin relation. I love this relation because of intrinsic value to the soul and I feel determined to square my life by the testimony which makes a separation between flesh and spirit. They are opposite elements and cannot coalesce and any endeavor that any one may make to combine them will not only prove futile, but if persisted in, will eventuate in the spirit of the world. I trust and have reason to believe that every one is endeavoring to do right, and yet my first and great concern should be and is, that I am trying, faithfully, to discharge every duty incumbent upon me both spiritual and temporal. Accept the love and gratitude of a gospel child, Arthur Bruce.
