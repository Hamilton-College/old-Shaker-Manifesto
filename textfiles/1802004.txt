Four Queries about the Shakers. No. 2. Chancy Dibble. Belief in Ann Lee. We do not worship man or woman. We honor Paul, Peter, Luke, Matthew, James raid John. Why? because they were apostles of Jesus, pioneers, founders of the primitive Church ; tli3 purest sect we read of, and the most perfect pattern of Christian love. They planted the gospel and stood firm against all opposition. They endured to the end, and obtained a crown of life. Yet we do not worship them. We reverence their virtues, and emulate their pure, peaceful lives. We bless and extol the spirit of Christ that inspired them. So in like manner we adore the spirit of wisdom, purity and love, which inspired Ann Lee, and her followers ; by which they overcame sin and selfishness, broke the shackles of superstition, and lived in brotherly and sisterly love, in spite of persecution. We do not worship Ann Lee. She never would allow any one even to bow to her. She directed all, to kneel to God. IShe was but a servant. We do not worship a woman, but we do worship the Mother Spirit. All creation has implanted in it the Mother principle, as well as that of the Father. That intelligent power .which sent forth man and woman, was Mother as well as Father. That vast angel realm where myriads of happy spirits dwell is made joyful through the Mother influence. The spirit of redeeming Love is manifested as purely and divinely through woman as through any other medium. We believe in rendering to woman her proper rights, in her own sphere. Thus we reverence Ann Leï¿½;, by yielding obedience to the spirit of truth through her, by which she and her associates planted a home of love. She taught, where purity aud equality reigned, there is home ; heaven on earth begun. We make our home and heaven, by uniting hearts aud hands, to make each other happy. Innocence and love are the gems that deck the home of the pure in heart. In this, there can be no deception, while we are following the example of Jesus and the apostles. Watervliet, N. Y.
