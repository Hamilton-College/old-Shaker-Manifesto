LITTLE EFFORTS WRITTEN FOlt THE MANIFESTO, Little efforts are like little seeds, Which spring to flowers, or grow to weeds. We can make them for good, or for ill. Just as our hearts dictate and will. We can make them now, and by and by, A new star may shine in Fame's blue sky; We can make them by and by, and wait A little longer at Fortune's gate. We can make them not at all, and stand With our feet fast buried in deep sand. Â« We can make them always, and so, prove Their worth by progress of which we move; But ever and aye, the efforts we make, Be they for noble, or selfish sake. Will surely grow, as the little seeds, Which are certain of either flowers or weeds, Into grand results which Trial perfects, Or to weed-like follies, with poor effects. Ah! just as our hearts dictate and will, Are our efforts made for good or ill; And who hath triumphed, hath truly learned That little by little, is triumph earned. Ah! little efforts are wonderful things, God's work carried on through sufferings. God's truth changing our human hearts, God's love healing their severed parts. All praise to the Poet-heart who sings 'None shall despise the day of small things !' All praise to the Master-heart, who makes Continuous efforts for worthy sakes. He hath learned by trial their true avail, And knows not the word, or meaning of fail. Then let us make efforts, or little, or great, But noble and pure, may our hearts dictate; For ever, and aye, our efforts, like seeds, Will grow beautiful flowers, or worthless weeds.
