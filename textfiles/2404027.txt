WHERE SNOW IS RED WHERE SNOW IS RED. Snow is sometimes found in Polar and Alpine regions, whereitliesunmelted from year to year, smd the annual fall is small, colored red by the presence of innumerable small red plants. In its native state the plant consists of brilliant red globules on a gelatinous mass. Red snow was observed by the ancients, a passage in Aristotle referring to it, but it attracted little or no attention until 1760, when Sanssure observed it in the Alps, and concluded that it was due to the pollen of a plant. It was also noticed by the Arctic Expedition under Captain Ross on Bafflns Bay shore on a range of cliffs, the red color penetrating to a depth of twelve feet. Less frequent is a green growth on snow.ï¿½March Ladies' Home Journal.
