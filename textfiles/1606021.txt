EATING TOO MUCH. The average farmer and farm laborer are chargeable with two failings, which injure health and shorten life, both heir-looms of the highly barbarous feudal ages just referred to. They eat too much and bathe too little. Some of the food is objectionable as to the quality, but the quality is less harmful than the quantity. The farmer's outdoor life gives him a vigorous appetite, and not enough re. straint is exercised against an excess. His table drinks, too (which may be classed as part of his food,) are also objectionable, being very generally strong tea and coffee. The drink failing is particularly prevalent among the females. When a person regards strong tea or coffee as an absolute necessity for a meal, it is, in itself, a bad sign. An appetite for an unhealthy stimulus is fastened on the stomach, and the path to disease is short and easy. Nature's simplicity is gone, and in its place are nervousness, changing moods, and a tendency to enjoy other stimulants, such as the most highly seasoned foods and condiments, and, not infrequently, intoxicating drinks. Children are brought up to tea and coffee, and the whole range of condiments, along with pie and cake to any extent, and their tender stomachs are disorganized at an early age. Then when a dangerous disease sets inï¿½dyspepsia, heart-burn, frequent colic, flatulency, nausea, etc., the child is ' weakly, ' unable to work, and an early death is regarded as 'an inscrutable dispensation of an all-wise Providence. ' There are thousands today half broken-down, prematurely old, complaining that 'food does them no good, ' or that it ' distresses them,' and who are running after the doctor, or swallowing quack medicines, who could yet be cured by a proper system of diet. Some, it is true, are too far gone, and yet hardly one in a thousand will listen with patience to a kind remonstrance against his bad habits. Rural JS'ew Yorker.
