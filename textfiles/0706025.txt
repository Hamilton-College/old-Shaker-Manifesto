Mt. Lebanon, May 4, 1877 Dear Editor:â€”You have put a temptation before me, one that I feel I cannot resist, to write to you. 'The child's prayer!' How beautiful the thought! How many innocent prayers have I put up before my heavenly Father to protect my soul from sin. When a bad thought enters my mind, what can do better than to drop upon my knees and raise my prayer to Him who has power to drive the bad spirit away. I thank you for that prayer. From your little friend, James E. Howd
