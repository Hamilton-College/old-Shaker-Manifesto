ADVICE TO THE YOUNG. No. 1. HARRIET SHKPARD. It is better to learn young what difficulties are, and how to meet life's misfortunes. Begin now to share another's ills, aud help to bear the burden under which your neighbor may be sinking. Repress often thy hilarity aud go to the place cf mourning and discipline thy vivacity to speak soothingly to the afflicted. 202 the manifp:sto. Life is a reality. Old or young we have always a duty to do and something to bear. Our occupation is here and imploring suffering invites us to it, and the call of good will and charity is, ' Come over and help us.' Places of service are as many as are the abodes of the needy and distressed. Have you anything to do but to decorate your frail ten. ement and your own surroundings, and cultivate pride which must be wholly eradicated before becoming a truly meek and humble follower of Christ? Have you powers of heart and soul to give to the labor of self-elevation and the improvement of our kind? The pains that have been taken to educate you has accelerated your ability for usefulness, by fertilizing your heart, and illuminating your sensibilities and supplying your intellectual faculty with fresh and aspiring thoughts. Having acquired new impulses to your advancing nature, and expansion of your intellectual and virtuous capability, for which you are accountable : your Heavenly Father will hold you amenable.
