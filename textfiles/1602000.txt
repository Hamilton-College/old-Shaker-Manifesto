THE FOUR DISPENSATIONS, No. 2. ELDER .JOSEPH MEACHAM. Let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first; and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition. 2 Thess. ii., 2. And it was given unto him to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds, tongues and nations. Rev. xiii. 7. And this is the state Christ prophesied the world of mankind should be in at his second appearance. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the days of the son of man. Even so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. Luke, xxvii., 26, 80. Plainly referring to his second appearance to consume or destroy anti-christ, and make a final end of sin, and establish his kingdom upon earth ; but the revelation of Christ must be in his people, whom he had chosen to be his body, to give testimony of him and to preach his gospel to. a lost world. Fourth Dispensation. The fourth dispensation or day. is the Second Appearance of Christ, or final, or last display of God's grace to a lost world, in which the mystery of God will be finished and a decisive work to the final salvation or condemnation of all the children of men, (which according to the prophecies rightly calculated, and truly understood, began in the year of our Savior Jesus Christ, 1747.)

Death to all sin, become alive to God, by the power of Christ's resurrection, ' which worketh in us mightily ; by which a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto us; and woe be unto us if we preach not the gospel of Christ. For in finding so great a salvation and deliverance from the law of sin and death in believing and obeying this gospel which is the gospel of Christ, in confessing and forsaking all sin and denying ourselves and bearing the cross of Christ, against the world, flesh and devil, we have found repentance of all our sins, and are made partakers of the grace of God wherein we now stand ; which all others in believing and obeying, have acceptance with God, and may find salvation from their sins as well as we ; God being no respecter of persons but willing that all should come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved. Thus we have given a short information of what we believe of the dispensations of God's grace to mankind, both past and present; and in what manner the people of God have found justification, or acceptance with God, which was and is still in believing and obeying the light and truth of God, revealed or made known in the day or dispensation in which it is revealed: for as the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness or live in any known sin against him. So his mercy and grace is towards all them that truly fear him, and turn from all their sins, by confessing and forsaking and repenting, which is the way and manner in which all must find the forgiveness ot their sins, and acceptance with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, or finally fail of the grace of God, and that salvation which is brought to light by the gospel. But to conclude, in short, as we believe and do tes'ify, that the present gospel of God's grace unto us, is the day which in the scripture is spoken or prophesied of, as the second appearing of Christ to consume or destroy antichrist, or false religion, and to make an end of the reigning power of sin (for he that committeth sin is the servant of sin and Satan) over the children of men ; and to establish his kingdom, and that righteousness that will stand forever. And that the present display of the work and power of God will increase until it is manifest to all, which must be done iu due time ; for every eye shall see him, and he will reward every man according to his deeds, and none can stand in sin or unrighteousness ; but in that righteousness which is pure and holy, even without fault before the throne of God which is obtained by grace, through faith in obedience to the truth of the everlasting gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, in denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts ; by confessing all sin and taking up the cross of Christ against the world, flesh and devil. We desire, therefore, that the chil26 THE dren of men would believe the testimony �of truth, and turn from their sins by repentance, that they might obtain the mercy of God, and salvation from sin before it be too late. �Mt.
