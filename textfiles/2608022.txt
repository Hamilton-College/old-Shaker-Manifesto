Kind words are the brightest flowers... Kind words are the brightest flowers of earth's existence; they make a very paradise of the humblest home that the world can show. Use them, and especially round the fireside circle. They are jewels beyond price, and more precious, they heal the wounded heart, and make the weighed-down spirit more glad than all the other things the world can give.
