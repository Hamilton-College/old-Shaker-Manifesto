Milk as a Preventive of White Lead Poisoning A singular fact is given in the Jouroi.nl dz Medecine with regard to the effect of the habitual use of milk in white lead works. In some French lead mills it was observed that in a large working population two men who drank much milk daily were not affected by lead. On the general use of milk throughout the works the colic vanished entirely. Each operative was given enough extra pay to buy a quart of milk a day.
