AT MIDNIGHT. By Nathan Haskell Dole. Tell me, glowing stars on high, Do I perish when I die? Or shall I be ever I? Will my spirit have rebirth And regain the things of worth When my dust returns to earth? Ye too perish, ye too fall: Flash a moment�then the pall: Is that typical of all? Boundless depths of glowing spheres, Changeless in the changing years, Seem to negative our fears. Yet your changeless is all change ! Fleeting, flying on, ye range Through the vortex vast and strange. Other creatures, other men, Cling upon you, live�and then Do they die and live again? From the New England Magazine for October.
