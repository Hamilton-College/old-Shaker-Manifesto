NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN Socrates, at an extreme old age, learned to play on musical instruments. Cato, at eighty years of age, learned the Greek language. Plutarch, when between seventy and eighty, began the study of Latin. Boccacio was thirty-five years of age when he commenced his studies in light literature ; yet he became one of the great masters of the Tuscan dialect. Sir Henry Spellman neglected the sciences in his youth, but commenced the study of them when he was between fifty and sixty years of age. After this time he became a most learned antiquarian and lawyer. Dr. Johnson applied himself to the Dutch language but a few years before his death. Ludovico Monaldesco, at the great age of one hundred and fifteen, wrote the memoirs of his own times. Ogilby, the translator of Homer and Virgil, was unacquainted with the Latin and Greek till he was past fifty. Franklin did not fully commence his philosophical pursuits till he had reached his fiftieth year.

But every one familiar with the biography of distinguished men will recollect individual cases enough to convince him that none but the sick and indolent will ever say : ' I am too old to learn.'
