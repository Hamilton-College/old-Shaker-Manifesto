AN IVY LEAF. By Annie R. Stephens. [Thoughts suggested on receiving an ivy leaf from Westminster Abbey.] As clings the ivy unto ruins old, So to my heart fond memories ever cling, Adown the aisles of years, faint, distant voices ring, I pace again that spectral silence cold, See cenotaphs and urns and arches bold. The chancel-light reveals each cloistered thing, The sacred shrine of prophet, bard and king, A treasure-house of riches manifold. And so I tread the vast sepulchral gloom, 'Mid trophies proud that chronicle high fame; The dust of kings that lies in sculptured tomb Shall vanish, and forgotten be their name ; But those who spoke for God, we all adore, For kingly souls shall live forevermore.
