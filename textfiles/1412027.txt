FOES OF LITTLE BOYS. ' BY-and-by ' is a naughty boy, Shun him at once and forever; For they who travel with ' By-and-by ' Soon come to the house of ' Never.' 'I can't' is a mean little coward; A boy that is half a man, Set on him a plucky wee terrier. That the world knows and honors� ' I can. ' ''No use in trying?'�nonsense, I say; Keep trying until you succeed; But if you should meet ' I forgot' by the way, He's a cheat, and you'd better take heed' Dont care ' and ' No matter�' boy, they're a pair, And whenever you see the poor dolts, Say 'Yes, we do care, ' and ' 'twould bea great matter, ' If our lives should be spoiled by small faults. Se eed.
