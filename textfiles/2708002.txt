My Dear Elder Henry;--Your remembrance of me in your letter... East Canterbury, N. H. June 8, 1897. My Dear Elder Henry;�Your remembrance of me in your letter to our dear Eldress pleased me more than I can tell you. Indeed, I had been intending to write you these three days past to tell you how much good I received from my interviews with you while you were here. Your interest in me is one of my most precious thoughts. I trust I may prove worthy of it. As I feel at present I can only keep thanking the good Father over and over again for all his goodness to me. What a happiness to feel one self among living souls that belong to that one true church which Jesus founded when he preached his ever memorable sermon on the Mount! I wish, dear Elder Henry, I could in some way make you understand my happiness. As the days pass, and the world and its frivolities recede to a dim remoteness, I feel that God is drawing nearer and nearer to my own heart. Believe me when I tell you I would rather fill the humblest place in the Society of Believers than to occupy the most influential pulpit in the land. Pity fills my soul when I think of those whom I have left, and who can not see as I see. I wish they could all come into my happiness. Poor blind souls! drifted about on the restless current of a world's applause, their pursuit after worldly pleasure is like a hunt after weeds and carrion. How often in their own lives they catch glimpses of their folly, but the flesh preventing them from deeper search, they struggle on without once experiencing the unspeakable happiness of seeing God. Ministers of the gospel may preach until the end of time the possibility of seeing God but not a single soul that listens to that preaching will ever enjoy the beatitude until sensuality is completely overcome. When ministers preach this doctrine, how little they themselves know of what is truly meant by seeing God ! How unwilling to pay the price of seeing Him! 01 course we all know that when we speak of seeing God we are using a figure of speech. But there are various ways of looking at the figure. I believe that in the mind of Jesus, 'seeing God' meant nothing more than the complete victory over the lower nature, a constant and daily growth of the spirit into a fuller sense of the divine, which will enable us to rise out of the body, and soar away above the lusts of the world finding no object worthy our capacities until we rest in God's own heart. Then comes the peace that can not be defined, which we would not change for all the wealth of the kingdoms of the earth combined. In accepting this view of the figure it is plain that our vision of God depends entirely upon ourselves. As we are, so is the God we see. Each time we violate the divine command, or willfully close our eyes to the light, we shift our point of vision oi' God. We know how differently sensible objects appear according to the manner in which they are viewed. The sun appears to be one thing when we view it with the naked eye, but a very different thing when we view it through the lens of a powerful telescope. So it seems to me it is with God. He is one sort of being to the soul that views Him from the sunny height of a pure heart, but a far different sort of being to the soul that views Him from the low, dark vale of sensual appetite and gratification. Is it not strange that intelligent, professing Christians, do not see this grand truth which is as plain as the noon-day sun ? If they did see it, instead of regarding our precious faith as the height of folly, and we ourselves as fanatics, they would see in our faith the ripest wisdom, and in ourselves true followers of the meek and lowly Nazarene. I think that the Master saw into the future when He said, 'Fear not little flock. In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer I have overcome the world.' Ke well knew his true followers would be a small minority. He knew how hard it would be for the natural man to discern the things of the Spirit. But tho we are a little body, misunderstood, often despised and calumniated, who of us would change that happiness we feel within, that divine guest our hearts entertain, for all the wealth and power our despisers may possess. We have a feeling towards them of pity,�a feeling voiced on the Cross of Calvary, 'Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.' Pardon me if I seem too profuse, but dear Elder Henry my heart is so full of joy that I feel I could ascend the house-tops and preach the glad tidings to all the world. 1 would that all men might see that there is something, yea, the greatest happiness obtainable in the 'despised little Nazareth.' Oh how I wish I had entered this blessed Society before any sin of the world ever stained my soul! During the years I spent in the ministry my position was that of poor blind Bartimeus by the wayside, crying, 'Lord open my eyes that I may see! ' I am firm in the belief that my petition has been heard. My being here is sufficient proof of that. We had a very helpful service last Sabbath morning. I must confess a feeling of regret stole over me each time I lookt at your vacant place. But we must not be selfish. You are doing the Master's work where you are. We know you will come back to us. What a glorious meeting that was we had when the good Sisters from Enfield were here! It took my thoughts back to the first gathering in the upper chamber at Jerusalem, and the Pentecostal descent of the Holy Spirit. May we enjoy such meetings in the future. I long to make myself useful. I want to learn everything. It will \\ quire time and patience; but it will all come. Hoping, dear Elder Henry, that you will be able to return to us soon, I remain, with much love, Yours in the Faith, Thomas A. Dwyer.
