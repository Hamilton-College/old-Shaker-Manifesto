OUR DEAR J. M. PEEBLES A communication from this Christ Apostle, we are only sorry to say, came too late for this number; but like every thing from him, it is so good, it will keep until we next appear. Our April number -will reach him in Yucatan, among the ruins of Central America, where, we have long been aware, these have had an attraction for him. Wherever he goes, he works for God; and let every heart lift an offering in his behalf. Here's an excerpt from his genial letter to us: * 'How the days, months, years glide by! The Centennial is close upon us. And while our Civil Government is preparing for a grand opening in early summer, should it be forgotten by Believers that it is a hundred years that Ann Lee, the baptized of Christ — Ann Lee, guided by revelation — by vision—by Angel Hosts, landed in this country and established the Millennial Church of purity, peace and 'all things in common ?' And should there be no mass gathering —no public recognition of this Centennial cycle by the body of Believers? '
