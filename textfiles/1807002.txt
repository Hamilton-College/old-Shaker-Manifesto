EXPERIENCE. Abraham Perkins. Experience teaches that the earth is glutted with the wiles of Satan, crowded into every public and private way, in all the walks of life, in the palace and in the hovel, in our courts of misnamed justice, in Church and in State, and all humanity encounters them. The pathway of life abounds with snares and traps ; to escape them, requires wisdom, adroitness and eternal vigilance. Varied are their conditions and aspects, and varied the degree of their mischievous character. We meet them in sunshine and in shade ; oft in form hidden or masked, and again open and clear to vision ; the latter equally perilous as the former, as from the absence of the show of disguise, the tendency is to remove suspicion where danger is near, thus eluding the trusting traveler when he should be the most wary. We are often meeting in life individuals, with whom at every interview an introduction is required and a study of their character necessary to be able to discern their moods ; otherwise we come to loggerheads. The movements and manners of yesterday are by no means accepted and borne by them to-day. The language of yesterday, however well accepted, is not adapted to the mood of to-day. If yesterday our eyes were open and we looked up, to-day they must be closed or we must look down. Yesterday, if it were the most agreeable thing to advance, to-day, the course must be reversed. Really, to steer through life free from some annoyances, without some friction is an impossibility and beyond the power of human acquisition. We either are subjecs to be trodden upon or to tread upon the heels of others. A degree of attrition, when under perfect control, may work advantageously by opening the eyes of the blind, enabling them to discover imperfections which otherwise than through sufferings would not be discerned. 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.' Prov. xxix., 18. The light of truth alone gives progress ; and ray added to ray and beam to beam will ultimately bring in the revelation and blaze of the principles and the glory of the millennium. Conspicuous among the golden rules of Christian life is the following:ï¿½ ' Neither give nor take offense.' This principle sustained, peace, love and union is the result, from which development, growth and progress will legitimately follow. Enfield, N. H.
