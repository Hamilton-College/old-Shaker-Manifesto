FORETHOUGHT New Year's Gift. I'll write it on the snowy page That now before me lies ; I'll blend it with the roaming themes That to my vision rise. I'll call it when emotions swell, To check their flowing tide ; I'll wear it as a gift of God, To humble all my pride. I'll bring it as a helping hand, Wherever need is found; I'll sow it as a precious seed Upon the holy ground. I'll prize it as parental love, To keep regret afar; To bless the harvest of the year, And be its ruling star. I'll wrap my spirit in its light. That darkness may not come, I'll hold it as a motto bright, Within my sacred home. C. Devyr, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
