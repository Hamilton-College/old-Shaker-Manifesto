Beloved Editor; I yield to a very... Harvard, Mass. 1885. Beloved Epitor;- -I yield to a very pleasing inclination to congratulate you, and co-laborers, on your successful efforts to keep our little white sail afloat on the great sea of human affairs. This flag of truce, extends an invitation to fraternize with all loyal fidelity to human love, and happiness in the many bannered crafts that float upon time's sea. They are no longer satisfied ' with skimmed milk here, with a promise of cream in the clouds. ' This beautiful green earth is no longer a curse, but a blessing, made to be, and to make happy in. Mother Ann said, ' If I possessed the whole world, I would turn it all into joyfulness. ' True religion unites, and makes happy, all who ' cease to do evil, and learn to (be and) do good, ' and do it. May the good angels, and earth's best spirits be your helpers So hopes and prays your abiding Brother. Elijah Myrick.
