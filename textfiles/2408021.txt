Enfield, N. H. July, 1894. As our tribute for the coming Manifesto, we will give a brief account of what we were privileged to witness, as a 'Sunday School Offebing,' on July 8th, designated as 'Children's Day.' THE MANIFESTO. 193 In the eai-ly evening the members of the Society gathered to our place of worship. Soon notes from an organ were heard in the distance, as a signal for the school. Thirty-two in number entered the room, dressed in white, marching and singing the piece, 'Sheltered in the fold of Christ, Blessed is thy portion.' They formed ranks in front of the audience, giving at the close of singing an appropriate Scripture response, with such an impressive opening that we felt sure of a very profitable and enjoyable season. A dialogue having for its theme 'The Better Choice,' was marked as giving practical lessons. The characters were Life, Youth, Pleasure, Fame, and Religion. Life presented its many phases to youth, while pleasure brought roses, fame a crown, and religion a cross of evergreen. The points made by each character were so realistic, we all felt that we, too, could join in the closing chorus: 'Rejoice, rejoice, with heart and voice For thou hast made the Better Choice.' Another exercise, entitled The Tree of Spiritual Blessings was enjoyed by all; a miniature evergreen bore cards upon its branches with names of the desired gifts, so as each one expressed their grenttst need, whether it chanced to be Joy, Longsuffering, Gentleness, Patience, or Purity, it was freely dispensed. It was calculated to teach what every young Christian will do well to learn. Recitations by the younger children were all nicely rendered and if a word of commendation has its proper effect, t'.iey will strive still more to profit by their instructions, for they were given by both beloved Elder Henry C. Blinn, and Eldress Eliza Stratton who graced the occasion with their presence. Right here I will say that Sisters, Mary Ella Briggs and Fannie Fallon, had the direct charge of these classes and proved themselves faithful and efficient workers for the young of the flock. After singing a piece entitled 'The Flower Land' the service closed by the reciting of a prayer in unison. This will be a bright spot on the memory of both actors and listeners and an incentive to every youthful mind, to purer and nobler aims. Julia Russell. North. Family. July, 1804. The July Manifesto with its radiant, illuminating light, citing thought to the goodness of the Infinite and our work toward the finite, we regard of great worth. From any one of its testimonial pages could be gathered substance enough tj flood society with lessons of holiness, if we would only 'take thought' about the wandering souls shunning the halo of moral persuasion, mindful only of the glitter of personal pleasure and of accumulating private property. True, 'love is the power that must break every yoke' that retards moral growth, that stimulates selfishness, preferring to sit in a chair of ease in the shade of lukewarmness, than to labor in 'the fields white with rije blossoms' that should be garnered to add strength and goodness to our home. As the sun draws moisture to the clouds and the clouds water the earth, so with us, love should be the power to cause us not only to absorb the good about us, but prompt us to give generously of what we have gained in the development of a Christ-like nobility. Our social visit with our Gloucester, Me. kindred, Eldress Lizzie Noyes and Sister Sirena Douglass, was fruitful of pleasantness, with the interchange of thought that cheers. 'Giving hope to the fainting, To the sorrowing joy.' Preserving of early berries, with the general routine of household work, engages the Sisters' time, while caring for farm duties, haying etc., occupies the Brethren. Thus the united help of all in things temporal, with as concentrated a zeal in 194 THE MANIFESTO. the moral welfare of each other, become the strong arms of salvation that saves souls from the stream of worldliness, whose polluting current seeks to draw the soul from the divine lovliness of Christian service.
