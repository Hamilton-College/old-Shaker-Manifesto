How vast, incomprehensibly vast, the loss of life by war... How vast, incomprehensibly vast, the loss of life by war! And how immense the loss of property by war�of life, that is so precious�of property, that is so indispensable to the enjoyment and usefulness of life! But there is an unspeakably greater loss than this with which war is also chargeable. I refer to the damage which morals and religion suffer from it. All I need add, on this point, is that the power of war to demoralize the world, and to corrupt the purest religion in the world, is abundantly manifest, in the fact that the moral and religious sense of even good men is not shocked by war. No stronger argument can be brought against war than the fact of its power to conform the morals and religion of the world to war, Messenger of Peace. Gerrit Smith.
