TRUE EDUCATION. GBANVILLE TEMPLE SPROAT. The collective end of human life, and of all education is the attainment of the good, the use of the true, and the fruition of the beautiful, regarding these as manifestations of divine being,- -revelatory isymbols of God. These alone, sought in the ways of right, and crowned, at their goals, with the prerogatives of power, can make us really noble and blessed. Truth, good, and beauty are the divine philters, given by the infinite Lover to souls masquerading here in the flesh, to make them love Him. The effect of these potions is sanity, serenity, incorruptible blessed- ness. We then begin clearly to see that all outward things are but masks, and forms, which serve as symbols to convey to our intelligence and affection communications of power, wisdom, and love? from the infinite One. All that appears to sense is the speech of God ; all that is, to spirit, is the meaning of that speech. But to earn by toil, to receive by grace any valuable boon, it is a preliminary necessity that we become personally conscious of our want of it. As soon as we begin to feel sharply our defects, and covet the possible supply, the path of progressive attainment opens before us, and our energies are strong to their appointed tasks. A story is told of an Eastern king who had a lovely daughter, idolized by him, but blind from her birth. She had grown up to maidenhood, and been kept sedulously ignorant of her great misfortune. One day, an old sage came to the court, who promised the king that he would give his child her sight. But he declared it to be indispensable that she should first become conscious of her blindness, that she might intelligently co-operate in the needful process. The king sought to prepare her. 'My child' he said, 'you know that your feet are to walk with ; your hands to touch with ; your ears 'o hear with ; your nose to smell with ; your tongue to taste with ; but others can also see, while you are blind.' 'Blind, father,' she a.ked, in wonder; 'what is that?' 'My child, ' he added, ' what do you think your eyes were made for?' 'Oh,' she replied, ' when my heart is full, the tears always come into my eyes ; and that I suppose is what they are for.' With the tenderest painstaking, the king and the sage succeeded in awakening in her the consciousness of her defect; and at length, to her unspeakable astonishment and delight, vision was given her. This principle holds true for all the multitudes of the world. While the vain, the prond, the insensible, impoverished and blinded by their incompetent self-sufficiency, remain unblessed, the modest seekers, and suppliants, who clearly feel their own deficiencies, are enriched, more and more, with the choicest blessings of heaven. The devout comrade of nature, and lover of men, whose heart and imagination have been touched by a mystic feeling of the Infinite, hungers and thirsts after God, weeps in solitude over his inner poverty and loneliness, seeks for God through long years of darkness and sorrow, and finally, reaches that experience of the divine fellowship, whose peace is deeper than plummet of thought ever sounded, whose bliss is higher than hint of language can reach. This condition opens to us all the heights and depths of immensity and eternity. It is the sole key to those transcendent marvels of experience, of which such strange hints glimpse out at us, in the writings of the Mystics. For the human soul is a centre of being which opens, outwardly, into the illimitableness of the material creation, and inwardly, into the spiritual boundlessness of God. But, to become what we are meant to be, to grasp the noblest possibilities of our state and lot, and make them real, in living fruition, we must emancipate our spiritual faculties from every enslavement of hatred, every constriction of dead habit, every fetter of fear and live in this universe of God, as fresh observers and worshipers. The h'rst lesson to be learned, in reaching this conclusion, is docility. A vital and watchful docility is the one virtue for every pupil in the school of life, preliminary to all the other virtues. It is the highroad of advancement towards every'perfection. The difficulty of acquiring and keeping this spirit, the precious fruits it yields, and the fatal penalties of its failure, constitute a lesson, in its whole extent not one man out of a million appreciates. How many painters, singers, preachers, writers, there are, whose productions at fifty or sixty, are no better than they were at thirty or forty.. It cannot be that they had so .early reached perfection. And how many gifted, ambitious persons there are, whose one fatal fault is, unwillingness to take what they feel to be the humiliating attitude of docility before others, and learn from them what they need. There is a story among the Hebraic traditions�a little ethical apologue� about one Peter, a poor ignorant teamster, who, dissatisfied with his hard life of drudgery, prayed that he might be allowed the comfort of a walk in Paradise. An angel appeared, and offered to grant his wish, if he would promise to study with docility whatever he saw there, and to utter no criticism or censure ! Accepting the terms, he joyfully accompanied his guide. The first thing he noticed was that the houses of the inhabitants were made of transparent gems. 'Why,' ho exclaimed, 'this is a great defect; there can be no privacy ; you are all exposed to public gaze,' The angel, with a slight frown and a warning finger, replied, 'They who are free from sin and guile, need no concealment. The glory of God is rather in exhibiting', than in hiding. ' (TO BE CONTINUED.)
