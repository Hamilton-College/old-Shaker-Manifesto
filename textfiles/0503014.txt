FIRE Since our form was made up, there has occurred, in the centre, or Church Family, at Mt. Lebanon — on February 6 — the greatest and most destructive fire ever experienced by Believers. Eight buildings — dwelling-house, Sisters' shop and wood-house combined, icehouse, storehouse, barn, cart-house, cider mill, gas-house and shed, entirely consumed. Two other buildings, with their contents, damaged. Total loss estimated at $100,000. Pittsfield, eight miles distant, was telegraphed and sent fire brigade, with engine and 1,000 feet hose, which came through in fiftyfive minutes, and did good service in extinguishing the fire. The neighbors turned out in mass. The Tildens came in force, bringing a good supply of fire extinguishers, with parties to use them. To all, we tender our grateful acknowledgments, for aid and sympathy. Young George Tilden was efficient in saving the infirmary. To H. A. Tilden, Marvin Sacket and H. Whiting, we are indebted for valuable suggestions in saving other buildings, especially the Meeting House. INCIDENTS AND ACCIDENTS. Elders Daniel Boler and Daniel Grossman, both injured. Andrew Barett, collar bone broken. Eldress Harriet Gooodwin was barely saved by being taken, by ladder, from an upper window. No insurance — internal or external — the loss presses heavy upon the whole Order. Prompt payment of debts due to Shakers, would much relieve.
