EZRA SHERMAN Thomas Schroyer We have received a copy of 'The Harrison News,' in which we find a notice of the death of our Brother at White Water, Ohio, published by his friend, ANOTHER PIONEEE C3-OISTE_ 'Death has again visited our Community, and claimed for its victim one of our most honored and respected citizens,â€”Ezra Sherman. None knew him but to love him. During the three months of his sickness, we visited him a number of times. On our first visit he seemed delighted that we called. He said, Thomas, I am glad you came to see me : I wanted to see you and talk with you. I may get well, but I think not. I am old and willing to go. ***** Don't pay any attention to creeds, but live right. Do right, and when you are called to enter the great hereafter, you will have nothing to regret. For several days preceding his death he had a presentiment that he should die at nine o'clock, A. M., the same hour that he was born, and sure enough, on Sunday morning, as the hour hand reached the hour of nine, his spirit took its flight.'
