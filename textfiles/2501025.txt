North Family Dec. 1894. I am writing a few Notes for The Manifesto, trusting they will be acceptable. What a beautiful little book it is. We all look forward to its coming with a great deal of pleasure. You can hear on all sides, 'Has The Manifesto come yet?' we are all so eager to receive it. We have had a bountiful crop this year, excepting corn which yielded only a little more than half a crop on account of the drought; still we are not complaining, as God our Father, will amply provide for us all. At the Center family, they have just completed drilling an old well near the cow-barn. After working at it for several days and drilling down over one hundred feet, they at last struck water. They intend to put in a new wind-mill as a much needed necessity, for they were compelled to drive their cows to the creek for water. We send our love to all in our Zion homes. What beautiful words those are. O.ir Zion homes. Not for one, but for all. We wish you a merry Christmas and a hiippy New Year. Charles R. Dixon
