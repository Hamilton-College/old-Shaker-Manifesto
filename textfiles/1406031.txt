IN MEMORY OF CHARLOTTE BUTTERFIELD. Appropriately it can be said; Keep silent daughter of frivolity for death is in that chamber. Startle not with echoing sound the strangely solemn peace, Death is here in spirit, watcher of a marble corpse. Death, new tenant of the house pervadeth all the fabric, he watcheth at the head and standeth at the feet, and hideth in the caverns of the breast. 0 Death, again so soon thou hast tarried here, greedily thou art snatching from our homes those in whom we love, trust and confide. Ah Death, thou art reminding us often of cur destiny, each one of us must sooner or later, meet thce, therefore, how essential it is for us to work while the day lasts, for the night will surely come when no one can work. Every day brings us nearer to thee. Weaie being prompted while in thy presenee to live the Christian life more perfectly, to be loving and kind, to be watchful, prayerful, forgiving and forbearing, more humble and charitable, more respectful and agreeable to all, more willing to suffer for Christ's sake, and do unto others as we would be done by in every respect, and be in reality, more selfdenying, to strive daily to be peaceful and condescending, to do all in our power to make those happy by whom we are surrounded. Dear Sister, where will we look for thee now that thou art shrouded in death? Hast thou reached that blissful haven of rest of which we hear so much? We must now say farewell, deeply feeling that we miss thee ! Thy faithfulness in duty, thy generous disposition and forgiving spirit, thy consecrated life and zeal for the cause cannot be forgotten.
