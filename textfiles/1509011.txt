Dear Friend, I was much pleased... Mount Lebanon, N. Y. July, 1885. Dear Friend,�I was much pleased to receive your letter of the 25th. which came through in six days. It is exceedingly agreeable to our feelings to see your desires reaching upward in the direction of the only normal and proper growth of the human spirit and intelligence, toward the ever increasing light of purity, and source of all true life and happiness. I do not know if there ever was a time in the world's history that the minds of men were more ready and anxious to receive light than at present. And God has provided the light required in those who walk in His commandments. I mean the light of the spirit of immortality. Our faith and practice is based upon the conviction that human beings are accountable for the light they receive, and that no one is justified before God who does not obey or put in practice all the light given them. Only those who walk in the light, can long see clearly, and only those who see clearly can reason correctly from truthful premises to sound conclusions. Hence I believe that only those who live the true life, can teach from that life, can have the doctrine which imparts life to its receivers, only such are effective and safe teachers. All others are as it were, only reflectors, if they shed any light, or parrot like repeaters by rote or memory, or teachers oi errors which must be unlearned, before the true light can shine in and set the soul at liberty. No soul is really free, who cannot approximate in practice to his highest ideal of truth and purity, and clearest convictions of right and duty. And before one can be set at liberty, there must first be a consciousness of bondage or servitude to inferior desires and habits ; next, a desire awakened sufficiently strong, to enable him to work success; fully for emancipation. Then spirits who have gained emancipation, both in the body and out, spirits who have risen to a higher level, can aid him according to the earnestness and sincerity of his efforts. The proverb says ' Steep and craggy is the path of the gods.' What! a plurality of gods ? Yea, all are gods in a limited sense, in whom the spirit of God rules with undivided sway. They are the lineal offspring of God, who dwells in them, and molds all their character and conduct. � Well, what of all this? Why, those who travel this path find it roughest and toughest at the beginning or initial end only, for though ' hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise,' the summit is crowned with illimitable fields of beauty and glory, where all talents can be made useful, where all Godly graces and virtues flourish, where no mar nor imperfection, nor stain of corruption, nor alloy of selfishness, nor vexation, nor trouble can come. '' Obedience to law must precede the ripening of the soul.' Hence though they wander ten thousand years in the boundless wilderness of nature, o'er bog, or fen, or desert wastes, or through enchanting scenes of beauty, wealth and fame, and all things delightful to the animal man, but which perish with the march of time, that hill or mountain of self-denial and self-conquest they must climb before they can rest from the weariness of toil, or gain that treasure of goodness within which alone can feed immortal desires, or liberate and perfect those highest attributes of the intelligent spirit, the free and proper exercise of which alone can bring the joy of contentment aad everlasting peace. Would to God that all could realize the conviction of this. They would be in haste to begin the work of casting off the clogs of earthly desires, that they might ascend light and free to the celestial p^ins above. Do not think these views speculative, nor rhapsodic, for they are partly testimony of experience, or plain inference from that which has been tested. Man's ideal of the happiness and peace to be enjoyed in the community order of life, where the talents of the strong and skillful are consecrated to God, and the shelter and uplifting of the weaker and less happily endowed brother or sister, is but a foreshadowing of the Real, which we believe is fast approaching through the honest, well directed labors of earnest toilers for a better hope. If you have doubts or questions to solve in relation to the whys and wherefores of our faith and practice, we are ready to try to remove the one, or solve the other as the case may be. Believing you will not fail to find, according to the earnestness and persistency of your seeking, and hoping your example may draw others to the better way, I will close by subscribing myself thine fraternally for the truth and higher life.
