BEATITUDES AND REWARDS O. PRENTISS Variety is universal law. Variety in harmony is the desideratum. The nine Beatitudes are all well — their Rewards well — well for such as seek rewards. One of the nine — the sixth — fills my eye. I'd take it for my portion, minus rewards. Among the seraphim and cherubim — feminine and masculine angels — of the more advanced heavens, the pure in heart oeatitude is transparently pre-eminent. We ask no more.
