An old teamster of fifty years' experience... An old teamster of fifty years' experience says he has never had a case of the galls upon his animals where the following preventive was adopted, which was simply to rub the collars inside every few days with a little neatsf oot oil, and the moment any dirt was found sticking like wax to wash it off with warm soapsuds, and then oil. A yoke from oxen, or collar from a horse should not be removed when brought into the stable from work until the sweat is entirely dry, and all chafed spots should be oiled.
