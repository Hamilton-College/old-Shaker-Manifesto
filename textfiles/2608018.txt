TRUTH. By Nellie Hamlin. Solomon counselled his son, 'Let not mercy and truth forsake thee.' Wise counsel for the present time. It is very easy to say, and equally easy to think that we will live and speak only that which is true. The teachings of our childhood have been such as tended to develop faculties of honesty. But as we come to an age when we must choose the right and the wrong for ourselves, we learn, and often by sad experiences, that there are many things in life to tempt from the sacred path of duty and virtue. We then realize the value of our early instruction, and the necessity of self-imposed rules for discipline and culture. Truth should be the crown of the Christian; his defence in battle; his shield in danger; a covert from the tempests of earthly strife, and a friend above all other friends. N'o natural talent can take the place of a simple and truthful expression in word and deed. Blessings attend thee, O spirit of Truth! Thou art a royal diadem, Be thou the guardian of my youth! In every hour my steps attend. At thy pure shrine my soul shall bow As youthful days roll on; To thee I pay my humble vow, Through thee tossing the conqueror's song. Harvard, Mass.
