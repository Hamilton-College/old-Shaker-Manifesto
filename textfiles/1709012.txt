Dear children: The wages of sin is... Enfield, Conn., 1887. Dear Children:- -k-The wages of sin is death.' Sin hardens the heart, darkens the conscience, and leads away from the love of good. Many desire the pleasures of sin but not its punishment. The law of retribution is inevitable ; if you cin you must pay the! penalty. Every act reacts on the actor. Consider the consequences of sin and shun the beginning of it. Sin, if not subdued, grows from bad to worse. Living in sin blights the spirit. Die to sin. Bad habits are vile weeds. Shuu them ever. Oue sin subdued brings joy to the soul. Each victory will help you some other to win. Watchfulness is a safeguard against sin. Watch all the time. Resolutely turn from all deceit and wrong, and do just as nearly what you know to be right as possible. Wrong is no less wrong because you may think it a little item. You are developing your characters by the lives you live, and by the thoughts you indulge. Soon the fruit will appear. Tares produce poisonous fruit. wt Walking the path of death and sin yields naught but pain and grief within.' Sin cannot be too faithfully fought against and resisted. While your day lasts guard well your hearts that no evil shall grow therein. Say to the tempter ' Get thee hence.' Close your minds to thoughts that soil the life ; your souls to impressions that may destroy your happiness. Practice virtue and vice will be hateful. If temptation insists, persist in resisting. Sinful by-paths are alluring. Beware. When you are tempted to do wrong, keep your promise and be strong. Your brother, Daniel Orcutt.
