DEATH. MARY WHITCHER. We do not speak of death With careless air; But with a reverence And Christian care. Although we live to die And die to live, As was the Savior's word. Our life we give. For whoso saves the first, The sinful life,. Must forfeit higher claims.ï¿½ The Christian strife. Canterbury, N. H.
