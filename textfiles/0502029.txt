MANIFESTATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY, DR. SLADE Dear Banner: Gotham is being stirred to its very centre by Spiritualism. The following is taken from the Daily Graphic: ' The interest in so-called 'Spiritual manifestations ' which has been developed by the course of the Daily Graphic in regard to the matter is rapidly growing. The Herald, following, as it is wont to do, the example of the Daily Graphic, recently sent a reporter to Chittenden, whom the Eddys, however, declined to admit to their seances. The Sun has lately been publishing a large quantity of letters on the subject; and at Elder Evans' Shalier Conventionlast night, the greater part of the conversation was on the subject of Spiritualism. The matter is in a fair way to be thoroughly investigated at last, and we are sincerely sorry that, so far asthe Chittenden manifestations are concerned, the Herald has been deprived of an opportunity to test their genuineness.' Elder Evans also gave the allopathic doctors grape and canister, and ventilated class-legislating, quack doctor, no diploma, ecclesiastical medical inquisitional bill, and the Albany Legislature for having passed the star chamber act. He held his immense audience at Steinway Hall spell-bound for nearly two hours. God and good spirits bless Elder Evans for his brave words, say I. 'Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.' Principles and not men, universality, not individuality. This is not Dr. Dake's nor mediums' funeral, it is the people's. And. if such innovations upon civil liberty are not frowned down by the people, we will sooner or later have cause to regret our indifference and 'masterly inactivity.''â€”Banner.
