FOR THE MANIFESTO. MY HOPES. Maude Wentworth. I have hopes of a happier future, Hopes for a brighter day ; When the sunshine will once more gather Around my lonely way. I have hopes for the land of Canaan, Hopes for that beautiful shore; Where with all my sorrows ended, I shall rest forevermore. I have hopes of a sure redemption, In the mystical by and by; I shall soar to beautiful mansions In the kingdom of God on high. I know that the great hereafter, Will be everlasting day ; [garden And the flowers that bloom in God's Fairer than those of May.
