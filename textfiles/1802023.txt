How Long to Sleep A prolonged and severe exertion, whether of brain or muscle, requires a correspondingly lengthy or deep repose. Sleep is the state in which the bodily fires are damped down and the machinery has an opportunity for cooling. The bow is unstrung to recover its elasticity during the recurring periods of slumber. The great point is to secure what Bichat characterized as general sleep. The whole body should be rested, so far as any avoidable demands on its energy is concerned. The Irishman who explained that a short sleep did for him because when he slept he 'paid attention to 't,'ï¿½ uttered a truth in his witticism. If sleep be thorough, then a short spell will do more good than a much longer period that is incomplete and imperfect. On general principles we may sleep all we can, unless we are lazy, then sleep less. The active, wide awake, energetic, go ahead people rarely sleep too long. We cannot tamper with the striking movement of a clock without injuring it, and we cannot tamper with orderly recurrence of sleep without impairing the very constitution of things on which the orderly performance of that function depends.
