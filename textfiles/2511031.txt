In Memoriam Sister Caroline Downs. By Orren Beaver. Another brave spirit has laid aside the garments of mortality to join the ranks of the pure in heart. Our Sister has spent a long life of devoted toil and consecration, to sustain the cause she loved so well. The many cheerful testimonies of loving friends in whose hearts her bright example will ever remain enshrined will attest her true worth far more than the costliest monument. For more than ninety-one years she had resided in our beautiful valley home, giving her whole being to the cause without reserve. Many years of her early life were spent at the North family and in the order of Elders. Sister Caroline entered the work with full purpose of heart, bravely to endure all crosses she might meet on the way. How well she kept those early vows is best known to those who had the pleasure of an acquaintance with her gentle, lovicg ^piiit and in tie pnhig of wise counsel to those who were young in the faith ministering to the sick and needy, charitable in all her dealings, sowing the seeds of purity and Christian virtue in all her intercourse with others. She was truly a mother in Israel. Angel choirs will chant the glad refr.tin through the shining corridors of heaven; Welcome, thrica welcome, to thy future home above. Shakers, N. Y.
