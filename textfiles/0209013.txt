Pruning Apple Trees BY F. W. EVANS Trimming these so that they shall bear the largest quantity of fruit, other things being equal, is good economy. Professor Mapes once stated to me that he trimmed pear trees so closely and scientifically, as to insure each fruit bud, a blossom; and each blossom, a pear. That is the principle. Look at a young apple tree, begining with the trunk, and ask yourself, how many of these largest size limbs does that tree require ? It has six ; 3^011 take out three or four, for two or three main limbs springing from the trunk, will make a tree. Is it well balanced ? Then look at each one of those main limbs, just as you looked at the tree; and see how many of its largest limbs you can take out. Do the same by the next size branches. And, if your tree is still too thick, follow the same plan, trim the next size, until nothing remains on the tree that may not blossom without waste, and bear fruit without there being any to drop off. Your apple tree will then be neither full of poles, trimmed up to make room for them; nor yet so crowded, that it spends its forces in blossoms that cannot set fruit; nor in setting fruit that can never ripen.
