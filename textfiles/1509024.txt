LETTER BOX Dear Cora, I am glad to have the.... Shaker Village, Mer. Co., N. H. June, 1885. Dear Coea :�I am glad to have the pleasure of writing a few lines. I am going to try to get my lessons so that I can have a Summer ride. I hope my report will be good. I hope I can go to walk sometime, it is so pleasant to go to walk. I am going to try to talk gently while at my work. The flowers are very pretty. I set in type that motto you told us about in 'The Manifesto.' I liked it last evening very much. I am glad I have got a little flower bed. I like to take care of flowers. I should like to get 100 in all my lessons. I should be glad if I could. Sister Marcia said she would like to hear how I was getting along in school sometimes so I shall tell her. I don't know as I can think of much more, but after all I have a few more lines to write. I like my flower bed very much, I think it is very pretty. I hope it wont rain this evening if it does then I cannot go out and see about it. I should like to set another piece after I get that one done that I am doing. I hope I can have one next week. I shall try to get all my lessons next week. After I finish this letter I shall take my Arithmetic. I wish I could write a longer letter. I have tried to keep my motto. Your little, Daisy Cook. THE BROOM. I have thought that this useful article was quite undervalued because of its commonness and yet how soon we should discover its loss should we occupy a room void of this article. I have learned that the word broom was first given to a kind of short bushy shrub which grew in India, finally it became the custom to gather this broom and tie it together to use for sweeping purposes. It is of the leguminous species because it bears a legume or pod which is divided into two divisions or valves having the seeds attached to one suture like the pea pod. More recently broom corn lias become more popular and is used quite extensively. It is a tall reed with jointed stem, the head only being used for brooms. I have read that Dr. Franklin planted a single seed in this country which he took from a whisk of broom corn in England and from it have sprung all the broom corn plants that have been raised in this country. The plant that is most commonly cultivated is nearly twice the height of an ordinary man and resembles Indian corn very closely but the head or brush from which brooms are made is much larger than that of Indian corn. It bears no ear, the seed being all on the brush, but these seeds have to be taken off before it can be used and quite frequently they are given as food to horses and poultry. The handles are made of several kinds of wood. Mary Ellen King. Dear Teacher Jeannette Forest: As you feel very anxious... Shaker Village, Mer. Co., N. H May, 1885. Dear Teacher, Jeannette Fokest :�As you feel very anxious and interested to know that we are becoming good writers and nice composers I thought of telling you a little story about elephants. I have read that the elephant is the largest and most awkward of land animals they are about eight feet high. The 'Young Folks' Encyclopedia' says that they become full grown when about thirty years old, and they sometimes live from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty years. The head of the elephant is very large but they have very short necks, they could not reach to eat or drink without the aid of their trunks. In the picture their trunks look to be about four or five feet long. The food that they live mostly upon is vegetables, leaves, grass and roots. Their tusks are made of ivory covered with a hard enamel. Elephants are found in Central Africa. I have heard that the Arabs are the principle hunters. They sometimes kill over seventy a day. They generally do their hunting on foot and towards noontime. They do their hunting at this time because the elephant wishes to lie down to rest. This is all I learned from the story, but I hope some day to compose and write as nicely as you do. Ever your sister, Celia A. Havens.
