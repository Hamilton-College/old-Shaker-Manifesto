Dear Teacher Jeannette Forest: As you feel very anxious... Shaker Village, Mer. Co., N. H May, 1885. Dear Teacher, Jeannette Fokest :ï¿½As you feel very anxious and interested to know that we are becoming good writers and nice composers I thought of telling you a little story about elephants. I have read that the elephant is the largest and most awkward of land animals they are about eight feet high. The 'Young Folks' Encyclopedia' says that they become full grown when about thirty years old, and they sometimes live from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty years. The head of the elephant is very large but they have very short necks, they could not reach to eat or drink without the aid of their trunks. In the picture their trunks look to be about four or five feet long. The food that they live mostly upon is vegetables, leaves, grass and roots. Their tusks are made of ivory covered with a hard enamel. Elephants are found in Central Africa. I have heard that the Arabs are the principle hunters. They sometimes kill over seventy a day. They generally do their hunting on foot and towards noontime. They do their hunting at this time because the elephant wishes to lie down to rest. This is all I learned from the story, but I hope some day to compose and write as nicely as you do. Ever your sister, Celia A. Havens.
