Again in this beautiful grove... Again in this beautiful grove, We have met for our annual feast, And thither the angels haye come, To bless, and our joy to increase. Loved Parents our welcome shall feel; Our measure is flll'd with pure love, And thankfully here we shall pledge Our spirits in union to move. We ask of the treasures you bear, To strengthen each covenant made; Then, every effort for good, Shall be with a blessing repaid. Fannie Tyson
