Arrival of elder Evans and his companions... Arrival of ELDER EVANS and His Companion in Glasgow on their Trip Abroad. We have received the following: To the Albany Journal:- -We have received letters from Elder F. W. Evans and brother James M. Peebles, giving an account of the voyage across the Atlantic, and their reception in Glasgow. It is some seventeen 3'ears since the elder, in company with J. M. Peebles, visited Great Britain. At that time they held a large number of meetings and sowed a good deal of Sha :er seed, which they are now cultivating, and we are in hopes of reaping a harvest in due time. Shakerism is not of such a fascinating character as to easily draw natural people to it. A daily cross and a life of virgin purity, with the crucifixion of the old man with all his affec- iions and lusts, is not very inviting, except to those whom the spirit has touched. It is very rare for people to move out of their old tracks until necessity drives them. Our ranks have been made up in some degree by those who felt the need of something to eat and a place to live. However, it is a poor gospel indeed if the soul and the future a' e all that are to be ministered to, leaving the bodily needs of the present life to take care of themselves. One of the greatest inducements of Shakerism is that the Shaker gospel gives all enough to eat and wear, and a place to live. A good wholesome meal and a nice clean bed is a mighty testimony to reach the hearts of some of the children of men; and sometimes through these means we enter the wedge that separates them from the world and lets the light of Christ into their souls. We expect that before long the mission of Shakerism to Great Britain will he consummated by the establishment of Shaker societies in England and Scotland, and be a sort of recruiting station for our societies in America. The English government has now progressed so far that the Shaker order will be welcome there. Respectfully, Daniel Offord.
