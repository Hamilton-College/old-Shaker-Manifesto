CHARACTER MORE THAN REPUTATION Keep straight ahead. The curve line may be the line of beauty, but it is better to be able to walk a crack than describe a circle. The man who can walk in a straight line may be all right, but he who can only walk in a cycloid curve is assuredly all wrong. This injunction concerning your physical peregrination applies as well to your spiritual itineracy. Are you slandered ? Keep straight on in your course and let backbiting die the death of neglect. What is the use of lying awake nights brooding over the remarks of some false friend, that runs through your brain like lightning ? What is the use of getting into a worry and fret over gossip that has been set afloat to your disadvantage by some meddlesome busybody who has more time than character ? The thing cannot possibly injure you, unless indeed you take notice of it, and in combating it give it standing and character. If what is said about you is true, set yourself right; if it is false, let it pass for what it is worth. If a bee sting you, would you go to the hive to destroy it ? Would not a thousand come upon you ? It is wisdom to say little respecting the injuries you have received. We are generally losers in the end if we stop to refute all the backbiting and gossipping we may hear by the way. They are annoying, it is true ; but not dangerous, so long as we do not stop to expostulate and scold. Our characters are formed and sustained by ourselves, by our own actions and purposes, and not by others. Value what you know of yourself more than what others may think of you. Character is more than reputation, and the approval of your own honest conscience is a thousand fold more valuable than the commendation of a community. But you can have both. Live for God's approval and your own proper commendation, and that of your friends will urely follow.â€”Christian at Work.
