Eulogium Sister Lucy Mclntosh. who, by natural death! left this, for the second phase of life, at the mature age of ninty-one years, was one of the very Jew remaining, whose identity with the society dates with its earliest history. Her steadfast, devoted, and unselfish life, gave potency to her wise precepts; she preached by example. Important positions of care and trust have been honoured by her integrity, intelligence and fidelity. To those who knew her, she needed no other eulogy than her whole life. E. M.
