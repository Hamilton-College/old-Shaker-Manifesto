LOOK UP, NOT DOWN Life to some is full of sorrow, Half is real, half they borrow; Full of rocks and full of ledges, Corners sharp and cutting edges, Though the joy-bells may be ringing, Not a song you'll hear them singing; Seeing never makes them wise, Looking out from downcast eyes. All in vain the sun is shining, Waters sparkling, blossoms twining : They but see, through these same sorrows, Sad to-days and worse to-morrows. See the clouds that must pass over; See the weeds among the clover, Everything and anything But the gold the sunbeams bring. Drinking from the bitter fountain, Lo ! your mole-hill seems a mountain. Drops of dew and drops of rain Swell into the mighty main. All in vain the blessings shower, And the mercies fall with power, Gathering chaff, ye tread the wheat, liich and royal, 'neath your feet. Let it not be so, my neighbor; Look up, as you love and labor, STot for one alone, woe's vials : Every one has cares and trials. Joy and pain are linked together, Like the fair and cloudy weather, Slay we have, oh, let us pray, Faith and patience for to-day. The Catholic.
