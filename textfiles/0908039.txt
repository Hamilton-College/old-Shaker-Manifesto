REST Father Ryan My feet are wearied, and my hands are tired— My soul oppressed ; And with desire have I long desired Rest—only rest. 'Tis hard to toil, when toil is almost vain, In barren ways ; 'Tis hard to sow, and never garner grain In harvest days. The burden of my days is hard to bear. But God knows best ; And I have prayed—but vain has been my prayer For rest, sweet rest. 'Tis hard to plant in spring, and never reap The autumn yield ; 'Tis hard to till, and when 'tis tilled to weep O'er fruitless field. And so I cry, a weak and human cry, So heart-oppressed ; And so I sigh, a weak and human sigh, For rest—for rest. My way has wound across the desert years And cares infest My path, and through the flowing of hot tears I pine for rest. 'Twas always so, when still a child I laid On mother's breast My wearied little head ; e'en then I prayed, As now, for rest. And I was restless still. 'Twill soon be o'er For, down the West, Life's sun is setting, and I see the shore Where I shall rest.
