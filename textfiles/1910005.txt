TWO RESURRECTIONS. F. W. Evans. ''I saw a New Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea or world.' The first resurrection heaven is composed of those who stand with the Lamb on Mt. Zion,�becoming Virgins. They learn the song of the Lamb, have the Di'me of God written in their foreheads, and are redeemed from both the first and second earth. These constitute the white clouds of the New Heavens, 'I looked and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the M&gt;n of Man�she was a daughter of man�having on her head a golden crown, and in her hand a sharp sifkle. To her it whs said, 'thrust in thy sharp sickle and reap, for the time has come for thee to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.' And the earth was reaped. This is the first resurrection�Shakers, who are in the New Heavens. And another Angel came out of the Temple, having a sharp sickle, who w;is commanded 'Thrust in ihy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe. And the Angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great Wine Press of the wrath of God, and it was trodden without the city.' It belonged to the New Earth. This was the Second Resurrection from the first earth to the New Earth. It was the 'Song of Moses.' ''In the days of these kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom�a Republic not in name, but in reality�and it shall break in pieces all other kingdoms, and stand forever.' He will have come whose right it is to reign in justice and truth, henceforth he that would rule over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. The Rulers of the 'first earth' government were conquerors and Kings, with Lawyers, Doctors, Priests and a literary and monied aristocracy, to support them, all living as paupers, upon the labors of the 'common people.' There has been antagonism�perpetual war�between the rulers and the ruled. The people 'cursed their God and their king and looked upwards for redress, and it came at the American Revolution. The 'first earth' is passing away and being supplanted by the 'new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.' Its rulers are chosen by the sovereign peo pie to rule in their name and as directed by themselves. This is the first and second resurrection. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
