A reform is needed; when shall it commence?... M. S. Wetmore A reform is needed ; when shall it commence? Right here in Boston, where there is wealth sufficient to support ministers at enormous salaries—to save souls—and to build churches and furnish them extravagantly, in which to worship God on Sundays, are men and women starving and freezing,-and no ' man of God' to stay their feet in the course of ruin. Saloons bright and cheerful invite them to enter. Churches dark and dismal are closed against them, for these latter places are God's houses, and must not be desecrated ( by the poor, the hungry, and forsaken. So Satan has it all his own way in his alluring hells. Why not open the church es, or the vestries at least, every even ing through the winter, make them a comfortable and cheerful as Satan' realms, and have it an understooc thing that hot coffee and substantia food will be served to the cold and hun gry, and lodgings furnished—if no there, then from a fund for the purpose instead of furnishing tracts for the mil] ions and money for the heathen—to thos who have no homes ; thus making th churches God's houses in very earnest and causing the hearts of the suffering to rejoice that at last humanity has dis covered a new way of saving soul through warming, feeding and clothing the body?—M.
