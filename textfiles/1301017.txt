THE TRUE WAY By Mrs. Laura E. Sturtz, Alhambra When a duty comes in view, Do it! Do not sit with folded hands, Thinking, moaning, crying, Because perhaps it chance to prove, A thing to hate, instead of love, Up ! and heed these stern commands. Hoping, ever trying! Be the task a menial one, Do it! Labor of the humblest kind. If it comes within your way, As a thing that God presents, And His wisdom ne'er prevents, If with cheerfulness combined You the task obey. Will assure a rich reward. Doit! For, if faithful in the least, Waiting, trusting, loving. He has said that 'so in much Art thou faithful,' and to such, He prepares His richest feast, All His promise proving. So if faithful in the small, Mind it! God will open up the way, Tenderest love showing, And will lead to paths more bright. And to tasks so very light, As will make one long, glad day, All its brightness glowing.
