Shakers, N. Y. North Family. April, 1895. While pursuing the even tenor of our way, we have with us the blessings of God and it is of very great importance to the mind as we view life from an external point of view. 'The Kingdom of heaven is within you.' There should be laid the foundation on which to build the superstructure in which shall be the dwellingplace of that spiritualized being who has attained the mastery over the rudimentary life; not through the 'conflict with carnal weapons attaining power over fellow mortals and compelling States and Empires to do homage to their will. Spring is very backward comparing it with past seasons. At present writing there are large snow-drifts to be found in the woods though the cleared land is generally free. March showed very little indications of balmy spring, but was typical of the month in maintaining boisterous weather. As far as health is concerned there has been a favorable state with the exception of colds and a few cases of the grip. By the time of the appearance of these Notes your humble correspondent will be busily engaged in the garden. We feel thankful for the privilege to commune with gospel Brethren and Sisters either thivugh The Manifesto or in daily communion. They quicken the spirit and make one feel that 'Life is more than meat and the body than raiment.' Hamilton DeGraw.
