SCIENTIFIC Tea as a Poison The Journal of Chemistry asserts tea is not the simple, harmless, beverage that is generally supposed; but that its effects, in their character, may rightly claim to be classed with those of tobacco and alcohol. The paper also adds : 'Many disorders of the nervous system are the direct result of excessive tea drinking.—Tea is a 'narcotic poison;' its essential principle, theine.. is allied in composition with such poison as strychnine and morphine. It first excites the nervous system and then exhausts it. Experiments show that both in man and other animals, it impairs power in the lower extremities; so that it affects the 'understanding' in a double sense—literally as well as figuratively. It is not the harmless exhilarant it is supposed to be but a powerful agent whose effects are often serious.'
