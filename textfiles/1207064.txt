Measuring Hay in a Mow .—Four hundred cubic feet of hard-packed Timothy hay wilj make a ton; so will 500 cubic feet of mixed Clover and Timothy hard packed. Clover alone requires GOO to 700 cubic feet for a ton and common mixed meadow hay, including a large proportion of Red Top and June grass , will require 700 to 800 feet. The weight depends somewhat upon the ripeness of the hay; ripe hay is heavier than that made from early cut grass- No rule can therefore be given that will give accurately correct results ; but the general rule is : Multiply the length in yards by the height in yards and the product by the width in yards and divide the product by 15; the quotient will be approii. mately the number of tons.—Ex.
