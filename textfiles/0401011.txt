THE RISE AND FALL OF EMPIRES All that has been said, or may be said of Dmpires, may, without much stretching, be said of races, generations, and individuals. All have their culminating point, their ascendng and descending grades. By fidelity to nature, by stern self disci)line, especially as respects diet and the use of the reproductive functions, through successive generations, the culminating point of that !amily stock is achieved, to wit: the producion of a choice type of the race homo — a lappy combination of the intellectual and moral elements in the human make-up. Now, let us go back on the record. Do we, in any case, find that high attainment transmissible by ordinary generations ? Does it not appear that liberal, intellectual endowment, and high moral culture, lift their possessor above the reproducing plane ? Where, in lineal descent, do we find the Moseses, the Solomons, the Jesnses, the Wash- ingtons, the Jeffersons, or the Paines ? The individuals aforesaid, were the culminating point of that family stock. The reproducing of God's image and likeness is a highly responsible office. Such high official functionaries should, in no case, be cumbered with serving the commonwealth in any other official capacity. Pater-familias should have undivided use of his capabilities to provide ways and means. Mater-familias should have full liberty to care for the little ones, unencumbered with other official serving. In the coming new earth it must be so. Another, an intellectual class — celibates —must run the Government machine, wholly unencumbered with domestic cares and responsibilities. When the new earth is fully actualized, all departments, each in its own order, working harmoniously — don't you think the morning stars may sing together, and the daughters and sons of God shout for joy ? Then will the new heaven be replenished with material not marred in the hands of the potter. Oliver Prentiss, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
