ST. PETER AND THE BASKETS St. Peter, from the door of Heaven one day Sped two young angels on their happy way, For the first time to see the world in Mayï¿½ Both bearing baskets. They were to bring back flowers more fragrant far, Than budding rose and blooming hawthorn are; They were to bring the praise of all the star Back in their baskets. The angel of thanksgiving, full of glee, Donned a big hamper, half as large as he; But the collector of petitions, see, With a small basket. When they returned, St. Peter, as before, Sat with his golden keys before the door; But each appeared to be in trouble sore, About his basket. The angel of petitions bore a sack Cram full, and bound uncouthly on his back; Yet even then it seemed that he did lack Of bag and basket. The angel of thanksgiving blushed to feel, The empty lightness of his mighty creel. 'But three,' he muttered, turning on his heel, To hide his basket. Then spoke St. Peter: ' When again you go On a prayer-gathering, you will better know That men's petitions in the world below, Fill a big basket. But when you gather up your thanks For prayers well answered and forgiven pranks, For health restored and disentangled hanks, Your smallest basket.' Good Words.
