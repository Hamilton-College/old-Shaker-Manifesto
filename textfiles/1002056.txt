In order to insure success two points must be attended to — first and most important, the glass must be kept quite level in the water while the scissors are applied, and, secondly, to avoid risk, it is better to begin the cutting by taking off small pieces at the corners THE SHAKEK MANIFESTO. and along the edges, and so reduce the shape gradually to that required, as if any attempt is made to cut the glass all at once to the shape as we would cut a piece of cardboard, it will most likely break just where it is not wanted. Some kinds of glass cut much better than others, the softer glasses being the best for this purpose. The scissors need not be at all sharp, as their action does not appear to depend on the state of the edge presented to the glass. When the operation goes on well, the glass breaks away from the scissors in small pieces in a straight line with the blades. This method of cutting glass has often been of service when a diamond has not been at hand, for cutting ovals and segments, and though the edges are not so smooth as might be desired for some purposes, yet it will answer in a great many cases. The two hints given above, if strictly followed, will always insure success.
