I think that first of all that I should be very thankful for 1113' good home and for the many kind friends that I believe I shall have if I am true good and obedient to all that is taught me. Yea I always' me'an to be so good so that I may keep my union and joining with them, that when I develop into woman-hood I may be worthy to take the place of some of the aged ones who will soon pass away. I want to be kind to all my mates knowing that just as I treat them I may expect to be treated. I will now bid you adieu hoping that yotf will join with me in every good resolution. With much love, Luella Flurtis—Age, 13.
