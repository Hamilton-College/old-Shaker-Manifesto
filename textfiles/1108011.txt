INWARD MONITOR CATHARINE VAN HOUTEN Is there not placed in thy heart A monitor to teach thee? Doth not God's free love impart A spirit pure, to reach thee ? Beams there not from heaven, light, To guide thy footsteps ? truly ! Cans't thou then not judge aright, And balance all things duly ? Judging, first, thyself in wrong, Will not thy heart feel sorrow ? May there not to thee belong, Much more than thou woulds't borrow? Wisdom bids thee to come down, In owning up thy error; How cans't thou wear, Truth's bright crown, Whilst wrong keeps thee in terror ? Mercy to thy neighbor give, Though erring still thy brother; Does he wrong; forgive, forgive, And strive to love each other; Keep ye judgment, Justice do, For'time is short, and fleeting; Soon we'll bid the earth adieu, Iu heaven be next our meeting. Mt. Lebanon.
