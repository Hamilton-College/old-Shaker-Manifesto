A Warning Word Concerning the Spread of Infidelity A Warning Word Concerning the Spread of Infidelity, by H. L. Hastings. Those acquainted with the author of this little book know very well how thoioughly he handles the subject and we can do no better than to quote what he says about Infidelity in America. 'We find throngs of people hanging upon the lips of some eloquent blasphemer, whose sophistries and misrepresentations warp their judgments and wreck their lives. We find Infidel papers springing up on every hand. We find scientific sneerers at the Bible who seem lo think that wisdom will die with them. We find tens of thousands of cheap Infidel publications issued, scattered and exported to other lands. We find the elements of wild disorder on the western fringe of our civilization.' Publisht at 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass. The Tenth Annual Educational Number of The Outlook puts side by side personal sketches of two great educators, with unusually fine portraits of the two men. One of the two is an Americanï¿½the great scientist, Joseph Le Conte, who has been the ablest American advocate of the theory of evolution as being in unison with the doctrine of Christianity. The other is the famous and eccentric English scholar and Oxford professor, Benjamin .Tow ett, sunl the sketch is based on the recent biography which has attracted such wide attention.
