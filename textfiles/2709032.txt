With Mercury, Venus, Vulcan and the Moon all busy at work to create a storm, is sufficient reason why we should watch as well as pray. Electrical storms are not especially interest ing to many minds and any hint given of their anticipated presentation would be received with watchful care. The Origin of Storms will be read with deep interest by those who are so fortunate as to obtain a copy of Word and Works. Those who are not specially interested in studying the coining of the storms can read about the beautiful flowers, or even take the pillow shams, or they may read of 'Our Homes.' Word and Works has an abundance of good reading and can easily interest a large class of minds. A Warning Word Concerning the Spread of Infidelity A Warning Word Concerning the Spread of Infidelity, by H. L. Hastings. Those acquainted with the author of this little book know very well how thoioughly he handles the subject and we can do no better than to quote what he says about Infidelity in America. 'We find throngs of people hanging upon the lips of some eloquent blasphemer, whose sophistries and misrepresentations warp their judgments and wreck their lives. We find Infidel papers springing up on every hand. We find scientific sneerers at the Bible who seem lo think that wisdom will die with them. We find tens of thousands of cheap Infidel publications issued, scattered and exported to other lands. We find the elements of wild disorder on the western fringe of our civilization.' Publisht at 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass. The Tenth Annual Educational Number of The Outlook puts side by side personal sketches of two great educators, with unusually fine portraits of the two men.
