HANDLE DAIRY STOCK KINDLY Mr. Parcell, in the report of the New Jersey Agricultural Society, says : It is important that dairy stock, from the young calf to the old cow, that is being fed for beef, should be handled and treated kindly. If a calf is handled roughly and becomes wild and vicious thereby, when it becomes a cow you may expect the same, but if handled carefully and treated with kindness, when grown up she will be mild and gentle. It may not always be so, but in general it is. There have always been many cows spoiled by the person having the care of and milking them, by whipping or frightening them whenever they come in his way, or if when milking, a cow hoists her foot or kicks (which is generally caused by pain,) such a fellow stops milking and commences whipping, or worse, kicking the cow, and she becoming enraged, holds up her milk, kicks back, and is finally ruined. Never whip a cow for kicking, if she does kick the milk-pail out of your hand and sometimes upset and knock you over ; but be kind and gentle with her, and milk her out with as little excitement as possible, and if she gets over her kicking propensity, it will be by mild not harsh treatment Never whip a cow because she kicks, for it will do no good, but will do a great deal of harm.â€”Exchange.
