NOTHING IS LOST CECELIA DEVYR Scatter bright jewels like hail on the mountain, Like rain that falls fast on the valley below, Though like the snow that dissolves in the fountain, They pass from your vision, still, still let them go. Nothing is lost in the outward creation, Change is the law that to nature is given, Nothing shall fail in the work of salvation, Progress shall bring us the kingdom of heavers. We may be up and awake in the morning, Doing the work that is needful at home, Or we may sleep through the light that is dawning, Yet unimpeded its glory will come. Who would awake to the light that is blinding? Who would be called to the sluggard's reward? Who would be sowing in season of binding? Who would be dead in the day of the Lord? Surely not those who are called by the spirit, Heavenly treasures on earth to obtain, Those who the life everlasting inherit, By faith that will cleanse them from every stain.
