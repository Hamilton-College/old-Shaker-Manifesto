Active Friendship It is with feelings of deep gratitude that we turn often to view, as models of unselfishenss, those who continue the staunch friends of The Manifesto ; and who give so many reminders of their genuine friendship by generous helps to this office in the circulation of this, our little missionary sheet. Without the possible hope of any pecuniary reward (and while a very few illiberal unShakers are using their little opposition to obtain an unenviable reward), are rendering much missionary help gratuitously, thus 'lending THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 93 to the Lord,' who will not fail to make returns with interest. While we thus render partial thanks to those unselfish enough to confer upon us every little help, we would also inform those receiving specimen copies of The Manifesto, that it is by and through the efforts of some very true and unselfish friends. If any would be glad thus to help us according to their ability, we ask a kindly reading of ' Special Notice ' on cover, and particularly that part addressed to the ' Liberally Inclined.' And to those receiving sample copies, we would respectfully ask of those who are able to send us their subscriptions.
