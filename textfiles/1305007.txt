THE ROSE. JANE BRAINARD. A poet said,— 'What mortal knows whence comes The tint, and perfume of the rose?' Another, said,— 'You may break, you may scatter the vase if you will; But the scent of the rose will cling round it still.' The rose we know is very attractive, much eulogized by poets and has been called the 'Queen of flowers.' Dear friends, let us take a view of this beautiful flower, analyze it critically if you never have. In every leaf you will find the finest veins ; it emits the most delicate perfume. Its medicinal virtues are soothing. Thorns on the bush may remind us of providential protection. This coincides with the interior life of a Christian, in whom the innocence of childhood and wisdom gained by obedience to faith are combined, we often see roughness on the exterior, like thorns on the rose bush ; but when we get near enough to view7 the interior, the tennle, we find it is refined, where kindness, gentleness, forbearance and charity seem unbounded. Like the perfume of the rose is the incense arising from the soul of a Christian. Who would not aspire to be a Christian if they knew the real virtue that forms the lovely character, -:nd have the companionship of associates that work no ill ? Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
