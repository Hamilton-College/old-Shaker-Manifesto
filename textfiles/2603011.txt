TENDERNESS. By Annie R. Stephens. Down in the woodland's deep and fragrant gloom, Where shadows quiver, green boughs interlace, And soft, cool zephyrs tremble in each space; The violets grow, arrayed in purple bloom, All wet with dews exhale their rare perfume. We gaze into each bright uplifted face, They sweetly smile with soft and tender grace, A hint of joy from wrorlds beyond the tomb. They seem to wear an angel's aureole, Such as we see in pearly dew-drops shine. Their silent speechan oracle divine, Breathes forth this message to each listening soul; 'All life is rich that humbly seeks to bless.' Oh petaled music of Love's tenderness ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
