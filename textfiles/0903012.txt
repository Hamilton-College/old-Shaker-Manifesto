Christ's Second Coming There appeared, recently, in the Sedalia (Mo.) Bazoo, a long article upon this subject, written by a lady named Clark, and which is, undoubtedly, a review of Elder Eads' ' Types of Christ.' It is an excellent paper, filled with the most advanced views upon the subject, and a very favorable, yet critical, indorsement of Shaker views as put forth in Elder Eads' pamphlet. It would occupy several pages of The Manifesto, or we would reproduce it; but do not feel warranted in so doing while so much matter crowds our ' pigeon holes.'
