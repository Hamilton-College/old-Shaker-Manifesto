GOOD MORNING Don't forget to say 'Good-morning!'' Say it to your parents, your brothers and sisters, your schoolmates, your teachersâ€” and say it cheerfully, and with a smile; it will do you good, and do your friends good. There's a kind inspiration in every 'Good morning' heartily spoken, that helps to make hope fresher and work lighter. It seems really to make the morning good, and to be a prophecy of a good day to come after it. And if this be true of the 'good-morning,'' it is also of kind, heartsome greetings ; they cheer the discouraged, rest the tired one, somehow make the wheels of life run more smoothly. Be liberal with them, then, and let no morning pass, however dark and gloomy it may be, that you do not help at least to brighten by your smiles and cheerful words.
