CUMBERED ABOUT MUCH SERVING. Christ never asks of us such busy labor As leaves no time for resting at his feet ; The waiting attitude of expectation He oft-times counts a service most complete. He sometimes wants our ear —- our rapt attention — That he some sweetest secret may impart; 'Tis always in the time of deepest silence That heart finds deepest fellowship with heart. We sometimes wonder why our Lord doth place us Within a sphere so narrow, so obscure, That nothing we call work can find an entrance ; There's only room to suffer — to endure. Well, God loves patience ! Souls that dwell in stillness, Doing the little things or renting quite, May justas perfectly fulfill their mission, Be just as useful in the Father's sight, As they who grapple with some giant evil, Clearing a path that every eye may see ! Our Saviour cares for cheerful acquiescence, Rather than for a busy ministry. And yet he does love service, where 'tis given By grateful love that clothes itself in deed; But work that's done beneath the scourge of duty, Be sure to such he gives but little heed. Then seek to please him, whatsoe'er he bids thee! Whether to do, to suffer, to lie still! 'Twill matter little by what path he led us If in it all we sought to do his will!
