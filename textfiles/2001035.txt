PRUDENCE God teaches us to be prudent which means saving. We should not waste any food, not even the cores of apples but they should be given to the creatures. When we sweep a room we should save all the pins, needles, and bits of thread. My teacher told me that those that save are rich and those that waste are poor. Lou Leonard. 8 yrs. old.
