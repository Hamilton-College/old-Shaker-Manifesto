BE THOU TRUE Care not what others say, Be thou true! If they gossip to betray, Be thou true! Be consistent and do right, For the truth makes a good fight; Do what thou dost with all thy might; Be thou true ! Be thou true ! Let thy love be sincere� Be thou true! Only God hast thou to fear; Be thou true! Since our joys must pass away Like the dewdrops or the spray, Wherefore should our sorrows stay ? Be thou true ! Be thou true I Friendship's very hard to find, Be thou true! True love is not always blind; Be thou true! Time at last makes all things straight, Let us not resent�just wait� But not trust too much in fate, Be thou true ! Be thou true ! - The Home.
