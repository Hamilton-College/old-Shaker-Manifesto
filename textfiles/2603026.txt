SECRET THOUGHTS. [Contributed by R. A. Shepard.] I hold it true, that thoughts are things Endowed with bodies, breath and wings, And these we send swift forth, to fill The world with good results, or ill. That which we call our secret thought, Speeds to the earth's remotest spot And leaves its blessings or its woes Like tracks behind it, as it goes. It is God's law. Eemember it, In your still chamber, as you sit [known, With thoughts you would not dare have And yet make comrades, when alone. These thoughts have life, and they will fly And leave their impress, by and by. Like some marsh breeze, whose poisoned breath Breathes into homes the fumes of death. And after you have quite forgot Or all outgrown some vanished thought, Back to your mind, to make its home, A dove or raven it will come. Then let your secret thoughts be fair; They have a vital part and share In shaping worlds, and molding fate, God's system is so intricate. Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
