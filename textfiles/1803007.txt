O MY GOD! WHY SO? Giles B. Avery. Wounded and bleeding as I lay,ï¿½ Feeling at every nerve ; 0 tell me, 0 my God, I pray, For what I this deserve. Chastened, my book of life I ope, And read its record o'er ; Counting the beacons of my hope, Now fled, forevermore. And ask, O God of love, I pray, Why, why this want of trust? Why, why so many pangs I feel, So piercing, so unjust! A voice, a softly answer gave, 1 list to catch the sound ; Shall He who came mankind to save, Be scored with paining wounds. That he might feel for others woes, And thus obedience learn ; And show us whence the fountain flows That caused his soul to burn With love, the wounded soul to heal The lost to seeK and save. And we yet never, never feel The life the Savior gave? 'Tis only nerves that have been touched, That ever learn to feel; 'Tis such, ah such, and only such, God's mercies can reveal. Then let me meekly bear the rod Tho' wounded sorely still; Since all its stripes are healed of God, In souls who do his will. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
