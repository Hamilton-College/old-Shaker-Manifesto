WOMAN People have glanced carelessly at the question of woman suffrage, and turned away with the idea that it would give undue influence to women of impure lives; but the reverse is the case. Women of impure lives govern us now, through their impure influence of legislatures, judiciaries, and juries, exclusively masculine; and nothing but women in authority can remand them to their proper sphere, if they have any. The influence they could exert through the ballot by force of numbers would be unappreciable, being more than neutralized by the votes of decent women, who would make a point of consigning to political graves all politicians known to be influenced by them, and only juries composed wholly or in part of women ever will do them justice. Were the political influence now wielded by courtesans of this country divided into as many equal parts as there are women in the United States, it would give every one a vote, and place the regulation of the dram-shop and social evil questions under the control of the decent portion of the community. It is only when men consult with women whom they respect, that we can hope they will be influenced by those they do not. Miss Swisshelm in the Independent
