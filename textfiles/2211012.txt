SERENITY. Annie R. Stephens. O calm, sweet morning air! all earth is still With sweet serenity of Sabbath day, The early light of morning's golden ray Rests like the smile of God on plain and hill. Subdued the songster's lay, and babbling rill; The grasses, glittering in their gemmed array, Wave low, as if an angel passed that way; This holy stillness chides each erring will. Calm us, O God! and let thy balm of Peace Drop soothingly, like dew drops on the flowers; And may thy love our aching hearts release From the harsh tumult of life's weary hours. For in thy Peace our fevered longings cease, And in thy Love, reststrength for toil are ours. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
