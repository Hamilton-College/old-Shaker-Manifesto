Beloved Eldress J--;--To-day, I have been looking backward... Enfield, N. H. Dec. 25, 1889. Beloved Eldress J� ;�To-day, I have been lookiug backward, counting the milestones I have passed, and trying to forecast the horoscope of the future. As we take these glances, how small the trials of life appear ; and how unsatisfactory is the recollection of the moments spent in those shady arbors where we tarried to cull the flowers of self-pleasure and folly, unmindful of the demands of our gospel call. 1 do uot believe in needlet-sly regretting misspent hours, but find it profitable frequently to recall my own failures, that I may have charity for those who, perchance, may find themselves on the edge of the flower-crowned chasm and have uot even the power of resistance that I possessed. Is not this one of the purposes of life that out of our own strength or weakness, we gather that which serves some other life? Thus in part fulfill our mission. As we are not called to bear the burdens of those on the natural plane, should not all our strength be given in support of the higher life? I would rather be known as one who stoops to raise the fallen, than to belong to the class whose attitude is, 'Stand by thyself, come not near to me for I am holier than thou.' Dear Eldress J� I send you these rambling thoughts, knowing that you will read between the lines and there find that my courage is strong, my purpose true, to endure the testing and honor Z;on, as I have been favored to be one of her inmates. 1 enclose love and kindly greetings for yourself and Order. May the blessings of the Christmas-tide and the joys of a happy New Year be yours to a fuluess. Lovingly, Your Sister, Mary Basford.
