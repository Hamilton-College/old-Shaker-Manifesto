Hast Thou Forsaken All ? JAMES G. RUSSELL Behold, tve have forsaken all, and have followed Thee.' Forsaken all ? Hast thou forsaken all, The best and dearest of thine earthly claim ? Thy father's house, possessions great or small, Hast thou forsaken these, with Christ to reign? Thy father, mother, brothers, sisters dear, The objects of thine heart's affections strong, Those earthly ties that hold the spirit near To all that to the earthly plane belong? Hast thou forsaken all, and wouldst thou know And share the blessings of a higher life,— A part and portion in this world below With those that mingle not in earthly strife? Wouldst thou enjoy that happiness of soul That's wrought thro' full deliverance from thy loss, And wouldst thou willingly forsake the whole That God requires, however great the cross? To find acceptance in his kingdom new, A virgin, lovely, spotless, clean and pure, And whatsoe'er thy hands may find-to do, Wouldst thou in holy faith all things endure ? One thing thou lackest more than all the rest, That constitute the sum of earthly pelf, If thou wouldst fain preserve within thj breast That idol god, the giant monster Self! Hast thou forsaken, then, that precious all, Thine earthly kindred, riches, and thy self, And in obedience to the heavenly call Then, verily our Saviour's words are true,— No man hath these forsaken but the strife Shall bring an hundred-fold of blessings new, And in the world to come, eternal life. Then courage, Christian soul, the way is clear, Marked out and trodden by the prince of light; Thou needst no longer grope in darkness here, The sun is shining with effulgence bright The holy hill of zion is uncapped, The misty clouds that veiled it disappeared; 3ehold the city of our God, enwrapped In glorious splendor, by his saints revered, ome, then, and at the glorious shrine of God, The loving seat of mercy, bow thee low; Accept the ransom, nevermore to plod The paths of wickedness, distress and woe.
