North Union, O., Oct. 16, 1881 Watson Andrews North Union, O., Oct. 16, 1881 Editor Manifesto : Dear Brother â€” This morning comes the October number of our hopeful Manifesto of faith and principles ; and I might add, consummate philosophy. Are we to fear the setting of this morning's sun, and if so, to rise no more? Is this light, whose celestial rays can pierce the gloom of ' nature^ darkness' and illumine the path of purity to the region of ' Christian Rest; ' is it to be put out? We hope not, we pray not, at the same time we doubt not God's will will be done. Dear readers, do but think of going back to the days when we had no such monthly visitant! When this oft renewed, tangible assurance of general union was not! Look at the last number ; starting out with the hint that we may be professing too much, practicing too little of the Christ life; and proceeding to a complete portrayal of 'True Christian Rest.' It might at first thought be considered a sufficient guide of Christian travel; but it is not. This is an insidious thought. In activity only is there life; fixity is death. Having attained to this glorious rest, or at least to such degree of spiritual sight as to realize the correctness of the author's views upon true rest, shall we sit down and fold our hands, as regards laboring for other souls ? content to regard ' the Summer over, and the harvest ended,' since we are saved? On the contrary let us 254 THE SHAKEK MANIFESTO. work harder, retrench more, and contribute liberally to the support of our Manifesto op Light, in money and sympathy ; and so very sparingly of criticism, that not only our truth-spangled banner, but its poor overworked Editor may ' still wave,' is the prayer of many needy readers. P. S. The inclosed money is $1 for postage, and $5 as a present for yourself, from our beloved trustee, Eldress Lydia Cramer, in behalf of the sisters. With much love from all, Truly yours,
