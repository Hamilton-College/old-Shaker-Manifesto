LIFE'S MISSION. By Jennie Mathers. To-xight, as I stand at the window, I am glad that the day has past, And the quiet hours of evening Have settled down at last. I watch the moonlight falling In bars of silver and gold, But I know its glowing radiance, falls On many a heart that is cold. On many a heart that is weary Of worldly contention and strife; On many a heart that is longing For a purer, a better life. And my heart grows sad while thinking Of the many that go astray, Who must answer for all evil doing To God, at the great Judgment day. The shadows, they lengthen around me, The moonlight grows suddenly dim; In the mists, the angels ar bringing A message of comfort from Him. I feel that my prayer is answered; A door of hope I can see. To help the weak and the erring Is the mission Christ has given to me. I find in the hour of sorrow, In days of darkness and sin, That the angels ar earnestly seeking The souls of the erring to win. Then I'll fear not the raging tempest, I'll fear not the angry sea, Be faithful in filling the mission The Christ has given to me. My faith in Christ shal be steadfast, My luv to God shal be true. With hands that ar ever ready, His wil, not my own, I'll do. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
