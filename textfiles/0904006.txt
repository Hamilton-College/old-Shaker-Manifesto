HOW I FOUND A HAPPY PEACE JACOB S. KULP Every one seeks for happiness; but nearly every one seeks differently. Many there are who think happiness depends on wealth; but wealth, unaccompanied by peace of mind, is unhappiness. There is no happiness in passionate indulgences, nor but little pleasure — and pleasure is not always happiness. Unless blunted by sinfulness, conscience finds stings in such engagements outweighing the pleasure. The angels sung on the first Christmas morn, 'Peace on earth and good will;' and Jesus, on taking leave of His disciples, uttered, 'My peace I leave with you.' It is one of the promises of God to those who would be happy: ' Their peace shall be like a river—a ceaseless flow of happiness.' By some, happiness is claimed as a myth — found only lettered in the dictionary. But my Christian experience causes me to affirm that it is possible of attainment, and now, in this life. How? Follow Jesus in self-denial; love Him by keeping His commands; follow the Lamb's life, by abstaining from all ungodliness and worldly lusts. Our souls will bear us witness, and to all around us we will give evidence that we are happy because enjoying a Christian peace. Consecration of time, talents, and our whole lives to God — to what God requires of us, ensampled by Christ's life — will yield a happy peace continually. To us this road to happiness is so simply taught that ' the wayfaring man or woman, though a fool' to worldly wisdom, needs not err in finding it; and this by living the life of Christ, as did Jesus, free from guile, and in possession of a happiness the world can never give nor take away.
