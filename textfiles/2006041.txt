COLDS. The word cold is a simple one, to name a malady which seems to embody all the ills which 'flesh and blood is heir to.' One would think when attacked with the wheezing, sneezing, coughing, snuffing disorder, that it ought to be given a Norwegian name of thirteen syllables, each beginning and ending with d or j. But since the evil 'is abroad' and always will be, we deem it sensible, from effect to study cause and find a panacea. Since a cold is produced by the stoppage of the two million little pores of the skin, thus throwing into the blood two pounds of effete matter which should daily escape from these little doors, the first effort to be made, is to open them again. As soon as the first symptom of a cold appears, sponge off with tepid water night and morning, roughly applying friction with a brush or coarse towel to the whole body. On going to bed, drink hot lemonade, or some other simple remedy to induce a natural perspiration; and you can soon conquer even a severe attack with all its disagreeable effects. But should you desire a cold for an abiding guest, take alcoholic medicines, shut up in the foul air of a hot room, and by remaining inactive, your desire will be granted. Lily Lupin.
