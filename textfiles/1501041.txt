A CLARION CALL BY REV. WILLIAM BRUNTON Ye brave of heart who dare to serve where honor calls; Ye sons of God on whom the, prophet mantle falls; Ye lovers of mankind, who seek to know the truth, And comfort age thereby, and strengthen weakliug youth, Wiio wish to cheer the weary on their toilsome way, Reclaim the lost, and lead them back to golden day, Who wish to teach the dull to feel true manly worth, And bring once more the Eden life to darksome earth, And give to trembling hope the confidence of love, To vain and savage pride the meekness of the dove, Unite with us : we seek and prize the good and true, We fain would sin and death by light and love subdue' In heart and soul we grieve that falsehood, wrong, and might Should rule the world in gloom, when truth would rule in light. Inspired with loyal zeal, a brave, crusading band, We, venture forth in love to free our holy land, The land where captives weep in passion's direst pain, And woes beset the poor, and wrongs the rich maintain ' Tis there we boldly press,proclaiming love and light Defending men from harm, upholding truth and right, ' Tis there we seek the foe, unfearing death or loss, With joyous valor filled, glad soldiers of the cross, There haste to tread with us the path grave vet'rans trod, And soon the world shall be the paradise of God. What greater joy than this, to elevate mankind, To speak the word of truth for heart, and soul, and mind; To labor for the right, to suffer for the just, To work for God and man, in man and God to trust; To live the saintly life, that common life may see This fair and glorious world more beautiful and free; To gem the spacious vault that rounds the spirit sphere With circling realms of love, at once iar-offnd near? Divinely blest the work! And earnest heart that shares In all these burning?hopes, in all these lofty cures, Make this your task in life, your life's supernal aim,. Responding to the call of honor, love, and fame. Selected.
