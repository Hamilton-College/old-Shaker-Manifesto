HUMILITY. Lizzie Belden. 'Humility is the foundation virtue of the Christian character.' We should be very careful of what we are building the foundation of our character, for if that is not firm the whole structure will fall. We should keep adding to our structure 'faith, courage, meekness, patience, godliness, love and all the other stones that enter into a s:.lid and Christian life.' The opposite of humility is pride which 'permeates many sins' as surely as humility 'forms an important part of nearly every virtue.' True humility drives pride, selfishness, disobedience, untruthfulness and all the other sins from the heart, for they would grieve the Holy Spirit. God has promised 'not to merely visit, but to dwell with the humble until they shall be taken to dwell with Him.' What a beautiful promise ! How clean and pure we should keep our hearts if we want God to dwell with us, and also if we want to dwell with him in that beautiful place they call Heaven. How dependent we are upon God for everything we have, every good thought, every pure desire which stirs within us is from God. He also gives us strength and wisdom to direct all the good that is in us. 'Humility leads us to shun the tempter to distrust ourselves and to trust God. It enables God to bestow upon us his richest blessings and to use us in his service.' So we should not be proud of what we have, but remember that it all came from God. It is written 'God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble' and Solomon wrote 'A man's pride shall bring him low; but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit.' It shall ever be my prayer that I may, with God's help, grow in humility. Hancock, Mass.
