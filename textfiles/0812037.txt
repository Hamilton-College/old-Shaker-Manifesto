IDLE BOYS AND GIRLS Idleness is the mother of vice, and a boy or girl who is allowed to grow up in idleness is pretty sure to be a vicious man or woman. The parents of such children have a fearful responsibility resting upon them when they let them run about at late hours of the night instead of keeping them at home, reading good newspapers and books, and training them into moral habits, so as to become respectable, instead of idlers, rum-drinkers, loafers, and gamblers, and worse which are sure to be the case vith the night-runners and day-idlers, and then the responsibility is increased. Give the children plenty to do, and you will preserve their morals. Better ¦a tired body than a vitiated mind.—Ex.
