MEED To the Memory of Brother John Shaw, ANNIE R. STEPHENS. Gone to his rest! lo the twilight declineth, The sun of his earth-life forever has set; But the orb of Eternity's morn on him shineth, And with joy hath his spirit the angel bands met. Xo gorgeous arrayal nor pomp of high station, We bring to our dear one as tributes the best, But tokens of love and this simple ovation,ï¿½ He lias done his work well, may peace crown his rest. Gone to his rest! for the Lord hath he labored, His all consecrated in manhood's full prime; Unselfishly toiled in the heavenly vineyard, And lived to the Faith through the journey of Time. Oh! long shall sweet memories cluster around us, Of days when his hands some good sought to do, And long shall his deeds of kindness surround us, That were wrought with a heart both willing and true. Gone to the rest that the faithful all merit, So full is the harvest, so rich his reward; The promise ne'er fails, that the righteous inherit; Christ's kingdom is theirs who work for the Lord. Oh our beautiful home in the eternal mansions; Each day brings us nearer that love-lighted land, [sions Where we'll roam with the blest heavens vernal expan And meet ne'er to part on that bright pearly strand Gone to his rest! yea the angels have crowned him, For him shall their harps wake the triumphal psalm; While the loved and the blest in gladness surround him For his is the vict'ry and the conqueror's palm, (ione to his rest! Oh softly we'll breathe it, 'Tis the chorus of joy the angels now swell; While the bodily form to dust we must leave it, Till we meet his bright spirit we'Jl whisper farewell in. Lebanon, N. Y.
