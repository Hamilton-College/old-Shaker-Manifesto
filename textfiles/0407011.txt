HORTICULTURE In the fall of 1872, after gathering the exceptionally large crop of apples of that season, we organized a corps of pruners. Going through our several orchards, we took off, first, the unfruitful lower limbs. Then the superfluous branches, giving the trees a heavy trim- ming. Rationale. Reasoning thus. These trees have so exhausted their vitality, that next year, they will not bear. We will help them, by removing all that can be spared without det- riment. Thus the strength, of the whole system of roots, will be concentrated in what limbs and branches remain. This fall, the trees will form fewer, but stronger fruit buds, for next season. We will have a middling fair crop of apples, in the ensuing non-bearing year. Result. One thousand bushels of apples — giving us an ample supply, and we sold $500 worth of apples and other fruit, in the panic, when $100 were equal to $200 in ordinary times. The wounds made, heal sweetly — clean as clean can be. Last year, we let the orchards alone, to recuperate. This season, we are thinning out the branches, to reduce the excess of blossoms, that give promise of a large crop the present year. This process we propose to continue through June and July, thinning out, where we had previously trimmed. Small apples will go mercilessly, if they set before we get through. Borers. In the past, having washed our apple trees with strong soap-suds and potash once or twice a year, no borers have made their appearance in our orchards. In Heathen orchards, they are making havoc, or labor. It may be well to state, that a shovel full of tan bark, or two, has been put around the young trees, in the fall. This is to keep the mice away. Perhaps the borers do not approve of it. Inasmuch as 'the Lord our God' blesses our orchards, by inspiring us to observe Nature's Laws, may we not hope He will do the same with our own bodies, so far as we ' mind the same thing and walk by the same rule ' ?
