HOME TOPICS Fish as food Fish as food.—There is much nourishment in fish, little if any less than there is in meat, weight for weight. In fact it may be more nourishing, because as a rule it is much more easily digested. Fish is consid?red almost a spscifb against scrofulous diseases. Value of food Vain? of foti.—0 13 prail of corn is equal, as food, to four pound? of potatoes and more than equal to eight pound? i. cabbage, or to twelve and a half pounds of turnips. Meat is not fattening, but is muscle yielding aud strengthening. Grains are fattening. Poisons and Antidotes It not unfrequently happens that serious and distressing results are occasioned by the accidental employment of poisons, and it has occurred to us that we might d;gt; a service to some of our mubrs by presenting them with a brief and compendious li.-t of the more common poisons and the remedies for them most likely to be at hand : Acicfs—These cause great her.t and sensation of burning pain from the mouth d gt;\vn to the stomach. Remedies—Magnesia, soda, pearl-ash or soap, dissolved in water; then use stomach pump or emetics. Alkalies—Best remedy is vinegar. Ammonia—Remedy, lemon juice or vinegar : afterward, re Me and water or ilax^eed tea. Alcohol—First cleanse out the stomach by an emetic; then dash cold water on the head and give ammonia (spiiits cf hartshorn). Arsenic—In the first evacuate the stomach ; then give the white cf egg=, lime water or chalk and water, charcoal, and the preparation of iron, particularly hydrate. Lead—White lead and sugar of leaf. Remedies—Alum and cathartics, such us castor oil and Epsom salts especially. Charcoal—In poisons by carbonic gas, remove the patient to open air, dash cold water on the head and body and stimulate the nostrils and lungs by hartshorn at tha same lime rubbing the chest briskly. Corrosive Sublimate—Give white of eggs freshly mixed with water, or give wheat flour and water or soap and water freely. Creosote—White of eggs and emetics.

The Scientific American sends out a warning against the recommendation of using Olive oil far every species of poisoning. We have seen this recommendation going the rounds very freely; and while we know that Olive oil is a very useful application in many cases, we believe that reliance upon it as an antidote fjr all poisons, to be a mistaken and dangerous expedient. Milk as a Preventive of White Lead Poisoning A singular fact is given in the Jouroi.nl dz Medecine with regard to the effect of the habitual use of milk in white lead works. In some French lead mills it was observed that in a large working population two men who drank much milk daily were not affected by lead. On the general use of milk throughout the works the colic vanished entirely. Each operative was given enough extra pay to buy a quart of milk a day. Syrup of Coffee This preparation is of great use to those who have long journeys to make. Take half a lb. of the best ground coffee, put into a sauce-pan containing three pints of water; •when thoroughly steeped, pour off into another clean vessel and boil again until reduced to one pint. As it boils, add white sugar enough to give it the consistency of syrup. Take it from the lire; when cold, put into a bottle and seal. When traveling, if you wish fjr a cup of good coffee, you have only to put two or three teaspoonfuls of the syrup into an ordinary cup, then pour boiling water upan it, and it is ready fjr use. We have proved it to be good.
