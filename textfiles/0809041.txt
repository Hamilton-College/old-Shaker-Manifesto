Syrup of Coffee This preparation is of great use to those who have long journeys to make. Take half a lb. of the best ground coffee, put into a sauce-pan containing three pints of water; â€¢when thoroughly steeped, pour off into another clean vessel and boil again until reduced to one pint. As it boils, add white sugar enough to give it the consistency of syrup. Take it from the lire; when cold, put into a bottle and seal. When traveling, if you wish fjr a cup of good coffee, you have only to put two or three teaspoonfuls of the syrup into an ordinary cup, then pour boiling water upan it, and it is ready fjr use. We have proved it to be good.
