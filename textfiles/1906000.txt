Leonard of Harvard, Mass, as it contains much interesting and valuable information.�Ed.~\ South Groton, Mass. July, 1865. Beloved Elder Henry ;�We were quite pleased on the receipt of your interesting letter. If kind friends impart messages of joy, it brings them very near, to allow us to share the blessing with them. If at times we feel overborne, we know by experience that we can look to no better source for consolation than to those who are traveling the same course, and bearing up under the weary toils of the same journey. You speak kindly of our former letters. We certainly thank you for your encouragiog words, for we had almost concluded that we had written so many long letters, that perhaps they had become tedious. If they have been of any benefit we are pleased to have it so. You say that when 'I am full to overflowing you would be pleased to have me write.' We think we had better not wait to be transported into that happy condition. We fear you would have to wait quite too long for an answer to your last, although in such cases we have always noticed, during our pilgrimage among Believers, that if any soar too high toward heaven, they soon light upon the earth again when they feel their own state roll back upon them. All who set out on the Believer's, journey, may as well prepare their hearts for sorrow as for joy and their souls for temptation as well as victory, if our experience teaches right. But it is all right. Deep, painful, heartfelt experience, is an unerring, truthful teacher. We are a heavy debtor to our true friends, who have kindly endorsed for us when our funds of strength were low aud our social poverty notorious. When we have been burdened with many cares aud tried with, failures at home and afar off, with few strong hearts to tender support, and vexation and perplexity was our portion, we have suddenly received a line from some old and tried friend and have had our soul moved within us while perusing it. We have then sat down and read it, and re-read it, and then read it again, feeling cheered by the inspiration it imparted. Dr. Johnson entered London, youno-, friendless and penniless, with his pack on his back, intending to gain distinction by his pen. It was a bold undertaking to seek notoriety among many thousands of scribes. A great political question soon agitated the metropolis and Johnson wrote on the popular side, which attracted the attention of an in- fluential Lord, who spoke in flattering terms of the unknown author, which bi ought him to light and favor. Through life he used to say, 'kI have undying love for that great man, because he praised me when I needed to be praised.' In this we are all much alike. A little friendship, praise or good-will, is to us the most precious when we really need it ; and in these days of upheaving, that time comes quite often. While passing through the trial, give us a few friends, the more, the better, who stand firm with faith unshaken, stand in the light and bow to government, and I prize them higher than ministering angels. Of the indifference of the world to the gospel call, we are too well posted. All old stereotyped religious teaching presents to men a tyrannical angry God and no probation beyond time. The fears and terrors aroused by holding up these theories produces an agitation called conviction. When many honest souls enter the gospel, it is more labor to get them out of their false zeal and creeds, than it is their sins. Then if they stand in the way of the next gospel increase, should not sucli errors and all the convictions which grow out of them be swept away? TO BE CONTINUED.
