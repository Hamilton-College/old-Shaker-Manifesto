Canaan, N. Y. The spring has come bringing with it more of rain than anything else. Too many rainy, and so few sunny days is very discouraging to those who work on the farm and garden; but it may be better by and by, and so we will hope on and do the best we can. Our good Brother, George Clark, is laying nearly a mile of pipe to improve and increase our water facilities; but the rainy weather retards the progress of the business very much by rendering it almost impossible to get the digging done. Our energetic Sisters have raised over a thousand tomato plants in the houï¿½e which they have transferred to the hot-bed and they are growing vigorously. On the 2nd inst. they set out one thousand strawberry plants and hope next year to gather a rich supply of luscious fruit. The Brethren and boys have busily improved all the pleasant days setting out pear, plum and cherry trees and raspberry bushes, in addition to the many duties common to the season. On the night of the 4th we had a very heavy rain storm, accompanied with high winds and hail making the prospect look rather dubious for a plentiful harvest; were it not for our confidence in an allwise power we might despair; but not- 150 THE MANIFESTO. withstanding all our draw-backs we have very much for which to be thankful. While we read and bear of so many who have had their homes and property destroyed by storms, we have been greatly blest, having experienced no damages by the fury of the elements, but continue to abide in our happy home safely protected, not alone from storms, but also from the contaminating influences of a sinful world living in the enjoyment of true freedom so far as we live in accordance with and are obedient to gospel principles. We are also thankful that in this present evil generation, liberty of conscience is vouchsafed to us, and pray from the depths of our souls that the wily oppressor may not be permitted ever to usurp power in this country and thus deprive honest, earnest hearts of that most sacred of human rights, liberty of conscience. May the power and Spirit of truth and righteousness so actuate and strengthen the noble and brave as to enable them to maintain with all vigilance the cause of freedom, and vanquish the oppressor.
