READY FOR DEATH Owen Feltham He that always waits upon God is ready whensoever He calls. I will labor to set my accounts even, and endeavor to find God such to me in my life, as I would in death should he appear. If I cannot put off humanity wholly, let me put off as much as I can; and that which I must wear let me but loosely carry. When the affections are glued to the world, death makes not a dissolution but a fraction, and not only separates the soul, but tears it away. So the pain and the hazard are more. He is a happy man that lives so, as death at all times may find at leisure to die.â€”
