Canterbury, N. H. This Society is on a high ridge of land, about 900 feet above the sea. It is situated twelve miles N. E. from the city of Concord. The soil is unproductive and requires a liberal supply of manure to force a satisfactory return of grass or hoed crops. For more than thirty years we have favored the covering of the buildings with gravel, and the best workmen were engaged to conduct the business. The experiment has not proved successful. The gravel has been removed from five or six of the buildings, and the roofs are now covered with tin and painted. The honey harvest of N. H. is never very extended, and it would be difficult to count on more than four or five weeks in which to lay up much surplus honey. Some years, however, the bees and their keeper have been made glad, but this season with twenty colonies, not one pound oi surplus honey has been obtained.
