How true it is that a busy life gives velocity to the wheels of time. No wonder that our worthy editor writes of the rapid ity with which we pass around the year's cycle. 'Seed time and harvest, cold and heat. summer and winter, day and night,' pass in such swift review, that each duty therein seems to overlap its predecessor without being fully accomplished. Still all that we can do is to grasp the real Now and stamp our best upon it, trusting that since in the work of the tapestry weavers, each thread adds to the beautiful pattern, though unknown at the time to the workers, so if every day finds us steadfast in duty, true in thought, word and action, we can present our life pattern to the Master workman, without fear or remorse. How wisely the times and seasons are arranged. Surely they 'builded better than they knew' who planned that the New Year should open with its spotless page so soon after the Christian celebration of the reign of the Prince of Peace, which brings a renewal of Christian love, peace and forgiveness to all whose spiritual ear has heard the gentle call 'Follow Me.' Our holidays�if they may be so termedwere fraught with blessings so serene that we trust they may long cover us as a mantle, and breathe upon us a benediction. Our school-room is filled this winter to its utmost capacity, both boys and girls attending, with interested and devoted teachers. As a family we are remarkably blest with health, considering the devastation made by 'La Grippe' and fevers in the adjacent country; and were it not that duties and requisite strength, are not always balanced, our temperate, pure and regular manner of life, would ensure us perfect health. Infirmity will accompany age; still our loved elderly people have a panacea for useless and unhappy old age, by keeping an interest to do all the good they can, by loving and blessing the efforts of surrounding friends, and by being in sympathy with the young lives about them. Thus we are all endeavoring to so wisely study Life's problem, that we shall be able to garner both time and strength with which to serve God and our neighbor. Amelia J. Calver. 42 3^in. 15%' THE MANIFESTO. 43 Center Family. Jan. 1894. Dear Editor;�We have not much to communicate at this time. We send New Year's greetings to all the dear friends who may peruse the Home Notes of the Center family. Our winter continues quite open scarcely any snow and no sleighing at present writing, our help have to draw wood on wagons; no ice has been stored as yet though the house is all ready still we expect the old Indian proverb will hold good which was, 'Winter never rots in the sky,' but we may have to wait till March as we did some years ago. Many years in the past we had a number of industries that afforded for the Brethren and Sisters an abundance of work with remunerative returns, these have all left us or ceased to yield sufficient to warrant us in keeping them going. There are none coming in among us to keep this large inheritance of the Fathers intact, and we see or think we do, that hired help is incompatible with Community life and we are driven to'the alternative of hired help or fields lying waste. We have heard for the past forty years that the people would come, in great numbers by and by and fill our houses, 'come like doves to the windows.' 'Watchman tell us of the night what its signs of promise are?' Answer. 'Traveler o'er yon mountain's height see that glorious beaming star.' We want to see the star in all its glory and beauty and we want to see Zion's ranks filled up and so full there will be no need of a hired man in all Mount Zion. Timothy D. Ray son. Shaker Station, Conn. Jan. 1804. 'Hold fast that which is good,' is advice worth regarding. If we desire to shine as jewels in God's Kingdom we must lose nothing which adds to loveliness in our characters. It is our privilege to grow better, purer, more true and loving. We should make ourselves worthy of being loved. Deeds of sympathy, words of encouragement and love to each other, are tending to our spiritual elevation. Our hearts will be full of love, if our lives are full of purity. Let us discipline ourselves to take what each moment brings to Us of duty and of privilege. Let us perform the duty of the hour now passing. If we grasp well the meaning of the one little fragment of time present, and perform the duty that this hour brings, we shall thus do that which will please God and perfect our own lives. 'The largest park in the United States is the Yellowstone. It is sixty-five milts north and south, fifty-five miles east and west, contains three thousand five hundred and seventy five square miles and is six thousand feet above sea level.' We should take pride in having good poultry, One of the best egg producing foods is wheat. For young chickens there is nothing better. Try it now while it is cheap. About one hundred hens is the right number for an acre of land, but one hundred fowls should not run together on that acre. A flock of one hundred should be divided into four small flocks giving each flock a quarter acre. Cooked grains with vegetables has been shown to be a capital food for poultry. Daniel Orcutt. Watervliet, N. Y. Second. Family. The January No. of The Manifesto we pronounce very good as do we all the past issues. We extend to all interested, our kind thanks for their labors, knowing it takes time, talent and consecrated effort to sustiin our periodical. Our young people were ranch interested in the history of South Union and are anxiously watching for the Feb. Manifesto. We speak of this more particularly, as 44 THE MANIFESTO. they were unconscious of the fact that Elder Issachar Bates and Benj. S. Youngs were sent from Watervliet. The article brought to our minds much that we have heard our older Brethren and Sisters tell of the hardships these pioneers passed through, and the noble sacrifices they made, leaving comfortable homes, friends and relatives; all that was nearest and dearest to .the human heart, and bravely wtnt forth on their mission of love, to preach the gospel of Christ, publish the testimony of Mother Ann Lee and establish Societies in the west. We have in our possession a letter wrtiten by Elder Issachar Bates to his son Issachar Bates Jr. in 1806. This letter is short, but full of exhortations to him to cleave to the way of God. Issachar Bates Jr. was reared in this family and moved to the South family where he was for many years an Elder. After he was released from this office of trust at the South family, he returned to the home of his childhood and youth, where a few years afterward he died, a devoted, consecrated soul to the end of life, beloved by all. We had a very satisfactory meeting at the North family on Christmas; the spirit of Christ and the testimony of Mother Ann pervaded throughout the assembly. While we read of the hardships and privations the pioneers had to endure to establish the Gospel in this land, let us who are young, not peruse it as a romance, but let it awaken us to more soul energy, more conviction which will bring us nearer to the saints who have gone before and laid the foundation for the spiritual and temporal blessings we enjoy. They labored unselfishly, 'let us do the same for others; help the glorious cause along.' We have commenced to harvest the ice, which is from ten to twelve inches thick. Weather has been very changeable: no sleighing at present time. Isaac Anstatt. Temptation can not enter... Temptation can not enter where the heart is well guarded. Enfield, N. H. Jan. 1894. Chbistmas has come and gone; and was pleasantly celebrated by both young and old, in the giving of tasty and useful gifts from the branches of the Christmas trees. The New Year opens with scarcely six inches of snow on the ground; line sleighing and pleasant weather. It is the season for 'good resolutions' and we will 'weary not in well doing,' even in the letter of the law. Should we break our pledges, let us renew them whether it be April 1st or July 4th. When once formed, let them ever be before us, even though at times our standard may seem to be set too high for our aim. Our ice crop is being harvested. About twelve inches thick and of fine quality. Shall cut about forty tons. It has been decided to close our South family, and as fast as business will permit, the members are moving to the Church and North family. Elder William Wilson comes to the Church to be associated with Elder Abraham Perkins. We make them all heartily welcome, and trust that they will find in the strength of our numbers a consolation that will in some degree, compensate for the loss of their dear old home. It is one hundred years since the South family was established. On the 7th ult. we held a Society meeting at their home to commemorate this event. From the older Brethren and Sisters, we received many beautiful lessons of patience and forbearance, through examples and incidents drawn from the lives of the first Believers in this place. The room in which we met, is 50x30 ft., arched overhead and contains what has been called the finest floor among Believers. Not a nail head is visible, and the joints between the boards are scarcely discernable, so closely is the grain of the wood matched. A worthy record in itself of the faithfulness of the early Believers. G. H. Kirkley. How I came to write 'looking backward' �Edward Bellamy has written the story of 'How I Came to Write 'Looking Backward' ' for The Ladies' Home Journal. He will tell, in connection with the history of the book itself, how the idea of Nationalism first suggested itself to his mind. THE MANIFESTO. 45 North Family. Jan. 1894. I was agreeably surprised on opening the first number of our New Year's Manifesto, to note the change of its essay form. As with literature, so are all moral and secular improvements, however slight, additional strength to formulate our soul redeeming cause and to bless as we would be blest. Fervent are our prayers that 'Zion may arise, her glorious light shine forth,' not only on home relations, but environ Br. Dowe in his western mission of manifesting the fruits of the spirit and advocating the gospel lessons of regenerative life. Yea, 'Zion's interests press a little heavier than ever before,' and gospel kindred let us give heed to the cry that Zion's overladened heart sends forth; 'Let Zion move as the heart of one,' on toward the Mount of Calvary and again listen to the ten commandments which harmonize and beautify after the pattern of the inspired Revelator. However irregular the landscape round about, to the artistic mind there lies beauty and grandeur. Even so in viewing the deformities of human beings; however marked and deficient in virtue, the angel side is there. Varied opinions on various subjects will ever exist, but where the spirit of Christ abounds, these are not used as weapons to combat and destroy, but are regarded as among the non-essentials of life. Bigotry and ignorance are antagonistical to love and wisdom, and they should mellow before the effulgent rays of truth and justice and tlius purity and equality will have its progressive work of mind and soul sanctification. Our family united with the Church to enjoy Christmas festivities, which privilege adds one more event to our lives, contributing a soul force to the fashioning of our spirits for the immortal life. As our acts form a readable character, as daily they become added to the Book of Life, let us impress upon our gospel friends' Book of Memory, records of enduring worth; for it should be a truth that 'I and my people are one' in moral works and in spiritual faith. G. II. Baxter.
