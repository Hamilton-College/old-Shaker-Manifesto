Physical Death versus Future Life The World's Crisis very sharply and unchristianly criticises Otis Sawj^er's ' Shaker Cemeteries' in June Shaker; also Bro. Peebles' remarks in same number. It very plainly asserts that Spiritualism and Shakerism are not of God, but of him who fathers all the iniquities of the world since first he whispered in Eve's ear what she should never have known. The Crisis is stirred to this because we believe and know of a future exist- ence—immortality. It knows only of the grave and its dead ; the resurrection has not occurred to its Editor and numerous readers. But as a dead tree compares with a living and fruitful one—as a dead man and a dead God contrast with men of life and a God eternal— so do the teachings and philosophy of the physical resurrection of dead, and twice dead bodies compete with the religion of life which comforts us that our loved ones are not, and never were dead; but that 'their spirits are living, in beauty they are blooming' on the eternal shore. Were there any truthful philosophy in 'an irresistible force striking an immovable object,' then might the ' irresistibility ' of The Crisis, affect the ' immovableness ' of The Shaker, upon the truth of immortality. A few days will decide this point to any who now live and have doubts. But it is a curious fact that Second Advents do die; for in all the spirit peregrinations we ever heard of, not one of them has been found in the spirit world ! We will not say The Crisis is of the devil; but we do infer it is blinded by the flesh, is leading souls in the dark, and needs the enlightenment and resurrection of the Spirit which we have been favored with. *
