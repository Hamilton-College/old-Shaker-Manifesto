IMPETUS MARY WHITCHER My impetus is love to God, And love to all his creatures; Eor Him I walk the narrow road, For him, extend my labors. The flowery mead affords a joy, The song of birds a pleasure; But without heart to do for man I've no abiding treasure. The eye and ear ne'er satisfied, The selfish heart still craving, Must for a goodness be denied, Which is, the world-wide saving. To follow Christ in very deed, We're broad in our endeavor. And feel our own, another's need, As felt the lowly Savior. Canterbury, N. H.
