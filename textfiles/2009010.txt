THE CITY OF GOLD. And the City was pure Gold. O, what is our hope and our joy and our crown, When life's fleeting pleasures are o'er; When the saints with their Lord on his throne shall sit down, When the troubles of earth come no more? CHORUS. There the sun never sets and the leaves never fad?, In that beautiful city of God. The souls that each saint to the Savior hath led, His crown of rejoicing shall be; When honors have faded and treasures have fled, Like the bubbles that float on the sea. Farewell then to pleasure, to wealth, to renown, The honors that pass in a day; We seek for lost sinners, our joy and our crown, Which shall shine when the heavens pass away. The worldling may sneer and our labor despise, But winners of souls by the Lord counted wise, Shall rejoice when he cometh again. There sickness and sorrow and death are unknown, There glories on glories unfold; There the Lamb is the light in the midst of the throne, In that beautiful city of God. Selected.
