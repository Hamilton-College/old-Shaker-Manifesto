Sabbathday Lake Dec. 1890. A Happy New Year gospel kindred! Can you not hear the echo of greetings THE MANIFESTO. 19 from the little band at Sabbathday Lake? We wish you all a Glad and Happy New Year, those living among the mountains in N. Y. and N. H., also those dwelling in the sunny vallies of Ky., Conn., Ohio and Mass., our sister Society at Alfred and not forgetting the little band in Philadelphia. Our earnest desire is that we may grow and prosper in our beautiful Zion homes. We are not dying out. We know of the joy unspeakable and full of glory we feel from day to day while living out the principles of Jesus Christ, whose birth we love to celebrate and we are determined to 'Lift the virgin banner higher up.' With us, winter has commenced in ear- nest. We hear the jingle of sleigh bells and many teams are engaged hauling lumber, wood &amp;c, which seems to be the leading industry just now. Our lake was fro- zen over the 29th. of Nov. and in a few weeks the ice harvest will begin. General good health prevails at present. Our Sisters are engaged weaving plush rugs which we find to be a profitable business, at the same time keeping along those domestic duties so needful to our existence. A. S. C.
