Enfield, N. H. 'The plowing time is only a preparation for the coming flowers and fruit; the soft rains will come, the genial sunshine, and some day you will be glad of the plowing, for there is an agriculture of the soul, as well as of the land.' Yea, the plowing and harrowing time has come again, as we have faith to believe it will many more times, before mother earth shall 'be rolled as a scroll;' soon the fruit trees will look like giant bouquets, perfect marvels of loveliness! The foliage trees don their mantles of leafy beauty, and we wonder in amazement each Spring-time as if it were the first, what secret power evolves this display of art in nature, and as often, accept the ever-changing panorama of the seasons, as one evidence of a supreme power. But we will not make word pictures, for spring poetry lias deservedly received many hard rubs, and mayhap spring prose would fare no better. We use the above, quotation, for ths; thought it so opportunely gives at the close, knowing very well that some of our good readers will say in the language of our friend Ingersoll; 'One world at a time,' but there are all varieties of dispositions and degrees of travail, which furnishes the necessary friction for development. Let those who do have an eye to the future, as well as the all important now, see if there be not some unseemly weed in the garden of the heart, which may be replaced by a thing of beauty which is a joy forever, some dry and withered spot that may be made moreproductive of good works, watered by the dews of charity, bearing in faithful remembrance from this beautiful Springtime of 1892, that 'there is an agriculture of the soul, as well as of the land.' The maple harvest lias been small, and we doubt if even the little folks had all they wished, on their annual visit to the sugar camp up among the maples, but we know they had a good time, for frolic and the old camp are inseparable. The weather has been delightful for the season, more than a week of warm, sunny atmospliere loosened the icy fetters of the lake unusually early, and Apr. 11th. witnessed its free play; we watch its liberation with a genuine friendly solicitude, for its ever moving, dancing watvrs seem to form a part ojf our valley home. Kind remembrances to all. E. B.
