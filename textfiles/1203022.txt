Lowell, Mass. Dec. 27, 1881 Lowell, Mass. Dec. 27, 1881 Elder F. W. Evans, Dear Sir ;â€” This is to inform you of my whereabouts and that I have not forgotten you. I have had my land surveyed and expect to sell in a few days. Dear Sir, I will, herein, ask you a few questions, if you please. In the first place, if I come to live with you, I must quit all female society, moral or immoral, and associate with men only. Next, I must stop the use of Tobacco. Next, must live' that sober, industrious and retired life that I see among your people. Also drop all my Music, of which I have over $500, worth, and I am called a good Musician, a talent very much respected by the common people. Also, I must drop the Lecture Roll and attend strictly to the industrial duties of your Society, notwithstanding I have a cash income, sufficient to support me through life, without work. Under these circumstances, do you think it advisable for me to come and sacrifice all these so called blessings ? I presume I have all the natural instincts of the natural man. Will your sort of life become so unnatural and monotonous as to destroy all the beauties of this life ? I trust you will condescend to answer the above in your clear, honest way, and by so doing, not only oblige me, but prepare me better to know just what I am to meet, if I come with you. On sabbath, the 18th inst, I preached in Grand Army Hall, in this city, to a very large audience. Subject; Why stand ye idle. Last Sabbath, I spoke in Well's Hall, this city, before the Reform Club, of some 2000. Subject; Why do young men learn to drink ? To night, I am to speak in the Congregational Church, this city. Subject; Where is my Mother ? On Sabbath next, in the Well's Hall again. Subject; Prisons, Prisoners, and the great cause of crime. Again, will you be so kind as to enlighten me on the above subjects ? I don't want to come to you to bring discord among you nor to lead you in a new field. If I come, I want to do you good and make you happy, if possible. Sir, I look upon you as the great head of the Order, and to yoix I appeal for light on the subject. Your letter shall be strictly confidential. I still see those great golden Letters, Lebanon. What does it mean ? Please give my undivided Love to all your Family, especially to the good Brothers and Sisters with whom I spoke. Please answer and oblige your well wishing friend.
