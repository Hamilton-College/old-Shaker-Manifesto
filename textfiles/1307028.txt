DON'T [Contributed by F. W. E.] Don't sleep in a draught. Don't go to bed with cold feet. Don't sleep with insecure false teeth in your mouth. Don't stai't the day's work without a good areakfast. Don't sleep in a room without ventilation of some kind. 162 THE MANIFESTO. Don't stuff a cold lest you be next obliged to starve a fever. Don't try to get along without flannel under-clothing in winter. Don't sleep in the same under-garmentyou wear during the day. Don't toast your feet by the fire, but try sunlight or friction instead. Don't neglect to have at least one movement of the bowels each day. Don't drink ice-water by the glass; take it in sips, a swallow at a time. Don't try to keep up on coffee and alcoholics when you ought to go to bed. Don't eat snow to quench thirst; it brings on inflammation of the throat. Don't strain your eyes by reading or working with an insufficient or a flickering light. Don't use the eyes for reading or fine work in the twilight of evening or early morn. Don't try to lengthen your days by cutting short your night's rest; it is poor economy. Don't take some other person's medicine because you are troubled somewhat as they were. Don't blow out a gas-light as you would a lamp; many lives are lost every year by this mistake. Dr. Foote's Health Monthly.
