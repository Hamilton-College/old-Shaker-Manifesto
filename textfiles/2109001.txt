TRUST THOU IN GOD. Cecelia De Vere. What, cannot see? but yesterday The earth and sky were calm and bright, And ships were seen upon their way, Both to and fro, in amber light; But now the clouds like rocks are piled, The shadows creep, and all is gloomed As if fair heaven had never smiled, And earth beneath had never bloomed. There was a gladness in the air, Sweet chords of music in the breeze, It seemed as if the hand of prayer Touched reverently the leafy keys. Now all silent, save the moan Of winds that prophesy of storm, And waves that bring the undertone Of tempests where the thunders form. What, cannot see? then light thy lamp And do thy work beneath its beam, Wipe from thy brow the gathering damp, And from thy mind the fitful dream, And scorn the spirit that would doubt The shining of the sun afar, Or deem the stars were blotted out, By nature's atmospheric war. So, when the phase of darkness spreads Upon thy soul to curb its view, And in its fold hides nameless dreads, Light up thy faith with ardor new. It is ingratitude to pine, 'Tis base to murmur or shrink back; 'Tis noble to arise and shine, Tho' midnight broods on pinions black. The revelation of the morn Will melt the ebon wings away, When unto truth the soul is born, With resolution to obey. Happy the soul whate'er its meed That learns in patience to abide, And cultivates the holy seed, Till harvest's golden eventide. For sweeter is the reaper's strain ^han all the music flung on air, And richer is the reaper's gain Than all the treasures earth can bear. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
