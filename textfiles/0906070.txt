REVIVAL There has been a great revival in Wales. In the moonlight nights of the past few weeks scenes were enacted rivaling those of Martha's Vineyard. At Rhondu Valley young men tore off their studs and gilt watch chains and cast them to the earth ; girls tore their earrings from their ears and flowers from their skirts, and scattered them to the wind, while the preacher exhorted in the Welsh tongue until vast crowds arose from the kneeling posture of humiliation in which they had been listening, and executed a wild, uncouth dance, until they fell exhausted on the earth.
