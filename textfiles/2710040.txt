The Ladies' Home Journal The Indianapolis Journal prints this interesting story concerning ex-President Harrison's i'Oi tljcoming book: General Harrison has just completed the revision of his articles �which have appeared in The Ladies' Home Journal, making extended notes and additions to them. There is a little story in connection with both articles and publication. When the arrangement for the articles was made with General Harrison by Edward W. Bok, editor of The Ladies' Home Journal, the General was paid for them, with the understanding that when they were put into book form the magazine was to share the royalties accruing therefioni. Mr. Bok, however, of his own accord, generously releast General Harrison from paying him any royalty, for the reason, as he states, that by the publication of the articles by General Harrison the subscription list of his magazine was enlarged many thousands. The profits to The Ladies' Home Journal were more than the publishers anticipated, and in view of this Mr. Bok asks nothing further. General Harrison placed the disposition of his book in Mr. Bok's hands. The best offer came to the editor from the Scribners, and to them Mr. Bok gave the book for his distinguisht contributor. General Harrison's revision of the book has just been completed, and the volume will appear in the autumn. The Outlook In the Educational Number of The Outlook Professor David P.
