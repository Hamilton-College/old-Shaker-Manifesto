A SONNET. Martha J. Anderson. 'How swift the shuttle flies that weaves thy shroud.''ï¿½ Young.Time with a swift momentum plies, As through life's web his shuttle flies, Twining the fibres that fate has spun All through the years since life begun ; Threading the woof of hours and days * Drawn through our devious winding ways ; Loosing the tangled ends of time, Weaving them all in rythmic chime : Binding the broken threads of thought Each by his skillful fingers caught. ***** Soon *hall the garment woven be, Ere thou slialt filter eternity, But, 0 thou mortal! be not proud, Time with his shuttle, weaves thy shroud. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
