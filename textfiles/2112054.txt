New England Magazine One of the most interesting articles in the November magazines is Frank B. Sanborn's, 'The Home and Haunts of Lowell,' in the New England Magazine. Mr. Sanborn was for many years an intimate friend of Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, and Lowell, and he possesses a knowledge of the men which those who read their books can never attain. The personal element in this article is charming. The illustrations from pencil and pen and ink sketches made on the spot by Sears, Gallagher and William Goodrich. Beal add. to the attraction of the article. .
