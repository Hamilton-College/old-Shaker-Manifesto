The Ladies' Home Journal If we desire children to be courteous we must treat them with respect, says Klizabeth Scovii in The Ladies' Home Journal.

When it is necessary to administer reproof, let it be given in private. Many children are very sensitive on this point, and they feel acute, although they cannot put their emotions with words. To tell a child in public that it has been rude, or lacking in good breeding, is as unwarrantable as it would be to tell a guest so. It is no excuse to say that we are trying to teach it to do better; we (�:�-. do tiis with greater effect if we take � it aside at ti.e first convenient moment and gently point out where the error was, and what should be done the next time. New England Magazine One of the most interesting articles in the November magazines is Frank B. Sanborn's, 'The Home and Haunts of Lowell,' in the New England Magazine. Mr. Sanborn was for many years an intimate friend of Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, and Lowell, and he possesses a knowledge of the men which those who read their books can never attain. The personal element in this article is charming. The illustrations from pencil and pen and ink sketches made on the spot by Sears, Gallagher and William Goodrich. Beal add. to the attraction of the article. .
