THE STORM AT EVENTIDE. By Eva Pinkham. The earth in rich, perfected beauty lay Wrapt in her summer robe of varied hues, Soft-tinted by the sun's last, lingering ray. The warblers, chirping forth their latest songs, Betokened peace and rest. The flocks and herds Grazed drowsily in the verdant meadow-lands Through which the murmuring brooklet winds its path. The air was rife with scent of new-mown hay And mingled redolence of fragrant flowers. The glint of sunset's gold through leafy boughs Was as a faint remembrance of the day. The dusky pines reared their brown, moss-clad trunks In gloomy outline 'gainst the deep blue sky; And the whippoorwill's sad note from yonder Covert seemed an oracle of sorrow. The dying breezes whispered sweet farewells. All nature's myriad voices, slumbering,. Bespoke the calm, still hush of eventide. But lo! anon the sky was overcast With darkness, and above the mountain's crest Loomed huge, black clouds like giant pedestals, Inlaid with a strange, peculiar redness Which foretold unwelcomed visitations. The lightning's flash, rending the ebon mass. For a moment, made more intense the gloom. The distant thunder, peal on peal,, drew near And louder grew. The storm came on apace With dreaded fury, and at length it burst In wind, and rain, and hail upon the earth, Whose fields, once fair and smiling in their pride, Now met their doom in one, short, fated hour. It seemed as if the gods had kindled wrath Against the people,�as when the fiery Majesty of Zeus, blazed in anger At the brave Prometheus, who, amid THE MANIFESTO. 35 The din and roar of the tempest, still spake Of the day when good would triumphantly rise O'er the unjust power.� Still the storm increased � And raged in madness,�as a beast of prey, , � . Wounded, springs upon its helpless victim.� ���;. All hearts were filled with terror, as volley On volley of hailstones struck the dwellings, And 'mid the roaring, crashing thunder-peals,' The lightning's vived flashes, prayers arose, Silently entreating heaven's protection. When lo! a calm; as when the Savior stilled The waves on Galilee, the gentle voice now Seemed to rise above the storm, commanding The elements of turbulence,�'Be still.'� Once more quietness reigned throughout the land And night's dark pall enveloped all below, Concealing desolation from the view. The hours wore on and soon the morning dawned. The light of day revealed the harvest fields, Whose golden grain just ripened,�kissed by Sunbeams and swayed by gentle zephyrs,� Told of plenty, now ruined and laid low. The whole scene bespoke of devastation. The ground was strewn with leaves, as in Autumn; Here and there a branch hung, cleft from its trunk. The gardens, once so fair and beautiful,� Filled with many lovely plants and flowers That fraught the atmosphere with odors rare; From whose waxen chalices, rich nectar Offered substance for the bee to gather,� Now were blighted and their glory stolen. Yet, e'en while the flowerets lay withering, Emanating from their torn and bleeding hearts, Mingled perfumes floated up to heaven As an essence of sweet, forgiving love. Thus should all God's children offer tokens Of appreciation and contentment, Though adversity attends with sorrow, Or prosperity with her gilded hours. For, a little lower than the angels Was man created.� 36 THE MANIFESTO. Should not angel-flowers Of virtue send forth fragrance from the soul Unto God, as gifts of love, for his care ? Canaan, i\r. T'. The foregoing is an allusion to the hail-storm which occurred at Canaan, N. Y., July 22, 1893.
