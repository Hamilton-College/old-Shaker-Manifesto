Text.--The Lord is far from the wicked... Text.ï¿½The Lord is far from the wicked, but he heareth the cry of the righteous. If we wish to have tVie Lord with us we will try to do right. It is written, 'If ye love me, keep ni.y commandments.' How can we think that we love Him if we do not do as he wishes us to do? He gave us all that we have. What can we give Him? I think that love is the best gift we can ever give Him And if we love Him it will be seen in our life. We shall be kind to all and try hard to do right. If we really want and earnestly ask for help He will give it to us. To do right we must have our hearts free from wrong, so that God's spirit may dwell therein, for God cannot dwell where there is sin. Sarah Morgan.
