A LITERARY CURIOSITY. [Contributed by Genevieve DeGraw.] 'The following is one of the most remarkable compositions we have ever met with. It evinces an ingenuity peculiarly its own. The initial capital letters spell 'My boast is in the glorious cross of Christ.' The words in italics, when read on the left side from top to bottom, and on the right side from bottom to top, form the Lord's Prayer, complete:' Make known the gospel truth, our Father King, Yield up thy grace, dear .Father from above, Bless us with hearts which feelingly can sing, 'Our life thou art for ever God of Love.' Assuage our grief in love for Christ we pray, Since the Prince of Heaven and glory died Took all our sins and hallowed the display, Infant 6e-ing, first a man and then was crucified. Stupendous God! thy grace and power make known; In Jesus' name let all the world rejoice, Now labor in thy heavenly kingdom own, That blessed kingdom, for thy saints the choice. How vile to come to thee is all our cry; Enemies to thyself and all that's thine; Graceless our will, we live for vanity; Loathing the very &amp;e-ing, evil in design, O God, thy wifcL be done from earth to heaven; Reclining on the gospel, let us live, In earth from sin, deliver-eA and forgiven, Oh! as th3rself but teach us to forgive, Unless its power temptation doth destroy; Sure is our fall into the depth of woe, Carnal in mind, we've not a glimpse of joy Raised against heaven; in us no hope we know, O give us grace and lead us on thy way; Shine on us with thy love and give us peace Self and this sin that rise against us stay, Oh! grant each day our trespass-es may cease; Forgive our evil deeds that oft we do; Convince us daily of them to our shame; Help us with heavenly bread, forgive us, too, Righteous Lord, and we'll adore thy name In thy forgive-ness we as saints can die, Since for us and our trespasses so high, Thy Son, our Savior, died on Calvary Selected.
