What a pity it is... What a pity it is that those who love the Lord and are denominating themselves the true light to a wicked world, should stop on their heavenward journey and dispute over the fastenings of their Sunday go-to-meeting-coat or the acceptability, to the Lord of an uncultured voice in preference to the tones of a good instrument. And yet we are informed that such is the fact. One church is being divided because some of the members choose to fasten their coats with buttons instead of hooks and eyes. And the other church is becoming divided because a certain class forbid the use of an organ in the time of religious service. It is surprising how much talk and confusion such trifling nonessentials will create. 'Behold how great a fire a little matter kindleth.'
