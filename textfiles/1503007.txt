ALFRED, ME., No. 3. BY ELDER OTIS SAWYER. Origin of tbe Shakers in Maine. New Li^lit Baptists, called Merry Dancers Come-outers, etc.They, therefore, marched in upon the Community, very unceremoniously, except through the medium before named, which was a common occurrence. In this case the party were met at the door with a hearty,� 'Welcome here, we were expecting you, Mother saw you several days ago and bade us prepare to receive you, Come right in. ' They all felt that they really had arrived home to their Mother's house, indeed, and were not strangers to each other, although they had never before met face to face. Mother Ann at that date was very feeble in body, but she told her attendants that those people that had taken so much pains to come such a long distance to see her and the Eiders, must all have the privilege to do e-o. James Merrill was over seventy years of age. His flowing locks were as white as thesnow. Mother Ann had for James a.special gift of blessing, because one so aged should undertake such a long tedious journey, to seehis gospel friends. The brethren that remained in charge of the vessel, were relieved by those who went first to Niskeyuna, and every one of the company enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing Mother and the Elders, and receiving from them, such counsel as fitted their condition, with a full assurance of the hundred fold blessing if they were faithful to bear the cross of Christ, and yield a willing obedience to the gift of God through a visible lead. One day while this company from Main� were at Niskeyuna, another large company came that wanted to see Mother Ann. They were from different parts of the country, but her attendants deemed it imprudent, in her feeble state, to favor them with a personal interview. Mother Ann, however, realized how disappointed they would be, and supported by the sisters she walked out on the piazza, and spoke a few encouraging wordsto them. The company from Maine while with the Elders, attended many gifted, religious meetings, and received much good counsel. Their faith was strengthened and they were blest with many divine gifts. The Brethren and. Sisters returned to their vessel at Alban}- and were soon sailing down the Hudson, anxious to return home as soon as possible. In the evening of Sept. 7th. after they had left N. Y. they encountered ;v terrible storm. The winds and high waves rocked their little craft so severely that they were, every moment, in imminent danger of going to the bottom. This fearful storm continued all night, and nearly everyone on board gave up all hope of ever again reaching the land. Ezekiel Hatch that brave old revolutionary hero who had for seven years fearlessly faced the foe on many a bloody battle field, sat down and braced � his feet, to keep from being thrown about, became as pale as a corpse, and said he expected every time a wave struck the vessel, that they should be wrecked. On the morning of the 8th, when their fears were intense, Dana Thorns, saw, in vision, Mother Ann who looked calm and smilingly upon her and with uplifted hands breathed peace to the troubled sea and from that moment all fear was taken away. She communicated her vision to the company which inspired them with fresh hope and courage, calling forcibly to their minds the account given in the fourth chapter of Mark, where the presence of Jesus saved the ship, and by his prayer and command, calmed the fierce winds and turbulent waves. Inspired frith this new courage each one did his duty faithfully, the storm subsided, the sea became calm and they soon expressed their joy and thanksgiving in songs and in prayer. They sailed safely into Portland harbor early on Sunday morning and landed at the wharf, in season for all to leave at sunrise for Falmouth. After travelling about three miles they arrived at the residence of Edmund Merrill, where they all took breakfast. It was but a short time after their arrival home that the sad intelligence reached them that Mother Ann's work on earth was finished and her spirit had gone to the land of souls. Noting the time of her death and the time that sister Dana saw her, was about six hours after her demise. In Sept. 1784 a company of ten Brethren and Sisters left Alfred to visit Mother Ann and the Elders at Niskeyuna. This journey was made in the saddle. On reaching Albany, they heard the painful news of the death of Mother Ann. , Before reaching Niskeyuna they met Father James and others who were on their way to New Lebanon, Father James was very glad to meet the friends from Alfred, and expressed much sorrow at the great disappointment it would be to them to be deprived r&gt;f the privilege of seeing the visible form of Mother Ann. As soon as he spoke the name of Mother, he began to weep, and immediately alighting from his horse, dropped upon his knees in prayer. As soon as the horses could be secured, the whole company were on their knees in prayer with Father James. It had been said of Father, and very truly, that when he wept the stoutest hearts would melt in tears of sympathy with him. Father James made a most fervent and heart felt prayer, imploring every one, who had received faith, to continue steadfast iiji the way of well doing, and to keep themselves pure and unspotted from the world, and from everything that defiles the spirit or brings condemnation upon the soul. 'My two friends are gone, ' said he, ' O pray for me, that I may have strength to bear the bun den now resting upon me, to nourish and strengthen every precious soul committed to my charge, that the least child may not suffer loss through my unfaithfulness.' Father James then blessed the company from Alfred, and each proceeded on their way. After visiting Niskeyuna cr Watervliet, they went to New Lebanon, N. Y. and returned by the way of Harvard, Mass. In the summer of 1785 Father James made his first and only visit into the state or Province of Maine. He was accompanied by Elders, Henry Clough, Job Bishop, EleazeF Rand and Ebenezer Co.oley. Father James went as far east as Gorham where he held meetings and preached to large audiences. At one service his text was taken from the 87th Psalm. 37th verse. ' Mark the perfect man and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.' From this he delivered an able discourse. He gave a clear and plain explanation of the Scripture, and of the work of God through Jesus Christ; that a new revelation of God was now made known through Mother Ann, and that the ax was laid at the root of the forbidden tree. Father James, in some of his testimonies was very plain and pointed against every sin, especially the carnal indulgences of the nature of the flesh. This sometimes aroused a spirit of opposition, and at one time Richard Edwards created some disturbance by interrupting Father James, several times, while speaking, much to the annoyance of a large majority present. John Stevenson of Gorham, a brave old sea captain could bear it no longer, and commanded Edwards to sit down, 'Sit down' said he, ' and hold your tongue and let this man preach. You know how to make a plough, and an ox yoke, but you don't know how to preach. This man Whittaker knows how to preach, and we want to hear him, and we want you, Edwards, to be still and lisjten to what he has to say. ' (TO BE CONTINUBP-) op
