PREPARE THY HEART By Lucy S. Bowers Be still, ye waves of restless thought and care, Be still, wild winds of worldly strife and woo, Sweet Peace on silver wing is hovering low. Within thy heart a welcome place prepare For her, the subject of thy hope and prayer. Flee every troubling guest thy soul may know, Ambition, Pride, which wander to and fro Despoilers of the bliss which tliou sliouldst share. Let in the angels of Truth, Joy and Light, Who swell the fulness of sweet harmony, Who guard love's ceaseless fountain pure and bright, They are the ministers of God to tliee. Make welcome these, and Peace will find a place, And fill thee with her own unfailing grace. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
