THE INCREASE CECELIA DEVYR If but the Polar regions we had known, How could we paint the tropics rich and rare ? Or of a strange seed sparsely round us thrown, E'en guess the harvest that it yet might bear? The lightning, drawn upon a single string. Seemed but like child's play in the years gone by ; And now it forms for earth a magic ring, On which her thoughts and interests safely fly. We know fair Spring and sunny Summer hours, We know rich Autumn and old Winter cold ; But there are round us and within us powers We cannot know, 'till they their life unfold. We may not tamper with the lightning's flame ; Nor gather fruit in misty blossom time ; Nor from green summer autumn's treasures claim ; But we must wait the viewless laws sublime. The earth revolving on her aerial course, Or turning to the star-space, or the sun, Receives impetus from a hidden force, And thus secure, her dangerous path can run. But out amongst the midnights of our life, We grope in darkness, or we stand in tears; Contend with shadows, wage an aimless strife, Or cowering, shrink before our gathered fears ! And what we lack is Faith that can confide, And never count the measure of its trust; A deep reliance spreading far and wide, 'Till doubt and disobedience are as dust. And then the heavenly, hidden law can take Our willing souls to govern and recast ; No lingering weakness, and no gloom, can break Our growing prospects in the Future vast. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
