'What is Religion?' BY SAMANTHA BOWIE It is an awakening of truth in the soul; a love for God; giving a just sense of one's duty, by opening the eyes of the soul to the great end and purpose of life—redemption. It does not consist of words, thoughts nor actions; but these are governed by the living principle of religion. How admirable is that religious belief, which, while it seems to have in view, not alone the soul's felicity in another world, but effectually secures its happiness in this life ! Religion is being good; and this is being like God. The various names given to religion are subject to much odium; but all admire the fruits of religion in a pure life. Morality is one step towards pure religion. Spirituality is in its advance. All things of real beauty and worth have their origin in pure religion; and nothing will satisfy the soul's demands but practical religion Under the influence of true religion the soul is mild, humane, and only spiritually inclined, working untiringly for humanity. It teaches souls to serve God through the love of a pure life, and not from the fear of his displeasure. There are many creeds, but there is one only religion, and this will make of all humanity, one relationship in spirit, by bringing all into a life that is alone found in Christ—pure, vir- ginal, pentecostal.
