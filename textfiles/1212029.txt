Juvenile THE MYSTERY OP THE SEED. Lucy Larcom. Children dear, can you read The mystery of the seed— . The little seed that will not remain In earth, but rises in fruit and grain? A mystery, passing strange Is the seed, in its wonderous change; Forest and flower in its husk concealed, And golden wealth of harvest-field. Ever around, and above Works the invisible love, It lies in the heaven and under the land, In blossom and sheaf and reaper's hand. Sower, you surely know That the harvest never will grow Except for the angel's snow and rain Who water and ripen the springing grain! Awake for us, heart and eye, Are watchers beyond the sky; There are unseen reapers in every band Who lend their strength to the weary hand. When the wonderful light breaks through From above, on the work we do We can see how near our helpers are Who carry the sickle and wear the star. Sower, you surely know That good seed never will grow Except for the angel of joy and pain, Who scatter the sunshine and pour the rain.' Child, with the sower sing! Love is in every thing! The secret is deeper than we can read— But we gather the grain if we sow the seed.— Lucy Larcom in St. Nicholas.
