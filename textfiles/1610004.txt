THE VALLEY OF SILENCE. BY FATHER RYAN. In the hush of the Valley of Silence I dream all the songs that I sing; And the music floats down the dim valley, Till each finds a word for a wing, That to hearts, like the dove of the Deluge, A message of peace they may bring. But far on the deep there are billows That never shall break on the beach; And I have heard songs in the silence That never shall float into speech; And I have had dreams in the valley Too lofty for language to reach. And I have seen thoughts in the valley� Ah me ! how my spirit was stirred! And they wear holy veils on their faces� Their footsteps can scarely be heard; They pass through the valley like virgins, Too pure for the touch of a word. Do you ask me the place of the valley, Ye hearts that are harrowed by care ! It lieth afar between mountains, And God and His Angels are there ; And one is the dark mountain of Sorrow, And one the bright mountain of Prayer ! Metrop olitan.
