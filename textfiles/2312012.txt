South Union, Ky. Nov. 1893. The health of Society is much improved since we wrote last, and bids fair to continue good. As to our business affairs, garden vegetables and a small crop of winter apples have been secured, and we are now housing provender for the stock, and gathering corn; which we find to be a fair crop. Perhaps the corn crop of the entire Society will amount to 8,000 bushels. The weather at present is delightful, and we are having a beautiful fall, such as we do not experience oftener than once in ten years. Elder L. Piercifield is absent in Mississippi, on business, and will probably be absent for several weeks. In spiritual matters, though we have some correspondence, we have not had many additions in point of numbers. James H. Richardson.,
