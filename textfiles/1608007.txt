FAITH AND WORKS. ALONZO G. HOLLISTER. It is written; ' The just shall live by faith.' But ' faith without works is dead,' therefore a faith that saves must be a living principle, producing works, or fruits, whereby its quality is known. Hence, those who receive the faith of God in Christ, which teaches among other things that every one will be rewarded for their works, good or evil, according to the strict rules of justice, work out for themselves the character of Sons and Daughters of God, by ceasing from their own wills that they may do the will of God, and manifest His righteousness in their conduct, by the fruits of a righteous faith. '�' Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit. ' The belief of one who sins, and trusts to be saved by the merits of another, from meeting its consequences, is equally manifest by works. He professes to believe and follow Christ who knew no sin, but really believes he cannot live without sin, which in one sense is a fact, because his life is in those works which Christ requires his subjects to hate and forsake�and should he utterly renounce and forsake them all, he would certainly die to all carnal pleasure, as did Jesus, and rise with Mm in the resurrection of life eternal. But,' 'Why call ye me Lord ! Lord ! and do not the things that I say?' 'He that committeth sin is the servant of sin, ' and 'no man can serve two masters, for either he will love the one and hate the other, or else he will cleave to the one and despise the other. ' It is evident from the writings of the Apostles, that those who honestly obeyed Christ's doctrine from the heart, received power over sin. But those who, under a profession of following Moses cleaved to sin, despised God's messengers of their own time, of whom Moses testified. And so loving sin, they were blinded and led by it, for which cause, they hated and persecuted unto death those messengers of Truth, who endeavored to persuade them to cease from sin, that they might not reap its wages. Consequently their 'green tree' ceased ;o bear fruit to God, and became ' the dry tree, ' and their house was left unto them ' desolate ' of any saving grace or virtue. Hence, after all the good grain that was among them was harvested by the messengers of Christ, the protecting power of God was withdrawn, and ' the flood' of clashing and destructive elements which sin ever generates, consumed and swept them out of the way. And just so surely as history repeats itself through the operation of interior causes, may all ecclesiastical organizations claiming the name of Christianity that make provision for the works of natural generation, and the gratification of the corrupt propensities of fallen nature, read the decree of their destiny in Revelations, xviii. For all systems that are built upon hearing the sayings of Christ, and doing them not, are likened to a house that was built upon the sand. And when the rains of heavenly righteousness descended, and the floods of light and truth came and beat against that house, it fell, and great was the fall of it, because it was founded upon the sand. Such are a-11 the buildings erected, (not by God) but by men who profess to follow Christ with their lips, but deny him in works, and thus dishonor his name. Of whom Christ said 'Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name ? And in thy name have cast out demons ? And in thy name done many wonderful works? ' And then will I profess unto them I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity. ' Repent! Repent ! for that day is revealed which shall try every man's work. O that all men would hearken and obey the silent monitor conscience, cease to do evil and learn to do well, that they may receive and know the voice of God in His messengers, in their own age and time ; and commence the practice of those works that belong to their everlasting peace and to lay up an interest and substance in eternity ; which begins here, in all who obey the law of eternal life revealed in Christ.
