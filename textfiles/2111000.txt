THE KENTUCKY REVIVAL. By Richard M'Nemar of Union Village, Ohio. Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 11. Dreams, Visions, and Prophecy. Danville, October 18, 1804. To the Moderator of the Synod of Kentucky.' In these sublime figures was couched the whole purport of the Schismatic vision, the corning of the Lord's kingdom with power. A one body of people, united in Christ by the pure bond of love ; the house, habitation or dome of the king of kings, in which the groanings of Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists and Christians, for the wounds of their petty, party causes should not be heard. A Zion or pure gospel church, shaking herself from the dust, from every thing unclean ; all that belongs to the serpent, and shining forth like the sun in his brightness. Making the people to tremble, and shaking terribly the nations. Consuming the man of sin, and opening a stream of everlasting righteousness upon the earth. Thrse were bold figures, and that they were just about to be substantiated, required something more than a vain imagination to evince. Sleeping and waking, the whole topic with these Schismatics, was the increasing work of God, and the blessed kingdom just about to appear, and each one contemplating it through some special dream or vision, in which they felt confident they had a particular revelation of the Lord's Christ. This was the kind of manna which they were daily gathering. In some of these rapturous scenes, they professed to be carried out of the body, and to be favored with a particular interview with the spirits of their departed friends., and to see and learn their different allotments in the invisible world. Sometimes they mixed with great multitudes who had embraced religion in the past century, and were waiting for the new Jerusalem to appear, and the way to be opened into the holy City. At other times they professed to see the holy City in the bright and heavenly glory, and to hear the songs of the angelic host; and attempting to join them in their music, occasioned the melodious sound, that entering into the overshadowing cloud of such celestial witnesses, perfumed their whole soul and body with a peculiar fragrance, which rendered everything of a mortal nature, disagreeable and unsavory. This peculiar fragrance, which could not be found in any thing upon earth, but the subjects of these strange operations, seemed of all other things, to bring the heavenly state the nearest to the senses of these people. Under the influence of this singular perfume, they would swoon away sometimes three or four times in a day, recover, rise and dance with such elevated springs, as might render it doubtful to the spectator, whether they properly belonged to the inhabitants of this globe, or to some other family of beings. Besides these singular transports, they had another species of vision, more universal, in which the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, plains, vegetables, animals and a thousand particular things and circumstances in nature, were used as emblems of things in the spiritual world, or kingdom of Christ. One has a night vision of two suns, another of three moons, another, wide awake sees a great platform of- bright stars in the noon-day hemisphere. From these they descend to apparitions of strange things upon earth. One discovers a certain spot of ground illuminated all over with the brightness of burning lire, and thousands of human beings Hocking to it from all quarters, and instantly purified from all the effects of a gross and fleshly nature. Another sees the air crowded with birds of prey, commissioned to devour the flesh of every dead beast. Another sees a road marked out in the color of bright light, a thousand miles long, and stands with his visual faculties intensely fixed upon it, until he discovers certain persons coming forth with good news from afar. Some in their visions were employed in crossing rivers, climbing mountains, finding treasures, fighting serpents, or more delightfully employed in eating the fruits of the tree of life, bathing in clear water, casting off old garments and putting on new. In a word, all nature seemed to be impregnated with a new and spiritual quality, which rendered every object and every transaction presented to the mind, whether sleeping or waking, susceptible of some signification which respected the then present work. These short sketches may serve to recognize the astonishing raptures in which the Schismatics were carried along in full expectation of the kingdom of Christ. Such was the unrenritted flow of that spirit, which transmuted every thing into a different appearance, that were it supposable that disembodied spirits could enter living men and women, it might be thought that every visionary, recorded either in sacred or profane history, had rendezvoused in the Schismatics, and borrowed their active powers to revise their endless train of types and figures. At least it was, no doubt with the greatest propriety, that these singular people appropriated to their day the full and perfect accomplishment of the following prophecy of Joel. 'I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams�and I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire and vapors of smoke.' They did not consider that the spirit of prophecy, or their dreams and visions and other signs had any thing in them to be depended upon for salvation. But as the merchant hangs out signals about his door, to direct the people where to come for merchandize; so were the prophesier, the dreamer, the visionist, the sweet singer, and fragrant dancer, hung out to the view of the world, to show where God was about to open his everlasting kingdom of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. This kingdom was what the Schismatics were peculiarly interested in, and short of this they determined never to stop. About the latter end of the year 1804, there were regular societies of these people in the state of Ohio: at Turtle-Creek, Eagle-Creek, Springfield, Orangedale, Salem, BeaverCreek and Clear-Creek. And in Kentucky ; at Cabbin-Creek, Flemingsburgh, Concord, Caneridge, IndianCreek, Bethel, Paint-lick and Shawnyrun, besides an innumerable multitude dispersed among the people in Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, and the western parts of Pennsylvania, who were exercised more or less with the same spirit. Praying, shouting, jerking, barking or rolling; dreaming, prophesying, and looking as through a glass, at the infinite glories of mount Zion, just about to break open upon the world. At least those who were foremost in the schism, expected beyond a doubt, that another summer would not roll by with any degree of the light, gifts and power of God, short of that which bringeth full and complete salvation from all sin. In this expectation, besides the common exercises of shaking hands and pledging themselves to each other by every thing sacred, that they would persevere in the sin-killing work unto the full feast of the lamb, they practiced a mode of prayer which wfis as singular as the situation in which they stood, and the faith by which they were actuated. According to their proper name of distinction they stood separate and divided, each one for one; and in this capacity, they offered up each their separate cries to God in one united harmony of sound, by which the doubtful footsteps of those who were in search of the meeting, might be directed sometimes to the distance of miles. Whatever this portentous concert might have addressed to God in the inner man, a sensible spectator with the slightest attention might have gathered the general import of their univocal prayer, from such language as the following :� 'Lord God, Almighty ! Thou hast promised unto us eternal life, and this life is in thy Son. Thou art no respecter of persons. Glory to thy name, we believe it is thy will that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. We venture upon thy promise, and roll our souls upon thy truth and faithfulness, as the rock of eternal ages. Thou hast invited us to come to the waters, without money and without price. Heaven's King, thou knowest that we are thirsty. We have long wandered in the dry, sandy desert of sin ; but glory to God, we believe there is an everlasting fountain opened, and our souls have already begun to taste the blessed waters. But Lord, we are net satisfied. We want the fulness ; and we believe thou hast given us the foretaste, not to disappoint us ; but to encourage us to press on to the overflowing fountain: and short of that we cannot stop. We want to bathe in the ocean of redeeming love, and wash away the last and least remains of a fallen nature. Jesus, Master, we want to be like thee ; holy, as thou art holy, without spot, and blameless. Come, Lord, and finish thy work! Cut it short in righteousness. We doubt not, it is thy will, even our sanctification. Thy perfect will is all we want to know. O send by whom thou wilt send. Work by means of thine own choosing; only supplant, root out, consume and destroy the man of sin, the son of perdition, and set our souls at perfect liberty from his iron bondage. Jesus, Lord, inscribe thy character on our every faculty. Make our bodies the fit temples of the Holy Spirit. Diffuse thy nature through all our active powers ; and let every member be moved and actuated by the impulse divine.' Could language b3 invented more expressive of the near approach of the day of real, positive, and full redemption? It therefore remains to give some account of those important realities, to which the foregoing signs and wonders pointed, and for the entrance upon which, they served as a preparation. 'Shout, Christians shout, the Lord is come! Prepare, prepare to make him room! On earth he reigns, we feel him near, The signs of glory now appear.' (to be continued.)
