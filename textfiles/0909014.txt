CAN WE OBJECT TO THE COMPETITION? It is amusing to see the tables turned in this way, as described by the New York Tribune : ' The heathen are organizing foreign missions for the conversion of Christians. The Hindus of the sacred city of Benares have founded a society for the propagation of Brahminism among the Christians of Australia. An eminent Brahmin of the name of Suradschi, a man of great authority, has recently been visiting some of the English colonies, and while traveling in Australia, was appalled and grieved at the fearful prevalence of drunkenness among the Christians. On returning to India he called together a number of thoughtful Brahmins, to whom he communicated his glowing zeal to do something for the salvation of their degraded fellow-men and fellow-subjects in Australia. The only perfect remedy, he considered, would be the conversion of these Christians to a better and purer faith. A large sum was collected for the pious and benevolent enterprise, and some of the Brahmins declared their willingness to devote themselves to the work, and to spend and be spent in this humane and holy cause. Suradschi is now engaged in translating fitting passages from the Vedas into the English tongue, for the use of the missionaries.'
