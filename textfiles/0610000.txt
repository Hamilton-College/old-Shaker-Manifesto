THE SACRAMENT ELIJAH MYRICK ' And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said take, eat; this is my body.' Which was his body ? Those whom he was addressing 1 Who had continued with him in his temptations ? To whom he appointed a kingdom as his father had appointed unto him ? Who were to be the body through which Christ would continue to be manifest ? Or was it the bread which he passed round as a symbol of union ? And while he was committing to them this great trust — this life — this new testament for many, for the remission of sins, did he not pass the cup as a seal of unity — a confirmation that they were one living body ? If this version is good grammar, and makes Jesus appear more sensible, then cast away the old bottles of tradition, and seek new bottles for the fruit of the vine, which we shall partake of, new, in our Father's (and mother's) kingdom. Heed no longer dying echoes — Echoes from the voices gone 1 While the trumpet voice of progress, Tells us of a brighter dawn. Harvard, Mass.
