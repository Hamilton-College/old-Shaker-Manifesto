ANSWERED PRAYER JANE CORNELL 'Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.! Now weary with straying, O Lord I am praying For guidance and strength, that I at length May safely reach home. The world now forsaking my cross humbly taking O Father I come. But nature uprising with power surprising My way doth impede, and shows me the need Of seeking thy grace. O Father relieve me, in mercy receive me, And show me thy face. O Lord art thou heeding the voice of my pleading, My soul's earnest cry, that thou wilt draw nigh To succor and bless ? For the power of sin and the traitors within ;[â€¢ Do sorely oppress. O Savior attend me, in pity befriend me O lend me thine aid, lest I be dismayed And courage I lack. And tremblingly quail, or through weakness fail The foe to beat back. My sure refuge thou art, and I ne'er will depart From the foot of the throne, till thou shalt make known Thou hearest my prayer. My cause still repeating, thy mercy entreating, I will not despair. O soul shout for gladness! Arise from thy sadness! And humbly rejoice, for a still small voice Whispers low to my heart, God's promise is sure, and will ever endure; In peace now depart. O blessed assurance of thy love's endurance! To this promise tender I now do surrender All lingering doubt. [made free 'They who come unto me and through Christ are I will not cast out.' Shakers, N. Y.
