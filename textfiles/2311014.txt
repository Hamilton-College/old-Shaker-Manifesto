PATIENCE. Lucy S. Bowers. Oh live by faith, yea, calmly trust and wait, Nor fret for that which time may yet reveal. An earnest hope, 'tis life and joy to feel, But harsh impatience brings no happy state. 'Tis best to work, be efforts small or great Self-sacrificing for another's weal; Then God who feels desire may soon unseal Some fount of bliss and open heaven's gate. When frost abounds, we wish for summer air; When storms becloud we long for sunny light When blossoms come we want the fruitage fair But wait we must, God's way alone is right. Yea, calm content with patient toil and prayer, Will give more peace, and happier thoughts invite. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
