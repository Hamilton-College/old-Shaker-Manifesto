THE WAY OF THE WORLD Yes, stone the woman—let the man go free ! Draw back your skirts lest they perchance May touch her garments as she passes ; But to him put forth a willing hand To clasp with his that led her to destruction And disgrace. Shut up from her the sacred Ways of toil, that she no more may win an Honest meal; but ope to him all honorable Paths, where he may win distinction. Give to him fair, pressed down measures of Life's sweetest joys. Pass her, 0 maiden, With a pure proud face, if she puts out A poor, polluted palm ; but lay thy hand in His on bridal day, and swear to cling to him With wifely love and tender reverence, Trust him who led a sister woman To a fearful fate. Yes, stone the woman—let the man go free! Let one soul suffer for the guilt of two— It is the doctrine of a hurried world, Too out of breath for holding balances Where nice distinctions and injustices Are calmly weighted-. But, ah, how will it be On that strange day of final fire and flame When men shall stand before the one true Judge ? Shall sex make then a difference in Sin ? Shall He, the Searcher of the hidden Heart, in His eternal and divine decree, Condemn the woman and forgive the man ?
