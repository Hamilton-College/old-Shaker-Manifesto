GIFT OF TONGUES '' I saw an Angel flying in the midst of Heaven — the religious world in man — having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell upon the earth — to every nation, kindred, tongue and people.' The preaching was to fear God and worship him — not to worship the beast and his image. Here is the patience of the saints who keep the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy. There appeared a white cloud with a woman sitting upon it, like unto Jesus. That cloud was composed of persons, 'clothed in fine linen, clean and white'—with characters, like the woman. She thrust, into the earth, a sharp sickle, to reap it — the testimony of Jesus against generation. The sign of the first Gospel degree, was the Gift of Tongues — Mother Ann spake in seventy-two different languages, thus showing that she was in rapport with the representatives of the nations, who needed the Gospel in the spirit world, and that to all of them the Gospel would be preached, and a crop gathered therefrom, of such souls as were ripe unto the harvest. Throughout the sounding of this first testimony the gift of tongues invariably rested upon those whom the Spirit raised up as leaders to preach and minister the Gospel, from Mother Ann, to Samuel Johnson and Richard Bushnell, who were greatly gifted in tongues.
