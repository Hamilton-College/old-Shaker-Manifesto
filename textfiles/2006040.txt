Juvenile. A BIBLE STORY. One nice Sunday morning three of we little girls went to see sister Sally Ceeley who is eighty-three jears old and she told us this nice Bible story. In the city of Lazarus there lived a man by the same name who had two sisters named Martha and Mary. Mary left Martha to get dinner and do all the house-work while she spent,the time sitting at Jesus' feet visiting him. Martha didn't like to do all the work, no more than I should, so she spoke to Jesus about it and Jesus reproved Martha and told her that Mary had chosen that good part which should not be taken from her. This meant that it was better to stop and visit the Savior than it was to be so anxious about something to eat. Canterbury, N. H. 8 yrs. old. Lou Leonard. THE GOOD SAMARITAN. A long time ago when Jesus was living, there came to him, so I have been told, a rich man who asked him who was his neighbor and Jesus told him this story. Once there was a poor man who started for Jericho. While on his way he met some ruffians who took his clothes and his nionay and left him almost dead. Soon after amin- ister came by on the same road and saw this man but didn't help him. The same day another man came by whom they called a Levite and he thought himself too good and rich to take care of this poor man, so left him and went on his way. Towards night a good Samaritan came by and pitying him bound up his wounds and gave him some milk from a bottle that he had in his pocket and put him on his horse and took him to a hotel and asked the Landlord to take care of him and when he came tho next day he would pay him for his trouble. When he finished, Jesus asked this rich man who was neighbor to the poor man and he said the good Samaritan. 8 yrs. old. Canterbury, N. H. Gertna Curtis.
