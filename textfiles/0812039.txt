A Good Law The State of Indiana made a law in 1835, that for every profane and blasphemous use of the name of God, Jesus Christ or other sacred names, a fine of not less than one, nor more than three dollars shall be levied. Good; now let this law be attended to, or let its swearers pay off its share of the National debt.
