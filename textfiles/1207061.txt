Farm and Garden SAWDUST FOR BEDDING Sawdust affords an excellent material for bedding. It is cleanly and a good absorbent. Its chemical composition is about the same as that of straw, so that manure with which it is mixed would apparently be of about the same value as that with which straw is mixed. The straw, however, is more easily decomposed than the sawdust, and its elements would sooner become available for plant use. The sawdust has the advantage of being a better absorbent than straw, and its use will save a larger portion of the liquid manure than will be saved when straw is used. Some object to the use of sawdust on the ground that it injures the land to which it is applied. This we regard as an unfounded supposition. If applied to light land, it wilj render it more retentive of moisture, and impede the excessive drying of the soil. If applied to heavy land, it lightens it and renders it more easily penetrated by rains, air and warmth. Wherever sawdust is easily attainable, it will probably be found advisable to use it for bedding and as an absorbent. Watchman.
