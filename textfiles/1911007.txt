LETTER AND SPIRIT. Thomas Harding. [written for the -manifesto.] ' Why judge ye not of your own selves that which is right.'�Paul. 'What is the matter with the Churches?' Is a question often asked and the reply might be given '-The matter with them is that they cleave to the letter rather than the spirit of their profession and prefer material and visible prosperity to spiritual grace, growth and knowledge,' and the consequence is that even the dull world itself is able to perceive the absence of that spirituality which 'giveth life' and the deadening presence of worldliness which kills the God-ward aspirations of the soul. The tendency of man is toward the visible and enjoyable. He naturally shrinks from anything which requires the sacrifice of self. He avoids tribulation even though he knows intellectually, if not instinctively, that humiliating exercises tend to final elevation and that the denial of self opens the way for spiritual growth. That which is next to his hand he avails himself of to enhance his self-importance even though he is aware that to allow himself to drift produces weakness and effeminacy. The spirit points the way to a 'rough and rugged road' but man tries to avoid it, he hates to travel that way, and attempts to compromise the matter by making a picture of it and then he sits down to the contemplation of what he has made, hoping to obtain all the advantages of travel while he stays at home enjoying himself. It is a burlesque of religion ! To bow down before the figure of a cross is idolatry even though the act may awaken tender emotions. The real cross is in the life, and it is not of our making. It chooses us, we do not choose it. The cross is not a matter of mere sentiment but it is a serious and stern reality. It is a hard fact which often produces anguish of soul and sends forth the agonizing cry 'Let this cup pass from me' rarely with the submissive addition 'Nevertheless not my will but Thine be done.' A symbol, though good as a symbol, is not the thing symbolized, and an illustrative story, although it be paraboK ically excellent, (possessing deep significational truth) yet when received as a literal fact it becomes like dry-rot in sound lumber. A book may be suggestive and contain beautiful and appropriate passages but lo reverence a book, because it teaches, or a man because he preaches is of a piece with the act of employing an automatic praying machine to grind out our supplications. But milk is good for 'babes' and some people must be startled into believing and then held to it by some figure on the blackboard which the eye can see and the wwenlightened mind can contemplate. 'To defiue God' said Spinoza 'is to destroy him.' True! for who by searching can find him out? What language can explain the 'Sacred Mystery?' The Divine recognizes the Divine and soul speaks to soul but worldly wisdom is foolishness with God, (who has hidden 'these things from the wise and prudent,') and material gain and worldly honor weigh light, indeed, in the balances of Heaven. Concerning God, Hark says in the 'Unity of the Truth' 'We no longer ask for or need any feeble definition of Him. We see Him. We feel Him. We love Him. Undefinable, because like only to himself. Incomprehensible because himself comprehending all things.' Let the church people realize this, thinking less about themselves and the world and more about the welfare of their fellow men and the ''mystery of Godliness' and the inquiry will cease to be made 'What is the matter with the churches.' In a modern novel 'A Midsummer Madness' occurs this suggestive passage. Mrs. Este. 'Everybody does everything for money now-a-days.' Rodney. 'No they don't. Women marry for money I know and men accept the grossest materialism as the rule of their lives. But good, honest, fair work is never done for money and for money alone.' 'Religious' work done for money and prestige is not honest work. The man who preaches and enforces doctrines, the truth of which he has never fairly enquired into, and even doubts, is not an honest, fair man, he 'accepts materialism as the rule of his lifr.' And the enquiring world knows it. There is a hidden 'force' which separates the Divine wheat from chaff� there is an 'occult' understanding which detects the tares amongst the growing grain. But merely eloquent preaching does not make it apparent� gorgeous church edifices do not stimulate Christian humility, nor can 'growth in grace' be purchased with the contents of overflowing cash boxes. Yet there is perhaps no class of men more entitled to public sympathy than the preacher class of America. The 1st. Napoleon once said that 'too much was expected of ecclesiastics and it made hypocrites of them.' Let the men have liberty, liberty to think and liberty to announce their convictions. Let them not be pinned down too closely 10 their creeds, let them feel that their honesty will not jeopardize their standing or endanger the bread of their families. Should that day ever come there will be fewer enquiries of 'What is the matter?' For 'where the spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty.' Sturgis, Mich.
