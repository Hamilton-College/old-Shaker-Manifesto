OAT MEAL PUDDING. If you wish to have it for breakfast, put your meal into a tin vessel large enough to cook it in, pouring on a little cold water sufficient to swell it a little: let it stand over night, and in the morning pour on boiling water, stirring it well. Add salt sufficient to season it; then place it in a kettle of boiling water stirring it several times, or until you tliink it swollen sufficiently, but care should be taken not to stir it after it is cooked, as stirring too much serves to mash it, and it is not as palatable as if whole. We think this method of cooking it better thnn stirring it immediately into the vessel over the fire.
