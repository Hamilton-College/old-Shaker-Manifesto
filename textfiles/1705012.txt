FAITH With constant faith surpassing doubt I stand and watch the tide go out- - That 'twill come back I say to you I do not know, and yet I do. At eventide I see the day Put night on guard and go away Will morning come the mists to woo? I do not know, and yet I do. I see the sere that autumns bring. Will verdure come with waking spring? My faith alone can answer true- - I do not know, and yet I do. We see our loved ones droop and die. Hath Heaven a brighter life on high- - Is death the vale that leads thereto? 1 do not know, and yet I do. Chicago News.
