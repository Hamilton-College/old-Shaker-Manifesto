LOVE. M. J. Tatterton. The Savior's commaud was, 'Love your enemies.' How purely unselfish must be the heart that really obeys the divine injunction ; but the Savior both by precept and example illustrated the worth of this love ; not only did he love those who were kind to him but those who reviled and persecuted him. Of all the influences brought to bear upon the human soul, the work of love is the most wondrous and divine. It sheds a halo of heavenly light over all with whom its possessor is associated. A soul in the possession of the love of God is rich beyond comparison. The earth may withhold her treasures and the fortunes of this world never smile ; but the wealth of love is a mine that can never be exhausted. When earthly riches shall have taken wings, love shall remain as the Christian's abiding treasure,ï¿½the test of the soul's discipleship. Canterbury, N. H.
