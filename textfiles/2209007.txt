AN APPEAL. Sophia Wayne. Christian awake! discard all earthly creeds, Adopt a holier faith, Seek for the light, fulfill all noble deeds, Banish all fears of death. Look upward to the glorious worlds above Formed by the Master's hand; Choose for thy watchword one of peace and love, Hope for the promised land. What but the all-wise Infinite's commands Brought these bright worlds in view, Speaking to us of fairer, better lands, Formed for the good and true. Turn not from virtue's pure and lovely path, Walk ever in the light, Remove all deeds of evil, hate and wrath, Learn always to do right. Then with our friends ascended, For victories sought and won, And hear the blessed loving Master's voice, 'Servant, thou hast well done.' Ballston Spa, N. Y.
