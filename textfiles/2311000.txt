SOUTH UNION. No. 1. The establishing of a Society at South Union, Ky., was accomplished at the expense of much suffering. The preaching of the gospel of Jesus the Christ is always followed by the persecuting spirit of darkened or sensual minds; and it is not uncommon to find among the low classes, the ministers of such churches as believe in the hanging and burning of those who may differ from them on some special theological point. The question of practical righteousness is not of so much importance to a searcher for heretics, as it is to know whether they were baptized in still waters or in a running stream. A remarkable revival of religion had been in progress in the state of Kentucky for more than a year. This was in the year 1801. It included the rich and poor, the educated and the ignorant, and no less the church professor and those who manifested no interest on the subject of religion. The news of this wonderful outpouring of God's spirit reached the Believers at New Lebanon, and seemed so much in harmony with the prophecy of Mother Ann that it became a matter of very deep interest. There were many persons then living who had heard the prophecy and believed without a doubt that it was in process of fulfillment. In the exaltation of the spirit, while in the worship of God, Mother Ann raised her hand and said to the Believers,ï¿½'The next great opening of the gospel testimony will be in the southwestern part of the United States.' It was a quandary in the minds of many, why that section of the country should be designated. Very little was known of that part of the country except it was supposed to be largely inhabited by Indians and wild beasts. The word, however, that was spoken in the gift of God, some years previous to this date, had been retained in the minds of the Believers as prophetic, and was now being fulfilled. The faith of these soldiers of the cross was as true as the compass to the pole, and they saw the hand of God outstretched to do a great and marvelous work, and they heard this voice of God, which called for the messengers of light, to buckle on their armor and engage in the work of harvesting souls from the low estates of the earth. Three Brethren were then selected NOVEMBER, 250 THE MANIFESTO. as missionaries, John Meacham, Benjamin S. Youngs and Issaehar Bates. They were to leave home on the first day of January, 1805, and make this journey of more than a thousand miles on foot. One horse was provided to carry their baggage, and on which they could ride in case of sickness or accident. ' At the early hour of three o'clock in the morning they bid adieu to their gospel friends and commenced their journey to the state of Kentucky. They traveled through Poughkeepsie, New York City, Philadelphia, Pa., Baltimore, Md., Abington, Va., Hawkins, Tenn., to Paint Lick, Ky. They now learned that they had been on the inarch two months and twenty-two days, and had traveled the distance of one thousand, two hundred and thirtythree miles. On March 3rd, they attended a religious service and opened their testimony of a life in God. They informed the leaders of the revival of their mission into Kentucky and were very pleasantly received. Other meetings were held as occasion offered, till the twenty-first of the month when they went on to Turtle Creek, now Union Village, O. A warm welcome was extended to them by Malcham Worley and his family, and the Believers felt blessed of God for the Providential care that was over them. To meet the wishes of the revivalists and to attend their meetings, Issaehar traveled on foot and alone, a distance of ninety miles. He was obliged 'to cross one creek three times where the mud and water was two feet deep. Before he reached the place of his destination, his feet were very badly blistered and it was with difficulty that he proceeded on his way. By the 23rd of May, 1805, not less than forty young Believers were added to the Community in Ohio, and as might be expected, the spirit of persecution was aroused. Mobs armed with staves and hickory clubs, threatened to use violence, but were persuaded by some of the company to wait still longer and see what the Shakers were intending to do. Meetings were held from day to day, and the Brethren made visits to different sections of the country to inform the people of their gospel mission. By the month of June, the congregation had become so large that no ordinary house would accommodate them, and they were obliged to build preaching stands in the woods. The Brethren were now able to find assistants among those who had been converted to the faith, and with these they traveled from Turtle Creek to Gasper, and as often as opportunity offered, held revival meetings in the several villages through which they had passed* (to be continued.)
