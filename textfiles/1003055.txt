How to Measure the Height of Trees —When a tree stands so that the shadow can be measured, its height can be readily ascertained as follows : Set a stick upright — let it be perpendicular by the plumb line. Measure the length of the shadow of the stick. As the length of its shadow is to the height of the stick, so is the length of the shadow of a tree to its height. For instance : If the stick is four feet above the ground, and its shadow is six feet in length, and the shadow of the tree is ninety feet, its height will be sixty feet. 6 : 4 : : 90 : 60. In other words, multiply the length of the shadow of the tree by the length of the stick, and divide by the length of the shadow of the stick
