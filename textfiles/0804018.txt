BRO. JAMES M. PEEBLES. Our spiritualistic brethren, may or may not thank us, for proposing an organization of Spiritualists under the leadership of Bro J. M. Peebles, a modern, and very superior Paul! We see very many beautiful spirits in the body, casting about for a line, while drifting unpleasantly and unwillingly towards Utopia. Bro. Peebles holds just the line, which we think the millions of spiritually minded, would be most happy to attach their barques unto ; and we are confident that by a strong attachment thereto, they will ever after acknowledge that their 'lines have fallen in pleasant places,' and find themselves being towed directly and expeditiously into conditions most desirable. Rev. Bro. Dr. Elder Peebles, we lay our hands, in imposition upon you ! We anxiously await the effects of the motion upon our friendly cotemporaries, The Banner of Light, The It. P. Journal, Voice of Truth, Spiritual Scientist, Voice of Angels, etc.
