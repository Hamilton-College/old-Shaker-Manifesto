Believers in biblical chronology, and a cabalistic interpretation of the Scriptures... Believers in biblical chronology, and a cabalistic interpretation of the Scriptures, must begin to wake up and put on a little more spiritual life, with the peaceable fruits of righteousness, or they may be left outside the gate on the speedy coming of the great millennium. Professor Totten of Yale College, has satisfied himself and many others, that he has most assuredly demonstrated the correct time for the opening of that wonderful era of spiritual prosperity which is to be the saint's joy for one thousand years. / By mathematical demonstration from the prophecies he unhesitatingly declares that the '''millennium will come suddenly, like a snare ; everywhere at once ; amid the crash of all existing systems, and out of a jreign of horror.' v To prove that his calculations are correct, beyond a doubt, he has placed elaborate tables of figures before the public, and respecting these he makes the following remarks. 'I know of no flaw in these tables, cither astronomical, chronological or historical, and by means of them I am permitted to convey to all my race the substance of my convictions.' The prophetic Congress which met, recently, in London, and was composed of hundreds of the most learned bishops, prelates, members of Parliament and deep thinkers, agree in their wisdom that the end of the world would come on or about the year 1899. Prof. Totten's array of mathematical calculations is really wonderful, and to thousands will be only bewildering, but it is said to have awakened a profound intensity of feeling, and the 'Midnight Cry' is again being heard through the land. This has been one of the wonders in the religious world, that since the first publishing of the biblical record, prophetic calculations have been made with such accurate precision that every shade of Christianity has accepted their own illustration as satisfactory and conclusive. If Paul had only been silent on this subject and not said what he did to the worldly-wise Corinthians, we might have entered the ranks with Prof. Totten to herald the incoming day. 'The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.' And then the direct testimony of Jesus. 'Of that day and hour knoweth no man, not even the angels in heaven.' While this wisdom of the world may interest the children of the world, it does not seem to develop them to be the children of God. It is quite singular that the combined wisdom and labor of this great body of educated minds, should determine the coming of the second advent, when they would be unwilling on their own part, or for others to enter into God's kingdom as it was established on the earth during the first advent of Jesus ; but it is characteristic of the race of man. It is the looking forward for something to come that will do for them what they are unwilling to do for themselves. Deny yourself, said Jesus, and take up your cross and follow me. If we neglect the lessons given in the first advent, how can we expect to work out those of the second? That a wave of religious thought is now passing over the civilized world, and is of sufficient force to push aside the grosser elements of the world, is a wonderfully redeeming feature in our day of grasping, defrauding and sensuality. If the believing thousands can accumulate the requisite amount of courage, and push ahead regardless of their enemies, as did Moses at the passage of the Ked Sea, then, indeed, will the millennium have commenced, and in due time the world will come to an end. The end of the world is the life of Christ, while the Christian resurrection from the world brought the disciples into a new element, where, like Jesus, they neither marry nor are given in marriage. The life of the world is the marital relation, the foundation upon which others of the same class may build from generation to generation. Take away this foundation and the world would come to an end. Paul, in speaking of his disciples respecting the position they were to occupy, said, 'These things are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. They were dead to the world, but alive in Christ. The waiting few who were engaged in the outpouring of the spirit of God in 1848 under the ministration of Wm. Miller, will renew their strength and have cause to believe that the long midnight through which they have patiently watched is nearly over, and the 'morning dawn is breaking.' In this religious thought we are as deeply interested as any class can be, and accept the awakening which, even for a brief space of time holds the religious world sufficiently quiet, that it may more carefully study the laws of God MThich are for the wellbeing of the body, and for the purification of the soul. Can it be possible that these believing thousands who are anticipating the putting on of their white robes in 1899, ai'e already engaged in the preliminary work of making the body a fit temple for the Holy Spirit ? Are they rising from a life in the elements of the world, to a life in the spirit of holiness ? To delay is dangerous. To attain to success one must reach the place in his life where he can say as did Jesus ;�'The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me.' While others may look for the fulfillment of the prophecies, agreeably to their special calculations, we are with those who believe that the light of the new day, the millennium, is already shining upon us. That it is a progressive work in righteousness and peace, and may enter the heart of any one who denies himself of all ungodliness and every worldly lust. All the chronological tables and all the calculations of days and years that may be formed, will be of no value when a pure heart is demanded. Paul bears a testimony that will more effectually open the path to the anticipated millennium than all the wisdom that may be brought forward by a host of professors, bishops or prelates. He says,�God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. He that soweth. to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. Any body of people who will accept the word of the Apostle and make of it a practical application in their relations among men, and then keep themselves unspotted from the world, need not wait till 1899, nor during one week for the second advent of the Christ, or the opening of the thousand years of glory. Such a demonstration of spirituality would bring the New Jerusalem down from God out of heaven, and every one would have the pleasure, at once, of saying ; 'Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God Himself shall be with them and be their God.'
