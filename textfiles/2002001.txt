WALKING WITH GOD. Giles B. Avery. The Christian's God is a Heavenly Father, revealed by Jesus Christ, the Heavenly Bridegroom, and a Heavenly Mother, revealed by the Mother spirit of Christ,�A Heavenly Bride. All souls who follow Christ, by denying themselves of alj. sinful pleasures, and, for Christ's sake, lay down their worldly, sinful lives, thus, become the 'Children of God.' As a dependent child of earthly parents walks with the parents for help and protection, so th? children of God, feeling their dependence on their Heavenly Father and Mother, seek th^ guiding, helping hand of God. The child of earthly parents cannot, with confidence, seek the guiding, helping hand of its parents excpt it render obedience to their commands, even so the children of God cannot, with confidence, look for aid, guidance and support from their Heavenly Father and Mother, unless obedient to their commands. God's laws are purposes of good deeds done to all the creation of G od; therefore the soul who walks with God, is devoted to do good, and good only, to all of God's Creation* as far as the. limit1 d pow'/rs of th? chil 1 of (iod extends. Thus, to walk with (iod leaves no room for the love of, and uplifting of self at the expense of the oppression and injury of a feliowcreature of God's creation ! The children of (iod, who walk with (iod, are led by th? Heavenly Parent's hand to heights overlooking the narrow bounds of mere s�lfish possessions, to peer out upon the broad iields of humanity, and scan human needs; they behold all phases of human suffering, the fruits of disobedience to God's laws, and,- in heavenly sympathy, are ready to administer relief, to the extent of their powers of body and soul. Souls who walk with God are freed from the lusts of sensuality, for, in godly paths there is no room, no place for desires opposed to godliness. God's laws are their life's guide, their love, their will and pleasure. The child who walks with God sees all the castles of sinful pleasure perish in the using, and vanish as the morning dews before the rising sun ; and, in lieu thereof, behold eternal mansions, reared in righteousness, in supernal glory, outshining the midday sun in its midday splendor. To a soul who walks with God, the voice of the tempter is hushed, and dumb is the tongue that would promise pleasure in unrighteousness ! While the sinner who pursues selfishness and gain, at the expense of the loss of his brother man, and piles up wealth upon wealth, pilfered from his neighbor's board, and pleasure adds to pleasure at the expense of his neighbor's sufferings, the hand of God is weighing out a store of just retribution, that will fill the sinner's cup of woe to overflowing. But the soul who walks with God is led through the fields of Paradise, and from those grateful spirits who have been blest by such soul's labors of love, mercy and charity, pour forth paeans of blessing, thanks and love, thrilling the soul with bliss. It is as impossible for a soul who walks with God, to wantonly or consciously injure a fellow-being, as for the sun to shine at midnight, for God's love is manifest in goodness to all the objects of his creation! Sufferings for violations of God's laws, are God's goodness manifest to prevent the repetition of disobedience ! The soul who constantly walks with God, is ushered into the magazine of the powers of the heavens, and can take therefrom, supplies sufficient for every need. Such souls dwell in realms of heavenly light, and all their works are seen, by eyes that are clairvoyant to the truth, to be in support of righteousness. Such heaven-born souls have ears clairaudient to the enrapturing music of the heavenly hosts, and their beings are thrilled and infilled with heavenly delights when associated with kindred spirits. They may have errands of mercy to perform, when they must sorrow with the afflicted, mourn with those who mourn, and weep with those who weep ; but, anon they return for recuperation to the happy mansions of the blest! Oh Zion, Zion, a suffering sin-laden world lies blanching on the barren plains of disappointment, and suffering of the inanition of the blessings of God ! The cry of a class of semiawakened souls goes up to Heaven for aid. It is time for the children of God to put on their laboring attire and go forth to lead them home to God. Zion fellow-travelers, let us reach forth more eagerly to grasp the hands of our Heavenly Parents, that they may lead us to the storehouse of God's bounteous treasures to supply the wants of hungry souls, and draw therefrom to bestow upon the needy ! Let us be found walking with God ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
