It being customary to use our Periodical for recording notes of the weal and woe of our various organizations, I take the liberty to present a picture in brief of how things move in and around our domicile. It is the vernal season of the year, when 'Vernal flowers are preparatives to Autumnal fruits.' It being seed time we are busy in making preparation, by plowing and sowing, for the future harvest. The earth is attired:� 'By the soft season, when descending showers Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flo wei's.' If old Tyrant Frost is firmly kept in check and martingal, the indices point to a fruitful season. Sr. Amelia Calver having taken a trip to the United State's Capitol City and vicinity and having surveyed the works of art and monuments of wealth returned to her mountain home April 30. Some others have made an eternal visit to the New Jerusalem, the City of Heavenly Light. May 2nd, Sabbath afternoon, a company from the Mount went to Hancock to attend the funeral of Eldress Lois Wentworth. This afternoon we are summoned to attend the funeral of Sister Olive Chapel of the South family. 'On Eaith we have no ul&gt;iiing place . But to*t as billows beat.' My wandering thought sometimes runs against a query, that may not, at present, admit of a definite solution.�Example: Is the earth plane a nursery for producing intelligent individualities to people the spirit spheres'? Were there individualized spirits without first being developt in the matrix of materiality? If so, why were not all created spirits at fiist, uninfected by materiality? Why? Calvin G. Reed North. Family. May, 1897. Yesterday there past, through our peaceful village, seven teams heavily loaded with gun-powder; whither bound we are not yet informed. We hope it may not be for human destruction, but the thought gives vis a shudder while the news of war and rumors of greater war are daily reaching us. Greatly in contrast is this to the sights and sounds which greet eye and ear at the present moment. The strife may not be less�but how different in motive and effect. The 'shouldering arms' with lumber and garden implements by the Brethren,, with equipments for housecleaning and window painting by the Sisters, while the wondrous miracle of spring unrolls as TERMS. a beautiful vision to the inner as to the outer perceptions when we read what it symbolize.s in the life of humanity. Surely as the gushing life of spring and the golden wealth of harvests are wrapt in the cold bosom of winter, so during the long period of seeming spiritual inertia which, has brooded over the world, vital forces have been concentrating that ere long will find expression in a more enlightened and advanced people than have ever before been the subjects of a deep spiritual revival. Let us who have years and responsibility before us renew our faith in God, in the potency of justice and in its fuller meaning�Love, and whatever the present seeming advantages, bear always in mind that no blessing to the individual or community can ever accrue through a compromise of righteous principles. Many before us and with us have set noble examples while some have mist the mark. We are debtors to the wise and to the unwise. . By kindness of Editor in sending copies we are glad to know that 'History of the Shakers' has been put in pamphlet form entitled 'A Christian Community.' We think it the most agreeably written and, for its length, the most comprehensive of any sketch which has yet been issued. In appearance and worth it is a twin to 'Advent of the Christ in Man and Woman,' by the same author. The latter is equally graceful, clear and well-adapted for present circulation among refined and intelligent people. Blessings to all who are spreading the light. Catherine Allen.
