GOOD FOR EVIL For the purpose of illustrating the difference between Christianity and ' mere benevolence,' as he called it, the late Elder Knapp used to releate that a man, tired of keeping his great dog, tied one end of a rope around his neck and the other to a stone, took him out upon a pond in his boat for the purpose of drowning him, and in throwing his dog overboard he lost his balance and fell over also. The loop around the dog's neck was large and slipped over his head, and he soon came to the surface, where he found his master, unable to swim, struggling wildly, and just ready to perish. The dog, regardless of his master's evil intent, and faithful unto death, seized hold of him, drew him ashore, and saved his life.
