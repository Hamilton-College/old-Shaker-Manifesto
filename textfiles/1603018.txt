ROOM AT THE TOP. They say the professions are crowded, By seekers for bread and for fame; That many a doctor or lawyer Can make for himself scarce a name. But however people are talking, Never mind, never mind and don't stop, What if the low rounds are crowded, There is always room at the top. Our country needs Websters and Lincolns Longfellows Greeleys and Grants ; Some of our young men will be such, If only we give them a chance. Do you think that Webster would faltered, At aught which idlers might drop? No ! No ! he ever kept climbing Till he reached his place at the top. In this life those only are leaders, Who have that indomitable ' pluck, ' Which people everywhere worship. And say ' what a fellow for luck. ' But luck has naught to do with it It is thisï¿½work, work, never stop; If you only have heart in your labor, You will surely come out at the top. Work, work from dawn until evening. Improve every moment of time ; Don't stay on life's lower flooring, But onward and upward e'er climb. If some one does feel above you, Don't let this your endeavors stop; For if they do practice off-showing And have of fine airs a large stock, They'll find e'er they die I am thinking, It is brains which find room at the top. The Western Plowman.
