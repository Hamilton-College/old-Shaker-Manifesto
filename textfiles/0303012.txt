'It is not what we eat, but what we digest, that makes us fat; it is not what we read, but what we remember, that makes us learned ; it is not what we earn, but what we save, that makes us rich.' As the wild waves that fiercely contend in mid ocean touch gently the shore, and speak in the low, soft music of broken ripples, so will the heart, once tumultuous with passion, when brought under self-control, breathe holy love as it nears the promised land of rest.
