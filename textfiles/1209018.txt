Cleanliness comes very near... Cleanliness comes very near to godliness. To reach this desirable state make frequent use of the bath. A variety of ways have been proved to be quite beneficial for the health, such as plunge, hand, towel, sponge or shower bath. One in limited circumstances can bathe effectually with one quart of water, while the more fortunate can use a more liberal supply. The temperature of the water should be made agreeable to the one who uses it. By some advisers, water at 75 degrees would be called cold ; others prefer a lower temperature. Use a little common sense apd you will not be harmed : without this, bathing, like eating and drinking may be carried to a ruinous excess. We have known persons to pamgc into a bath which was at freezing point, and others to stand on the ice for a shower bath. These may be heroic for cleanliness, but destructive to health. Study some good work on the subject of bathing and then follow the directions for your own health and for the comfort of your friends.
