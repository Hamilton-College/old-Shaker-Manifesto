Shakers, N. Y. Sept. 1897. When we read the editorial comments of the 'Ave Maria' on the principles of our Communities, and coming from an organ under the jurisdiction of that powerful ecclesiastical organization, the Catholic Church, we realized the fact that the boundary line of sects and parties could not prevent the communion of kindred souls and all who love the truth were as brethren and sisters, regardless of the organization, religious or political with which they are associated. Let those who think that the testimony of truth which Believers have held forth has fallen on barren ground, because of our disparity of numbers, remove their doubts; there never was a time when the testimony was working with that fullness as at present. The more advanced minds are going deep to the foundation of the causes which are producing the discordant effects portrayed in our political and religious life. The opening years of the twentieth century will witness a quickening of the spiritual forces that have been dormant, for in the inspiring words of Gerald Massy, ''Tis coming up the steep of time, And this old world is growing brighter, We may not see its dawn sublime Hut high hopes niake the heart throb lighter.' Hamilton DeGraw.
