Alfred, Me. Sept. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry ;ï¿½At the time 'Home Notes' for Aug. should have been written, I with another Sister and Brother was on a journey along the shore, including Rye, Isle of Shoals, York and Kennebunk Beaches with Shaker basket work for sale. We had an opportunity to see what is called the favored class in the world. Some were reported to be worth their millions, who had come to these watering places in pursuit of health and happiness. Judging by what we could see many had mistaken excitement for happiness. A change for a day sometimes tends to bodily health and present happiness. So thought President Westcott of the P. &amp; R. R. R. when he so kindly sent a free pass to Eld. John for as many of our family as could leave home to come down to Portland and go out to one of the islands in Casco Bay. On the 20th. of Aug., thirty-one persons including children availed themselves of friend Westcott's kind offer. If I should write a history of that day, it would take up too much of your valuable space, suffice it to say on arrival at Portland we took steamer for Cushing's Island where we spent a few hours watching the waves and inhaling the fresh breezes from the broad Atlantic. Then returned to the city to give the children and some older ones an opportunity to spend a few pennies for what most pleased them. At 5-30 P. M. took train for home where we arrived very tired but not sorry for the journey. Brethren harvested 150 tons of hay in very good order. The second crop is cut and eight acres of sweet corn harvested which averaged fifty dollars to the acre. The cream sold for the first seven months of this year amounted to $732.48.. The most received for one month was $143.52. Twenty-five bu. of cranberries have been picked by the young Sisters the past week. One young Sister hand picked two and one half bu. in one day. Health of Society generally good. Our beloved Ministry Sisters have returned after an absence of nine long weeks, and we gladly make them welcome for they come laden with love and strength to cheer and encourage us on our heavenly journey.
