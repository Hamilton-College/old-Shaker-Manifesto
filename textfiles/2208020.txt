Watervliet, N. Y. Second Family. The weather has been wet and cold for this season of the year. We are in the midst of haying, that is, when the sun shines. The crop in this section will only be medium. Eye is about ready for the reapers. Corn is very backward, oats are heading out. Our beloved Ministry arrived at the Valley July 5th., in good health. They brought us much love from eastern kindred, also from the Mount. We are glad to say Br. Chauncy Miller keeps improving in health and strength. May he recover and be with us many years, as he has talents that are much coveted in 'Zion's great need.' While we are busy laying in temporal stores, let us not forget the spiritual harvest. Human nature is just as full of excuses to-day as it was in the days of Jesus, if not more so. We need to keep our calling ever before us, it is dangerous to parley or look back, for Satan is ever ready to take us on that high pinnacle and offer us the kingdoms of this world if we will only bow down and worship him. Let us bear in mind there is no standstill, it is either forward or backward. Let us therefore be numbered with those who have put their hands to the gospel plow never to look back. *
