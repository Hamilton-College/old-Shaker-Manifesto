Harvard, Mass. Aug. 10, 1890. We begin to realize our loss by the long drought. For seven long weeks through the hay season and before, the blessing of rain was withheld from mother earth, and right in the time our potato crop needed it the most. We Khali realize from our late potatoes a reasonable crop. But early ones are very small. Apples are scarce. Corn is looking beautiful and the largest crop planted for many years. The hay crop was harvested without a drop of rain which makes it of excellent quality. Garden vegetables are good. Onions will be an excellent crop. This sums up the temporalities. Our dear Elder John Whiteley started for England, the home of his boyhood, on Saturday the 9th of August. He is to be gone two months and we pray he may have a happy time. Our prayers shall be many and fervent for him that he may find some noble minds who will come, and like him live out the principles of self-denial. Health of Society quite good, none on the sick list. One more effort to beautify our home. The twelve acres of land lying between the Church and South Family which had grown up to bushes and was spoiled even for pasture is now being cleared and the intention is to make it into a meadow equal to any which lies aside of it. We felt a little of the cyclone which commenced in Harvard and did such damage in South Lawrence. What protection we are under! JFor almost one hundred years this Society has not met with any serious calami- ty by flood, wind or fire. Why should we not sing hymns of thanksgiving? This morning many spoke of the protecting power which has been so liberally extended to us. Our meeting is filled with good gifts, and our songs ring out the spirit of thankfulness. A. Barrett.
