White Water, O. North Family. Dec. 1893. We have finished sawing our wood for the winter. Four of the Brethren from the Center family, with their new, fifteen horse traction engine, pulled into our wood-yard early this morning and as the workmen and the machinery were in fine condition, the way the short sticks flew was a caution. While the Brethren were busy outdoors the Sisters were contributing their share indoors, helping on with the good work, by placing before us a most excellent dinner. How well they succeeded, we will leave to the imagination of the readers, as the writer feels that he can not do the sub- ject justice in writing. We have our corn all in the crib. Our stock in shape to be stabled whenever necessary. ****** We had a very good meeting at ten o'clock, Thanksgiving morning. Every one was made to feel that it was a thanksgiving indeed, as well as in name. Why should we not be thankful? We have every thing to make us comfortable, both temporal and spiritual and all that we are required to do for all this, is to take up our cross against sin. Many thanks for the invitation to visit your home at Canterbury. Our school children are making preparations for an entertainment during the holidays. Please accept our gospel love and best wishes for a happy Christmas. J. O. Tyler
