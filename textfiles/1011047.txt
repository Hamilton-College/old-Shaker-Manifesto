A great deal of winter fruit... A great deal of winter fruit suffers early decay in consequence of a deficiency of ventilation, especially during autumn and after the fruit is deposited. The Germans are very successful in the ventilation of their cellars, by a communication with the principal chimney, the heated air in which neces sarily maintains a current, which sweeps out the noxious and stagnant gases from the vegetable and other contents. Apples are safer in barrels either in a shaded place in the open air, or under a shed, than in a cellar, till the frost comes on. Then they should be covered with straw and only be taken into the cellar when severe frost comes on.
