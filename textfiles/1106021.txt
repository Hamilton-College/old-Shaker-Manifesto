He showed them the poverty and wretchedness of Lazarus and the ease and luxury of the rich man on earth, and then the bliss of Lazarus and the misery of Dives in the world to come. He asked them which of the two they would like to be. A little boy said: 'Please, I would like to be the rich man on earth, but Lazarus in heaven.' That is the way with some grown-up children ; they want to be Dives here, and enjoy the good things of Mammon, and a safe home in Abraham's bosom after they cannot hold on to Mammon any longer. But this is God's test of our love for Him. If it were not for this test heaven itself might be spoiled by the presence of self-deceiving hypocrites, but this sifts out the chaff.
