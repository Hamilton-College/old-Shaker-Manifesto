PREST FLOWERS AND GRASSES. By Cora C. Vinneo. Mementos of a season true, Well stored with every gift divine, You mind me of the summer dew And bright sunshine. From out the wind-storm's noisy speech, Through you I hear the songs of spring Faintly as distant bells, that each Intoning ring. I hear the copious falls of rain, That sang the weary brain to sleep; Hear the wind sighing through the grain, So soft and deep. These songs are old, but when the year Moves to the resurrection time, New life will come to flower and spear Like thought to rhyme. The new will gild the tarnisht old, And turn life's bitter wine to sweet, While God's great blessings manifold Our joys complete. The hope that rules the tides which rise As moonbeams rule the mighty sea, And bring through purposes grown wise Tranquility. And as we walk life's grassy meads, Where sunbeams lay the shadows low, May lastftig flowers from precious seeds Around us grow, That when the close of life draws near, And cold and weary seem the hours, May we all keep for latest cheer Grasses and flowers.
