OPEN THE DOOR TO ME. GRANVILLE TEMPLE SPROAT. ' Open the door to me ! Open the pearly gate ! I am thy worshiper, Oh, King! Who always on thee wait. I laudfand praise thy name To every one I meet; I sound thy plaudits, trumpet-tongued, Through every lane and street. ' ' Who art thou, breaking rudely thus, Upon thy Monarch's rest? I've heard of thee through cries sent up From many poor oppressed. Thou takest away the orphan's right, To me thy tithes to bring. Depart! depart! thou canst not gain An audience with thy King. ' ' Open the door to me ! Ope*n the pearly gate ! I've built a temple in thy name, Adorned with costly state. I've brought my choicest offerings there, Treasures of purest gold, Until my temple far outshines The glorious one of old. ' 'Depart! depart! I have heard of thee� All that thy hands have done ; Thou hast built a temple in myjname, Whose dome outshines the sun. Self, self, alone, thou hast loved and sought; Where all thy idols meet. Thou hast built a temple to thy King, Then, taken the highest seat. ' ' Open the door to me ! Open the pearly gate ! I've sounded thy ' glad tidings ' forth, To all, both small and great. I've sent thy chosen heralds oiit O'er every land and sea; I've loaded them with ' purse and scrip, ' And all in praise of Thee. ' ' Thou hast sent my chosen lieralds forth Glad tidings to proclaim; In all of this thou hast sought thy own, And not thy Sovereign's fame. Thy lips have spread thy Monarch's praise Thy heart has loved thy own; Depart! depart! thou canst not gain Acceptance at my throne ! I know thee�read thee�all thy heart,� Its windings all I trace ; Thy hollow mask�thy feigned voice, Thy smirking, painted face. I know thee�read thee�all thou art;� All that thy hands would bring. Vile hypocrite ! how darest thou thus Bring mockery to thy King ! ' Canaan, N. Y.
