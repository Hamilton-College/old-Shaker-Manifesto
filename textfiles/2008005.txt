VEGETARIANISM and the MILLENNIUM. [Contributed by Ernest Pick.] Among the evidences of an approaching millennium which are active at the close of this nineteenth century is this mighty wave of spiritual thought which, rising like the fabled phoenix from the very ashes of decaying empires, even back to the dim mists of eastern antiquity, but now freely breathing through the spirit of civil and religious liberty, sweeps majestically across our western republic, bringing new inspirations and aspirations to hundreds and thousands. This wave of living thought finds expression through the principles of Vegetarianism, Christianity, Temperance, Theosophy and Hygiene, as well as other true reforms and elevating movements which if you please, are like so many beautiful rivers, each from a seemingly different source, yet all bearing their draughts of intellectual refreshment toward the one infiuite ocean of uuity and truth. Dark and sad is the blot on this fair western civilization of the horrible cruelty and suffering inflicted in slaughterhouse and stock-pen, upoif the lower, but sentient creatures, and it reflects its debasing influences upon the inner natures of those engaged in performing the degrading details of revolting work. Is not this carnage for a needless purpose, when nature so lavishly repays the labor bestowed on her peaceful gardens with fruits, grains and vegetables, as the most harmonious blending of her four great elementals, earth, air, sun and water, the highest expressions on the plane of the vegetable kingdom, and the perfect food of man ? The Infiuite often furnishes the means with the opportunity to shape all human ends, and noble, thinking men and women are awakening to these truths all over our broad land from Maine to California, and from Canada to Florida and Texas. I believe that, co-existent with the development of the finer sensibilities, there is an almost unconscious loss of the desire for flesh foods ; and many are almost vegetariaus without knowing it. This may account for the popularity of those excellent dairy-restaurants in large cities. All is ready for this new form of truth ! Who will sow the seed by precept and example ? for as goes the West, so goes America ; and as America goes, so goes the future world. Let us for a moment glance backward far across the mystical bridge of time, and behold man in his ideal home, the Garden of Eden ; for reli- gion, tradition and philosophy will agree that the primitive home of mtui was in a garden,ï¿½certainly not the slaughterhouse. Standing upon the apex of creation he was then, as now, the medium between the celestial and earthly, with the attributes of an angel, and the tendencies of a brute, holding the temporary balaftce of individual to evolve in either direction. Disobeyiug the divine injunction which whispered to his psychic conscience, he was not content to subsist on fruits and grains (simple and primitive fare which nature offered unsullied by blood) but slew fowl and brute to minister to his perverted appetite, as if to destroy the ladder of life by whicli lie attained his superiority as lord of creation, entailing thereby misery on posterity, and being himself eventually driven from his beautiful garden home. This allegorical, yet truthful picture of man's tirst conditions affords a beautiful lesson, ibr as the first and natural home .at the beginning of the cycle was in the garden of Eden we do not believe this vast cycle of human life can ever reach perfection, until, moving westward during long ages with the course of empire, the circumference of the planet is at last completed, and man comes back to his first and dear old home in the east, the ideal Garden of Paradise, a veritable heaven on earth. Is not Vegetarianism one of the means at least by which this millennium is to be attained? From the 'Esoteric.'
