VISION OF THE JUDGEMENT GILES B. AVERY. I beheld, in the engiscope, the ensanguined ensign of a creedal judgment for humanity reading thus, 'The punishment inflicted on Christ for our sins ! ! ' On viewing this, my spirit burned with indignation and pity, and I sighed with grief, and cried out, O Lord have mercy and open the eyes of the blind ! In thy goodness, justice and love, tear off this mask of wretched sycophancy, and let these ease-loving, sin-living professed believers in Christ, know that the Christians' God is not 'less just than his creature,�man ! What human Court of arbitration would adjudge and decree to punish the known innocent, for the proved and confessed guilty? Again I looked, and, on another so called Christian banner, I saw the pennant streaming creed, written in ghoulish letters of blood. 'Judgment�The sentence of damnation on the wicked ! ! ' Then my vision upward turned toward the shrine of the God I worship : before it I saw His glorious Son�The Christ; he spake, and Io the utterance from his loving compassionate lips�UI came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.' Then listened I to angel voices, and I heard one of his beloved disciples proclaim, li God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but, that the world through him mjght be saved ! ' I now turned to the Orient and Egypt's Moloch next before me came, and, with his horrid burning brazen bosom and his fiery arms, grasping his sinless infant prey�Its judgment tribute for the parent's sin, at the cruel sickening sight I shuddered, and I wondered how the heathenish and devilish ingenuity of man CONTENTS. could devise a scheme so monstrous in its scope and object�the depletion of over population, and the provision for the gratification of lust unlimited�a scheme so sacreligious to the true God. could be thought acceptable, even to a heathen idol deity ! ! A judgment offering so scathing to the affections and tenderest emotions of the human heart, declares that vice, even though unknown as such, petrifies humanity into a block of marble, too senseless to be joyful, too emotionless to weep ! Next India's golden strand before me came. I saw the sacred Ganges silvery judgment stream. On either bank arrayed stood penitent worshipful mothers, casting their bundles of dear or hated infant life,�a judgment tribute to the ravenous avenging crocodile !�An offering of the fruit of the body, for the sin of the soul. Sorrowful, I turned, and prayerful to a better God, I wept. Bitter tears of pity would flow. Then I turned to Hindostan's burning plains ; there, with my lorgnette I saw the 'lorn heathen prostrated before the attantan bloody wheels! of Jugernaut, thus to be crushed from life by the ponderous moving of his judgment car; thus the wretched heathen supposed his cruel idolatrous deity avenged, and pai'don won at last! Now, sickened with the offerings of blood-stained cruel worshipers, again my vision turned to so called Christian lands, there I beheld Jesus, the Son of God, nailed, hands and feet, to the bloody Jewish cross,�a tortured victim ; I beheld the murderous spear, the bitter draught of gall, and I heard the anguish stricken moan, 'My God, My God, Why kast thou forsaken me? ' and then the- sweet-mellifluous prayer 'Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. ' To those cruel worshipers of that creedal Christianity which claims the necessity of this human sacrifice of the pure and innocent Jesus, slain by wicked Jewish hands, for this God's judgment tribute for human sinners, that the guilty wretches who only believed in Jesus' righteousness, and that he thus inglorious]y and cruelly suffered to appease an angry God, that these sinning believers might go scot free, I then turned, and I asked them, Is not this the most cruel sacrifice, as a tribute to judgment, that my vision has yet beheld? The recording angels answered, Yea! Then I hurled such (Christian?) creeds to earth, � I crushed them 'neath my heel; I prayed for better, higher birth, For nobler nerves to feel! For sight to see a better God, More wise, more just, more true, Earth's myriads on her blood-stained sod, A God of love might view! My soul now bowed in grief at the unutterable blindness, and, in some cases the deep hypocrisy of the professors of Christian grace, the mockery of these so called Christian lives ; but I drew a faint breath of relief, as I recalled to mind an incident in the experience of a sincere seeker after truth and honesty, of the mediaeval ages, as follows. Fra Rocco, a mediaeval preacher, commanded all the penitent in his audience to hold up their hands ; and every man's hand was raised ; then Fra Rocco cried aloud, 'O thou Archangel Michael,�thou, who, with adamantine sword standeth at the judgment seat of God, cut me off every hand that has been held up hypocritically ;' And every man now dropped his hand in haste ! Now is revealed a judgment-seat near- er to the heart's emotions, and truer to the lines of justice, than the breast of Moloch, the avenging f crocodile, the wheels of Jugernaut, or the cruel Jewish cross and bloody spear; '-a judgment not rendered according to mere professions, or relations, or reputations, but the deeds done in the body ; and these deeds not as merely external, but as man's vital spiritual conduct, '�the book of life's records, the secrets of the heart! I was next in vision taken to the mansion of the beloved Apostle John. I told him I was seeking the truth concerning the judgment day and work; he made me a welcome guest, and bade me go with him. We now journeyed to the home of the lovely prophet Ezekiel, he led us forth on to a ' sea of glass mingled with fire. ' 'This, ' said he, 4'is Wisdom's judgment court tribunal.' 'Here there is no possible place for hypocrisy ! This is the platform whereon all souls must stand to meet the judgment day of Christ's Second Appearing.' On this sea I saw a vast multitude standing who had been judged ! No hiding ! Life was here to be seen in all its naked truthfulness. And the fire of truth had burned up all that was not fit to be seen. Souls assembled here were known to each other,�The fold of Christ,- -The Children of God ! Confidence here was mutual, and universal peace, union and love, was its ripened fruit. And now said the beloved Apostle John, ' Come up hither and I will show you the New Heavens, ' And, behold a ' White Cloud, and One Sitting thereon like unto the Son of Man,' even Christ, descended ' in his glory'�The female manhood manifestation of the Christ�Woman, the glory of man, and the united twain the radiant glory of God. This cloud Avas a 'Cloud of Witnesses' And lo, a voice from the Christ on the Cloud, ' Lo I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his ('* own ') works shall be. ' And now we heard the Avords of Isaiah concerning this judge declare. ' And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of Avisdom and understanding, the spirit of council and might, the spirit of knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. *'* � And he shall judge not after the sijjht of his eyes, neither repro\'e after the hearing of his ears ; but, with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. ' For the effects, the ultimate of deeds is not always to be judged by immediate and present appearances, but, by consequences also. A man may gradually use arsenic, commencing in small quantities, with apparent momentary benefit ; and he may increase the dose until he takes enough to kill, outright, a dozen men, and, for the time being, he may not appear to be essentially harmed, but, alas ! Very soon he perishes suddenly ! Precisely so of mental, moral, and spiritual influences ; and, on the good side effects are similarly noted. Words of goodness ; deeds of love and kindness ; feelings of unity, and magnetisms of purity. Love! ' Tho' but a little thing, Dropped in the heart's deep well. The good, the joy that it may hring, Eternity shall tell.' As a just standard of judgment's aid, nothing is so \-alual&gt;le as the simple naked truth. Even the heathen Avere so well convinced of this that they worshiped the goddess of truth stark naked.' ' To diminish, or exaggerate, or to give a talse coloring, either by word, gesture, doubtful accent, or any kind of inuendo to plain truth, is Satanical.' The age we live in is surfeited with hollow professions of the truth, with mockeries ; and multitudes are disgusted with its own false life, both in manners, morals, and religious profession ; and this is the most powerful cause of its infidelity. 'The living Jesus was meanly clad, and lived cheaply ; but the dead was clothed in fine linen, and laid in a tomb. ' Do not the great masses of professing Christians, do more to adorn and honor the formalities and ceremonies, the houses for worship, of a mere dead powerless Christian profession, than to grace the true Christ life ? Let conscience judgment answer ! ' A little damsel, seven years old, solicited her father to purchase for her a London Doll, with a china face and a silk dress. The affectionate father gratified her wishes ; but, she soon grew weary of it, and exclaimed 'I want a baby that will cry and eat victuals.' The application is easy. The spirit of the age and dispensation demands of the professors of Christianity a living, practical conformity to the pattern set by Jesus. A baptism that shall bring sinners to repentance ; reform them ; give them a new and a true life ! Some few years since there was claimed to have been a religious revival in our town, and numbers joined the church and were said to have been couverted to Christianity ; a non-professor inquired if a certain person among those claimed to have been converted, who bad stolen some of his property, had confessed it, and returned the goods ? He said he had not heard anything of such a change ! Could he be a } eliever in the said conversion ? Thus the enlightened, and reasonable human mind demands a judgment for the living ! And this is precise-ly what Christ, in his Second Appearing, came to introduce, and he said, 'For judgment came I into this world, that they who see not, might see, and they who see, (with the eye of worldly wisdom, and self-conceit,) may be made blind. ' This Judgment day and work is inaugurated, and its mission fulfilled, which requires a full and free confession of the deeds, motives, and intentions of life, made by each and every member of the true Christian Church ; the Church of the resurrection of the souls (not of the dead bodies) of mankind, into the elements and power of an eternal soul life, and love, and liberty, to live to (Jod in holiness, (set apart for a godly use,) and worship him in spirit and in truth. To all such the day and work of judgment is come when they hear the gospel testimony, and by its light and law judge themselves, confessing all their sins' These are they 'whose sins go before hand to judgment, and cannot follow after to condemnation.' No other judgment day or work, need they ever fear ; and to these shall the Christ who sitteth on the White 'Cloud of Witnesses' proclaim 'Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.'
