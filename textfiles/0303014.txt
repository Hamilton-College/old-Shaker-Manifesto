Faith is not a light thought that sweeps across the brain... Faith is not a light thought that sweeps across the brain to be condensed and fall in tears; it is not a mere emotion like the wind that rises powerfully, then dies into the stillness of the air; neither is it like the lightning's flash that gathers force to dissipate, and return from whence it came; nor the fragrance of the flower borne away by the passing breeze, but it is a life germ planted in the soul; and by cultivation and growth it gains strength and lifts the heart to high and holy aims, and opens the vision to the beauties of a new angelic life.
