I also received a postal from my brother asking me to send for the 'World's Advance Thought' of December because of a piece of thought from his mint upon the subject Armageddon. This subject, by the way, I. am but remotely interested in, am much more interested in my brother and yourself than I am in the instability of human institutions, which God is so evidently shaking down to a common level even to the bottom of the seas of unbelief. That part or parcel of Armageddon pertaining to my individuality does trouble me, and how to come to life out of its valley is a matter of the first importance to me. This hoio to do, has been told me plainly by a woman, Ann Lee; Mother, Bride of Christ, the Truth, the Light, the Way. She confessed her sins one by one, just as she committed them and had faith that she could take up her cross against all that she knew or thought to be sin, and told me to do the same. Having been a faithful student of the Bible, Ann's teaching is to my apprehension confirmed by the teaching of the Bible from the first chapter to the last. First, obey. Next, having disobej^ed, confess and obey. This sums up the whole matter in a nutshell. Nowhere in the lids of the Bible do I read that man is commanded to think, but frequently man is commanded to do and to seek. I do read that 'your thoughts are not as my thoughts, nor your ways as my ways, saith the Lord.' I see this world run thought-mad, every one in haste to get his thought before his brother either as to investing or making of pelf, home or happiness, the founding of states, honoring of men and women, fighting a branch of the great tree of evil as prohibition. Associations without end, investigations of the past and pryings into the future. Close and familiar acquaintance with every spirit in heaven and earth but one's own spirit. Always before our spiritual eyes are our own perverted selves; we turn away from that view and are confronted alway and everywhere by the final judgment of that self. One more spiritual sight is permitted us and that is the righteousness that is to be obtained by faith that is in Christ. No act of faith was ever enacted that did not take the actors out and above themselves for the time being. Hence all progress whatsoever is due to acts of faith^ and not oi; speculation, ratiocination, contemplation or observation. I do read that 'as a man thinketh, so is he.' But I also read that 'the thoughts of man's heart are evil continually before God,' and his heart 'is deceitful and desperately wicked above all things.' I am sick of the whole world of thought, a vast amount of chaff and some precious wheat. If a man must sift his mental pabulum from men's rehash of God's thoughts so simply put forth in his commandments, he will full soon have arrived at that outer darkness where there is weeping, wailing and gnashing of teethor insanity. What is it that troubles the mental and spiritual world most if it is not insanity? Every soul that is not marching with fearless tread to victory over their own spirit, soul and body, by the faith that is in Christ, is insane. And such approach death's door with anxiety and fear, because they have not chosen in this life to believe wholly in the power of Christ over all flesh. 'Life is not what they planned it to be.' This is the oft-repeated story; I have but just heard it from a hearty, wholesome man and professed believer in Christ, who is now facing the uncertainty of earthly relationships by death, which his profession called him to make certainly uncertain in this life. This busily thinking world has made the way of truth (?) exceeding broad and easy to the extent of giving all and keeping all: to the adaptation of truth (?) to circumstances of pleasurable environment, rather than binding pleasure with cords to the horns of the altar, which is death. This is only berating the evil I see, perhaps with a beam in my eye. It is coining thoughts from my mint, when all thoughts should bear the impress of God's mind without human perversion. I might run through my camera the whole of human motive, aspiration, and result, and not add tone enough to inspire one soul unto salvation, nor be able to furnish a dress modest enough for the public eye. And if the dress should please, I should be glorified and exalted, whereas all glory is due unto God. Nay, I will prefer the 119th Psalm. That prayer which only our Redeemer could pray, and try to reach the keeping of the precepts, commandments, judgments, testimonies and laws of my God, for it would be impossible for this imperfect creature to be glo rifled. Truly I am deeply indebted to the thoughts of others for much inspiration and companionship. Great aspirations after godliness and all true and undisguised truth is the bread of life to every soul at some period. But they are only temporarily mine unless by suffering I have evolved them out of, or through my suffering to bring them to the birth in my heart. Let one have brushed aside all sophistries that would prevent his generosity in a worthy cause, and how easily he inspires his audience to give. William Booth has but just launched a mighty force spreading in all directions and for good ; because first he was willing to suffer many things to gain faith himself. Christ was our mighty exemplar, and Christ in Ann Lee is our mightiest example of what personal suffering can do in one individual to bring to birth a faith almighty and sufficient to compass that strongest passion of the human heart, the power of a life to create a life for the selfish pleasure of the act. That a woman should be able to inspire thousands to forsake the cherished perquisite of animal life by the faith that was in her revealed through suffering'. And who will renew for the world again this suffering for a great faith? Must not each generation suffer for itself ? Supposing we were all compelled for a little to part company with shelter, lands and companionship, without fire, to sit upon a stone with a crust and a cruse of vinegar, to test whether we would yet hold our faith. Again, the long life of increasing self-denial step by step of the honest Shaker is more than the short, sharp test by fire and the sword ; and the poor and despised Shakers are the salt of the earth, the hope of mankind, the glory of God on the earth, but not of it. What a wide gulf as to the sympathies which are fast binding all religious denominations in a compact, as it were, to go up and war against the only visible Jerusalem, and none to spare for those who 'make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.' There is a severe trial coming upon all flesh and a great reward coming also. 'The word of God is nigh us even m our hearts, and in our mouths that we can do it.' Away with the bother of worldly gossip commonly called thought and give me the power to see myself as God sees me. It will bring that best of all gifts, tribulation. Amen. From your Brother in the faith once committed to the saints. G. H. Hollister.
