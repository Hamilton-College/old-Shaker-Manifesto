Can Human Society Afford to do Without Religion? GILES B. AVERY. Tins question is suggested by a certain class of minds, who, for want of greater light relative to the nature of the soul, and the reality of Spiritual things, are drifting into Agnosticism� The doctrine that the existence of God can neither be asserted nor denied�also of future existence of the human soul. In this inquiry we do not characterize religion as a mere profession of some one of the three hundred Creeds of denominations calling themselves Christian, but of such a faith in God, the Creator of the Universe in which we have our being, and in those revelations of His laws of righteousness to man, as requires and prompts the Believer to a cheerful and willing obedience to the same, as the only source of true happiness to the human family; consequently -resulting in the Believer living a pure, true, good life, as judged by comparison with the laws thus revealed from our Creator; thus consecrating his services to do God's will, as the purchase of blessings to himself and fellow man. But what is this Godly character we should take for a guide ? The Agnostic tells us, that, ' when we define this Theos- �God, we limit Him to the extent of our own capacities and faculties. ' But the Agnostic does not tell us how the capacities and faculties of one individual or one class of individuals, tribe, or nation, as uncivilized, civilized, enlightened and religious, come to possess almost infinitely higher capacities, enabling them to elevate the character of their idea of God than those of other individuals, tribes, or nations ; for he denies all knowledge of God by revelation! He says 'All knowledge and supposition of the Absolute are none other than the image of ourselves, and our thoughts, projected and magnified in the dim twilight of the vast.' How, then, are we to account for the vast difference between the Fetich's idea of God�some immense object of sense, as a great mountain, a mighty river, a tremendous rock, a wonderful tree, a terrible animal and the true Christian's idea of God�a Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother. If no revelation from God, how are we to account for the immense difference of the sense of right and wrong, between the cannibal tribes, who, for untold ages have believed it right to kill a man for the purpose of eating him, and those peoples who feel and believe it to be wrong and wicked, to kill a man under any circumstances, and wrong to injure his person or property ; or, needlessly to pain any living being ? Tracing human history backward, we observe, that, through some source, and, by some means, superior ideas of the God character have appeared, from one period to another, suddenly, or, as it were, spasmodically, and, through some individual agency, and not as a gradual development of the whole people of a tribe, nation, or community ; but, producing such tribal or national development. How are we to account for this, except by the admission of an All wise, Superior Intelligence, whom we may justly call God? And, by revelations from this God to such individuals as mediators between God, and these mediators fellow men? If no absolute and Sovereign Power, as God, exists, no Intelligence higher than man, how are we to account for the multitudinous superhuman manifestations of power operating upon certain portions of the human race from time to time, in all ages of history, of which we have authentic and reliable records ? True, there have been prodigies of human ability who have performed most wonderful and astounding feats; but, coincident with these phases of human experience there have been manifestations of some power entirely beyond the limits of the human capacity manifested through human prodigies, and, in the entire absence of human agency! Evidences of superhuman power, in all ages of human history are numberless. Whence their origin if there be no God? 'Tis done! The evident manifestations of an Absolute Existence and power by whom man has being, and, to him, as the Creature of this Absolute Power, is delegated a limited portion of this power, are as numberless as the sands of the seashore ! It is man's portion, being thereby taught, to listen, obey, and adore ! It is not necessary to abstract our entire conceptions of God from nature's manifestations-, God's Works / in order to have. a religious veneration for the Deity ; neither is it necessary to make a God of Jesus, as old as his Father, and older than his Mother, in order to become-i a 'religious'�A Christian ! There is all difference between theological Creedism, and true Christian Religion ! Infidelity�Disbelief in God, and rejection of religion, is the recoil of human reason against mysterious, usphilosophical creed dogmatism ! It is by the heart, quite as much as by the intellect that the soul is united to God and Heaven ! The Syllogisms in the arguments of the Agnostics, by which they negative the conclusions of their own philosophy, result in a contradiction of human experiences the revelations of the knowledge of which are as absolute as the periodical incidents of day and night. It is not a difficult thing to frame verbal theorems so contradictory, as, apparently, to astound philosophy itself; but, these apparent aphorisms do not present acceptable apodixis .' What experience verifies we do not care if verbal philosophy denies! In logic it can be proved that this side of the river is the other side ; but, reason tells us it is still this side, just the same. There is an intuitive sense in all human beings that inspires the idea of God. 'All history tells of man's effort to bring God near,' thus Idolatry. And, 'At last we see what human progress means, it means throwing off the brute inheritance through ages of struggle. ' And, however God may be panoplied with attributes by the unenlightened ideas of humanity, yet, the history of human developments declares revelations from God, though Agnostics, and agnosticism maj not be able to acknowledge them! Ability, and the consequent accountsability have been vouchsafed to mankind in different degrees, and, these have not been the incidental characteristics of race, clime, or country, but, exotic productions, brought from superior spheres. And, ' The present uncertainty' manifest by Agnosticism 'is not to endure.' There will be 'some fresh word of power for each age. ' Re- ligion, genuine,�the power to live a virtuous godly life, is a gift from the Hea\ ens ; the soul of man loves its behests, and glorifies its possessors ! God be praised ! lleligion is the vital fountain of virtue. It is the founder of civilization and refinement; it is the institutor, the protector and defender of the natural rights of man. It is the enfranchisement of will ; the liberator of conscience ; it is the arbiter between judgment and mercy ; the discerner of merits and demerits, and the dispenser of forgiveness under the Divine law of love. Without religion�genuine, that manifests love to God above by love to man below, the human family slink back into chaotic darkness, instituting social conditions where might is law, and right is unknown, where selfish desire and animal greed prompts the courses of life, and demoralization and desolation devastate the plane of human existence, where love is twined to lust, and the beastly nature of man knows no bounds but those of superior brute force ; where the finer feelings of angelic love and tenderness are submerged by lawless passions, and where the pleadings of the soul are silenced by the fulminating impulses of the brutal nature of man. To abandon the religious element in man is to deny the existence of God ; to reject all accountability in man to any authority ; to institute unlimited war, bloodshed, contention and strife, to let loose the dogs of pandemonium. Multitudinous are the charges of wickedness, injustice, contention and strife, murder and desolation against religion, (so called,) but, this is not against true religion, but servile creedism of human origin, and, as opposed to true religion, as fire to water ; this has been the adoption of a child of hell into the family relation, as tutor and guide, to blind the eyes of the worldly wise and eat up the peace of the enlisted soldier under the banner of human creed these set wide the distance between the temples and altars of human worshipers of differing professors and denominations, and build the walls of churches that separate souls, who, otherwise led by true religion had mingled soul to soul in a heavenly and angelic alliance. Buddha said '�The religious man only is good. And what is goodness? First, and foremost, it is the agreement of the will with the conscience. A man who devotes himself to religion, is like one who takes a lighted torch to a dark house; the darkness is dissipated. ' 'In reflection, in life, in conversation, in study, I never forget the supreme end, religion. ' ' Truth is to be sought with a mind purified from the passions of the body. Having overcome evil things thou shalt experience the union of the immortal God, with the mortal man.'' u Man is perfected by conversing with God, which he can only do when he abstains from evil, and strives to imitate the Divine nature. Second, by doing good to others. Third, by turning from the absorption of material things.' '� True religion helps persons who possess it to amputate from the body, in some degree disease ; from the soul indifference to one's self and others good ; from the senses injurious pleasures and luxuries ; from a household discord, and establishes peace, and union of the spirit. But, the present era appears to be fraught with a restless effort to extri- 10g cate the race of man from the obligations, restraints, sacrifices and blessings of religion. An effort to disprove the existence of a God as man's Creator, and, as a consequence, to deny the possibility of any knowledge of duty, or accountability by the possession of ability or the dictum of revelation. This is not strange ; it is the ligitimate fruit of false, and human theology, which reason, and revelation teach man to reject. But, the theories of agnosticism would man an evolution from a protoplasm,� an accident of nature, or matter, and matter an accident, or incident of the primamateria ; and, so far as this philosophy reveals, the primamateria; an incident of something lighter, and less luminous than moonshine ! But, a living soul cannot afford to do without God and religion. True religion is redemption from barbarism ; it is the all powerful panoply of God committed to man to resist the assaults of all those evil passions that are the resources from whence all curses flow to man. It is the light that shines on the pathway of heaven ; it is the price that purchases heaven's blessings, and the royal benediction, ' For it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom of Heaven.'
