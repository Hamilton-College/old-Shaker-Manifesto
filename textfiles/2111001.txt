SHAKER HARVEST-HOME. On Thursday afternoon, Oct. 1st. at the North Family, Mount Lebanon, N. Y., an industrial exhibition and harvest home gathering took place, consisting of work produced by the family ; mostly of recent date, also of old times. Several Brethren and Sisters from other families were present, among whom was Eldress Eliza Ann Taylor, of the Miuistry, and to that aged Sister a hearty welcome was given. Eldress Anna White, in some introductory observations, said that they were greatly blessed, that day, in the harvest work. There were sowing, planting and reaping seasons; then came the harvest season, when the farmer gathered in cereals, fruits and vegetables, and garnered them in storehouses, before the approach of winter. The little exhibition was suggested only on the previous Sabbath. They would find a considerable number of objects to examine ; for some of the work of the North Family was shown, from the year 1820 to the present time and it was al.so the work of old and young. They would have accepted the work of those in other families who had once lived in this order ; but the exhibition was rather premature. In a central position, they would observe an ever- green tree, which was planted by Elder Frederick, ami upon it were a few leaflets of his publication. There would be an opportunity of walking around and inspecting all the contributions, after a few readings and recitations. Six youug Sisters sang 'Flowers of Heaven.' Readings by Martha Bur� ger, 'My Offering;' and Cora Vinneo, 'A Comparison between Flowers ;' recitation by several little girls, 'The Christian Graces,' faith, hope, charity, purity, godliness. ''Let us learn the Christian graces, as we walk the heav enly road.' Br. Daniel OfFord said that this was a surprise to him, as, he presumed, it was to many others, it was the Sisters' gift and an evidence that the Sisters v. ere keeping the gift for them ; and the Brethren would bless the Misters. Remarking upon some of the objects placed around the room, he said that he was largely concerned in water pipes : a half-inch pipe could be seen there, which was used, in old times, to supply the family with water. Forty years ago, they had three faucets for kitchen, second house and wash house: now, they had over three hundred faucets. (Br. Charles Graves: And every one of them to be taken care of.) The family is supplied with water from a four inch pipe of sixty times the capacity of the half-inch and which will throw a stream of water over the house. It is also used for the bathrooms. The baptism of the body is as essential to our existence in this world as the baptism of the spirit is to our souls ; we realize that there is much in physical existence that can aid in spiritual welfare. Here is our aged brother, Henry Cantrell, whom we are favored to have with us ; thirty years ago, Henry, a first-rate mower, used to mow with the old scythe hanging in the opposite corner: now, one of the little boys, twelve years old, could, with the mowing-machine, do six times as much work in a day. There was an old sickle ; an acre of grain used to be a great day's work for an average man : but now, with the patent reaper and binder, a comparatively feeble person could go round the field and reap at the rate of ten acres per day, with all those bundles bound up. lie then alluded to the results of the progress of horticulture, pointing to some specimens of flue and large yields of apples, tomatoes, squashes, potatoes and sweet corn. All the sunflowers, said he, were from the labors of the boys, and he expected that the sun of righteousuess would shine upon the dear children. The various objects of industry and the display of fruit were then inspected by the company. The celerity with which these products of labor and skiU had been brought together and arranged reminded one (of course, on a small scale,) of the rapid construction and artistic arrangement of 'houses of London in the olden time,' which were so much admired at the Healtheries Exhibition, South Kensington, London, in 1884. The roof was dressed with asparagus bcughs, covered with red berries, with hanging baskets of flowers and trimmings of hawthorn; and an evergreen tree was a central figure of the room. Upon the walls were two beautifully enlarged photographic portraits of former Elders of the Order: Elder Richard Bushnell and Eldress Antoinette Doolittle. Upon the mantel stood a row of lights, from the homemade tallow candle and lamps, to Edison's electric burner. Flower stands were arranged by the side of the room on which were pots of rare plants; another with varieties of flowers ; a sloping frame, covered with wood-moss, dotted with floral designs ; then there were bouquets, in handsome form, of different flowers, each one grouped by itself, all raised at home. Two stands were occupied by the fruit that had been preserved in glass jars, this season ; peaches, pears, pineapples, cherries, plums, gooseberries ; also dried fruit was exhibited; dried cherries, plums and pears. One long table was devoted to the fruit and vegetables gathered from the gardens, farm and orchards: apples, 20 varieties ; pears, 7 varieties ; plums, 2 varieties ; (rather late for plums ;) a fine variety of quinces, peaches and musk-melons. Four varieties of grapes ; 4 of squashes ; 3 of sweet and yellow corn, and some very large pumpkins and mammoth sunflowers. A nest of double-yoked eggs. Three varieties of beans; root-celery; sheaves of wheat and rye, atd a miniature stack of hay. Second table, manufactured articles. Various articles of home-knitting, from our own wool; gloves of fur and silk ; various useful fancy articles. Ryestraw, gathered in June and made into bonnets and mats, the various processes shown ; also, styles of caps worn during the last hundred years; miniature suits of Brethren's and Sisters' clothes, aud specimens of spinning and weaving. Third table, upon which the printed literature and the writings of the family were exhibited. In the center of th table of literature was a model of the ark of the covenant, from Biblical description, pure white, with a gold band around it and draped in white ; modelled by Cecelia De Vere. Placed in the ark was a portrait of our late beloved Minister Giles B. Avery. The third table also included literary compositions, penj;nauship and ornamental designs by the Sisters ; a specimen of William Offbrd's printing; a specimen of shorthand and typewriting. Near the center was a table with refreshments, ornamented with small bouquets. Here was the produce of the dairy, a large sage-cheese, and some gilt-edged creamery butter. Among the curiosities were a model of an old spinningwheel ; some worsted and skeins of yarn, spun by the Sisters many years ago. Upon a shelf were several pairs of home-made shoes of different kinds. A little plot of grass with a poem attached, 'The Beautiful Grass;' also floor-mats aud carpets. Elder Frederick W. Evans said this was a time of gospel union, and he was very glad to see so many young people enjoying life in the gospel. Reverting to the Mosaic dispensation, he spoke of the Hebrew festivals aud Sabbaths, and contrasted the Jewish with the puritanic Sabbath. He had been told by Elder Henry B. Bear that, in the Ohio Society, they had a large preponderance of men, and found difficulty iu getting women converts. He (the speaker) thought that the numbers of the Sisters ought to predominate, as at Lebanon. There were all the chores, attention in sickness, many things necessary for them all, that required the care of Sisters, and a good company of Sisters was one of the blessings that they could not be indifferent to. He congratulated the Sisters upon not being drawn into the whirlpool of fashion, as they would have been if in the order of the world. The Elder then read a short poem by Harding, a spiritualist, pathetically referring to an aged pilgrim 'walking on the strand, waiting for the boatman.' 'A welcome to the boatman,' and mourning, were common feelings in the world, by aud for the aged : but he was walking upon the strand of life and enjoyed it; aud if he could be sure of as good a place aud company in the next world as he was blessed with here, he would be quite satisfied. The nearer to the spirit world, the union grew stronger aud tne enjoyment greater. In concluding, Elder F. W. E. said uOur Shaker order protests against the closing of the World's Fair upon auy oue of 'the seven sabbath days ;' aud against all religious legislation, under our secular government, as being in violation of the Constitution, which guarantees to all citizens, men and women perfect liberty of conscience. 'The Shakers respectfully suggest that, on the Constantiuiau Sunday, the poor�common people�be admitted to the Fair, free, and that a lunch be provided, of good h\gienic food and drink, free of cost. Therefore, we urgently plead for the laboring-classes, the real producers of the larger portion of the World's Exhibition, aud repeat that the World's Fair should be kept open on all the seven sabbaths of the week. Eldress Anna remarked ; While gratified that the Brethren appreciated the labors of the Sisters, they should be glad to have more good Brethren. She then spoke of some of the labor-saving appliances and inventions. She used to stand, all the forenoon, over the wash-tub ; but th.it is done away. She also spoke of the present famine in Russia, and the 'hunger-food.' Among the exhibits was a broom with a paper attached ; entitled 'The Inevitable.' This was read by Rosetta Stephens. Life's common and daily necessities follow us e\ erywhere. Ruth Barry, read 'The Harvest-Home Gathering' ; Julia Lincoln, 'A Praise Offering' of flowers ; Lucy Bowers, a classical piece on 'The Groves ;' Belle Rullhausen an acrostic, 'Fair Rose of Summer ;' Ada Wayne, 'The Harvest-time' of ripened fruit aud grain ; Sarah Bodine, VA Grateful Tribute;' Mabel Lane, 'Fruits and Flowers;' A duet on the organ by Mabel Lane aud Julia Lincoln. May Rullhausen read a poem, 'A Summer Day ;' Eldress Anna, 'The Grass', 'Sing the grass, that brightens this earth of ours.' Br. Charles Graves spoke of what all had done, to help the exhibition alou^r; each had contributed in his or her way. Br. Walter is the herdsman. He represents his charge by this large sage cheese. Again, others put on certain finishing touches so as to produce other articles of food that are here ; j for instance, the cake and pie. 'Otherwise, it will be un-American, j Br. Daniel: We all put a finishing untrue to the founders of our republic j touch on that. and our non-sectarian Constitution ; al- j R. Stephens exhibited some cotton so a base injustice to a large portion of] articles of dress worn by Eldress Ann our best citizens, in depriving them of Taylor, when a little girl; the date the opportunity to attend. thereon being 1821 ; the cotton was grown in Kentucky, and spun and knitted there, by hand ; some of these articles were, at an early date, presented to Eldress Polly Reed. The visitors then returned thanks. Sr. Emma J. Neal, had to leave for the Church office ; said that she was beyond time, having become entangled in the magnetism of the place ; for something so good was there, that she could not stay out. Sr. Minerva Reynolds was very thankful for the opportunity of meeting her Brethren and Sisters, and seeing the products of their industry and the products of their minds, also. She desired to be united with them in all that was good and true. Sr. Catherine Van Houten had observed the progress of the North Family during sixty years, from the time of her early childhood; its increase and blessing. Sr. Phoebe Van Houten said that this was a gathering that tended to a great increase of love and charity. Sr. Martha Anderson remarked, ' have to thank Sr. Phoebe for care during childhood' and, thought Sr. Grace Bowers would, too. Br. Alonzo Hollister characterized this as a 'feast of reason and flow of soul.' In regard to new-comers, remarks had been made about the difference between 'men' only, and those who truly became 'Brethren ;' but it should be borne in mind, in regard to the future Brethren and Sisters, that it must necessarily take time to complete the gospel work and transform them from the worldly to the spiritual. He was not behind any one in prizing his good Sisters, or his good Brethren. Elder Timothy Rayson congratulated the Brethren and Sisters upon the success in gathering the various articles and in arranging them, aud presenting them for mutual benefit. It is really a 'Harvest-Home.' I enjoy these occasions as much as any one. I would have been glad if more from the other families could have had an opportunity of being present, but a great many of them, it being a busy season of the year, were attending to their duties at home; and we know that there is a good rule to be observed, 'Duty first; pleasure afterwards.' I thank the North Family for the privilege of meeting with them, and for the invitation to enjoy this social gathering. One of the Sisters, in speaking of flowers, had quoted, that 'a thing of beauty is a joy forever.' The present occasion caused in the mind a happy reflection of meeting so many good Brethren and Sisters, all contributing to make their home beautiful and a joy forever, to each and every one. The choir sang, 'See the goldea fruits that come from our heavenly Harvest-Home.' There was then an interval for refreshments; aud, after singing a piece entitled 'Blessing,' and some friendly conversation, the company separated. The exhibition will remain open until next Monday, to give other visitors an opportunity of attending; an offer which has been accepted. Reported by Martin W. Miles. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
