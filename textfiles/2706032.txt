The Rev. Irl R. Hicks Almanac The Rev. Irl R. Hicks Almanac for 1897 is well worthy of a careful perusal. It contains an abundance of profitable and interesting subjects, that must do good to those who read to become intelligent. Storm Diagrams and Forecasts are arranged for every month in the year. A Star Map also represents the heavens every month which will make the Almanac doubly interesting to those who wish to 'seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning.'
