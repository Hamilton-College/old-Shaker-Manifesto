THE ARAB LEGEND. There is a quaint Arabian legend which tells of the pilgrimage to Mecca of two devout followers of the Prophet. Abouk journeyed on foot; Selim was mounted on a camel. At night-fall both the pilgrims had reached a spring of water in the desert, where grew a few palm trees. They prepared to spend the night together. 'It is a long and tedious journey,' said Abouk. 'On the contrary, it is short and pleasant,' answered Selim; 'I was cheered by a mirage on the horizon, wherein I saw the spires and temples of the Holy City.' 'There was no mirage, no Holy City to be seen !' angrily declared Abouk; 'there were, instead, legions of venomous ants in the sand, that bit and poisoned my flesh.' 'Not a single ant was on the desert,' rejoined Selim. The two pilgrims were quarreling fiercely, when a good priest, also journeying toward Mecca, came up. He* listened to them patiently. 'Peace my brethren,' he said, at last; 'let us leave these questions until to-morrow night to decide. In the meantime, let Selim go on foot, and Abouk ride the camel.' They consented to this exchange of places. On the next night it was Abouk who had seen the glorious visions, and found the journey pleasant, and it was Selim who had been bitten by the ants. 'My brothers/' said the priest, 'we are all going to Mecca, whether we walk or ride ; but Selim can not see what Abouk sees unless he stands where Abouk stands. It is well to change places occasionally.' Argonaut.
