THE MESSENGER By Nancy L. Rupe North, east, west and southern household, Children of our heavenly king, All in harmony together, Let us one more offering bring. We've been passengers, dear kindred, In the Messenger of Thitii, Met each month in blest communion, Aged, middle-aged and youtn. Blessed voyages ! How pleasant, As we sailed from shore to shore, Proving love a heaven-born token 'God is Love'â€”we ask no more. Had we eloquence of language To portray the grand career Of the wisely guarded vessel, As it moved from year to year, Strewing bread upon the waters, That in future will return, Setting starlights in dark places That will never cease to burn. Sowing seed for future ages, Plants from which can never die, These are watered from a fount Of living streams that never dry. But like autumn leaves and flowers Childhood, youth and middle age, All succumb to final changes Passing from life's active stage, Precious treasure, 'Manifesto,' Dost thou in like manner pass ? 182 THE MANIFESTO. Hast fulfilled thy glorious mission, Must we bid adieu at last? Brethren, let us chant a requiem, Sisters, join the plaintive strain, That our greetings, as in past times, Never will return again ! But a glorious day is dawning When earth's conllicts will be o'er, Rapturous thoughts, O glorious meeting On the grand immortal shore. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
