The grasshopper plague in the West has directed attention to the terrible waste and destruction of game that used to be so abundant in the country now afflicted with insects. Formerly, when grouse, quail and other insectivorous game birds were abundant on the prairies, people never heard of grasshopper plagues. They have only been known since the people of the West have indulged in wanton destruction of the birds, so that they might make money by selling their carcases to the eastern markets. To such a degree has this business been carried on that-of late years dealers have been offered high prices for squab-grouse, as a dainty, and the young birds have thus been slain before they had done their part in replenishing the earth. Once the prairies used to be covered with luxuriant vegetation, in which were myriads of grouse ; and nobody ever heard then of grasshoppers eating up the prairie grass. The birds had the advantage over them, and ate them up before they got time to lay waste an acre. The birds have now been destroyed or driven away to remote and unoccupied territory, where, of course, they will again be pursued by the gunners, unless the western legislators pass laws by which the destruction of the birds may be prevented and their increase be promoted. The grasshopper is just as dainty to the grouse and the quail as is the measuring worm to the English sparrow, and the way to abolish the annual plague of the grasshopper is to prevent the destruction of all such birds by legally punishing their destroyers.
