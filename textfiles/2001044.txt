Nashua Weekly Telegraph Nashua Weekly Telegraph, is from the Telegraph Printing Office, Nashua, N. H., and under the management of O. C. Moore. It has come out in a new dress, and being well printed, becomes a pleasure to read it. Wonderful Advance has been made in Calendar making of late years, and the enterprising proprietors of Hood's Sarsaparilla seem to have completely mastered the business. For their calendar for 1890 is so beautiful in conception and general effect as to be almost beyond improvement. Fourteen colors were used by the lithographer in producing the beautiful head, the flesh tints being simply exquisite. To be appreciated this Calendar must be seen. Ask for Hoojd's Calendar and Hood's Holiday Herald at your druggist's, or send 6 cents in stamps to C. I. Hood &amp; Co., Lowell, Mass.
