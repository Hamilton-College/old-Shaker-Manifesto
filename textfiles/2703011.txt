Pleasant Hill, Ky. Feb. 1897. We had beautiful weather till the night of the 24th of January the mercury then dropt to 6 deg. below zero. The next day it was 9 deg. below with two inches of snow. The weather soon became warmer and most of the snow disappeared. Our ice-houses are filled with good ice, one inch thick. Nancy L. Rupe. Not
