Spirit of our July number THE SPIRIT OF OUR JULY NUMBER. By a careful perusal of our present issue it will appear to the candid reader fruitful with hope and confidence in our loving parentage, Father and Mother God, and the continued growth of love to our fellow beings. The cogent and liberal feelings exhibited by our brethren are worthy of notice. Although Elder Eads is determined the infidels shall have a God, yet he is very kind hearted about his compulsions we know. Eead Bright's and Beecher's remarks. Consider the tribute to Jesus paid by our liberal brethren, the Hebrews ; and the 'Teachings of The Talmud.' In ' Creeds' we find exhibited a very pretty spirit; and we get some important lessons from 'Religions of Head and Heart.' The epitome of â€¢'The Wisdom of Contemporaries' will give all more love, and better opinion of mankind's leaders of thought. Don't fail to learn 'The True Shepherd's Voice,' and sing it with us on second Sunday in July. We have endeavored to present a good number. The verdict we leave with our intelligent readers.
