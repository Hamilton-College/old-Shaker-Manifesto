SYMPATHY ' A soft answer turneth away wrath ; but grievous words stir up anger.' How little we appreciate the amount of good to be derived from kind words. The tides of men's lives are turned by kind words, fitly spoken. A cheery ' Merry Christmas,' or a ' Happy New Year,' will draw one from a gloomy contemplation of self, and fill the heart with charity and love for all mankind. Many, upon the verge of a foolish, wicked action, are, by a pleasant word, or kindly recognition, drawn away, and made to look upon their trials and crosses in a light modified by the sympathy so expressed ; and with renewed zeal gird their armor of good resolves the closer, and spring forward in the battle they are waging against their own terrible pride and passions. So let us not only sympathize with one another, but express our sympathy; and in so doing enlarge our charity for the short comings, and our appreciation of the struggles of others in the way of right. Then let us cultivate our powers of sympathizing ; let us grow womanly in this respect, and learn to use tact and delicacy in our sympathies. Let us cultivate our sensibilities, so that we may intuitively understand the conditions of others, and be quick to sympathize and help. Let no lives be lost through the lack of cheering words. E
