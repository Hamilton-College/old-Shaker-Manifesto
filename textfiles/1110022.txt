SPEAK GENTLY C. A. If we would consider how much more grief and remorse we must suffer from unkind expressions that we utter, than from those we bear, we would be more careful not to return ill for ill, and more apt to remember, that ' A soft answer turneth away wrath.' Oh ! was there more love divine on this broad earth below, 'Twould lume the gloomy haunts of sin with its celestial glow, And many hearts now crushed by scorn, who to their fate were driven. Would be reclaimed by love that breaths the blessed word ' forgiven.' As he whose bright example gleamed adown the ages past, Asked those who knew no sin, to first the stone of judgment cast; But, guilty hearts shrank from the deed as ne'er they shrank before, While to the erring one he said, ' arise, go sin no more.' Grand words, so full of charity! so rich in heavenly love! More potent far than human law the sinners heart to move ; This Christ, indwelling in the heart, e'er prompts to noble deeds, And meets with truth's exalted power, the spirit's inmost needs. 0 blessed is the heart! that tunes its heavenly minstrelsy, While drawing inspiration deep, O fount of love from thee ! Depending on the power that guides through bright and clouded days, At morn and eve it lifts the voice in hymns of grateful praise. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
