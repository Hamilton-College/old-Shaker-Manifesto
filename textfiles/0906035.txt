DO US THE FAVOR Friends, to circulate the copy of the Manifesto falling into your handsSend for specimen copies to be sent to friends. Five cents might do five dollars' worth of good, by thus sending to some needy one—needing the influences of spirituality imparted by the Manifesto—a copy of our little paper. We work only for the good of the people ; that they may be better. We wish we could give all for the people's good, without any return payment, but we cannot. We give our time, strength, and the best ability we have, without asking payment, other than that of a good conscience doing our duty. Therefore, good friends, help us to sustain the physical fabric of the Manifesto, even by the pittances of single subscriptions; and 'you shall in no wise lose your reward.'
