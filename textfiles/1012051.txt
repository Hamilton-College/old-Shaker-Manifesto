A Curious Way to Deaden Pain .â€” The Medical Record contains a notice of a new and curious method of deadening pain which is of striking simplicity. It was discovered by Dr. Bonwill, a dentist of Philadelphia, in 1875. In 1876 Dr. A. Hewson made a favorable report of his experience with it to the International Medical Congress, and at a recent meeting of the Philadelphia County Medical Society several papers were read on the subject, and much discussion followed. In using the method, the operator merely requests the patient to breathe rapidly, making about 100 respirations per minute, ending in rapid puffing expirations. At the end of from two to five minutes an entire or partial absence of pain results for half a minute or more, and during that time teeth may be drawn or incisions made. The patient may be in any position, but that recommended is lying on the side, and it is generally best to throw a handkerchief over the face to prevent distraction of the patient's attention. When the rapid breathing is first begun the patient may feel some exhilaration ; following this comes a sensation of fullness in the head, or dizziness. The face is at first flushed, and afterward pale or even bluish, the heart beats rather feebly and fast, but the sense of touch is not affected, nor is consciousness lost. The effect is produced in females more readily than in males, and in the middle-aged more easily THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 281 than in the old ; children can hardly be made to breathe properly. It is denied that there is any possible danger. Several minor operations, other than frequent dental ones have been successfully made by this method, and it is claimed that in dentistry, minor surgery and obstetrics it may supplant the common anaesthetics. Dr. Hewson's explanation is that rapid breathing diminishes the oxygenation of the blood, and that the resultant excess of carbonic acid temporarily poisons the nerve centers. Dr. Bonwill gives several explanations, one being the specific effect of carbonic acid, another the diversion of will force produced by rapid voluntary muscular action, and third, the damming up the blood in the brain, due to the excessive amount of air passing into the lungs. The Record is not satisfied with the theories, but considers it well proved that pain may be deadened by the method, which it commends to the profession for the exact experimental determination of its precise value.
