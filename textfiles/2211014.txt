I asked the Lord that I might grow... [Contributed by Thomas J. Stroud.] 'I asked the Lord that I might grow In faith, and love, and every grace; Might more of his salvation know, And seek more earnestly his face. ' Twas He that taught me thus to pray And He, I trust, has answered prayer; But it has been in such a way, As almost drove me to despair. I hoped that in some favored hour, At once He'd answer my request, And by his love's constraining power Subdue my sins, and give me rest. Instead of this, He made me feel The hidden evils of my heart, And let the angry powers of hell Assault my soul in every part. Yea, more, with his own hand, He seemed Intent to aggravate my woe; Crossed all the fain designs I schemed, Blasted my hopes and laid me low. Lord why is this? I trembling cried, Wilt Thou pursue thy worm to death? 'Tis in this way, the Lord replied, I answer prayer for grace and faith. These inward trials I employ, From self and pride to set thee free; And break thy schemes of earthly joy That thou may'st find thy all in Me.' H. M. H. in ''Steppings in God.''
