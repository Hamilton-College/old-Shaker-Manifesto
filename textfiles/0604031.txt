ENGRAFTED The Order of Trappist Monks has sent an agent to this country in the person of Brother Francis de Sales, who has been commissioned to purchase property in the State of Maryland, where it is proposed to erect a monastery and furnish it with grounds sufficiently extensive for the pursuit of agriculture, which is an important industry among the monks of La Trappe. Two hundred monks taken from monasteries in Ireland, France and Turkey will occupy a house which Brother Francis de Sales will temporarily rent, so that during the erection of the monastery and the laying out of the grounds the newly arrived monks may make themselves familiar with the customs of the country. They are expected to arrive about December. The rules which bind the Trappists are very stringent. Constant silence is one of their vows. They are permitted to eat no other food than vegetables and bread, water alone being allowed for drink. They sleep in their habit, or gown, on a low pallet, and their bedroom is a small square inclosure formed by curtains. The bell-ringer arouses them at two o'clock every morning, and after a few minutes allowed for their prayers at waking, another bell bids them fall into line, and move in solemn silence to their chapel. They toil unremittingly throughout the hours when prayer and other devotions are not in progress.
