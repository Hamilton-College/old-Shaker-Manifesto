Shakers, N. Y. Jan. 1893. The festive season of Christmas and New Year has come and gone*. Its record we hope will be a verdant spot in the memories of those who were the participants. Willing hands placed a beautiful evergreen tree in our chapel, and with its brilliant illumination from the candle lights presented a very cheery aspect. But best of all was the burden of gifts placed thereon by that dear old friend Santa Claus. He must have a splendid memory as no one was forgotten. On Christmas eve we met to receive the gifts that he had to bestow. Hope that every fireside and home in our land was visited. While we step on the threshold of the New Year and find its page clean and white we question what will be its record at the close? Just what we make it. Only one moment at a timp is all we have to carry and the future ceases to be, by becoming the present. As we read of rumors of war and see the belligerent attitude assumed by the dying monarchies of Europe as a bluff to frighten their enemies; at the same time trembling with fear at the portends of the coming revolution which will be their overthrow, we pray that in our own beloved country the counsels of wisdom may prevail, so tha,t her mission can be to direct the nations of the earth to that condition of life which is founded upon the spix'it of love as it is the all conquering power. May all who love the truth be encouraged. We wish all of our gospel friends a prosperous year, and may the cause that we have given our life to sustain be blest as the result of faithful efforts. Hamilton DeGraw.
