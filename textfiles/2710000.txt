ESTABLISH THE HEART. By Elder Henry C. Blinn. JESUS stands in advance of all who have accepted the system of united fj inheritance, where the selfish interests are made to give place to a more universal care for mankind. Paul in speaking to the Hebrews has said ;�'Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day and forever. Be not carried away with diverse and strange doctrines ; for it is a good thing that the heart be establisht with grace.' From the earliest ages, God has called out his witnesses from among mankind and some of them have been as true as the needle to the pole, while others have failed to receive a very deep impression and have hardly been raised above the level of the world. The first witness of God's power�the man in Eden�signally failed and years past away, before another special witness was called. These messengers of God, including a long list of prophets, judges, kings and priests have accomplisht a wonderful work among mankind. The influence being more for good than for ill, is world-wide, and it will continue to increase toward God and for humanity while time lasts, and of this there need not be the least doubt. The most remarkable of these witnesses is found in the person of Jesus the Christ. His work was wholly on the side of good, as righteousness became the foundation upon which his life and testimony were establisht. The disciples and apostles were also witnesses of the same good work. Even of more modern date, without the knowledge of John Calvin, Martin OCTOBER, Luther, George Fox and Wm. E. Channing, thousands might have been left in greater darkness on the subject of Christianity. Prominent among all the witnesses of God, the Christ life of Mother Ann Lee has been accepted by the Shakers. As a preacher of righteousness, she taught her followers as did Jesus, to take up their crosses against the pernicious influences of the world, and to deny themselves of 'all ungodliness and every worldly lust.' Her mission is wonderful in that a woman should dare to teach when the Bible, the Christian's word of God, was wholly revealed unto men. Paul had also expressly taught that the women should accept all religious instructions from their husbands. The unmarried, of course, were ruled out. But Ann Lee broke all these barriers and taught publicly and privately, as did Jesus, that the pure in heart, the meek and the merciful, should be called the children of God, and that the disciples of our Lord could never engage in warfare with carnal weapons,�that in preference to all other things, we must seek the Kingdom of God and its righteousness. Persecuted in England by the inquisition of the Protestant church, a few only of the number came to America and establisht a Community of united interest. In 1810 they were able to publish a book of some oOO pages. It set forth their views of the Christian life, and a review of the antichristian churches. This has been called the Shaker Bible, but' the Shakers were innocent of the charge and went on as before, reading and making their sermons from the authorized version, by King James, which within a few years has been, and is still being so thoroughly pruned by the I). Ds. of the churches. Referring to the united interest, we are justified in believing that it was the order of the Primitive church. Jesus and his twelve disciples are our first examples. They were Shakers in the full sense of the word. To the rich it was said,�'Go sell what thou hast, give it to the poor, then come and follow me.' To those who owned less of this world's goods, selfishly, it must be said in the words of the disciple, 'Behold, we have forsaken all to follow thee.' The rich and the poor gave all to Christ and became as brothers and sisters in the church of God. It was to forsake all. The Pentecostal church was organized on this same basis. They sold all their possessions and gave the money into the consecrated interest of the church, the same as the Shakers are doing at the present time. While the Apostle Paul establisht a reformatory church at Corinth, Ephesus and at Rome, he at the same time establisht them on a very selfish foundation, and admitted all the relations of the old inheritance, which had been so thoroughly opposed by the testimony of Jesus. It was a Gentile, Christian church. It may have been the best that Paul could do under the circumstances, but it presented only a slight resemblance to the church of the disciples. To let every man have his own wife and every woman her own husband, is all Bible doctrine, and we only wish that the Christian conscience was strong enough to keep it as disciplinary as Paul felt authorized to organize it. The Shakers, however, have no controversy on this point, as they consider it a phase of life that no more concerns them either among the saints or sinners, than does any business relation which men and women may choose to follow. The Shakers have never lookt upon the marital relations as being either very good or wholly bad. Marriage began very early in the history of our race and will, in all probability continue, so long as the race lasts, even tho it is in violation to the testimony of Jesus the Christ. The Infidel and pseudo Christian churches, have tried to amalgamate marriage with Christianity, but have so far most signally failed. At best it is only a civil right and all its privileges, as well as all its penalties, are directed by the voice of the civil law. Paul's advice to those carnal Corinthians, which the Christians so loudly eulogize, was perhaps, the same as a Shaker would be inclined to give to a polygamous church, but it presents a sorry picture of the gospel of Jesus, and after the experience of two thousand years, the Christians are looking back and claiming the indulgences of a lower order. Very little did these people think of establishing the heart in righteousness, or of denying themselves of all ungodliness. The disciples of Jesus were higher types of character and were ministers of influences for which it would be an honor to contend. They were the guides to that place of rest, where 'God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and where no more death, neither sorrow nor crying shall be known, for the former things have all past away.'
