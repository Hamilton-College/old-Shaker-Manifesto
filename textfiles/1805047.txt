The Library Magazine The Library Magazine for March comes out in a new dress which is highly creditable to the highclass literature which it embodies. It is certainly a very extraordinary dollar's worth of literature, the nearly 2,500 pages per annum which this Magazine gives to its subscribers. Those who see it are not surprised at such very emphatic endorsements as given, for example, by Prof. Perry of Williams College, in a recent letter to the publisher: ' I do not know when my subscription to the Library Magazine expires. Please renew it. I do not intend it shall expire at all so long as I am able to read.'
