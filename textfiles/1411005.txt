AN ANALYSIS 0F HUMAN SOCIETY. No. 1. DECLARING THE LAW WHICH CREATES AND SUSTAINS A COMMUNITY HAVING GOODS IN COMMON. DANIEL FRASER. I introduce the following analysis with a few remarks on co-operation : Having been identified with co-operative efforts, and also with communities having goods in common during the past forty years, I would, for the benefit of those having aspirations after a higher life than our present civilization affords, offer a few thoughts. A number of persons uniting their labor and capital in any industrial business, is co-operation. The relative conditions of rich and poor are not disturbed. The strong, are strong for themselves, the rich, are rich for themselves. The one do not bear the infirmities of the weak, nor the other the conditions of the poor. Co-operation may be just, but organically, it is destitute of the benign- - - -the Christ element. Justice, is not goodness ; it is simply an exchange of equivalents. Goodness illustrates itself in giving, but expecting no return. They are organically distinct. The former may be an eye for an eye, or a stroke for a stroke. Or it may be a pair of boots for a barrel of flour� a bushel of Avheat for two yards of cloth. The latter returns good for evil, blessing for cursing. The former yields just acts, the latter divine deeds. Capitalists may co-operate, and control the property of a country. The real capital of a country is not gold, nor bits of paper. If there was no surplus of the necessaries of life in the markets of the world, what would that which is called capital amount to ? Nothing. Therefore, the actual capital of a country is the food and clothing and other necessaries of life, which the laborers of a country have produced and have to spare. If gold, silver, and bits of paper capitalists co-operate and control the real capital of a country, they control that which does not belong to them. That which the laborer has produced, should never, in the hands of others, he allowed to control him, nor affect injuriously that which he has produced. Within the last century a number of wealthy men co-operated and took possession (under the title of ' The East India Company') of a great country, containing millions of people. They controlled the land, and, of com&gt;e, the laborer and what he produced. Holding absolute possession of the soil, they assume to be at once�rulers�legislators�soldiers and merchants ; a combination terrible in power�it was hell organized upon earth. The course they adopted, ultimated within the past i'aw years (under the auspices of the British Government) in the destruction of millions of human beings. Co-operators on a smaller scale, buy great tracts of land, monopolize it, and the contained minerals, coal for instance, an article given for the general good of all. These co-operators tax the community, and sometimes actually control legislation. Hence, co-operation may be Satanic as above, and be just, as is the case with that form of co-operation which attractsattention at present ; which createsproperty and distributes it according to the power expended in creating it. Every infringement of justice is a Satanic act. The priiiia facie evidence Is, tbat the greater portion of human action at present, is Satanic. The late Avar�the stupendous struggle of the slave�the Saftaiiic poAvcr, Avas intrinsically, to cause the slaAre to create property, and con,sume none except what AAras necessary to �create more. The sympathy extended to said poAver, by the ruling, the educated, and established religious classes, �over nearly the Avhole surface of Christendom, indicates Avhatformof society at present prevails. All efforts at reform are to pr.�A'ent certain persons from holding and consuming property Avhich they did not create. 1 suggest that*all co operative societies, the members being creators of property, should have legislative protection, bounties, etc., afforded them ; so that a just state of things may prevail. Communities having goods in common embrace the justice of co-operation with this organic difference, that the strong are strong for the Aveak as for themselves, and that the two great classes�rich and poor, are unknown. Such a community is a manifestation of the Divine in man, even as slavery is of the Satanic. Every act of goodness is a divine act. Man being capable of benign acts, is evidence that he has a divine life Avithin him ; in a germinal state it may be. The incipient quickening of the divine in man, has been the cause of efforts to establish communities having goods in common, organically embracing and manifesting the benign or divine element in humanity. .lesus recognized this element�'be ye perfect even as your Father Avho is in Heaven is perfect. ' ' Ye are gods�divine, to whom the Avord of God came. Greater things than these shall ye do. ' ' He who is the greatest, let him be your servant, etc. ' This can only be accomplished Avhen the diviue in man is quickened. This quickening, convicts of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. If Ave glance for a moment at the leading minds in the movement toAvards forming communities, we find them the noblest of the noble. Their highest aspirations Avere to inaugurate among men the reign of love and universal peace. Self-sacrificing men. all honor to you. A simple Shaker, from the midst of his quiet home, extends to you the Olive Branch of fraternity. How is it that the noblest of men have not been able to establish communities having goods in common ? They had honest hearts, ability and zeal, and other elements of success, yet they failed. The non-success of communities, embracing a number of families, and the success of the Shaker Order, led me to an analysis of human society. For, if physical things can be analyzed, and their forces, affinities, and quantities determined ; Avhy should not human society also be analyzed, and its forces and affinities ascertained, and thereby prevent, in the future, material loss and disappointments ? With this vieAv Ave will inquire, First, what arc the primary atoms of human society ? Second, Avhat are the forces of these atoms ? Third, what are the products of these forces on each other? Fourth, Avhat are the organic laws Avhich create and define distinct classes in human society ? and Avhat.phases do.es society assume in reference to the organic laws of each ? ' I will now classify the materials to be analyzed; Human society presents itself in three distinct orders. The just, the Satanic and the divine. The organic law of the just order, is love of self, and neighbor as self. This order was represented by the Jews, and is beginning to appear in the United States, ' All men are equal,'' see also Homestead Bill, and other items flowing from just principles. A Jew had as practical a right to land so that he might eat, as to air so that he might breathe, an usury being forbidden, prevented the growth of a moneyed firigtocracy controlling the products of labor, and arbitrarily changing their value. The organic law of the Satanic, is love of self, at the expense of the neighbor. This i- represented by two phases. First, by holding human beings in absolute vassalage ; breaking up the matrimonial and parental relationships of the enslaved, takin ; from them the property they create, standing between them aud knowledge, and trampling upon their free agency.
