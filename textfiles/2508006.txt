Dear Elder Henry;--In the June Manefesto... Mentone, Ala. June 21, 1895. Dear Elder Henry;In the June Manifesto was a letter from C. G. Reed, of Mt. Lebanon, containing matters of vast importance to those of obscure vision. A medium of unquestioned integrity who lives in our neighborhood, read Brother Reed's letter at my solicitation, and although somewhat prejudiced against the Shakers, consented to try for a view of the Florida enterprise with an eye single, so to speak, to the spiritual side of the work. He passed down the east side of Florida for a distance, thence inland to the place of the temporal operations of the colony in Osceola Co. His view of the plantation was brief. Immediately a cloudy pillar, glistening and pure white was presented to his view. Its base rested in the center of the colony's possessions. He was impressed that it reached from earth to heaven. He says it was heavenly and beyond his powers of true description. So far as I know no one has anything against the above medium whose name is Henry Mason. He says this letter contains no false impressions so far as he is concerned. Yours for a life as pure as the cloudy pillar. E. B. Gillette.
