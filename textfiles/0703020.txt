A Very Common Error I want to point out to my hundreds of children who read The Shaker, a very common error in writing and speaking — one committed frequently by otherwise good, scholarly writers and speakers. It is in the improper uses of the little words, or and nor ; no, not, neither and either. Almost every paper or book we read, some instances of the error occur. Remember that either and or are used together, as 'Either you or I must go.' But the most common mistake is in using no, not, neither and or together, as ''Neither you or I;' 'iVo man or woman, nor child or beast escaped.' Corrected: '¦Neither you nor I; ' 'No man nor woman, neither child nor beast escaped.' Bear in mind that no, neither, nor, not, etc., are used in conjunction, and either, or, etc. I think the cause of such common, but thoughtless mistakes, is the good, grammatical rule, 'Two negatives are equal to one affirmative;' but this rule has no connection, in fact, with the above mistakes, but may be supposed to have by many. There are some instances where the usage of good writers and speakers could never be admitted to be good grammar nor sensible; and the above errors are among the number. Now let me refer you to a: mistake in the January number. In the beautiful music we find, 'No longer,' etc., and further on, 'Or wish,' etc. This was a mistake of mine—of my eye, not of my understanding. Now read the second verse, third line, and you will find better work. After a little notice of, and practice in correcting these errors, you may become as afflicted by seeing them made so commonly, as your friend, Geo. Albert
