KIND WORDS. Respected Friend;--I send you a short contribution... North Union, 0. May, 1889. Respected Friend ;�I send you a short contribution for the 'Manifesto,' with sincere wishes for its long continuance and unceasing prosperity. Respectfully, W. L. Lincoln. My present feelings lead me to say a word of appreciation... Shaker Station, Ct., May, 1889. My present feelings lead me to say a word of appreciation of the Manifesto. I think it an excellent exponent of our resurrection life, to the world. I appreciate the Editorials which maintain a protest against the worldly element in the so-called Christian churches. I feel like saying, God speed the Manifesto on its mission. Thomas Stroud. Beloved Elder Henry:--We are in receipt of the June Manifesto... Shakers, N. Y., June, 1889. Beloved Elder Henry :�We are in receipt of the June Manifesto, which is always a welcome visitor, and I trust an agency of much good. Our Brethren and Sisters think this number is very good. Your Brother, Ozias T. Bogart.
