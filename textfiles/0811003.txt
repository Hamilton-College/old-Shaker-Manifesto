ADVICE TO YOUTH. DANIEL ORCUTT Never be discouraged by trifles. 'If a spider breaks his thread twenty times he will mend it again.' Firmly resolve to subdue wrong and you can do it. Be not disheartened at slow progress ; work on ; little by little great things are accomplished ; 'with truth for your standard' success will be certain. Fear not when trials come ; though the day seem dark, trust in God and all will be well. Mind what you run after. Never be content with bubbles that burst and end in disappointment. Get that which you can keep, that is worth keeping. Koot out the noxious passions from the heart, as you would hurtful plants from the garden. Cherish the virtues, love, meekness, modesty, goodness, purity ; let them thrive and pro- duce their natural fruit, real happiness and joy. Fight hard against sinful thotights. Temptations will come; resist them firmly. Say to the tempter, 'Get thee hence, Satan.' The indulgence of sinful thoughts produces sinful actions. 'When lust hath conceived it bringeth MANIFESTO. THE SHAKER MANIFB1STO. S67 forth sin ; sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.' Evil passions grow fast; they are hard masters ; destroy them or they will destroy you! Evil passions are vile weeds of the heart, and every indulgence of them is seed, from which will spring a new crop. If your thoughts are pure, your souls will be lovely; if impure, they will be deformed and wretched. Keep your minds filled with good thoughts that bad ones may find no room to enter. Look well to your thoughts. You are sowing on the field of life. Be sure that the seed is good. 'As you sow, so shall you reap.' If you sow 'tares,' you will reap a harvest of vices ! Suppose a farmer should sow vile seed with his wheat, and say, 'When the grain is ripe I will gather and separate them ? ' Would it not be better to sow clean wheat? Sow only pure seed, that when you reap, you may find nothing but golden grain. Enfield, Gt.
