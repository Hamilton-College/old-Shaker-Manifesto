VEGETARIANISM Journal of Chemistry There was a discussion on this subject at a recent meeting of the Medical Society of London. True vegetarians, it was urged, eat neither butter, eggs, nor milk. Sir Joseph Fayrer related his experience of the effects of this diet among the natives of India, and said he had no doubt that people could live on vegetables alone. He had seen some of the finest specimens of the human race as regards strength, power of endurance, and physical development among the inhabitants of the northwest provinces of India, who were pure vegetarians ; but he accounted for their condition from the fact that their food consisted chiefly of leguminous seeds, such as peas, beans, and the like, which contained a larger amount of nitrogen than other vegetables. The president, Dr. Buchanan, remarked that in the discussion several factors should enter; as age, which was a considerable element, as no doubt people advanced in years appear to thrive on a vegetable diet, whereas children require almost a pure animal diet. Again, climate was a great factor ; and in the treatment of disease it could be strongly advocated ; while, lastly and chiefly, temperance must be strictly enforced, avoiding excess in the use of animal food, and taking, in fact, a middle course.
