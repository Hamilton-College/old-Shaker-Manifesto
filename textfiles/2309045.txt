Southern Receipts for Pickles DELICIOUS MIXED PICKLES. Let five dozen small cucumbers stand in strong brine for three days, writes Eliza R, Parker in a column of 'Southern Receipts for Pickles' in the August Ladies' Home Journal. Wash through cold water several times. Put half a gallon of strong vinegar in a kettle with one ounce of mustard-seed, one of juniper berries, one of celery- seed, half a dozen pods of green pepper, two pounds of sugar, half a dozen small onions and a lump of alum. Let come to a boil, and pour over the pickles for three mornings, heating the vinegar each time. Put the pickles in wide-mouthed bottles and seal.
