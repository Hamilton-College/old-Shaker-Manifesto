Our Congratulation Our noble publisher writes us : 'The general verdict is such, that I congratulate you upon the improvement of our paper. Your editorials are very worthy of consideration. I am unchanged in my opinion, that it is far oetter to say pussy sometimes, than to say cat always! (This advice prevents our saying things very plainly, except in ' Plain Talks.' ) Even Jesus, the radical, was reticent upon subjects which he knew would not be appreciated nor understood. He was wise. The gospel, though so simple that ' a 'ool needs not err,' cannot be sustained 3y fools, nor will a foolish, rash zeal tend to its increase.' â€” N. A. Briggs
