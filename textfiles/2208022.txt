Ayer, Mass. July, 1892. As one individual after another is led to apply for membership in our Society, we have a line chance to see to what extent they have been baptized into a refining and moralizing element necessary for a further work into that which is more spiritual. And where should this refining work commence if not in the minds of the children and youth, who should be pliable an d easily led toward the spirit of good and thus become a blessing to themselves and to their friends. Fathers and mothers, there is nothing of greater importance to you, than to make the welfare of your children the first object of your life;the preserving of the purity and innocence of their young lives. Is the raising of large crops to be compared to it, or is the unceasing scrub scrubscrub! which makes the home a marvel of neatness, to be of parallel importance to the giving of attention to the influences that are moulding the characters of our children, the effects of which will live long after our hard labor has turned to dust? We may not know the effect of a kind word, although it may not be held in remembrance of the speaker, while in the mind of the child, who may have needed just that touch of inspiration, it may awake to new life after a journey of many years. The young mind is always open to surrounding influences, and the brighter those influences are made, the more pleasant becomes life's pathway. Where'er you go, yea, sow a seed, If cloudy be your sky or fair; God's grain shall fruitful be, indeed,. And we to heaven the sheaves may bear. Haying has commenced and we are gathering in crops from some of the seed ! sown in early spring. May the harvest be bountiful. Apples are about a medium crop. Pears and plums are about the same. Were blest with a plentiful supply of strawberries. A. D. B.
