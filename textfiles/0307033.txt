SHAKER AND SHAKERESS Blest Angel of comfort, I welcome you here ; Your mission is holy; 0 be of good cheer: The tidings, so truthful, you bear on your wings A halo of gladness around the heart flings. Move on through the land, diffuse light as you go, Alleviate sorrow, assuage pain and woe; Give joy to the mourning who 're bow'd down with grief, Who fain would from sin and its bonds find relief. A blessing on all, do most freely bestow, As 'round on your errands of mercy you go. 0 bless all truth-seekers who listen to hear A voice from the throne, saying, Come ye up here. 0 bless the truth-loving, and guide them along, To feed in green pastures with Mount Zion's throng. 1 love you, blest Shaker, to me you are dear; I love your companion who's standing so near The Shakeress Virgin ! may she at your side In her comely raiment and meekness abide. For since you are dual, you've surely become A New Thing of Beauty to gladden our home. And should I outlive you, I'll weep at your tomb, There, cull the sweet flowers that over it bloom. Ride on in your majesty, power, and love ; Bear with you the message received from above, That Saviors have now on the earth-plane appear'd, And thousands of souls by their presence are cheer'd. The saints have ascended to clouds of pure light, And still will mount higher to view Heaven's hight. Jane Emily Smith, Mt. Lebanon
