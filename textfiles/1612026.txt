KIND WORDS. I send a Christmas offering... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. I send a Christmas offering to the well conducted Manifesto. Daniel Fraser. It gives me pleasure to... Union Village, Ohio. Dec. 1885. It gives me pleasure to read the Manifesto, and I feel grateful to those who care for it from month to month. I hope the little Monthly may prosper, as it is for the good of Believers, and for those not of our order. Your Gospel Sister, Louisa Farnham. My dear sir; Appreciating your kindness... State Lib. of Mass. Boston, Sept. 1886. Editor of Manifesto, My Dear Sir;�Appreciating your kindness in sending The Manifesto regularly to the State Lib. of Mass., I beg to ask that you will be good enough to send a copy of the number for July 188G, which we have failed to receive,�in order that we may be able to bind the volume complete for preservation. Yours most cordially, C. B. Tillinghast, Acting Lib.
