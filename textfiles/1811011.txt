A SECRET WORK. Thomas Harding. 'Be of good cheer Ihave overcome the world.'''[WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO.] The work of Salvation, by which I mean that hidden series of soul experiences by which the spirit or individual soul, is separated from the flesh, is a secret work. The growth and ripening of grain is imperceptible to the outward eye, but the advance which the wheat has made is observable, and when the proper time arrives the harvest is 'saved,'' that is, separated and stored. The divine admonition 'Confer not with flesh and blood' is very important; to be heedless of it subjects the 'babe in Christ' to much tribulation. The spirit which brings Salvation works in secret, each end which it accomplishes, in its order, is palpable, only, when the end is reached for which the exercise was sent. The wind bloweth where it listeth, we may hear the sound thereof but the end for which it blows and the source from whence it comes, are hidden from the novice until he, or she, experiences the effects ; then is he conscious that the Divinity has been at work within him, for he knows that he has 'come up a step higher.' Following upon this is the assurance that, having come thus far on our journey toward the Infinite, we shall go on and on, until 'He' shall have put all carnal things under his feet, then shall we be free indeed. Who would be willing to retard such mighty work, fraught with such momentous consequences, by yielding to that love of display, notoriety or approbation which has its being in the very core of human character? When the subject has become 'free' then, perhaps not till then, shall he know thaf 'The Father' seetli in secret, that his work, in the heart, is hidden from, and is intended to be hidden from, common observation and comment ; that though the world does not know us and cannot appreciate the work done within us, yet 'He' knows us and it, and that we have been 'saved' and separated from the world's passion and approval and at last rendered willing that it should be so. The skeptic may need 'physical' manifestations to convince him that there is another and more occult world, but those who look into their own souls, do not need that 'Spirit friends' should manifest for that purpose. Ah! no!! what the world of humanity most needs to-day is to have its attention called to the sublime facts of the Divine 'Spirit' and to the world of mystery and sublimity within.ï¿½Sturgis, Mich.
