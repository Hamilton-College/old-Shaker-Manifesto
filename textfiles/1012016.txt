TRUST 'The clouds hang heavy round my way, I cannot see; But through the darkness I believe God leadeth me. 'Tis sweet to keep my hand in his While ail is dim ; To close my weary, aching eyes, And follow him. Through many a thorny path he leads My tired feet; Through many a path of tears I go, But it is sweet TÂ© know that he is close to me, My God, my guide. He leadeth me, and so I walk , quite satisfied. To my blind eyes he may reveal No light at all ; But while I lean on his strong arm I cannot fall.'
