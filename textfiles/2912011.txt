In Memory of our Brother, FRANK O. LIBBEY By Ellen Griffen 'In the midst of life we are in death.' When the deepening shadows of evening Began to darken our way,— When the twilight came softly stealing To shut out the light of day,— The Angel of Death came near us, And took from our fond embrace, One who was loved and cherished, To dwell in a holier place. To a bright and happy mansion, He has striven to prepare; Where no pain can ever enter, Neither sorrow, grief, nor care. He has gone, the reward of his labors To receive, at the blessed throne ; For bearing the cross of the Savior, He shall wear the promised crown. He was almost too young to be taken ; His place we can not fill;— But in loving and true obedience, We will try to do the will Of our Father who art in heaven, And knoweth what is best. So with joy we will let our brother, With the angels in heaven rest. 'Tis hard we know to be parted From friends who seem so dear, But this is no abiding place, We can not tarry here. For soon we shall all hear the summons. The call to the evergreen shore, Where with friends we shall be united, To part with them nevermore. Alfred, Me.
