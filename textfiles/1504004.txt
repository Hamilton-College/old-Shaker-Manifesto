SONG OF THE TAPE-MEASURE. Where is my tape measure? lean go no farther in my work without it; for positive exactness is required not only in the inches, but in the sixteenths and thirty seconds of an inch ! Hustling over the special articles which usually cumber the table of a seamstress, I found, at length, the little symbol of discipline andperfectness. As I caught it up and unrolled its tiny coil, a humming sound fell on my ear, and anon from its gentle tones, I caught these words : ' Measure the thoughts that are filling thy mind; Measure the words thou art speaking; Measure the eyes that all error would find Measure the acts oft repeating. Measure thy feet that they stand in the light; Measure thy hands and be careful, Measure thy life by truth, goodness and right, Measure for God, and be prayerful. ' My little measure seemed doubly dear after this episode, and I resolved that I would try to act through the New Year by the kind advice contained in the song of the Tape-Measure. Canterbury, N. H.
