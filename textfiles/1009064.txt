Ox-Gall Ox-gall . — An ox's gall will set any color — silk, cotton or woolen. One spoonful of gall put into a gallon of warm water is sufficient for the above purpose. Gall is also excellent for taking out spots from bombazines, and after being washed in it they look almost as good as new. It must be thoroughly stirred into water, and not put on the clothes. It is used without soap. After being washed in it, cloth which you want to clean should be washed in warm suds, without using soap.
