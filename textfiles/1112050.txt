A NEW STICKING PLASTER The Scientific American tells us, that at a recent session of the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture, Prof. E. S. Morse gave the following curious particulars about ants: ' The ant belongs to a family of insects such as wasps, bees and hornets, but is the superior of them all, as are the elephant, the horse, the dog, etc., in other lines of animal life. Their mouth is for biting and swallowing food only, not for breathing. Their bite is so . determined and lasting that they are used in some countries for confining the edges of wounds and cuts. Ants' heads are presented to the cut surface, which they grasp with their nippers, when their bodies are cut off, leaving a whole row of them to hold the flesh. They are cheaper than sticking plaster in some countries.
