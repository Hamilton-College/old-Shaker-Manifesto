RETROSPECTION. Agnes E. Newton. Another week its record leaves Upon the page of life; Its golden moments all are flown With joy or sorrow rife. Ah! what the import of the hours Passing so swiftly on? [seek, Whence, what and where the goal Ave What fields are lost or won? Our human hearts indeed are weak Life's mysteries to grasp; Blind guides are theories and creeds, Traditions of the past. Our present need, the claim we urge Before our Father's throne; 'E'en as thy day thy strength shall he' The promise we have known. Increase our faith, make strong and Our spirit's sight, that we [fine May see aright, where duty points The way, to follow Thee. 'Thy will be done' will give the peace That earth can ne'er afford; The scholar's lore, the sceptic's pride Availeth naught with God. ISTo cup passed by, hut in his name Who all of earth resigned; To know and do his Father's will Acceptance we will find. Canterbury, N. H.
