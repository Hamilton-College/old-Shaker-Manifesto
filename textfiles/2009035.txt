White Water, O. North. Family. Aug. 1890. Well here I am again for the month of August I must have something to write about our home, must say we are shining up pretty well here. We have been white-washing the fence along the highway and painting the gates, some a bright red and others a light blue. I have been painting our laundry engine, so it looks like a new one again. We have had our cistern fixed in the front yard, it had caved in last spring, so we are getting things fixed pretty nicely. We have started in the sheep business again, with a start of twelve head of very fine sheep all young frora one to four years. The weather has been very hot for the past week. We are selling off some of our cows and investing the money in the sheep. We are taking care of the cows ourselves now, we used to pay a man $ 18. per month. We have but one hired man at this family. We are also working our road tax and have about four days to work. Our home begins to look very nice. We also put up forty-four rods of combination fence. We will have very short crops of corn here if it does not rain soon. It is very dry. The center family have been taking sugar melons to market. They get from $2.50 to $3 and $3.50 per bushel for them. They have also been in the rabbit business for the past year, they have what they call the german or scotch hares, they have some that would weigh about eight or ten pounds. They have about fifteen young ones and five old ones. They are a fine sight to see, every body admires them. People in this section are plowing for wheat. The center family bought a new creamery witli a crank to raise all of the cans at one time out of the box. Their herdsman has been fixing the cowbarn floor lie is taking out the board floor and putting in stone and gravel floor. H. W. Frederick.
