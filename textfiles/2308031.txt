THINK NO ILL. Catharine Allen. At the present time there is a widespread movement in the world, among earnest, aspiring souls, to draw nearer the Fountain Source of truth and life, by establishing among themselves, unity of purpose and harmony of thought and feeling. To this end are held the Soul-communion and the Silent Unity meetings of which we have read. This class of people are organized under various names in different places, but the central idea among them all is to Think no III,�to look for, emphasize, and build up the good in each other, by thought, word and deed; recognizing that the outer being is created by the inner; that all potency is in thought; in fact that thoughts are things, and the only real things. That apart from expressions in word or action, through silent thought we have power to bless or injure, uplift or degrade our brother or sister. The acceptance of this truth is having a practical bearing upon the lives of thousands at the present time, and is working as a dissolving element to creeds and dogmas, sects and isms, and also as a unifying and focalizing power to all that is good and true in the hearts of the people. In refusing to think evil, and ever holding in view the God-thought and divine ideal, they believe they are brought nearer the source of creative good which heals,�restores to wholeness, body and mind. It seems to me there is a truth in this, worthy of our thoughtful acceptance. As a people we are blest above all others in the possession of many of those spiritual truths toward which they are progressing, and should we not strive earnestly to embody these in our characters, that we also may be drawn together in a closer communion, and have our souls refreshed from those crystal fountains that shall vitalize our beings with new and living thoughts? To this end let us be firm in our resolve to think no ill of each other. In every human heart there dwells a deathless being created in the image of the Divine;�a child of God,�a beautiful angel. Let us call it forth and recognize it: let us speak of it to each other and greet it in each other. Let us nourish it by our kindly thought, our sympathies and prayers, and in our efforts to minister to this life in those about us, perchance the angel within our own hearts will grow stronger. We all have one purpose, and one goal in view. We all must feel struggle of soul in casting off the old life for birth in the new. Let us be lights to each other through the darkened valley, that we may rejoice together on the mount of triumph. Let us cultivate that kindly affection and tenderness of feeling that shall make us as careful of another's reputation as we would wish them to be of our own, thus keep the golden rule ; and in that love which is the fulfilling of the law, so faithfully guard our hearts that we shall think no ill.
