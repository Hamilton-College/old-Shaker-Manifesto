ZION'S DEFENSE J. G. RUSSELL O Zion, Zion, is thy foundation sure? Art thou establish'd on the rock That ever will endure? The question now receives response Tho' foes with thee contend, There is an arm, all powerful arm, That will thy cause defend. Then why, O why, thus doubting stand, In-dwellers of thy courts ? Gird on the armor of the Lord, And in his strength go forth, And meet, with glittering sword in hand, The foes that 'gainst thee move, And in the name of Zion's God, Victorious thou shalt prove.
