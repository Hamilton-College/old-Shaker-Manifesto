Extract â€” lam pleased Avith the 'Shaker and Shakeress Monthly.' I think the ideas expressed are all of an elevating nature; even the appearance of the paper, pleases me, as it is the whitest of the Avhite, and the ink the blackest of the black, and nice size type to read readily. The piece of poetry entitled ' The Churches of our Land.' written by Cecelia Devyi, I think contains excellent sentiment. The piece of music 'Beautiful Shore,' I will get D. to play for me. I hope to visit the Society some time when the pleasant weather comes again. M. J. R. N.
