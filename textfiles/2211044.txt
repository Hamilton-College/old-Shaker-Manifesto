New England Magazine The October New England Magazineis specially attractive for the quantity and quality of its poetry. Everett S. Hubbard contributes a fine Columbus poem, 'The Three Ships,' which has the place of honor in the number. Charles Edwin Markham, the Californian poet, is represented by a poem in his best vein, 'A Harvest Song.' Madison Cawein, of Kentucky, is somewhat metaphysical in 'The Ordeal.' James B. Kenyon contributes a pretty fancy, 'The South Wind.' St. George Best is topical with 'MaTs.' Stuart Sterne, a New York poet, in 'Vespers' and 'Matins,' gives us true poetry and sentiment. All these poets are of the younger generation, and are scattered throughout the Union, so that it cannot be said that the New England is bound by local prejudices, or closes its columns to the younger singers. And poetry is undoubtedly still read, the croakers to the contrary notwithstanding.
