Books and Papers Phrenological Journal and Science of Health In the October number of that veteran among American magazines, the Phrenological Journal and Science of Health, an appreciative sketch of the late Cyrus W. Field is given, with an account of the laying of the first Atlantic telegraph line. The Editor gives another installment of the descriptive series relating to the World's Fair at Chicago. A Plea for Individuality is well stated by Gracia. A story from life is that entitled The Secret of Amy's Wedded Happiness. In Child Culture, an excellent paper on The Responsibility of Childhood, occupies several pages. 'I Couldn't Say No' comes from an English writer, and sets off a common domestic folly. Teasing Children hits the mark, too. A Strange Essay has its common parallel, as the reader will recognize. The Coming Food Exposition at New York City is illustrated, and a good variety of valuable suggestions appear in the Health Department. The Editor discusses certain current questionsthe strikes, for instanceand very appreciatively refers to the late poet Whittier and Mr. George W. Curtis. The Journal is published at $1.50 a year or 15 c. a number. The last three numbers of this year are offered free to new subcribers for 1892, or three numbers 'On Trial' for 25 c.

The series of reminiscent articles of 'My Father as I Recall Him,' by Mamie Dickens, the oldest and favorite daughter of Charles Dickens, will begin in the next issue of the Ladies Home Journal by an entertaining narration of Dickens' personal habits, and an inner glimpse of his home life. New England Magazine The October New England Magazineis specially attractive for the quantity and quality of its poetry. Everett S. Hubbard contributes a fine Columbus poem, 'The Three Ships,' which has the place of honor in the number. Charles Edwin Markham, the Californian poet, is represented by a poem in his best vein, 'A Harvest Song.' Madison Cawein, of Kentucky, is somewhat metaphysical in 'The Ordeal.' James B. Kenyon contributes a pretty fancy, 'The South Wind.' St. George Best is topical with 'MaTs.' Stuart Sterne, a New York poet, in 'Vespers' and 'Matins,' gives us true poetry and sentiment. All these poets are of the younger generation, and are scattered throughout the Union, so that it cannot be said that the New England is bound by local prejudices, or closes its columns to the younger singers. And poetry is undoubtedly still read, the croakers to the contrary notwithstanding.
