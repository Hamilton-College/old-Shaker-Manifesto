Give Him A Lift Give him a lift! do'nt kneel in prayer, Nor moralize with his despair; The man is down, and his great need Is ready help, not prayer nor creed. 'Tis time when the wounds are washed and healed, That the inward motives be revealed; But now, whate'er the spirit be, Mere words are but a mockery. One grain of aid just now is more To him than tomes of saintly lore : Pray, if you must, in your heart; But give him a lift, give him a start The world is full of good advice, Of prayer, and praise, and preaching nice ; But the generous souls who aid mankind Are scarce as gold, and hard to find. Give like a Christianâ€”speak in deeds ; A noble life's the best of creeds ; And he shall wear a royal crown Who gives them a lift when they are down!
