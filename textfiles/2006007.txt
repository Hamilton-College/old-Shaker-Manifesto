LITTLE KINDNESSES. L. B. Settles. I think if we examine our own hearts, we shall all feel ourselves to have been sadly neglected in this branch of the 'little things.' How often from want of thought and attention, do we see people, really kind people, fail to make others happy or comfortable. How often do we see, in families, those who would do anything to oblige each other if the matter were a great one, such a total neglect of the little kindnesses of life, that by degrees they become selfish, and are unable to perceive wherein they fail, or that anything else ought to be expected of them than what they perform. How often do we hear kindly-feeling, well-intentioned people regretting that they can do nothing, that they have nothing in their power,ï¿½while all the time, these little kindnesses are unnoticed and unperformed. Life affords but few opportunities of doing great services for others; but there is scarcely an hour of the day that does not afford an opportunity of performing some little, it may be unnoticed service. Careful and earnest attention to little things of this kind, is of great advantage to our own characters. We can seldom perform little kindnesses without little self-denials ; and the habit once formed of daily attending to others, and trying to please and serve them, is of inestimable use in repressing our natural selfishness. It is n command in Scripture, that everyone should 'please his neighbor for his good to edification ;' but it is a duty oftener neglected than trying to serve others. Amongst the many ways of doing this I mention kind consideration of the peculiarities of others. There are few families where there are not some members who require to be studied a little, and if the 'peculiar one' be the head of the house, or an aged member of it, this attention is generally paid. But how often do we feel it hard to be the one that must always give up ! How apt wre are to be provoked at the peculiarities of others, instead of endeavoring to forbear, and please them rather than ourselves ! There is much want of knowledge of each others characters to be met with in families, and from this sometimes, proceeds the careless indifference about pleasing them; the study of characters may be apt to lead us into critical and censorious thoughts and feelings ; but if we study others, that we may best know how to please them, and make them happy, it cannot be otherwise than a profitable study. Let us remember young friends the sacred duty of giving pleasure, by doing little kindnesses, that it may be practiced daily. And, if we could but feel what a sacred duty it is, surely we would wish and endeavor to make and find opportunities of practicing it! Is it not a sacred duty to make life as happy as we can to those, who are enduring the heat and burden of the day ? And is it not so still more to the aged, who perhaps have little to cheer them ? and who may have suffered and undergone much during the weary days of their pilgrimage. Let us seek out opportunities, let us slight nothing as too trivial or minute,* if it may give pleasure to others. Do not, because you can do so little for others, do nothing. Look around you, and see whether there be not some one whose burden you can lighten, whose little cares you may lessen, whose little wants you can gratify. All must be done cheerfully, as if it were a pleasure, not merely a duty ; and above all, we must never allow anyone to feel or see that we have made any sacrifice of our own will or wishes on this account.
