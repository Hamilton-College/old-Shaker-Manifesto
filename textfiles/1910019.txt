DEATH-PENALTY. No. 2. Fred'k. Gerhard. Now let us hear what a murderer said, at the last moment before his execution, about the death-penalty. A physician�consequently an educated man�had murdered, some time before, a girl whom he had pre~ iously seduced, and he was condemned to death in Cleveland. Standing under the gallows, he addressed those present, saying, among other things, the following: 'I will concede, gentlemen, that life is a precious gift, and that it must be protected; and that, if anybody murders, human nature's natural ininstinct demands his life. Consequently, if the people of Bedford had killed me at the time I committed the deed, I would have said it was not inhuman, and was done in passion; but if, after six months of deliberation and preparation, people demand my life, then they are murderers. 'What would be the most advantageous for you, gentlemen�to put this rope around my neck, or to send me to the penitentiary, to keep me there as many years as you may deem prrper; to dismiss me then as a penitent, so that I might use for the benefit of my fellow-men what little of talent and power the Creator has given me? 'Capital punishment is annihilating. One life is as good as another. I admit that; but what advantage will my death bring about? None. I do not even remember the moment when, in madness and drunkenness, I found a mark for the pistol. Still, such is law. This law, however, is made by man, and is not the law of God. 'I do not enter into the land of annihilation, but into the land of progress, and whilst I acknowledge the law of Ohio, I say that it is foolish and vain Or do you think that, because this rope puts an end to my life, crimes will be prevented? The same influences which surrounded me will cause the same effects in others, and no example can prevent this. I submit to the law of the land, and leave you. I hope that this execution will be an example for everybody, not in favor of capital punishment, but to demonstrate its folly, and that you may reflect on this.' The way in which this man has reasoned out his rejection of the rightfulness of the death-penalty well merits attention. It indicates the sole moral purpose of any punishment, namely, the reformation of him who has committed a crime. Or can it be doubted that even the worst criminal may arrive at intelligent remorse and honest re pentance? And when he thus repents, honestly and truly, is he not then a reformed man? And if such reformation is possible, have we then the right to deprive him, who has sinned, who has committed a crime, of life, and to cut him off from repentance and reformation? Ample experience in penitentiaries furnishes the proof that it is not necessary to destroy the criminal; that, on the contrary, he may, by judicious treatment, be reformed, be led to true repentance, and his guilt be thus properly expiated: God does not want the death of the sinner, but that he repent and reform. 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.'�St. Luke xv., 7. The intimidation theory, the idea of kill- ing the one in order to strengthen thereby the virtue of others, is an absurd perversion of all moral thought. Of all the means for exercising good moral influence on society, this one of shedding human blood, or of killing in any way a human being1, is probably the most mistaken, the most dreadful and revolting. The most efficient protection of life is its sacredness; and this sentiment is weakened by every execution. The great Roman philosopher, Cicero, expressed himself as follows on capital punishment: 'Far be the death-penalty from us, far its executors and implements; for every mention of it is painful to a free man.' And in the criminal work, 'The New Pittaval,' Vol. 27, we find the following passage : 'When the champions of capital-punishment enter the lists for it armed with one well known quotation from the Bible�'He who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall Ms blood be shed'�it is just as if something were decided as of right, on the strength of one passage in a code, though it were an insult to the sense of justice of a whole nation,' But if it should be thought necessary to secure, besides the only moral end of any punishment, some deterring effect in the case of those crimes called deserving of death, this will be reached in the surest way by prompt adjudication. Do not procrastinate proceedings for murder for months and years, but have punishment follow as speedily as possible. Yet do not condemn to death, but to imprisonment for twenty years, or for life. That will have a really deterring effect, and will bring to their senses people of violent nature predisposed to crime. But can confinement for life be justified even in the case of murder? The law allows for every misdeed or crime a time of limitation, after the expiration of which the culprit can no longer be held responsible. In almost all countries this limitation is fixed at twenty years for murder; and if a person who has committed murder cannot leg lly be punished after the lapse of twenty years, ought not, then, the maximum penalty fur murder to be twenty years? Had the culprit succeeded in escaping judicial prosecution for twenty years, he would then be entirely free, and could not be touched. Would it not be fair, then, when he has not evaded punishment, but has borne the penalty during twenty years, to restore his liberty to him just as much as if he had not been punished at all ? A further argument against the death-penalty is furnished by the many judicial murders, the many condemnations of innocent people, which criminal 'history reports. It is bad enough if innocent people are condemned to imprisonment, their innocence established only after the lapse of months or years, and are then restored to liberty. But how�and that, too, has occurred often,�if an innocent person is condemned to death, executed, and his innocence found out only afterward? Life on'je taken cannot be restored. Frederick the VHse says : 'Nothing is easier than to take human life.' But is it right? Can we restore it to him, should he be innocent; and would we not be criminals toward him in that case? And when experience teaches that in all countries sentences of civil and criminal courts are every day set aside, as unjust by higher courts, and when this is clear proof of the human weakness of judges, who, nevertheless, are undoubtedly honest as a rule�cultivated men, well-versed in law, who certainly have no intention of doing wrong�and when one sees how the decisions differ, dare one, under these circumstances, expose a human life, be it that of the vilest criminal even, to the vacillations of human opinion? But whoever does not believe that many really innocent people are executed, need only look into the transactions of the English Society for the abolition of capital punishment, by which it is demonstrated that in two hundred years, about two hundred innocent people have been butchered. And this by no means includes the many hundreds who�as previously shown�were hanged in England in former years for theft and other minor crimes. I myself am in possession of a list of more than sixty cases, where people were sentenced to several punishments, innocently, and this list I have collected in only a few years. Another argument against the deathpenalty is the repugnance of many jurors to giving a verdict of 'guilty' against a murderer, because they know that the sentence entailed thereby will be that of death, and their human feeling refuses to deliver a fellow-being up to death. Kather than do this, they give a verdict of 'not guilty,' and in this way, criminals deserving punishment often escape, to the great, injury of society. It was said before that in modern times all torturing of convicts has been abolished by law; but has this been done, so far as custom is concerned? How often has it occurred in places where decapitation is still effected by the axj, that the siroke missed, the instrument burying itself in the shoulder instead so that the unfortunate creature had to be executed under additional tortures! And how innumerable are the instances in the United States, where hanging is still practiced, in which, owing to the bungling of the hangman, the culprit had to go through the process of hanging iwo or three times before being allowed to give up his miserable life! In McKean Co., Pa., in 1879, a murderer had in this way to undergo the operation twice ; at Sioux Falls, Dakota, in 1882 another one three times, and a third one, a boy of eighteen years, in Georgia, in 1883, twice; and between the two operations an hour expired before he was dead. Are not such cases alone sufficient to give every person of feeling a perfect horror of capital punishment? But executions have still another dark side; it consists in the blasphemy of the priests. They represent to the condemned that they will enter now directly into heaven, and be received by Christ; there stands the culprit, instead of being deeply humiliated by the sense of his criminality, actually jubilant, and rejoicing that he will soon be with Christ, and that Christ will receive him with all glory ! Is not that rank blasphemy? The priests who seduce these miserable sinners to such fantastic visions, ought, instead, to exert all their influence to induce them to really repent of their bloody deeds. Such a conversion, at the moment of going to the gallows, is utterly worthless, and nothing but a self-deceit and a deception of others. True, serious, profound and saving repentance can be arrived at only gradually, and will never show itself in jubilant outpourings under the gallows. And to what scandalous, outrageous, immoral behavior on the part of the public does not a condemnation to death lead ! The condemned receives from all sides proofs of sympathy, women and girls present flowers and delicacies; and people importune those in charge to allow them to see the condemned or to exchange a few words with him. It is a glorification of crime. Many an honest, poor fellow, on the other hand, is allowed to die in his lonely chamber; for him no sympathy is felt, and nobody sends him dainties. However much it may be in accordance with the spirit of modern times not to bury the body of the culprit any longer, as formerly, in the spot receiving the offal of the shambles, but in the cemetery, where so many sinners are lying�even such as have not been condemned judiciously�it is, nevertheless, very unwise, on the other hand, to give executed criminals public and pompous interment and obsequies, as is often the case, particularly in the United States. This, too, is a glorification of crime and must make an impression on the lower classes�those from which criminals mostly come�not conducive of good morals. The fact that in 1878, the executioner of Berlin gave a grand dinner, accompanied by music on the day of the execution of Hoedel, who had fired on the Emperor; and the other fact, that twelve hundred�actually twelve hundred�people applied for the position of hangman of London, which had become vacant by the death of Marwood�these facts, I say, ought to fill our century with burning shame. When will the old barbarism, belonging to the dark past, be finally cleared away, and capital punishment be abolished everywhere? When will the Legislatures of all the states of the Union, and of all foreign countries at last consider it their sacred duty not to tolerate the death-penalty any longer? When will citizens, called for jury duty, refuse to serve in murder cases so long as the murderous law of capital punishment exists ? When will judges insist earnestly on the abrogation of the murderous law, which surely has often caused them bitter qualms of conscience? When, finally, will rulers recoil with horror from lending their assistance to an execution, refuse to commit themselves, and aid directly in premeditated murder? Or is an execution, perchance, not a real, premeditated murder, murder in the first degree? According to the laws of all civil ized countries, every premeditated and intentional killing of a human being is murder in the first degree. Well, then, are not premeditation and intention to the greatest possible extent the preliminaries of every execution? Even in those times when capital punishment was still considered as something indispensable, the executioner, the hangman, was considered dishonorable, and no decent, reputable man would shake hands with him, or would drink with him, or enter into any connection with him. And this shrinking from him sprang from the truly human feeling of horror at a man who could be bought with money to slay his fellow-men. And should we, perhaps, try to palliate executions by saying that the law of the state exacts them? There is a higher law than all Statelaws, and that is the law of common human morality, which we find laid down in the precepts of the most diverging confessions. Already ihe old Mosaic law, known as the Decalogue contains the commandment: 'Thou shalt not kill:' and the same injunction we find in the Koran, as well as in the law-books of the Hindoos and of other creeds. Bad State-Laws must be annulled.� Civilization has put an end to former still more horrible modes of capital punishment, such as breaking on the wheel, impalement, quartering, burning at the stake, &amp;c, and has simplified executions ; but the nineteentli century, which has already given birth to so much progress, ought not to come to an end without having abolished also this last horrible remnant of capital punishment, and without having expunged it from the law-books of the civilized world. Away, then, with this relic of a long-passed dark age. this mockery of the civilization of our century, this blot on our generation! Every one who has human feelings in his breast, every one who still recognizes even in the criminal the human being, the unfortunate, erring fellowbrother, ought to lift up his voice, to assist in attaining this noble, this truly human end. I repeat, the foremost and only moral end of any punishment is the reformation of the criminal; and for this high purpose capital punishment does not only not answer, but has even the diametrically opposite effect; for the so-called conversions which the priest forces upon the condemned in the last hours or moments, in plain view of the gallows and in the face of death, are no real reformations, but mere outward forms, by whic h the priest thinks to fulfill his duty. Reformation requires time and calm reflection uninterrupted by external influences. He who is once slain can neither reflect nor reform any more. It cannot be predicted or asserted of any criminal, not even of the worst, that he is incapable of reformation. Even the worst criminal may repent�repent profoundly; and he will and must repent, if he be only given time for mature reflection, and subjected to impressions, whose influence is in that direction. Repentance brings forth reformation, and to make the latter possible, the criminal's life lias to be preserved Confine him for many yea's ; but do not take his life, do not cut him off from the possibility i f repentance and reformation, from the recovery of his better self. We have no right to do that! I have above referred to the fact, that the opponents as well as the advocates of capital punishment can base their arguments on the Bible; and further I have referred to two texts, which have also reference to the deathptenalty, and declare against it. But I must repeatedly call the attention of those, who l�ok to the Bible as the only fundamental law for all actions of man, to the beautiful teaching, which we find in Ezekiel xxxiii., 11: 'I have no pleasure in the death of the �&gt;icked, but that the wicked turn from bis way and live.'' I have no doubt, that even those, who until now have been advocates of the deathpenalty, if they consider well all the arguments fur its abolition, laid down in these lines, cannot but become opponents to it. I repeat, our nineteenth century, which has put an end to the inhumanity and brutality of slavery, should not go to rest without also abolishing the inhumanity and useless barbarism of the death-penalty. Let us work for this noble end !
