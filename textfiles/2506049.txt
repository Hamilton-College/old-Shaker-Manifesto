Atheism and Arithmetic Atheism and Arithmetic. This is a singular combination and we well might ask, Whs't has Atheism or Christianity to do with Arithmetic? The author H. L. Hastings, however, is quite at home in the illustration of his subject and has called our attention to the 'Arithmetic in Plants and Planets.' 'Mathematics in musical Science.' 'Number in Vital Action.' He has even illustrated the wonderful work of God by noticing the 'Arithmetic in a Corn Field.' Books like this of such careful, useful and correct representation are valuable in any home, and could be read with profit by either young or old.
