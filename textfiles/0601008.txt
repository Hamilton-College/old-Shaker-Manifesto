REWARD OF LIFE ELIZABETH H. WEBSTER ' Blessed are they that do His commandments that they may have the right to the tree of life.' John while 'in the spirit' on Patmos. ' Blessed, or happy and spiritually pros- pered, are those who keep the commandments of Jesus,' not merely the code of laws, given to the early Law-giver, but the ' new commandment,' which surpasses them all in that it comprehends the whole, with greater reaches of love, unity and unselfishness. ' The law was a school-master to bring them to Christ;' and by obeying the former they gained the power to fulfill the still higher requirements of the latter. By 'denying self,' they learn to love the neighbor so well that they can ' sing joyfully the song of Moses,' ' with the Spirit and the understanding,' and the still sweeter song of the Lamb, or the Christ-spirit. They are to ' have right to the tree of life,' because ' they are worthy,' as the Revelator says of those ' who enter into the Holy City through the gates' of confession, justice, con- secration and purity. But what is this tree of life, to which they have right, which ' bears twelve kinds of fruit ?' Is it not something of which they may partake continually, as there is a constant succession of fruits, which will afford them cheer, strength, all needful sustentation, and keep them in life and vigor 1 It is a tree of life, not of death. So much so, that those who have not, by obedience to these physical and spiritual laws, gained a right to the fruit, may still find benefit and healing, even from its ' leaves,' or the less concentrated nutriSHAKEE. 4: THE SHAKER. ment of the fruit. If they cannot, by obedience to the whole law, become ' every whit whole,' body and spirit, they may find a healing principle, even in the leaves, or scattering truths, eliminated by the growth of these germ principles.
