Cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter... '' Cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside may be clean al- so. ' The words we speak, and the acts we perform are as the contents of the cup and platter, if they are free from selfishness and all that pertains to the world, that world to which Christ referred when he said, 'I am not of this world, ' our characters which may be likened to the outside of the platter will inevitably be without reproach. â€” E. A. S.
