SIGNAL LIGHT Ts my bark launch'd on an unknown sea Dividing time from eternity? Without chart, or compass, by which to steer, Must I toss on these waves of hope and fear? In vain I look ahead for a light; The foam crested billows alone meet my sight! O 1 where shall I turn for a skillful hand, To pilot me safe to the better land? 0 that a dove from some isle of the sea — Would bring as to Noah — a message to me ! But no dove appears —no mast can I spy — To awaken the hope, that a haven is nigh. And, while I am looking in vain for a sail— 1 tremble with fear, my bark is so frail; So I lift up my voice, and supplicate aid From that Power, whose mandate the sea hath obeyed. Thou Almighty Power, thy help I implore ! Guide safely my bark 'till my voyage is o'er! And whatever course thy hand shall direct, I'll trustingly steer, if thou wilt protect. But what is that glory which bursts on my sight? Though far in the distance, 'tis heaven's pure light; A signal on high is hung out for me, It is the bright beacon of purity. Can that be a mirage, I see through the haze. The beautiful landscape that now meets my gaze. With soft-tinted flowers, and fruit-laden trees, And groves with green foliage sway'd by the breeze? Ah, soon shall my soul its reality test! Devotion secures me the haven of rest; That soul-cheering thought has inspir'd my mind To buffet these billows, that haven to find. A. E.
