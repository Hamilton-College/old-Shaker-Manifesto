Dear children, you cannot look after your... Enfield, Conn., 1883. Dear Children ;â€”You cannot look after your habits too carefully. You desire to be happy ; with bad habits you cannot enjoy real happiness. Every wrong habit is injurious, and produces evil results. Bad habits are strong, and continually lure their victims to pleasures, which satisfy not. 'The way of the transgressor is hard,' as well as foolish, while ^'Wisdom's ways are pleasant' and peaceful. Every act contributes its iota toward forming your characters, moulding the individual beings which you become. Day by day, you are sowing seed, from which must come the fruit of your after lives. Consequences are inevitable. W/iat you sow, you will reap. Sow only good seed. Destroy the weeds. 'Sow an act, and reap a habit; sow a habit, and reap a character; sow a character, and reap a destiny.' Conquer sinful habits, or they will conquer you. 'Array a bad habit in costly attire, it is a bad habit still.' Bad habits, in their beginnings, may soon be overcome ; but when grown into your very lives, they are difficult to subdue. Shun the beginning of evil, is golden advice to follow. You may form habits of kindness, or unkindness, honesty, or dishonesty, vice or virtue. Virtue's path is safe. Walk therein. Watch for the sinful habits, and uproot them before they get a firm hold. I want to say to every one that I find indulging in wrong habits, Beware ! You are sowing seed for a harvest of woe !
