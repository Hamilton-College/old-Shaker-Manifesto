Eldress Naomi Ligier Union Village, 0., Dec. 19, 1887. , our well beloved and highly esteemed Sister, left the shores of time on the 15th. of last Dec. (see page 48) During eighty years she spent a life of virtue and immaculate purity among Believers. For forty years she stood with Eldress Sally Sharp, as second in the Ministry of Union Village, which had general charge of the Western Societies during that period. Obedience in the most minute particulars to those who stood before her in care and burden, was ever her watchword, from which in practice, she never swerved in a single instance. She was beautiful in person, lovely in character, and possessed of every accomplishment calculated to have given her any amount of prestige and success in the pursuit of worldly pleasures. But she rejected all such transitory pleasures, and spent the whole of her life in personal purity and practical righteousue.-s. Her tenderness and sympathy for those in distress were unbounded and her charity to all, both aged and young, was proverbial. The Society where she u as originally gathered were obliged to break up twice, owing to persecution and sickness ; and in finding homes at Union Village and other Societies, at a time when traveling was very laborious and exposing; they passed through many trying and even heart-rending scenes, by sickness and exposure, loss of property, and severings of dear associations. Yet through all, our dear Sister chose to 'suffer afflictions with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.' Heb. xi., 25. 'ï¿½And I heard a voice from Heaven saying, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth : Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors ; and their works do follow them.' Rev. xiv., 13. Rest is not inertia, when spiritually defined, but change and variety of occupation ; and doubtless our dear Mother in Israel has entered upon the seraphic employments of the angelic spheres and into everlasting blessedness.
