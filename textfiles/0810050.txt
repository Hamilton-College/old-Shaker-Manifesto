Our Public Roads â€”Keep the roadsides clear of noxious weeds that would otherwise scatter their seeds in pastures and cornfields. Mow the grass twice in the season for hay, if it cannot be done oftener. Plant trees along the boundaries, or so far within them as to give space for a side-walk. The trees should be mostly two or three rods apart, in order that their forms may become fully rounded and developed as they grow old. In bleak and windy places, plant Norway spruce and other evergreens nearer together, or ten or twelve feet apart, on the windward side, for purposes of shelter and to prevent snow drifts.
