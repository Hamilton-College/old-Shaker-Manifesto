Thoughts for today Eyes to see God Augustine mentions a heathen once saying to him, as he pointed to the sun, to his idol gods, and various objects about him, ' Here are my gods, where is thine ? ' Augustine answered, ' I show you not my God, not because I have not one to show, but because you have not eyes with which to see Him.' Christ is Coming Frances E. Willard exclaims : ' Truly, Christ is coming, coming all the time, like sunrise from the east, or summer from the south, or heaven to hearts that love and look for His appearing.
