BRIGHT DAY. ' Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath .shined' Psa. 1, 2. Canterbury, N. H. 1891. There has come unto thee, O thou Zion of God, A day of thanksgiving and prayer; With thy sons free and strong let thy daughters rejoice, And blessed be the heart that is pure. The heart that is pure and the hand that is true, The feet swift to carry glad news I will gird with my strength and clothe with my love, And my pow'r in their spirits renew.
