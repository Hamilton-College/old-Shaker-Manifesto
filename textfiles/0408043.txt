The Best Pathfinders Do my young Americans know who are the best pathfinders on the American continent, the great original pathfinders of the West ? I'll tell you. They are the buffaloes. Yes, sir, it's true. Hear what a correspondent of St. Nicholas writes with the quill of a dear graygoose friend of mine: As the frosts of winter destroy their pastures in the north, so the heats of summer parch those in the south, and the buffaloes must, each spring and autumn, take long journeys in search of fresh feeding grounds. The large size and weight of these somewhat clumsy explorers make it rather difficult for them to cross the mountains, so they seek out for themselves the most practicable routes; and hunters and emigrants have found that a ' buffalo-track ' offers the surest and safest path for men and horses. The best passes in the Cumberland and Rocky mountains, and the regions of the Yellowstone, and the Colorado, have oeen discovered by following the trail of these sagacious animals. I know this is so, for the great traveler, Humboldt, once wrote : ' In this way the humble buffalo has filled a most important part in facilitating geographical discovery in mountainous regions, otherwise as trackless as the Arctic wastes, as the sands of Sahara.'
