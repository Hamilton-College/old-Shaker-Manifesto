BREAD VS. WHISKEY Away back in my teens, near sixty years ago, I went to Quaker meeting — an evening meeting — at the house of Benedict Robinson, in the now town of Milo, in our county of Yates, State of New York, a land then flowing with bread and whiskey. Whiskey was as much one of the family necessaries as bread. The corn and the rye had, from the beginning, been regarded as whiskey. Nothing more, nothing less. The whiskey mills had begun on the wheat with no sparing hand. The Spirit moved Caleb Macumber, of Farmington, Ontario county, a man of giant frame, giant voice, giant every thing, and he arose with one hand in coat pocket, the other behind his back ; he began to speak — 'It — is — our — duty — to — be — thankful — for — blessin's — as — well temporal — as spiritual. I — shall — take — for — the — subject — of — my — discourse — vegetables — especially — that vegetable — of — which — we make — Bread — wheat.' His words fell like sledge hammers upon our ears. Not upon our ears only, but upon our very souls. In breathless silence we followed the preacher. He told us that ' in the staff of life that land had been blessed above all lands ; that we had turned that blessing into a curse ; that the day was not far distant when there would be a scarcity in the land,' ' and children will cry for bread.' We didn't see it then. In less than two years we saw the word of the Lord by the mouth of the prophet fulfilled to the letter. There was not bread to be bought, and no money to buy it. Many families were breadless for weeks, and children did cry for bread. O. P.
