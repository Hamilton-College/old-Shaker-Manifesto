LANGUAGE. Sarah J. Burger. It was said by one of old, 'Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.' We realize this truth, and also, that for the refining of the spirit, true Christian culture is requisite. With this the language will always correspond, as it is an index pointing to the interior life. A physiognomist can discern the condition of the mind by the expression of the face; so can the degree of spiritual attainment be recognized by the conversation. If low and coarse it will be expressive of grossness and impurity; if sad and regretful, of disappointment and depression of spirit, but if bright and cheerful, kind and forbearing, chaste and gentle, then it will bespeak the hopefulness, generosity and purity of the heart. It is said that 'death and life are in the power of the tongue.' We can never recall the spoken word, nor estimate how far its influence may extend for good or ill, therefore we can not too closely guard the motives and impulses of the heart. Impure thoughts, envy, jealousy or any of those ignoble sentiments springing from the lower selfhood should be banished at first approach, for if fostered, how soon the finer feelings will be set aside while the soul unconsciously gathers to itself the elements that nourish this lower life, and the conversation will necessarily correspond. But if we ever hold in our minds, ideals of pure and beautiful characters, if we think kindly, sweetly and lovingly one of another, opening our hearts to the THE MANIFESTO. 1.) i sunshine of other lives, then our thought atmosphere will be genial and wholesome, and whether uttered or sent forth on silent wing, the messages from our souls will bear naught but glad tidings of peace and good will.
