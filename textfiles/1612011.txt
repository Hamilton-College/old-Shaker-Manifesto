I'M GLAD. MARGARETTE DAVIS. I'm glad I was not reared a child Who in no God believed ; I'm glad no idol from my lips, Hath worship e'er received. I'm glad I early learned to pray To Father, Mother,�God ; And felt that love reforming me Which triumphed o'er the rod. I'm glad that heaven is not to me, A place beyond the skies; My Savior taught that in my heart, This kingdom truly lies. I'm glad as I go forth each day To battle with sin's power, That I believe kind Angel friends Surround me every hour. And that they know when oft I fail, In purpose I'm as true As when in vict'ry I prevail, And brave the conflict through. I'm glad, with heart of earthly mold, I've learned the lesson sweet� No evil to retaliate, But kind forgiveness mete. And thus I walk life's zigzag course With calm and happy heart, Assured that I have chosen out From it, ' the better part. ' To Christian home and friends and care I owe this peace of mind; And every child that comes to us The same rich gift may find. Canterbury, N. H.
