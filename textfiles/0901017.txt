THE PROPHETIC CONVENTION We promised a notice of our observations at the great gathering in New York on October 30, 31 and November 1. We had really hoped, until the last possible moment, to have met with several representatives of our Societies thereat; but we were reasonably mistaken, for every thing there having been pre-arranged, and the line of thought marked out for both speakers and hearers, there was no possible chance for any utterance differing from the demarcation, and therefore no necessity of sending representatives. The gathering was a notable one— several hundreds of ministers, repre- senting many denominations, being there and in sympathy—but as notable also by the absence of so many more prominent clergymen, and particularly those of New York city, who have no sympathy with premillennialism, being as we gladly and yet with astonishment learned, postmillennial in belief. The theories and dogmas which alone were permitted to be discussed at the Conference were the affirmative of 1. The personal coming of Jesus, again in the flesh ; 2. The resurrection of the physical body; 3. The final exaltation of believers, and condemnation of unbelievers. All of which, to those of us who believe that Christ has appeared again spiritually through others, is simply foolishness.
