It is a false idea to think of meriting heaven... It is a false idea to think of meriting heaven by a total abdication of the enjoyment of life, of power, and of wealth, and thereby sinking into wretchedness ; for the renunciation of enjoyments, of power, and of wealth, intended and signified in the Word, is to esteem them as nothing in respect to the Lord, and the life of the world as nothing in respect to a heavenly life. Swedenborg.
