THE WASP AND THE BEE A wasp met a bee that was just buzzing by, And he said, 'Little cousin, can you tell me why You are loved so much better by people than I? My back shines as bright and as yellow as gold, And my shape is most elegant too, to behold : Yet nobody likes me for that, I am told.' 'Ah cousin' the bee said ''tis all very true; But if I had half so much mischief to do, Indeed, they would love me no better than you. Ycu have a fine shape and a delicate wing, They own you are handsome; but there is one thing, They cannot put up with, and that is your sting. My coat is quite homely and plain, as you see, Yet nobody ever is angry with me, Because I'm a humble and innocent bee.' From this little story let people beware, Because, like the wasp, if ill natured they are They will never be loved, if they're ever so fair. Jane Taylor
