REVERIE. ROSETTA CUMINGS. However varying the scenes of time, Which mark the busy moments as they pass; Sometimes disclosing joys unsought, unseen, And yet again with chilling, icy grasp- - Destroying bliss which in prospectus beams, Fond hopes of pleasure which the future holds. All beautiful and bright the vision seems, Thefutuie moments valued are as gold. Vet when the present brings within our reach Those joys which in the distance seemed so fair, The blessing vanishes; we sets it not, The promised bliss is gone we know not where. And yet the Father merciful and kind, Unable as we are to scan his way, Provides with ever bountiful design, Blessings unnumbered for us every day. O! that we learn to prize his goodness more, And view in every gift his love divine, fpower The same strong arm which holds the tempest's Scatters the dew and bids the sun to shine. And though his smiling face be veiled today, 'Tis all the same his goodness and his care Are just as real, as when with milder grace, He answers to our fondest wish and prayer. And Heaven's best gifts to us are often sent Disguised in sorrows which we welcome not. We take them, but how little realize If rightly borne, what good in us is wrought. We sigh and murmur when our Father's hand Is working for our best eternal good; Accept we must, the good we do not find, Did we but prize these trials as we should. For though in stormy paths our feet must walk, Pierced with the thorns of worldliness and pride, We have no reason to complain or doubt If in a Father's care our souls confide. And wheresoe'er our lot in life is cast, Whate'er the trials which to us may come, Help us repeat with confidence and trust Thy righteous will O Lord, not mine be done. Enfield, N. H.
