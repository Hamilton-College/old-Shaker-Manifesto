Authur W. Dowe, Dear Brother in the Gospel... San Diego, Cal. Feb. 1894. AUTHUR W. DOWE, Dear Brother in the Gospel ;ï¿½Your very welcome letter received. I am more thankful than I can express that after many long years of waiting I have found an honest co-worker on this Coast. As regards locality, I think your suggestion of forming a society in the center of the state is good and that it would be more successful in many ways. The people here seem to run in cliques, while all that I have talked with seem very friendly. I have had several tell me that they would like to join a society and would put in what they had ; but as we did not have a society here at that time they have gone over to the Theosophists. I think as you do about having a home to offer people. It will require all the strength, both physical and mental that we can get together, to be successful in this work, and I do not want the word failure in it, I shall write, this evening, to my people at Watervliet, N. Y., and also send your letter as you have expressed your views of the work better than I can, and ask them to show it to the Ministry and see what they think of it. There is a great amount of fruit raised near here and a canning factory would probably be successful. I lived in Oakland for twenty years so am familiar with that portion of the state. I feel that we can not make any definite plans until we hear from the Ministry and as soon as I receive an answer will let you know. Did you join the Society while at Canterbury? Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain, Your Sister in the Gospel, Cornelia R. Powers.
