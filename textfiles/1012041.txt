North American review The North American Review.â€” D. Ap pleton &amp; Co., New York, contains in its last number, Dec, a valuable article by an old friend, Ex-Secretary of the IT. S. Treasury, Boutwell, upon ' The Future of the Republican Parti/.' We would call attention to the value of the publication itself, which invariably contains deep digests of prevailing thoughts of the day.
