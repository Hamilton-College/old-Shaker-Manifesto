The main purpose of keeping cows is to procure their milk... The main purpose of keeping cows is to procure their milk. Everything we do for them should point to this purpose, and we should fail to do nothing for their comfort and flow of milk, unless more expensive than the milk is profitable or convenient. Slop them well, keep them warm day and night; too often that which we give them to produce milk is consumed to keep them from freezing. A little care and labor can be turned into a great quantity of milk. G. A. L.
