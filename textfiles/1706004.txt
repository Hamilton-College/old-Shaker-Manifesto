Addressed to my young friends... OLIVE F. CHANDLER. Addressed to my Young Friends, soliciting more earnest effort io deep thought and self-knowledge. 0 walk upright, make straight thy paths, Know, angel light does scan each thought; And cherish not the slightest hate, Let each desire to truth be brought. O garner Love, one thread each day, Make warp and woof of finest peace ; Let every thread be straight and smooth, That bitterness and strife shall cease. Thus early learn your thoughts to train, This is a science grand and vast; And let not error's veil deceive Nor ignorance's pall thy mind o'ercast. Search deep within thyself to scan And analyze the powers within ; Each motive view with critic's eye, Have not a touch or stain of sin. .Harvard, Mass. T
