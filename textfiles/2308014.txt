It is customary in some Oriental cities for the night-watchmen to hourly announce the time, adding 'All is well,' when it is so, for the comfort of the inhabitants who are trusting their safety to these vigilant guards. This is very much like our little Home Note corner, where we can pass the word of hope and cheer from one Society to another, though not hourly. It is pleasant to hear of homes being renewed, brightened up and put in order. It shows that there is life within, as much as the quick healing of a wound, speaks well for the healthy vitalizing fluid, which courses through the veins. We regret to learn of drought and frosts as so troubling our Western Societies. Columbia County, N. Y. is one of the best places to live in after all. The weather is always doing better for us than we expect. We can stand a drought without much injury (only to strawberries,) and although we had quite a severe freeze the last week in April, we had no frosts afterward of any amount, although we expected them for 'Hicks said so.' Under these conditions we have and shall be blest with all kinds of fruit, which has been provided with a tree, bush or vine to grow on. The second Sabbath in June witnessed for us an unusual gathering to our morning service. The worthy Ministry from Maine being on a flying visit to Lebanon, we being unwilling to share such privileges ï¿½ North Family. The heavens are full of promise of the brighter day. We have had quite recently several very interesting callers. They came to us seeking information and to make the acquaintance of our people. We are pleased and encouraged to meet so many thoughtful and intelligent inquirers who are giving their earnest efforts to the solution of the dark problems of human life. We are thankful that Zion is yet able to minister strength and encouragement to such souls, and that the hallowed influence in and about our consecrated homes is felt and the source of it acknowledged and revered. Much has been gained and come to us through the labors of those who have alone, invited the Society at Hancock to meet with us, and it was a season of mutual strength and encouragement. Small families, (where the premises are in accordance) and large meetings is the ideal Community. For the information of all who have so long known our dear Eldress Ann, we would say that she is still the same loving mother as when she stood at the head of Community. Age drafts upon her bodily strength, but she is bright and active, lending her aid in the little home duties as far as her strength will permit, and more than we feel that she ought. She lives to show us the beauty of that character which has made a life work of crucifying self and living to make others happy. Amelia J. Calver. Center Family. July, 1893. We have begun haying. I have been out picking cherries, most of the time for a fortnight past. But I must close this to get off this morning. Inclosed find copy second and completed edition of Synoptic View. Hope you will be pleased with it. I do not yet despair of seeing E. M'Nemar's sermon in Manifesto. Alonzo Hollister. THE MANIFESTO. 191 passed on. We have been blessed beyond hope or thought. We desire an increase for ourselves, for our day and time. We are straightening the wall of our large stone silo on two sides. The unevenness caused considerable loss, and we think with straight walls there will be no necessity for weighting the ensilage when the silo is filled. We have under way considerable improvement in our barnyards with the object of having them in as dry and tidy a condition as possible. Our gardeners have noticed there are fewer insect pests in the gardens and orchards this year than for many previous years. We hope this is general and presages a time of relief from these plagues. A company of our Sisters have been on a visit to our good friends at Watervliet and have just returned with increased strength and a renewal of the spirit that quickens and makes alive. Walter S. Shepherd.
