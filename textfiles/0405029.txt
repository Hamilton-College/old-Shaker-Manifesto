HAPPINESS The conscious pursuit of happiness is found to be one of the most degrading motives in the world. The objects are so various ; the points to be considered so numerous ; the difficulties so unexpected ; the most worldly man is still so mysterious to himself; that what we call happiness is to a very large degree provided for us or denied to us, as air, sunshine, and water are, which may be said to be universally supplied, though there are instances when each of these may fail us. The idea of what happiness consists in varies from the briefest physical indulgence to the faith and patience and fortitude of the saint. The extremes of the idea are as far apart as the clod of earth is from the star in the heavens. A man might as well think of providing for the digestion of his food, or the circulation of his blood, as of successfully keeping in view as a motive of life that infinitely various condition of existence which happiness is found to be. The Epicurean descends to become the epicure. The most determined and narrow-minded willfulness, the coarseness of sensuality, the violence of the brutal, the heartlessness of the idle and frivolous, all come within the limits of happiness, as one or another would define it. When our Master declared for self-denial, both by precept and example, he showed that it is in lives of usefulness, deeds of charity, labors of philanthropy, sentiments of affection, that the true good is to be found. Not by seeking happiness, but by true work in the world, is human destiny best wrought out.â€” Christian Register.
