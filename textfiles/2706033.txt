Figs or Pigs? Figs or Pigs? This is a pamphlet on Vegetarian Philosophy, by James M. Allen. The Author in his preface says,ï¿½'The food of human beings, except infants, should be derived directly and wholly from the Plant Kingdom. No food should be used which necessitates slaughter.' He then proceeds to tell the reason why and the why must be ascertained by reading his book which is very interesting as it includes testimonies from many deep thinking minds. The tenacity of habit, rather than careful reason, holds many to the system of eating slaughtered animals. It becomes a matter of education from early childhood and is not easily laid aside.
