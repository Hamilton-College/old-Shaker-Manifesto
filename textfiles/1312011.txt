SELF CONQUEST. MATILDA J. TATTERTON. A triumph in the Christian's battle field, is a theme for a grand poem, a beautiful painting, or for one of the most solid facts in the history of the world ; for there are victories won by men and women over themselves, with which the honors achieved in war, are not to be compared. Of these silent successes we seldom hear, but if written they would make a literature which would inspire its readers to greater conquests than the heroism of a Napoleon or the capture of a. Richmond ! . The conflict is often waged in the midst of friendships and pleasurable surroundings, when the exterior bears no evidence of the fearful struggle ; again it is enacted in the calm hours of meditation, when some subtle foe suddenly appears, and challenges the fullest test of our strength. No witness is there save the unseen, who, when the tempter finds us fortified by purpose and principle, are able to 'bear us up, lest at any time we dash our foot against a stone.' All honor to the man or woman who fights hatred, revenge, envy, selfishness, or whatever form the demon may assume, back to its last covert in the heart, and thence expels it forever ! Although no outward show of honor is given the victors in this good cause, they have their reward, one greater than Fame can bestow. They come out from the combat self-ennobled, though humbled before Him unto whom should be given all honor and glory, as being the Source from whence they derive all their strength. Canterbury,N. H.
