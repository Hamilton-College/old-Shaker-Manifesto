THE STARS. Annie R. Stephens. WRITTEN FOR THE CHILDREN. Amelia:� I was gazing out of the window On the twilight evening sky, And one by one in the stellar dome Gleamed the starry-gems on high. There was the sun fast sinking In his bed of living name; And just above the sunset One star of glory came. And then, near the darkened zenith; A brighter one appears; Lo! all the star-lamps lighted, Hung out like chandeliers. And I've gazed in the morning twilight, When the moon was sailing by, Eight near fair Lunar's crescent, Two diamonds gem the sky. So near that they flashed their beamings Right in her mellow ray, I wondered, (if by telephone) They talked on their circling way. Oh, with what thrilling ecstacy I've gazed on the star-lit dome, Till each radiant, silvery twinkler, Seemed a beautiful angel's home; And I've thought of the little children, And the funny things they've said;� That the angels lighted the star-lamps While they were going to bed. One thought that they were gimlet holes That the glory we might see; If heaven's wrong side so bright appeared What must the right side be. Maud:� Why Amelia! you must be a poet. But I'm a star-gazer too; I love to watch the night-gems That sprinkle the vaulted blue, Your beautiful words of poetry Fall on my listening ears THE MANIFESTO. 188 Like harmonies of angels, Or music from the spheres. I have a little knowledge Of those starry worlds afar, For have seen one follow the sunset, It is Venus, the evening star. The brightest one is Jupiter, Four million miles from here; Four moons attend through all his course That monarch of the spheres. And those at present near the moon, Are, Saturn with golden rings, And Mars who was called the God of war In the time of the ancient kings. The shepherds on the Chaldean plains The same bright planets viewed; Down through ages men have watched The starry multitude. To constellations they gave names, Like the Big and Little Bear; Draco, Pegasus, Auriga, And Cassiopeia's chair. Perseus, Virgo, Hercules, The beautiful Northern Crown; Just now above the eastern hills, Sweet Pleiades shines down. Serene:� Now I've listened with anxious ears, To know beginning from end; And the more I open my eyes The less I can comprehend. I know my grammar and history And I can cipher, too, This wonderful science Astronomy, Is even too much for you. Now you star-gazing poets, I can not understand, How you can fill your noddles, With every thing so grand. Tillie:� I've had a bright idea That struck me in the head, They like such fairy visions, We, practical things, instead. Away back in the distance, I can not tell you when. Some wise men followed a wondrous star Serene:� 'Twas the Star of Bethlehem. Tillie:� I can not think just now Serene 'Twas something about night; [flocks When shepherds watched their chosen They saw a wondrous light. Serene:� Full eighteen hundred years ago Was born in Bethlehem, The promised child who grew to teach God's law to suffering men. Yet while he in a manger lay Wise men came fr;/m afar, Directed by the glowing light Of the bright and guiding star. They thought he was their future king, As prophets had foretold; They laid rich presents at his feet Of frankincense and gold. When he grew up to be a man His mission he received, He spread abroad the heavenly light, And many souls believed He healed the sick, the blind and lame, And blest the children dear, And comforted all lonely hearts With blessed words of cheer. And thus they loved and reverenced him, But some his power denied; The wicked Jews detested him, His body crucified. And down the years men worshiped him This good and Christ-like man; But loving self, they've quite forgot His beautiful Christian plan. Tillie:� Why don't men worship present good, Instead of the good afar? I'm sure I could follow a starry ray, And find where bright treasures are. Maud:� My dear little girl, I think we've found The beautiful Morning Star; For in our home doth love abound, With naught our peace to mar. Tillie:� Why surely so! I never thought; For through the winter's cold, I am protected from the storm Like a lamb within the fold. And when the blossoms deck the trees, And the birds are full of cheer, And the fruit hangs ripening in the sun, Why! it must be heaven here. 184 THE MANIFESTO. Amelia:� Our heaven is fonned by doing good, By being pure and true; To do to others as you wish That they should do to you. All:� Then we will form this heaven below, While grateful praise ascends, For daily blessings that we share, For home, and dear kind friends. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
