LIGHT. WILLIAM LEONARD. Ix the primitive Church their attempt at a united earth order was good, as far as it was carried, but its foundation was not solid. It was a male attempt, altogether, and if woman was not admitted to counsel and help hold it up, then it must come down. Our order of the heavens is for men and women. They regulate and rule the earth order which is likewise for man and woman, and for the lords of creation to be compelled to give woman her right and let her take her birthright in the heavenly order and in the earth order,is something new under the sun. In the former periods there existed a very small degree of heaven and a great deal ot earth, in the same people. We certainly have the foundation principles of a new Heavenly Order and a new Earthly Order, but in both we need to step forward. Jesus declared, till heaven and earth pass, these simple requirements pertaining to diet, as written in the Law, and all the rules of physiological life would stand as God's laws to Christians. Many are beginning to feel that the outpouring of the spirit will be in Zion's laws to govern the appetite ; rule the bodies more consistently and set apart the very food and show the way to prepare it to produce health. We need new rules to regulate our outer life that we may be raised into a glorious, physical resurrection. This would sweep away a host of diseases, unnecessary labors, needless expense and intemperance. It would relieve many sufferers, bring us into closer connection with the heavens and let in a flood of light and power for the prosperity of the Church. As a people we should be preparing ourselves by conscientiously living up to our present light. Our physical condition as a people demands it. As the Lord liveth and as the gospel will increase, new rays of light, or physical life will break in upon us, inspire our spirits, revive our health, so that the Christian man and woman will not say, ' / am sick.
