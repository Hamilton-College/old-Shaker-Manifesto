RESURRECTION MARTHA J. ANDERSON North Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Dying daily 'tis the conscious Evolution of the soul. In a life of endless progress, As the ages onward roll. 2. Dying to the loves of nature, Self and selfishness they hold, In a sphere too cramped and narrow, For the being to unfold. Dying, just as seasons changing, Leave the forms that pass away, Higher life, new growth unfolding, Smites the old with sure decay. 2. Dying, unto worldly honor, Glory's vainly boasted name, Laurel wreath of truth immortal, Never crowned the sons of fame. Dying unto bitter envy. Jealousy and vain deceit, Demon spoilers, of the blessing. Shared where peace and union meet. Dying to life's sordid grasping, Love of power and earthly gain,â€” That would rob a needy brother. Heeding not his want or pain. Dying to a lofty spirit, Over-bearing, proud and high, Stooping not with gentle pity, When the lowly passeth by. Dying unto false pretenses, Held in pure Religion's name, Cant, hypocrisy and grandeurSilken robes for sin and shame. Dying, that in resurrection, Grand and true the soul may rise, Noble types of God-like image Wrought through perfect sacrifice. Life is in the Christian's triumph, When from sin and bondage free, Lo, the prince of darkness cometh, And can find no place in me.
