Moses was wise in forbidding the eating of swine's flesh. It is coarse, impure, scrofulous food, often containing trichina?. The graceful reindeer of the polar reigons is a standing proof against the necessity of animal flesh for food even in the frigid north. In the year 2000 our advanced race will look upon a meat-eater very much as we now look upon a cannibal. â€”Dr. J. M. Peebles, in Banner of Light.
