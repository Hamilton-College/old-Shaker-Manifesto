MUSIC SUNG IN CONNECTION WITH THE DIALOGUE:. 1. Praise, rejoicing and thanks-giving, Is the glory 2. May the joy our feelings cherish, Thrill a chord in of our song! While the angels from above us, 'Waft the blessed strain ev'ry heart! While the secret streams out-flowing, Shall an answer true along; impart; 'Tis for promised joys unmeasured, And we call on all to join us For delights that In our joyous ne'er will wane, For the rapture festive song! While the waves of pure before us, And the hope for holy gain, life dance merry, And the heart is glad and strong I Chorus, con spirito. We will swell the gladsome chorus, Till bright hosts around us throng, And with harps of sweetest music, Join our universal song. Yea we'll swell the gladsome chorus, Full, unbroken, rich and strong; Till It floats and floats around us, This our universal song.
