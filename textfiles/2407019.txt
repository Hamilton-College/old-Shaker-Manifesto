Watervliet, O. June, 1894. We have been having very cool, wet weather through May, and had a slight frost on the morning of the 31st. Well, we have been trying to make home cheerful, inasmuch as white washing and repairing can do it. We are putting some new siding on our wagon and carriage house. Also white washed some of the out buildings which makes them look much better. We have taken down one old building that was used for storing tools. Have put up a lath and wire fence at the south of the North family's garden which was much needed and makes a better appearance. Our potato crop looks well and we shall have new potatoes by the 10th or 15th of June. They are of the size of hens' eggs now. Garden truck is coming on very slowly as the weather has been very unfavorable. Corn looks well, also wheat and the harvest will be abundant if the frost will only keep away. We hope that June will be warmer and the weather more pleasant, that the farmers may look more cheerful. A company of Brethren went to Dayton to interview an army of Coxeyites that were gathering together to start for Washington, but they got there one day too late to see any of them. Wo had better take things as they come and learn to bear all things patiently. We must not expect to have smooth waters to sail upon all the time. We have sold some lambs that averaged 61 lbs. each. If any one can excel we would like to hear from him. We herewith extend our kindest love and blessing to all Believers east, west and south. We have nothing but good-will to extend all around.
