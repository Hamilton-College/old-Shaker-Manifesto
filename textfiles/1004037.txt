Oh, he whom Jesus loved... Whittier 'Oh, he whom Jesus loved has truly spoken ! 1 he holier worship, which God deigns to bless, Restores the lost, and heils the spiritbroken, And feeds the widow and the fatherless. Then, brother man, fold to thy heart thy brother ! For where love dwells, the peace of God is there; To worship rightly is to love each otherâ€” Each smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer. Follow, with reverent steps, the great example Of him whose holy work was doing good : So shall the wide earth seem our Father's temple, Each loving life a psalm of gratitude. Thus shall all shackles fall ; the stormy clangor Of wild war-music o'er the earth shall cease; Love shall tread out the baleful fires' of anger, And in its ashes plant the tree of peace.'
