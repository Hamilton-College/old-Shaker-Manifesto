Sanitary. A VEGETAKUN. [ Contributed by Elder F. AV. Evans. ] l,it~i* Costs liut a $ix])�iicv a Way� Some Mays JJeM. A letter from Dr. T. R. Allinson to the London Times says : 'Allow me to bring under the notice of your readers some experiments I have just concluded to solve the difficulty of feeding our poor in London and elsewhere. The cry is that food is so dear the poor can scarcely live. This cry is true if they want to live on luxuries, but if they will live on wholesome but plain and healthy fare they can do so for very little. A little over a month ago I determined to give up all expensive articles of food and live almost as cheaply as possible. Having left off flesh foods fer nearly two years, and lecturing frequently on the question of food, I knew what to select. Looking over my food accounts, I found milk, butter, eggs and cheese, with tea and coffee, were fairly expensive articles, and none of them necessary, so I gave them up for a time to see results. On Oct. 19th. I began my experiment, my weight was then nine stone eight ounces. I continued this purely vegetarian diet for a month, when my weight was nine stone three pounds twelve ounces or a gain of three and a quarter pounds. My friends said I looked well; I felt well, and did my usual work the same as ever. I walked from ten to fifteen miles daily, seeing patients or taking exercise. Here is an account of my dietary, which cost me little more than a sixpence a day, and I could easily live for less without luxuries : Breakfast consisted of a basin of porridge, made from a mixture of oatmeal and wheatmeal, which I found more palatable than either singly. This I usually ate with bread to insure thorough insalivation. Then came bread fried in refined cottonseed oil or fried vegetable haggis. For drink I had a cup of cocoa or fruit syrup, with warm water and sugar. The cocoa used was an ordinary one with plenty of starch in it, which makes a thick drink, and no milk is than required. Dinner consisted of a thick vegetable soup and bread, potato pie, savory pie, vegetarian pie, vegetable stew, stewed rice and tomatoes, etc. For a second course I had bread, plum pudding, stewed rice and fruit, baked sago, tapioca ajnd apples, stewed prunes, figs, raisins and bread. Tea meal consisted of bread and jam, stewed fruit, or some green stuff, as water-cress, celery tomatoes etc. I had only three meals a day, and frequently, when very busy, I had only two, and a cup of cocoa and a biscuit for supper. I always use the whole meal bread, as it is laxative and contains a great deal of nitrogen, which is thrown away with the bran. The cottonseed oil is a cheap and good cooking oil, and is impossible to detect. This diet I continued for a month, and now I only take the an- imal products when out, not having- them at my table. ' Now compare this diet with one of flesh or a mixed one. The latest analysis shows flesh to contain from 70 to 74 percent of water, the dry residue being A'ery rich in nitrogen, and it contains a little carbonaceous or fatty matter. Hence, to live on meat alone, as much as eight pounds a day is necessary. Then there are to be considered the diseases of animals which are communicable to man if that flesh be not thoroughly cooked all through and as very few of our animals live a perfectly natural life, most of them are more or less diseased, especially the fat ones. The excess of nitrogen taken into the system in eating flesh meat has to be got rid of by the liver, kidneys and lungs; hence these organs, are overtaxed, and much disease is the consequence., in fact, were it not for flesh food we doctors should have very little to do. Man living in towns can not afford to eat much flesh, because he does not get sufficient exereise and oxygen to burn up the excess of nitrogen. If he does eat this flesh, and if lie eat much, then he must suffer from many complaints, such as indigestion, bilious attacks, congested liver, hemorrhoids, gastric catarrh and other gastric troubles. If the habit be continued in gall-stones or urinary calculi may follow, or rheumatism and gout. Then the kidneys become diseased and more nrork is thrown on the heart, which becomes also diseased; the end is death by one of the lingering diseases, which shows a diseased organ somewhere. E^en epilepsy and many nervous diseases are aggravated by flush. Cancer is on the increase, and from some observations I have made, it may be indirectly traced to flesh. Consumption lias only a remote connection with flesh, it being due chiefly to the want of fresh air. Vegetable food is cheap, contains an abundant supply nfriutrj. noent at first cost, and our systems are so formed as to use it with least expenditure of vital force. ' COLD FEET. We often hear persons complain of having fold feet, not only in the winter but at all seasons of the year We do not understand by that feet that become cold accidently by standing in the street, on the cold ground, on the snow or en the ice, but we wish to speak of a condition of disease which consists in having the feet habitually cold. If a person cannot have the feet warm, in spite of warm felt shoes, in spite of woolen stockings, and these moreover in a warm room, and his feet are cold in bed during the night he is :n a condition of chronic malady, which is the cause of many other maladies. What is the cause of such cold feet? The physiologist would say that animal heat depends on the blood which gives out its heat to all parts of the body, and if the circulation is sluggish in any part, there is in that part a sensation of cold. In that chronic condition which consists in having the feet cold we have then a defective distribution of the blood. As the cold feet do not receive a sufficient quantity of blood, therefore they do not get a sufficient quantity of warmth, the nutrition of these extremities is perverted, some of their functions are arrested and organic troubles follow. Not only the part affected becomes diseased, but as a result other remote organs. To have the feet habitually cold is not the result of a deficient quantity of blood in the system ; the quantity exists, but it is blocked up in other places, in the arteries and veins. This ebbing tide of blood, which sometimes causes extravasations of blood has often been followed by dangerous symptoms. Thus we find hemorrhoids in men, and nearly all uterine affections in women, are due to habitually cold feet, and when these cease, the affections that follow disapx&gt;ear also. Habitually cold feet are the origin of many affections of the stomach. This unequal circulation of the mass of the blood often causes diseases of the liver, of the intestines, of inflammations and catarrhs of the stomach. This blood repelled from the extremities goes xery often to congest the lungs, organs which easily yield to sanguine congestions. And it can be said that ninety times in one hundred, diseases of the lungs are due to cold feet. Cold feet often induce difficult respiration and asthma; the heart becomes subject to palpitations. The congestion reaches the larynx, the head; from these the trouble extends to the brain and to the eyes. All these affections disappear when the feet are kept warm. It is to our own carelessness that habitually cold feet arc due. We systematically render ourselves ill. Even from the cradle they raise us to have cold feet. The stockings are thin and the shoes narrow with elastic tips, so that the blood cannut circulate in the feet; add to this the evil custom of having garters, and the general want of care for the feet, and it is easily seen why these organs revenge this treatment later. What is necessary to avoid cold feet, and to cure this infirmity when it exists? It is not well to give baths too warm to children; it is well to continue baths at all ages. The feet should be attended to, and infants should have loose shoes, without elastics, and then tlie feet will keep warm. If the feet have become habitually cold, it is necessary to have patience and not think that a trouble that has required twenty or thirty years to establish can be cured in one night. There is no specific for the cure of chronic cold feet. The cure of the evil pertains to natural therapeutics, as rubbing, vapor baths and walking. In this way warmth comes to the feet, and with it health returns. When the feet are warm it becomes easy to talk, for then the head is cool and the blood circulates freely. The old proverb which said that ' head cool, feet warm and waist free may laugh at the doctors ' finds here confirmation. An excellent vapor bath for the feet is made thus : In a small box put a jug of boiling water, and envelop this jug with cloths wet witli hoi water. Place the naked feet on �lats thai cover the box. and then envelop them with flannel. The vapor which rises from the wet cloths warms the feet and dilates the blood vessels ; thus the blood has more space to circulate, and the nerves are excited to action. After a certain time wipe the feet with a dry towel. It is well also to have at the feet, in the bed, during the night, a bottle or jug filled with hot water. Hall's Journal of Health.
