THE GRAPE CURE According to the Pall Mall Gazette, among the most agreeable hygienic processes extant must be reckoned the grape cure. There are on the continent numerous establishments devoted to the use of the remedy; two in France, Aigle in Savoy, and Celiestes-Bains in the Ardeche ; three, at least, in Switzerland — Veyteaux, Vovey, Montreaux; and many in Germany, Austria, the Tyrol, and Hungary. The juice of the grape, containing, according to medical authority, 25 per cent of its weight in active agents — glucose, tartaric acid, potash, chalk, soda, oxide of iron, and manganese in combination with sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc. — there is some reason for comparing this 'organic mineral water,' as it has been called, with the inorganic, the curative powers of which are so universally recognized, and for expecting similar results from it. The cure is very simple. It consists in eating an immense quantity of grapes, the thin-skinned sweet white varieties being best for the purpose. The patient takes but little ordinary food, and is required to eat three or four pounds of the fruit a day just at first, the quantity being gradually increased to eight, ten, and even twelve pounds of grapes. This is, if possible, to be eaten in the open air, in the vineyard whence the supply is derived —an arrangement which, no doubt, greatly conduces to the efficiency of the cure. It is frequently undertaken in their private practice by French physicians, who possess the matorial for it in the incomparableChasselas, of which such quantities are now selling in Paris.
