We have received from the pen of Elder Frederick W. Evans, a beautiful article in memory of Elder Daniel Boler. As it reached us too late for this number it will appear in the Manifesto for January, 1893, as wall several other articles bearing upon the same subject. A number of pieces must be carefully laid away for the present, as our December paper is already full of good things.
