A PEEP INTO A MOUNTAIN-WALLED TREASURY of the Gods UTAH. 'A PEEP INTO A MOUNTAIN-WALLED TREASURY of the Gods,' is the title of a beautifully illustrated book forwarded to us by Cassius C. Smith of Denver, Col. In his illustrative notes referring to this wonderful country the Editor writes.'Earth has no other land like ours. Among all the nationalists and realms of the Globe, Columbia the Gem of the ocean is peerless, unrivalled and unrivable. The grandest empires of the old world, of ancient or of modern times, sink into petty provinces beside its vast dimensions.' This very interesting, instructive and beautiful work will be sent to any address upon receipt of 25 cts by J. H. Bennett, Gen'l Passg'r agent, Rio Grand Western Railway, Salt Lake City.
