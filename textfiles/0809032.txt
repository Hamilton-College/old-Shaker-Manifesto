A Hindoo Prayer! 'There is one thing, my God, which makes me very anxious. It is this. Having loved thee as my Father and Mother, I now feel I cannot fear thee, as a transgressor like myself should fear the great Judge. The fact is, I love thee, and yet I love and cherish my sins too. Assuredly my love for thee is not genuine pure love. So, at least, says my conscience. And yet I cannot believe that I do not love thee. Teach me, God, to har- monize sweet love with chastening fear, that I may, wMIr loving thee with passionate at- tachment, root out whatsoever is wrong in my heart. If I cannot fear thee, Lord, let thy holy spirit so sanctify my inner nature that there may be left no cause for fear.'
