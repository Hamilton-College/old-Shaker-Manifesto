The Phrenological Journal The Phrenological Journal for Aug. introduces us to Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court. A brief but very interesting article follows the portrait. Our Cakes by Henry G. Fox is a lesson of wisdom of which even the worldly wise would do well to take note. Notable People has reached the 22nd. article, and in this we have the portrait of Robert B. Roosevelt a descendant of the early Dutch settlers, and of Gen. Abraham Dally, a veteran of the war of 1812. He has reached the great age of 93 yrs. and yet was able on the centennial anniversary of New York to appear in his continental uniform, and occupy a place on the grand Stand, at the time of the review. A variety of other articles of value is found in the Contents, and the whole may be obtained for onlyl5 cts. at the Office of Fowler &amp; Wells Co., 775 Broadway, N. Y.
