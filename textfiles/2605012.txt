Sabbathday Lake, Me. April, 1896. The sudden death of our beloved Elder John Vance necessarily called the Central Ministry to our aid. In their great kindness they came to our home March 24th, bringing with them love and comfort such as gentle parents are wont to bestow on their sorrowing children. They tarried three days, leaving a blessing with us. Elder William Dumont has been chosen to fill Elder John's place in the Ministry and also retain his position as Elder and Trustee of this Society. Eldress Lizzie Noyes and Sister Aurelia Mace were also appointed Trustees. These three faithful souls we trust implicitly for our spiritual and temporal welfare. The new greenhouse erected last fall is now full of seedlings. The Brethren expect to have 400 doz. tomato plants to sell and 200 doz. celery plants for the Poland Spring market. The Sisters are starting their flower seeds and find it much more convenient than formerly when they had but the light and sun of the windows. We have almost every requisite for plant growing. The winter has been one of the most trying seasons for many years. Twice recently we have been visited with a distemper known as La Grippe. Some of the members are now confined to their rooms battling with the ugly monster. The lumber at the saw mill is now being sawed. The coming week the firewood w ill be sawed with the Portable engine. During the past month we have had a great deal of snow. On the 3rd inst. a foot of snow fell in one night, and even now one would think it were mid-winter ins.ead of spring by the way the wind blows the snow around. Ada S. Cummings.
