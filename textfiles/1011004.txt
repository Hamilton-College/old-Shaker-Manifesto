WITCHCRAFT F. W. Evans ' Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.' Under the American Government, there is no such sin as witchcraft, because there is no church connected with it. In these United States, Spiritualism stands upon precisely the same footing as other sects and denominations. Spiritualism, operating within the jurisdiction of any religious organization that believes in Spiritualism, without the consent of the organization, is witchcraft. Thus, in any church, Protestant or Catholic, Spiritualism is condemned as witchcraft. Among believers, Spiritualism out of order is nothing else but witchcraft, and witchcraft is rebellion against the constituted church authority.
