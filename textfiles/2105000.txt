THE KENTUCKY REVIVAL. By Richard M'Nemar OF Union Village, Ohio. Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 5. ./Eneas M' Callister, in a letter dated May, 1802, speaking of the work in North Carolina, observes, 'The like wonders have not been seen, except in the Kentucky Revival last summer, since the days of the Apostles. I suppose the exercises of our congregation last winter, surpassed any thing ever seen or heard. I think it sometimes would have been well, if they had been kept and never told.'* ****** It is certain, the natural man rereceiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; hence, Christ instructed his disciples not to cast pearls before swine; for the same cause, so little has been published abroad concerning the deep things of G-od, made manifest among the people called New-Lights : and for the same reason, these things can be but slightly touched at present. That the power was supernatural by which such multitudes were struck down, required no arguments to prove ; and had they never risen again, there might have been some reason for charging it to the devil: but who has power to kill and make alive again? could any one with the rationality of a man, suppose that any thing short of the power of God, could suspend the functions of animal life for an hour, a day, or a week, and again restore them with additional brightness ? Is nature able to assume such apparent changes, as for tens and fifties, moved at the same time by the same instinct, to forget the use of every limb, and fall prostrate no matter where, and yawn, and gasp, and expire in a cold sweat ? This belongs not to nature, and as little does it belong to nature to exempt her sons from wounds and bruises, broken limbs, and aching heads, in case of such repeated and dangerous falls as were common among the NewLights. Least of all, could nature extend to their resurrection, after an hour, a week, or a trance of nine days. Who wants a miracle to arouse their faith, and fix it on the sacred truths recorded in the Scriptures ? let him recognize the camp-meeting, let him find the man or woman, whose immortal THE MANIFESTO. part for hours and days traversed the regions of eternity, while the breathless body lay as a spectacle of terror to surrounding friends. The learned expositor of Scripture, and the one whom he opprobriously terms an Infidel, are equally baffled with the falling exercise : the one upon his Irypothesis, that there never was such a thing as a miracle in the days of the Apostles; and the other, that there never was to be any such thing after. All their experiments and researches were in vain, to reduce this operation to some natural cause. Their feeling the pulse, changing the situation of the person, applying smelling bottles, bathing with camphor or cold water, and letting of blood, could never make half the discovery in the case that those made who came with their barrels of whiskey to retail to the multitude. By such it was abundantly proved, that the readiest way to keep clear of this extraordinary exercise, was to drown the soul in debauchery and vice. Many circumstances, confounding to the wisdom of man, attended the exercises mentioned, which for sake of brevity have to be omitted. However extraordinary these things were, they were not considered by the people as the most evidential of a work of the true spirit: something much greater was commonly expected to succeed their resurrection, of greater importance than any thing that went before. The word of exhortation is ranked among the apostolic gifts, and as such it was considered by the New-Lights. This gift was generally expected on the occasion of rising from the before mentioned trance, and such expectations were very commonly answered. The exhortations delivered on those occasions by all ranks and colors, but especially by small children, were so evidential of a divine power, so searching to the conscience, and so wounding to the sinner, that the most obstinate unbelievers have fallen down, like those of old, and confessed that God was of a truth in them. It required a spirit more incredulous than that which has commonly been called infidelity, to deny a supernatural agency in the case of such pathetic and powerful addresses from little children, not only unlearned, but also of the most bashful and unpopular cast of mind. Such little ones, of eight or ten years of age raised upon the shoulders or held up in the arms of some one, in the midst of vast multitudes, would speak in a manner so marvelous and astonishing, that persons of the most rugged passions would dissolve into tears. Professors of the foremost rank, confess that hitherto they had been total strangers to that heavenly sense and feeling, which distinguished a child of God. So deep were the effects of truth, delivered in the simple language of a child, of which the following may serve as a short specimen. 'O the sweetness of redeeming love ! O if sinners knew the sweetness of redeeming love, they would all come to the overflowing fountain!' The general gift of exhortation was to search out the state of the sinner, convict him of sin, and warn him to fly from it. They often came so pointed, even to naming out the person and pub98 licly arraigning him for specific crimes, that evil spirits, whose work is to cover iniquity, and conceal it, were stirred up to great fury. Those possessed with them, would come forth in a great rage, threatening and blaspheming against the author of the revival, and bold as G-oliath, challenge his armies to a rencounter. Could nature, without bloodshed and slaughter, overcome beings so fierce? Or must it not be something supernatural? To see a bold Kentuckian, undaunted by the horrors of war, turn pale and tremble at the reproof of a weak woman, a little boy or a negro ; to see him sink down in deep remorse, roll and toss, and gnash his teeth, till black in the face ; entreat the prayers of those he came to devour, and through their fervent intercessions and kind instructions, obtain deliverance, and return in the possession of the meek and gentle spirit which he set out to oppose; who would say the change was not supernatural and miraculous ? Such exorcisms, or casting out of evil spirits, are justly ranked among the wonders which attended the NewLight. Nor could the man once delivered from the Legion, go home with greater joy to tell his friends what great things Jesus had done for him, than many returned from these encamping grounds, to announce to their former companions, their happy change. To what has been said it may be objected, that many who were converted in this extraordinary manner, gave no lasting evidence of a real change, but returned again to their former courses ; and as they testified that they were all actuated by one spirit, if some were mistaken, why not the whole? I answer, the work of God is one thing and the opinion formed by the subject of it, another. If it should be granted that many, or even all, were mistaken as to the immediate effect of the work, this would not alter the work from what it was. If a foolish person should take grain when it was only in the blossom, and say it was ripe, and commence reaping, binding and stacking it, this would not prove that the plowing and sowing had not been well done by a good farmer. Spiritual life is of a growing nature, as well as vegetable and animal life. If many, zealous to increase the number of their disciples, did deceive the generality with a vain persuasion, that a short scene of conviction, light and comfort, comprehended all that was contained in the new birth, and cut them off from any further growth, this did not prove that their impressions had not a proper beginning, or were not of the genuine kind. Obj. 2. If this great appearance of union and general communion was of God, why did it not increase? Arts. Why did not that union and communion increase which existed among the Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Herodians and Syrophcenicians, who followed Christ into the wilderness and encamped there day and night ? The reason is plain, the foundation of a lasting union could not be laid until the rubbish was cleared out of the way, and as this was the first work then, so it was in the late revival. Those who followed the true light were united in breaking down and burning that which was old and decayed, and this had to be done before they could unite in building up that which is sound and permanent. A union in the first case, although it is productive of greater division, is both a shadow and a sure pledge of that union which follows in consequence. Obj. 3. But what do you make of those who testified that they had got all the rubbish destroyed, were carried above all sin, and temptation, and pain, and never should suffer again, were higher than Elijah, perfectly blessed and filled with the fulness of Grod. With all this so united in heart that they never could part, and yet after all, turn to hate one another worse than ever, and live as loose and wicked as others ? So that they could afterward say ;� 'Ah! where am I now! When was it or how� That I fell from my heaven of grace? I am stripped of my all�I am brought into thrall� I am banished from Jesus' face.' Do not such changes prove that their extraordinary light was all a delusion ? Ans. If so, the same argument will prove that every dispensation of light, both under the Law and Gospel was a delusion, for after the brightest manifestations there was always a falling away. Did not the whole camp of Israel fall away after the giving of the law upon mount Sinai? Did this prove that the light which they saw and all the signs and wonders that preceded and accompanied it was delusion? David, Solomon, and all the Kings and people of Israel fell away; and how often was this chosen generation brought under judgments and banished into captivity, not to prove that their extraordinary light had been all delusion, but the contrary. John the Baptist decreased and his followers came to nothing. All that had followed Jesus for three years, forsook him and fell away in the hour of trial. If this was not sufficient according to the above objection, to prove their light a delusion, you may add the universal apostacy that prevailed through the long reign of antichrist, in which there was none that did good and sinned not, no not one.
