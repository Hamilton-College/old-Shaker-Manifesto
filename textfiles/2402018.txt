Shaker Station, Conn. Jan. 1804. 'Hold fast that which is good,' is advice worth regarding. If we desire to shine as jewels in God's Kingdom we must lose nothing which adds to loveliness in our characters. It is our privilege to grow better, purer, more true and loving. We should make ourselves worthy of being loved. Deeds of sympathy, words of encouragement and love to each other, are tending to our spiritual elevation. Our hearts will be full of love, if our lives are full of purity. Let us discipline ourselves to take what each moment brings to Us of duty and of privilege. Let us perform the duty of the hour now passing. If we grasp well the meaning of the one little fragment of time present, and perform the duty that this hour brings, we shall thus do that which will please God and perfect our own lives. 'The largest park in the United States is the Yellowstone. It is sixty-five milts north and south, fifty-five miles east and west, contains three thousand five hundred and seventy five square miles and is six thousand feet above sea level.' We should take pride in having good poultry, One of the best egg producing foods is wheat. For young chickens there is nothing better. Try it now while it is cheap. About one hundred hens is the right number for an acre of land, but one hundred fowls should not run together on that acre. A flock of one hundred should be divided into four small flocks giving each flock a quarter acre. Cooked grains with vegetables has been shown to be a capital food for poultry. Daniel Orcutt.
