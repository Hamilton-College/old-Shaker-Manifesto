House-hold To Prepare Straw for making Bonnets and other Articles E. A. S. The time for gathering the straw is when the grain commences to ripen or turn yellow. Gather in the field, the grain standing; as the best straws, those freest from mildew, can be more easily selected. Cut just above the upper joint on the stalk for bonnets, the next two are shorter and may be used for table mats and small fancy articles. It is preferable to gather the straw a little too young, than too old. Have ready, water boiling hot in which to scald the straw. When scalded sufficiently, the joints will make a snapping sound. The next process is to whiten it in the sun ; three days are usually a sufficient length of time. Do not leave it out over night after the first. Unsheathe it the second day. Bleach it in the same manner that woolens are bleached, repeating- the burning of the brimstone two or three times. Rye and oats produce the best straw of any f the grains. Rye straw is the strongest; at straw the whitest. Brimstone causes steel to rust; palm-leaf nd straw being bleached with this, should not be cut with scissors or knives that are good, as it ruins them. It is a good idea to varnish wire that is used in making bonnets, to prevent rusting. E A.S. Canterbury, N. H.
