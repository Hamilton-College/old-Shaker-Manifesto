Cooking potatoes Cooking Potatoes.—The potato is more nutritious and more generally used than any other vegetable, and when properly boiled so as to be dry and mealy, it is a real luxury; but when sodden and water-soaked, as frequently we see them, they are indigestible and one of the worst things that are put into the human stomach ; and yet a well-boiled potato is seldom seen at a hotel or restaurant, and the man who would introduce them into the latter would do a public favor and help his own purse. This is the way I would recommend: Let them be put into cold water in a covered vessel, and boiled rapidly until nearly done; then pour off the water and sprinkle a small quantity of salt over the potatoes; put on the cover so as to leave a small open space for the steam to escape and leave the vessel over the fire for a few minutes, and the potatoes will be done.— Germantown Telegraph.
