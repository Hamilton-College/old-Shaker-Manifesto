Sonyea, N. Y. July, 1892. 'How strikingly the signs appear That the harvest time is near. Now the reapers have gone forth To gather fruits from off the earth.' The early rising farmers are hurrying early and late to secure a noble harvest by making hay while the sun shines. The sunny days furnish broad fields and lots of hard work for all who possess the valuable gift of push and pull, life and stir, the four essential qualities that assist in forming the perfect man and woman. The living well know that 'it is not all of life to live, nor all of death to die.' June celebrated its twenty-seventh day by visiting the land with one of the most severe rain and hail storms ever known in this remote section of the great big world, the storm was accompanied with sharp shafts of lightning, forming a magnificent display of electric brightness. Our currant garden is the finest of any seen on this or the other side of the big waters. G. D. G.
