WHAT IS LIFE? ABRAHAM PERKINS. What is life? It is very much what we make it. If our soul purpose is to make the principles of honesty and truth the guide and governor of action, we shall reap the fruits of those principles, which are always love, peace and joy, without amalgamation or the relation of any spirit akin to hatred, malice or strife. No foe, foreign or domestic, can enter to take away or destroy known justification, the reward of honest living. Jesus said,�'The kingdom of God is within you.' It ' cometh not by observation.' No greater heaven is possible to be enjoyed, than that arising from the knowledge of eftbrts purely honest, and from faith made practical by works of obedience; and no hell more severe, han that arisinr: from the knowledge of disobedience to the light of conscience. God is enthroued in the soul of man for judgment, according to the testimony of Jesus ;�'Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.' John, xx., 23. Again, by Paul:�' Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?' 1 Cor. vi., 2. No man can change the order of this tribunal, which is established by a mighty hand for the justification or condemnation of our deeds ; and no man feels the approbation of his works, unless his conscience approves ; neither does he feel condemned, unless in his own heart, he is convinced he is in the wrong. Our own hearts are our accusers, whether our tongues confess or do not confess. No greater evidence of truth can be obtained, than that coming from personal experience. We know God through our senses by the objects of His creation. The evidence of a Supreme Being is from what we behold,�what we see, hear and feel; and no evidence is more palpable, than that which comes through man, His image. Hence our duty is obvious from the evidences every day before us, from the necessities of the occasion, the demands of the circumstances. These circumstances man himself often creates, and should be able to control. In life, there exists no condition that would justify a breach of divine law. A penalty is attached even to the sin of ignorance ; suffering must follow, even if but few stripes are inflicted; there must be repentance lor every deviation from truth and right, which sooner or later must come to the knowledge of the soul. Therefore how absolute the necessity that we live in sunlight, that we know the truth as it is, that we are not in darkness and under deception, that to us life is made real, that our profession be not a pretense, a fraud, a sham, that in us be no blemish or taint of hypocrisy, that we be seen as we are and truly be, as we seem to be ! Such and only such are the subjects of the kingdom of heaven ; the elements of which, neither defileth, maketh a lie or in any sense worketh iniquity. AVho then can confidently claim to be the heirs of the kingdom, the children of Zion ! Whosoever can, let him cry aloud that he may be heard, if there are to be found ears to hear. Let him have the moral courage to declare his faith, and by example give evidence of Christian character, that his life is hid in Christ and his relation of the resurrection order. Enfield, N. H.
