To the memory of LUCINA McDANIELS. Katie Boyle. In silence we look on her cold face of clay; The spirit God lent for a time now has fled. Mother Earth ope's her arms her own to receive But the soul still lives when all else is dead. Her path did not lie amid roses alone, For sometimes it traversed where dark waters roll; And over rough moantains she wended her way, In quest of that kingdom the promised abode. At last she's attained to that haven of rest' She has merited by her strict faithfulness To the Father's cammand to do his good will That she might reign with him in full righteousness. Released now from bondage to reign with the just Who've gained full redemption o'er death and the grave; And sings the sweet Anthem of freedom and love, To God the redeemer who doth the soul save. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
