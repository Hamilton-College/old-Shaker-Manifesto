The Ladies' Home Journal WSIE MITCMJSM of the CHTUSRCH. The mission chapel has become a kitchen where the church does its sloppy work. Hundreds and thousands of churches in tins country�gorgeously built and supported�that even on bright and sunshiny days are half full of worshipers, and yet they are building mission cha,pels, because by some expressed or implied regulation the great masses of the people are kept out of the main audience room. Now, I say that any place of worship which is appropriate for one class is appropriate for all classes. Let the rich and the poor meet together the Lord, the Maker of them all. Mind you, I say that mission chapels are a necessity, the way churches are now conducted; but may God speed the time when they shall cease to be a necessity. God will rise up and break down the gates of the churches that have kept back the masses. And woe be to those who stand in the way! They will be trampled under foot by the vast populations making a stampede for Heaven.�T. De Witt Talmage, D. D., in The Ladies' Home Journal.
