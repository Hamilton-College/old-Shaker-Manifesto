EXPLANATORY Beloved Editor, G. A. Lomas : I have the pleasure of sending to you the enclosed communication from one of our aged mothers in Israel, who, although 87 years of age and feeble in body, is yet bright and beautiful in spirit. She has a growing interest in all that is good and pure. She is an interested and constant reader of The Manifesto â€” a lover of truth, with whom there are ' no backward steps, no halting between two opinions,' her spirit reaches upward, and twining around the sturdy oak of our faith, she lives for the good she can do, and not for herself alone. As the blossom sends up its sweet incense, so there arises from such souls the blessings of veterans in the cause, and surrounded by angels they have left the thorny paths of life to walk in the gardens of Paradise ever more. I am, your sister, Mary A. Gillespie
