BAD AMBITION Bismarck is often discontented, and in a period of despondency he is said to have exclaimed -. ' In satisfying my ambition 1 have made nobody happy.' The company at his Varzin residence protested ' No.' He continued : ' And what a number of people I have cast into misery. Without me three great wars would have been avoided ; 80,000 men—nay, much more—would not have been killed, and such a number of families, of fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, aud wives would not have been plung ed into mourning. However, that account is to be settled between God and myself so far as the hereafter goes. What happiness have I derived from all my success ? Little or none ; and I have reaped endless worry, vexation, hatred, pain, grief, overwork and care.'-—Cm. Gazette.
