Beloved Elder Henry:--I enclose a slip cut from a Montreal paper... Shirley Village, Mass., Aug. 1892. Beloved Elder Henry :1 enclose a slip cut from a Montreal paper, that I think worthy of a place in the Manifesto. We are progressing with fall work nicely. How true it is'God works in a mysterious way his wonders to perform,' to the natural mind at least. To those standing in the light of his truth, much of the mystery disappears, and to them it will shine brighter and brighter unto the perfect; day. Yours very iruly, John Whitely.
