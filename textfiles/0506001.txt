UNBORN POETRY There is a river that makes glad the City of our God. Passing over the river is not to die, With outstretched limbs in state to lie. For as a man thinketh so is be, In time or in Eternity. To die is a change that none forego, The Peasant, the King, the friend and foe, go hastening on in weal and woe, to the land of Ghosts, which none may know. Know as we know the things of earth, In manhood, youth, and back to birth. Mystery of mysteries From the beginning! Why do we live, love? Why keep on sinning? Where did we come from ? Whither go we, Men, Women and Children, Bond and free ? To die is not to pass over the river, for still we live — live on forever. But there is a river that never's dry, That none may pass over until they die. Die to the life that reproduces, The race of man without abuses. The end has come, the summer is ended. The harvester, Death, with life is blended. Life — Eternal Life, From the throne of God, The Lamb was the first, the first who trod The banks of that river, The river of God. Ed.
