As Christianity is gradually compelled to give up civil government, so it will gradually be compelled to give up associations with metaphysics, with long creeds, and with apostolic succession, and chorals and candles, and betake itself into the soul, and find its ejnpire to be bounded by faith in Christ, and an fipright life. In that day, and may it hasten its coining, all the hearts that love Christ and do the will of God will be one. David Swing
