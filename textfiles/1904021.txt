THE LORD'S PRAYER REVISED. Father in Heaven, hallow'd be Thy name ; Make Thy will on earth and Heaven the same ; Feed us with manna, as daily we need; Teach us thy precepts ever to heed. Forgive us our debts, oh! Father divine, To forgive our debtors, make us incline. If temptations assail, lead us we pray, To shun the evil, to choose the right way. Guide and direct, oh! Father above; Shield and protect with Thy infinite love. Bring us at last to Thy home in Heaven, Praise and glory shall to Thee be given. 'A.'
