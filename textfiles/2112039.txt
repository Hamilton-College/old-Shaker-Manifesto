ANSWER TO BIBLE QUESTION, NO. 24. Mary L. Wilson. It is well to be familiar with the historical events connected with our Savior's life, but of much more importance that the disciple understand the true meaning of the gospel and learn to apply the principles to daily life. He that said 'I am the Eesurrection and the life,' had no reference to the reanimation of the human body, of which it is recorded, 'Dust thou art, and unto dust slialt thou return,' for 'He that believeth on me, though he were dead, (physically) yet shall he live,' (spirit- ually) indicates the possibility of soul growth after death. 'He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it' does not imply the necessity of crucifying or taking of human life in order to rise with Christ in the Resurrection and inherit eternal life. The crucifixion of Jesus, was the result of wicked persecution, just as all the advocates of truth have been persecuted since that time. ''The flesh lusteth against the spirit' and took the life of the first-born Son of God hoping to extinguish the light of gospel truth, for which Jesus came to bear Avitness, but 'God's ways are not man's ways,' as He makes persecution an instrument in his hands for creating thought and investigation which result in a religious awakening and the conversion of souls. The life of Christ accepted by any human being will bring the world of sin and selfishness to an end, individually speaking. This seems to create considerable anxiety in the mind of the natural man and woman. What will become of the world? not �What shall I do to be saved to-day from the sins of the world? is the all-important theme. 'The children of the Resurrection neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven.' Then if the life of Christ is the Resurrection, only those who live as the angels in heaven are his disciples, for 'As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.' Judging by their fruits, which is the only criterion for a Christian, Adam has more followers than Jesus Christ, which is not speaking very well of the nineteenth century as a progressive Christian age We should be quite unwilling to till the soil or adopt any of the old methods of performing hand labor on the farm or in the shop, that were in use even one hundred, much less five hundred years ago, and still this is what most people are doing in moral and religious life. If religion means anything, it should be a practical application of those principles which will create a heaven on earth, where peace purity, truth and love reign in every heart. This will constitute the millennium�the Resurrection of the soul. Some of the Shakers and Spiritualists claim that the different parties to whom Jesus appeared after death were simply gifted as visionists. Some will say, 'Why did Jesus not appear as an angel?' Because the disciples being natural must see him as he was on earth, in order to believe that he was the same Jesus who had been crucified, and it is equally difficult for the natural man of to-day to believe and obey the gospel of Christ, which creates a wonderful transformation or resurrection from the dead works of sin.
