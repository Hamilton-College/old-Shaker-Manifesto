REMARKS ON FOOD. By Joel Shrew, M. D. Butter is'very moderately used. At Priessnitz table, I doubt if six persons, as a rule, vise more than one in this country. There is but little upon the table. A very thin small roll of it is seen here and there. Some of the patients appear to take none. As is the case in Germany, generally, the butter is salted but very little. Perhaps this is one reason why so small an amount is taken. If a larger quantity were used, it being nearly saltless, the effect would be decidedly less harmful than if it were salted, as in this country, for salt is in every sense a drug, and one that should be avoided. Puke cold water is the best drink that God ever gave to man, and foolish are they who do not avail themselves of the blessing.
