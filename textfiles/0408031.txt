PEACE AT LAST I sought in vain for comfort, in pleasures of the world; I saw its brightest visions turn to mis'ries untold; I walk'd through scenes of sorrow, trusting earthly pow'r, To sustain my fainting spirit in the trying hour. I've made (Oh! God forgive me) idols on the earth, And worship'd them, forsaking things of greater worth ; But all those things have vanish'd, and in sorrow deep Left me alone — forsaken — to wander and to weep. Now, rays of light are shining; in the distance I can see Hope, Religion,— many treasures indeed are left to me ; Forsaking earthly pleasures, I turn to thee OGod! And humbly walk before thee in the path that Jesus trod. Now, joy and consolation, my wearied soul has found, In seeking full salvation on Zion's holy ground; Devoting all my efforts to serve and worship God, I'll bow in true submission, and bless his chast'ning rod. He has led me out of bondage — sooth'd me with his love — And taught me to prepare for a heav'nly home above.
