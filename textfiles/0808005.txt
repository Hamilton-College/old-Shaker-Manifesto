PRAYER DANIEL ORCUTT Prayer is the earnest desire of the heart, ascending to God, the Author of life, and the Giver of all blessings. Our first thought, in the morning, should be a prayer of thankfulness to God, for His watchful care over us ; and through the day, our spirits should breathe forth holy desires, 'on wings of prayer.' And when night veils the earth, then, too, let us raise our voices in supplication, and commit all our burdens to One, who hath promised to sustain those who trust in Him. We can never pray too often, 'Leave us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil.' 'Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation,' was the wise command of our savior. His whole life, from childhood to the cross, was constant prayer ; and shall we not imitate Him, by putting on the whole armor of righteousness, which will alone be our safeguard ? Oft may our bark be tempest-tossed, but we need not fear; He who 'doeth all things well,' is at the helm, and will guide the faithful, over the sea of danger, to the desired haven. Have you never watched till you saw the first bright star shine through a dark cloud? prayer and watchfulness, which is the armor for the battle of life, will surely bring in sight the star of hope, dispelling the clouds of sorrow and gloom.
