Dear Editor:--I thought that you would like to know... Sonyea, N. Y., Feb. 2, 1890. Dear Editor :ï¿½I thought that you would like to know that I tried to answer some of the Bible questions that were in the Manifesto. I answered seven of them. I have been very much interested in reading the children's letters in the Manifesto. Every week the boys and girls learn verses to repeat in our Bible Class. Before we repeat our verses our teachers go through the whole lesson and ask us questions upon it. We are studying the book of Acts. One of our teachers has given us a question to study upon, it is, 'What King built him an ivory house?' Bible questions are very interesting because there is usually some beautiful story connected with them. Lena M. Soule.
