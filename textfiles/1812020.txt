PRECAUTIONS AGAINST DISEASE. Never enter a sick room in a state of perspiration, as the minute you become cold your pores absorb. Do not approach contagious diseases with an empty stomach, nor sit between the sick person and the fire, as the draft from the chimney leads the contagious influences in that direction. Always let the current of air be from you to the couch of the sick, not from the couch to you. The air of the sick chamber should be kept so fresh that there will be no perceptible difference upon coming into it from the outer air. Catholic.
