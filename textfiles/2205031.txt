To Ye Aged and Beloved John Higginson: There be now at sea... Boston, Mass., Sept. 3. 1082. To Ye Aged and Beloved John Higginson: There be now at sea a skipper (for our friend Esasias Holdcroft, of London, did advise me by the last packet that it would sail sometime in August) called Ye Welcome, R. Green was master, which was aboard a hundred or more of ye heretics and malignants called Quakers, with W. Penn, who is ye scamp at ye head of them. Ye general court has accordingly given secret orders to Master Malachi Huxtell, of ye brig Porpois, to waylay ye said Welcome as near ye Coast of Cod as may be and make captives of ye Penn and his ungodly crew, so that ye Lord may be glorified and not mocked on ye soil of this new country with ye heathen worshippe of these people. Much spoil can be made by selling ye whole lot to Barbadoes, where slaves fetch good prices in rumme and sugar, and we shall not only do ye Lord great service by punishing the wicked, but shall make gayne for his ministers and people. Yours in the bowels of Christ. 'Cotton Mather.'
