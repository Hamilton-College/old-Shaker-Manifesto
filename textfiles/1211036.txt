FOREST'S SNAKE STORY One day when I was coming up from the island, I saw a black snake. He was coiled around a tree. I was bare footed. Two other boys were with me ; they had on shoes, and each one had a hoe. When we -rere pretty near him, he began to run The other boys were afraid to touch him with their hoes, so he went home in the wall of the garden. I t )ld the boys that were with me, if I was not barefooted and if I had a hoe, perhaps, I could have killed him, but as I did not have a&gt;~y shoes on I did not kill him because I thought he might ooison me.
