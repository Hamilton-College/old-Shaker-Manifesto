THE VALUE OF A NAME. By Elder Henry C. Blinn. IS there auy value in a name aside from the work which the name has wrought out? As a religicus body we have given ourselves a name and we have thought that it represented an order of religious life. Others have seen fit to give us another name which they thought would designate us better than the one already in use. It seems that it is the good or ill fortune of many religious denominations to be provided with a name, not of their own forming; but its value to the Society depends very much upon the influence it produces in their own home and also among the children of this world from whence it came. Some of these names at first were given in derision, and upon which the Merry Andrews have played to please their silly listeners, but subsequently these same names became the honorable and honored sign of Society, which like the Sun of Righteousness arose with healing in his wings. The Primitive Church was not permitted to enjoy the simple name 'Disciples of Jesus,' but were soon laughed at as 'Nazarenes,' or men who had taken a set of vows that kept them, more or less out of society. The several forms of religious doctrine that have followed in the order of time have shared the same experience. The Holy, Apostolic, Catholic Church, is known as the Roman Catholic, and another Holy, Catholic Church is known as King Henry's Church. The Methodists were known by the name of Ranters, and the Baptists as Dippers, while the more quiet and humble Friends are universally known as Quakers. Our Church name, so significant of the religious life that we have accepted 'United Society-of Believers' has been largely laid aside and that which was brought forward by the enemies of the cross of the Christ, is now our accepted name before the world. But why did the sons of Belial call our gospel fathers and mothers by the peculiar name of Shakers? We may expect that those good God-fearing pioneers who loved righteousness and hated iniquity were worthy of the designation and demonstrated by their zealous forms of worship, and their quotations from Scripture that they also hated the spirit of the world, that they might become the friends of God. One of their familiar quotations was from the prophet Haggai, ii., 6.�'Thus saith the Lord of Hosts. It is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the sea and the dry land. I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory.' From the use of these Scripture quotations came the name of Shaker. It is a good Dictionary word but it has no honor of being classical. Does this say that the rabble knows better how to name a religious body appropriately than do these religionists how to name themselves? We might with all propriety ask,�What is there in a name? The Revelator, under an inspirational influence breathes forth this loving word,�'To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.' This was the beautiful promise from the spirit of God, and the new name was of inestimable value. Written as it was by the finger of God in the white stone, it became a most precious treasure. In this case the new name could not be tarnished by unclean hands, nor injured by the voice of the unregenerate heart. But religious societies are no better for the acceptance of one or more names which are used to designate them among men,�even if used with deep religious significations as Christian, Apostolic or Evangelical; nor are they the worse for being known by the opposite class of names as Heretic, Infidel or Schismatic. The good and the bad occupy, unmolested, the same pages of history, and dwell side by side in their silent homes. This strange record begins with the race of man. We have the two brothers, Cain and Abel, then Esau and Jacob and among the long list of the right and wrong we find Alexander, Peter, John and James with Judas, Nero and Attilla. Then Augustus, Henry the VIII, Napoleon, Washington and Benedict Arnold. And yet there may be great power for good in a name that has an honorable record attacht to it for deeds of mercy and love and charity in the interest of the human family and men are made better as they read or think of those who have given their lives to God for the good of mankind. Before one name it is said,�'Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess,' but with our present understanding we should suppose that the very foundations of the earth would tremble to bring this about. In this work the Shakers are at home as sons and daughters of the living God. They can have but one testimony, and that will be�Truth. Those who have any light from God, even in the least degree, should let that light shine. To neglect this duty is to fall into darkness and ultimately into death. We can take a review of the past and there read what God has designed to do in the earth. Isaiah tells us that the Lord will shake terribly the earth and that men shall cast away their idols of gold and of silver and hide themselves among the rocks through fear of the Lord. That mighty visitation will be the day of the willing and unwilling Shakers, when that only which is on a sure foundation will be able to stand. In this wonderful work that will extend throughout the whole world, those who are interested in the elevation of manhood and womanhood, whether it be in civil or religious liberty, will be denominated the friends of God, as they are the friends of humanity. They will work with and for God and by their lives of unselfishness and of honesty and of strict self-denial, they will help to shake the earth from all that fetters either the body or mind. Should we prove unfaithful to our name and to our trust, we know without a doubt, that the end is death. Nehemiah the prophet has written,�'God will shake every man from his house and from his labor that does not keep his promise,' to walk uprightly. Time only is needed to verify the truthfulness of this word by the prophet, as we are the witnesses of its fulfillment on every side. There is no escape even down to the third and fourth generation if the law of God is violated. To be called of God is not an idle story. It means active labor, and here it is,�'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind and with all thy strength,' and when this is consummated then will come that beautiful promise of God,�'To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.' Every religious denomination has a special work, which points more or less directly toward the life of our divine Teacher, and in this righteousness, will have the reward of 'well done.' Whatever this may be for humanity, we need not occupy their ground. Our lines are well drawn. Our work is distinct from all others, and our name is significant of the work which we have espoused and will be our witness before the world. If like the wise virgins we keep our lamps trimmed and burning, we may hope to find a place in the ranks of the redeemed and be able to enter into the Holy City, the habitation of our God.
