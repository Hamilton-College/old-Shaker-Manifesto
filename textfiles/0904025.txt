Being Kind to Animals The Chinese are always kind to animals, and never pun ish ; hence, a mule, that, in the hands of a foreigner, would be not only useless but dangerous to every one about it, becomes, in the possession of a Chinaman, as quiet as a lamb and as tractable as a dog. We never beheld a runaway, a jibing, or a viciou mule or pony in a Chinaman's employment; but found the same rattling cheerful pace maintained over heavy or light roads by means of a turr-r or cluck-k the beast turning to the right or left, and stopping, with but a hint from the reins. This treatment is extended to all the animals they press into their service. Often have I admired the tact exhibited in getting a large drove of sheep through narrow, crowded streets and alleys, by merely having a little boy to lead one of the flock in front; the others steadily followed, without the aid either from a yelping cur or cruel goad. Cattle, pigs and birds are equally cared for.â€” [Travels on Horseback.
