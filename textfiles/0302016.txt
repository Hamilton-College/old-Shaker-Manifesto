Hannibal, Mo., November 16,1872 Bear Brother Frederick: Please accept my thanks, and the fifty cents for ' The Shaker ' another year. I would not be without it for twice its price. Its sweet influence comes to me like angel whispers from that better land, cheering me along the sad and lonely way of life. O when may I join those ' brave conquerors,' for so you are, who battle with your own affections, and the whole army of the world's desires. God bless you for the good you are exerting. My heart is with you all. Sylvinia Jenkins
