OUR HOME. AN ACROSTIC ANNIE STEPHENS Mount of the orient, rising in grandeur, Over thy snow peaks, the sunny beams fall, Up from thy valleys the cedars are towering, Noble in beauty, majestic, and tall. Time in his onward march, left us the record, Lighted with deeds which the martyrs have done, Earnest their work, for a truth they were growing, But we must toil till an increase is won. As o'er thy hill tops the sun rose in splendor, Night stars receded from Heaven's blue arch, Over them still shines the light just as clearly, Night stars sing sweetly, as then, on their march. O ! while we're thinking of efforts of past time, Uplifting our spirits in praise for the true, Revering the martyrs whose lives were devoted, Have we not a work in the present to do ? O ! yea, we must build up the city eternal, Make ready for souls that would dwell in accord, E'en now it appears as a light to the nations, OUR HOME is exalted, the Mount of the Lord.
