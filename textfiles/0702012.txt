Watervliet, N. Y., Jan. 11, 1876 Beloved Editor Albert : In perusing the December number of your val uable missionary paper, The Shaker, I found a beautiful description of your ' Flying Visit' through some of the eastern Shaker churches; it afforded me great joy and comfort. I was so delighted with the encouraging account of the prosperity and flourishing condition of the eastern branches of our Zion, that it did my soul great and lasting good; and I mean to read and re-read it every opportunity for the same pleasure and profit. In relation to The Shaker, I think it is the greatest 'Missionary' that erer has been sent out from our Zion ; also, I think it has been very ably conducted thus far since its commencement, and with a blessed increase. I for one most heartily wish and desire its prosperity and success in future. It deserves our best wishes. J. C. Buckingham
