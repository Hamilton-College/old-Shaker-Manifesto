Unity in Diversity. Man is a progressive being, and therefore essentially imperfect. We are not perfect ourselves, and therefore we should not require perfection in others. Our various degrees of development also render each one of us different from the other. It is unwise and unjust for us to condemn others for being different from us, because we are equally different from them. If we will tolerate others in their difference from us as much as we would have others tolerate us in our difference from them, then we may live together in friendship and peace. But if we censure and abuse others because of their faults and failings, then they may treat us the same for like reason, and that would cause contention and separation. Toleration secures unity in diversity, and it will be all the more ' good and pleasant' for people to 'dwell together' in such unity, because variety is said to be 'the spice of life.'
