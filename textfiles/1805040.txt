In Memory of sister ELIZABETH GARVEY. H. R. Agnew. On the wings of the morn in the evening of life, Serenely her spirit has flown To the city above in realms of pure love, To dwell in her beautiful home. She was true to her God, true to friends here below; Sweet Purity dwelt in her soul : A glorious reward awaits her we know, Where truth everlasting unfolds. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
