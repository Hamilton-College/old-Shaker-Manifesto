THE POWER OF INFLUENCE. [Extract from a sermon by Rev. Philips Brooks.] [Contributed by Eldress Rosetta Cumings.] O this marvelousness,�this awful power that we have over other people's lives! O the power of the sin that you have done years and years ago. It is awful to think of it. I think there is hardly anything more terrible to the human thought than this�the picture of a man who, having sinned years and years ago, in a way that involved other souls in his sin, and then having repented of his sin, and undertaken another life, knows certainly that the power,�the consequence of that sin, is going on outside of his reach; beyond even his ken and knowledge. He can not touch it. You wronged a soul ten years ago. You taught a boy how to tell his first mercantile lie; you degraded the early standard of his youth. What has become of that boy to-day? You may have repented. He has passed out of your sight. He has gone years and years ago. Somewhere in this great multitudinous mass of humanity, he is sinning and sinning, and re-duplicating and extending the sin that you did. You touched the faith of some believing soul years ago with some miserable sneer of yours; with some cynical and skeptical disparagement of God, and of the man who is the utterance of God upon the earth. You taught the soul that was enthusiastic to be full of skepticism and doubt. You wronged one years ago and his life has gone out from your life; you can not begin to tell where. You have repented of your sin,�you have bowed yourself, it may be, in dust and ashes. You have entered upon a new life. You are pure to-day. But where is the skeptical soul? Where is the ruined one whom you sent forth into the world out of the shadow of your sin years ago? You can not touch that life. You do not know where it is. No step of yours, quickened with all your earnestness can pursue it. No contrition of yours can draw back its consequences. It makes life awful to the man who has ever sinned, who has ever wronged or hurt another life because of this sin, and no sin ever was done, that did not hurt another life. I know the mercy of our God, that while He has put us into each other's power to a fearful extent, He never will let any soul absolutely go to everlasting ruin for another's sin; and so I dare to see the love of God pursuing that lost soul, where you can not pursue it. But that dots not lift the shadow from your heart, or ctase to make you tremble, when you think of how your sin has outgrown itself, and is running far, far away, where you can never follow it. Thank God, the other side is true, as well. Thank God, that when a man does a bit of service, however little it may be, of that too, he can never trace the consequences. Thank God, that that which in some better moment�in some nobler inspiration, you did ten years ago to make your brother's faith a little stronger, to let your shop boy confirm and not doubt the confidence in man which he had brought into his business, to establish the purity of a soul instead of staining or shaking it, that in this quick, electric atmosphere in which we live, that t.)o runs forth. Do not say in your terror, 'I will do nothing.' You must do something. Only let Christ tell you�let Christ tell you that there is nothing that a man rests upon as lie looks back upon it when it has sunk into the past, with any satisfaction, except some service to his fellow man, some strengthening and helping of a human soul God-ward.
