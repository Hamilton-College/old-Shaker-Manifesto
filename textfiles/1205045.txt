MIXED FEEDS One of the strong points in favor of the much praised ensilage, is that animals eat it with a relish. No food, however rich it may be in food elements, will prove profitable if the farm stock cannot be made to take to it kindly. It is on this account that a mixing of feed has been so successful. Sameness palls upon the appetite—a change of diet encourages and sharpens it. A few roots cut, or better, pulped and given to the animals, will make them eat the corn fodder or cut straw with all the greater relish. Try and make a little change in the diet of the animals, even though it be only once a week, with some roots, potatoes, apples, &amp;c : it will pay, The more an animal eats, and healthily digests, the more profitable it is.—Am.
