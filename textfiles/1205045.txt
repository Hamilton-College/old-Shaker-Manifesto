Farm and Garden Ashes as a Fertilizer .—Unleached wood ashes contain all the constituents of plant food that the ordinary or worn out soil needs except nitrogen. By their chemical action, they render much of the inert nitrogen in soils available, and in that way may be said to furnish nitrogen. This is true of lime, and on this power of making nitrogen available, the greatest value of lime, when applied as a fertilizer, depends. Ashes also have a good mechanical effect upon the soil, especially heavy clay soils, which are made lighter and more porous, so that air and water circulate more freely. Ashes do not suffer waste by being washed out to the extent that is true of the mare soluable and concentrated fertilizers sold in the markets their effects are therefore more lasting.'—American Agriculturist. MIXED FEEDS One of the strong points in favor of the much praised ensilage, is that animals eat it with a relish. No food, however rich it may be in food elements, will prove profitable if the farm stock cannot be made to take to it kindly. It is on this account that a mixing of feed has been so successful. Sameness palls upon the appetite—a change of diet encourages and sharpens it. A few roots cut, or better, pulped and given to the animals, will make them eat the corn fodder or cut straw with all the greater relish. Try and make a little change in the diet of the animals, even though it be only once a week, with some roots, potatoes, apples, &amp;c : it will pay, The more an animal eats, and healthily digests, the more profitable it is.—Am.
