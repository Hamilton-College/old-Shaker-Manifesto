Whoso labors for his own... Whoso labors for his own, Casting not a thought abroad Is but level with the drone In the service of the Lord. Christian duties reach afar, To the utmost of our strength And no less our labors are, Than of giving all at length. Both the beggar and the prince Share the Father's kindest love; Just as loyal to the first, As the latter we should prove. M. Whitcher.
