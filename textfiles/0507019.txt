Beloved Eldress Antoinette : Having enjoyed the luxury of feasting on the savory contents of the excellent paper, Shaker and Shakeress, I think it but just to try to render something to add to its columns. I have been much edified in perusing the soul utterances of my dear Gospel Brothers and Sisters who have thoughtfully contributed to the union feast, and would express thanks to every one for the same. I was specially interested in reading the beautiful production from the pen of that consecrated 'Mother in Israel,' Eunice Bathrick, in the May number. Such breathings diffuse spiritual life and true soul inspirations which must do good, having been produced from long experience in the blessed higher life. May we aim to copy her living example, and heed her wise exhortation to ' Zion's daughters,' thus preserving the unity of the spirit, and be able to do good and help others less favored. Abundant thanks to the managers of the Shaker and Shakeress for your evident pains-taking to gather and prepare wholesome food, not only for the immediate guests who have been'called in to sit with you at the table in a spiritual order, but for the multitudes as well â€” those who are still on the earth plane. May you be blessed and strengthened in yonr arduous duties and many burdens in the labor of enlightening souls, and opening to their understanding the distinction of the spheres, earthly and heav.enly, and how to attain unto the latter, is the sincere and earnest desire of your sister.
