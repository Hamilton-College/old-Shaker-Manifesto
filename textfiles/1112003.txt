TO LEBANON G. N. P. GALE In that remote, secluded glen, Far from the restless world, My spirit joys to find itself With pinions wide unfurled. To revel 'mid fair nature's charms, And from her boundless store Cull flowers of beauty whose perfume Inspires me more and more. Pure are the lessons she imparts, Affectionate and kind ; Sweet peace and thankfulness her joys, In greatful hearts enshrined. Vast, solemn, silent mountains round, In pompous grandeur rise, To kiss and woo the fleecy clouds, And commune with the skies. Their graceful blooming slopes display Rich gorse and purple heath,â€” Save where the golden wheat waves high In smiling fields beneath. And far below, deep in the glen, Are stalwart lab'ring hands Gathering the precious fragrant herbs, Among the Shaker bands. Their voices borne on zephyr's wing, Ring up the steep hill sides, And tell how many a Shaker suit A noble spirit hides. O active toilers, that unbar Earth's undeveloped store; May you unfailing harvest reap Of heaven's yet richer ore. Believe not that the worldly rich Are happier than you, Their wants are legion, and their cares ; Your wants and cares are few. Heaven help all willing, working hands, And aye, will aid and cheer All who strive well to aid themselves, Whate'er their station here. Let each his duties on life's stage Industriously fulfill; In love and labor trust, and wait, Obedient to His will. Then in this calm enchanting glen, As in the city's glare, All may be happier if they will But seek Heaven's love to share. St. Catharines, Ont.
