Harvard, Mass. June, 1894. In consequence of the removal of our good Elder Andrew Barrett, whom we all greatly miss, to his first beloved home at Mt. Lebanon, the Society at Harvard was not represented in June Manifesto. Our beloved Eldress Ellen Greene is at Mt. Lebanon on a visit to recuperate her health. The cold, wet May gives promise of a good hay crop. In June we hope the weather will cease its erratic behavior and return to its accustomed genial habits. Crops in general are looking finely, gardens flourishing and early peas nearly ready for the table. Strawbenies begining to ripen. Milk, our present staple, has increased very much since the return of good pasturage. Farm work progressing finely. Some important improvements in the way of re-shinclinr, painting and repairing generally, keeping all hands busy. In doing our part to make life pleasant, we can with confidence look for a blessing. We are well pleased with the article in March and April Manifestos on Agriculture. Hope to hear more on the subject. All boys should learn this all important science and it would not hurt girls to understand gardening and fruit culture. Mar Ma M. Bk'UitI.
