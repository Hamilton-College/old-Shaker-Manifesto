Agricultural Broom-Corn Seed .— An exchange states that the seed of broom-corn, which has hitherto been considered useless except for planting, and an inferior article of food for cattle, has been discovered to be valuable as a breadstuff. It was first used as a substitute for wheat in 1870 and 1871, but, like many other good things, was lost sight of, and its manufacture was never carried to success, and never became even particularly known until about three years ago. The yield of flour is about one-half in place of two-thirds from wheat. The bran is also as valuable as wheat bran as a food for animals. The flour cannot be told from wheat flour, and the bread, cake, etc., is delicate, inviting and delicious, and easily digested. The yield of broom-corn seed is also enormous, a single spear often producing a pint of seed, and the yield has reached five hundred bushels to the acre, while it is safe to estimate the average at one hundred bushels. Covered Yards for Cattle .— American farmers for the most part have yet to learn the value of a covered yard for their stock. There are many days in the year when cattle could be turned into such a yard, that would otherwise be condemned on account of the weather to stand all day in the stable. The roof would prevent all waste of manure from washing, and would make the yard so cleanly and 'comfortable that the animals could lie down. In this country, where wood is cheap and almost every man sufficiently handy to be his own carpenter, we are convinced that farmers have only to see the advantages of such yards to adopt them at once.
