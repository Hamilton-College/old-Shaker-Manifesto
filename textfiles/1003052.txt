Covered Yards for Cattle .â€” American farmers for the most part have yet to learn the value of a covered yard for their stock. There are many days in the year when cattle could be turned into such a yard, that would otherwise be condemned on account of the weather to stand all day in the stable. The roof would prevent all waste of manure from washing, and would make the yard so cleanly and 'comfortable that the animals could lie down. In this country, where wood is cheap and almost every man sufficiently handy to be his own carpenter, we are convinced that farmers have only to see the advantages of such yards to adopt them at once.
