LITTLE TEMPTATIONS. Ernest Pick. 'Here lies the chief temptation to wrong. To tell a small untruth, to utter a little word of unkindness, to cheat in some very unimportant matter�these are the real temptations of life which beset us.'�Self-Culture. T. F. Clarke. How my soul yearns for consolation, what a thronging and pushingdesire for the millennial state of mankind I experience ! What a mixture of joy and grief, strength and weakness, doubt and assurance the inner life of a man is, who has forsaken all of tin1 world and the flesh and who has crossed the threshold to the kingdom of man divine. How expressive and intelligent, strengthening and consoling is the assurance that forever we shall be guided onward and upward to the right a.s long as we are true to the divine monitor, conscience, which speaketh loud and admonishes and advises faithfully, constantly and unmistakably. How faint yet positive the voice is in dilliculties which former experience has not encountered yet, or in affairs close to the boundary line of wrong and right, wrhen the least step either leads into the kingdom of right or into the anarchy of wrong. How unfailingly follows satisfaction when ours was the right step, how inevitable remorse, when wrong. How careful and prayerful, trusting and full of faith should we be, not once to suppress this monitor which the more it is obeyed, the quicker and louder it becomes till- the truly redeemed steers his life-boat safely through life's ocean, whereas when once disobeyed the voice is but faintly heard the next time, and will be missed entirely after repeated disregards. Often do I wish to find a talisman which forever may protect me and be a never failing guide in sudden emergencies, a support and strength in times of sickness, excitement, weakness, doubt and temptation ; a shining light when our.life's journey brings us in contact with strangers, or our way leads usv into regions unexplored by our experience, a rule in all undertakings and business whenever we voluntarily leave the secure harbor and willingly face and engage in new battles and struggles to gain more good by risking the already gained for a fuller victory. And this talisman, after having accomplished all this, would be a brake on the chariot of victory, a warning friend in time of prosperity a strong opponent and drawback when success begins to dazzle our judgment or to inflame our passions. Where, then, may we find the philosopher's store which teaches us to say 'Nay,' when kindness and tender feelings flatter our vanity and selfishness ; when earthly gain and ambition, office or bodily comfort try to lead us astray from our path' of stern duty ? Where is the 'wisdom imparting strength to step out of the beaten track of custom, habit and indulgence, where the tact to oppose erring and mistaken friends and where the conviction for which we readily sacrifice home, long cherished ties of affection, beloved surroundings in order to be true to our call and mis sion of building up the Kingdom of Heaven on earth where Peace may reign and good will to men? Is it not in doing right regardless of ourselves though the heavens may fall; to resist the beginnings of evil by not touching, tasting' or handling- evil and what comes thereof and trust in God who knoweth and seeth all, that He may speed our redemption and bring us to everlasting' glory in his kingdom of righteousness and love ?
