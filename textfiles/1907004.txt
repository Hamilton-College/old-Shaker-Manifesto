THE GOLDEN SIDE. There is many a rose in the road of life, If we would only stop to take it ; And many a tone from the better land, If the querulous heart would make it; To the sunny soul that is full of hope, And whose beautiful trust ne'er faileth, The grass is green and the flowers are bright, Though the winter storm prevaileth. There is many a gem in the path of life, Which we pass in our idle pleasure, That is richer far than the jewelled crown, Or the miser's hoarded treasure ; It may be tht love of a little child, Or a mother's prayer to heaven, Or only a beggar's thanks For a cup of water given. Better to weave in the web of life A bright and golden filling, And to do God's will with a ready heart, And hands that are ready and willing, Than to snap the delicate, minute threads Of our curious lives asunder, And then blame heaven for tangled ends And sit and grieve and wonder.
