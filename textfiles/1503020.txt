THE EYES Never read in bed or in a reclining attitude ; it provokes a tension of the optic nerve very fatiguing to the eye-sight. An exchange says : ' Bathe your eyes daily in salt water, not salt enough, though, to cause a smarting sensation. Nothing is more strengthening, and we have known several persons who, after Tising this simple tonic for a few weeks, had put aside the spectacles they had used for years, and did not resume them, continuing of course, the oft-repeated daily use of saltwater.' Never force your eye-sight to read or work in insufficient or too broad light. Reading with the sun upon one's book is mortally injurious to the eyes. Selected.
