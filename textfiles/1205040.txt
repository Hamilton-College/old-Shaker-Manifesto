The Oleander .—All parts of the oleander are deadly. A very small quantity of the eaves have been known to kill a horse. The lowers have produced death in those persons who have earelessly picked and ate them. The branches divested of their bark and used is skewers, have poisoned the meat roasted on hem, and killed seven out of twelve people who partook of it.—Southern World.
