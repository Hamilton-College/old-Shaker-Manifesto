THE DIVINE INMOST. Oliver C. Hampton. 'He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.' Psa. xci., 1. This is one of the most sublime, poetical and profound passages in the Bible. Deep proving and self-sacrifice alone will enable the Zion traveler to find this 'secret place of the Most High' and enjoy the invulnerable peace and safety thereof. The road of selfabnegation and sorrow, and' sincere devotion to the good and happiness of other? may not seem very pleasant to the beginner in this search for the 'secret place of the Most High,' but will grow more and more bright and consoling the farther we progress in it. And when one has once found this 'secret place,' this everlasting rest, no possible variety of conditions, circumstances or external locality can evermore disturb the peace and serenity thereof. Only get once beneath this 'shadow of the Almighty' and nevermore shalt thou O fainting, trembling mortal, 'hunger or thirst, or the sun (of the scorching desert of sorrow and adversity) light on thee, nor any heat.' For that benevolent Hand under whose shadow thou hast gathered i.s able at any and all times, to satisfy all thy wants and gratify all thy Heavenly desires and holy aspirations forever. But what and where is this 'secret place of the Most High,' this 'shadow of the Almighty?' Jesus said 'The Kingdom of Heaven is within you,' and also that it consisted of 'righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.' And Paul inquires who shall ascend into Heaven or descend into the deep to bring down Christ or bring Him up, but declared Him to be nigh to us, evea in our hearts�that Word, which the Apostle John declared was in the beginning and 'was with God and was God.' If God and Christ be in our hearts the Kingdom of Heaven must be there. In every individual, there is an inner recess, a Divine Inmost, in fact a region of infinite depth of spirit which has been explored but a very little ways by even the most spiritually minded, and not at all by a vast majority of man kind. The portals thereof, remain closed to millions of mortals during their entire life on the eai'th. The vestibule thereof is far, far beyond all the rudimentalisms of this mundane existence. Occasionally bright gleams from this throne of bright Glory are recognized by those far advanced in spiritual development. After the agonies and deep proving of Job, (this story of Job is one of the most true and beautiful allegories ever written) among other of his remarkable sayings is the following� 'There is a path which no fowl kuoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: The lion's whelps have not trodden it nor the fierce lion passed by it.' Job. xxviii., 7, 8. Every spiritual experience though painful and proving, leads us nearer to that halcyon abode. No sin, sorrow or sickness ever penetrated to its hallowed confines. 'No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon ; it shall not be found there ; but the redeemed shall walk there.' Isa. xxxv., 9. 10. 'The ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads ; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall 'flee away.' This region of everlasting rest from the sins, shams, and sorrows of this rudimental world is in us al!, and accessible to every sincere seeker thereof. It is the microcosmic habitation of our Ileaveuly Father and Mother to all intents and purposes and on the same plan, that they have for their habitation, the great macrocosm. But the condition of accession is a complete surrender of our rudimental self which we are to sacrifice wholly to the benefit and comfort of others. We cannot do this without being fully organized, and in systematic arrangement. This organization implies an enlistment under a banner recognizing the greatest good to the greatest number. This can be reached in no way only by obedience to that law of the Universe by which 'the less is blessed of the better.' This is best represented by what Believers term '�The visible order of God.' it is, however, only visible by its practical results. (Spirit, ord-T, faith, grace, love, wisdom, &amp;c, are all invisible entities.) This visible order is made manifest on earth by what are called Ministry, Elders, Trustees, Deacons, Members. Obedience to this order in our daily life will finally, beyond all possible peradventure land us all upon the serene shore of that inner region of eternal peace, indicated by the quotation at the head of this article, and it shall be found 'that a man (and a woman as well) shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest, as rivers of water in a dry place, and as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.' Isa. xxxii., 2. Union Village, 0.
