Beloved Elders: I address you all unitedly as one, because I have reason to believe you have one Faith, one Lord, and one Baptism; and that you are unitedly striving, according to your several gifts, to build up the cause of Truth, Purity, and Holiness among your fellow-beings. And such as can truly appreciate your labors of love, and the deep solicitude you feel for an increase into the higher life of all souls committed to your charge, cannot but love, respect and reverence you, for your work's sake. Not as lords over God's heritage, but as examples to the flock, in meekness and Christ-like humility. The world are accustomed to bow To men of ambition and pride ; But who shall be reverenced now, The Gospel alone must decide ; For he that would stand in the lead In this Dispensation, must know, That he is the greatest, indeed, Who is the most humble and low. That you, beloved Elders, may have health and strength to perform the many arduous duties devolving upon you, and be the faithful medium through whom the Divine Spirit may bring many souls to feel the blessings of this heart-cleansing, sin-consuming work, and be your Epistle read and known of all men, is the sincere desire and prayer of your aged brother, Richard Bushnell, (near 82 years of age.)
