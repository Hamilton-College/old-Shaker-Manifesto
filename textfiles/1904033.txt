HUMILITY. Ada Wayne. There are many precious gifts and graces of the spirit, which beautify and adorn the true followers of Christ. Among them all, none is more conspicuous in its effects on the life and character of the individual, than the spirit of humility. Before we can make this virtue our own, there is a work to do to divest ourselves of worldly pride, ambition, jealousy and envy; then we make room in our hearts for the indwelling of humility* it cannot find a place where sin abounds. It is the faith of the true Believer in Christ's second appearing, to bow in submission to the will of God as manifested in a visible lead, and to be humble and teachable. Humility leads us to see our errors, and to confess and forsake all our sins; in this way we may grow in newness of lifey, and find a spiritual travel in the regeneration. The meek and lowly Jesus set us a beautiful example to follow; his life was one of humble and self-sacrificing service to mankind. I want to feel that I am truly his disciple; not vain and self-exalted, but humble in heart, striving each day to do all the good I can. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
