Faults Faults.â€”Do not attempt to cover your faults, but try to get rid of them. Every person does wrong at times, and confession is no new thing in this world. One must own that all is not right, or become ridiculous as well as hypocritical. Other people will see, whether we try to blind them or not; and just for what we are worth will they value us. Let us all be honest, no matter what else we may be, and not pretend to be better than we are.
