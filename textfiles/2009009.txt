'Grain by grain the treasure's won, Step by step the race is run.' M. J. Tatterton. It is one of the mistakes of frail humanity to seek for immediate results without observing the steps which are needful for their attainment. In secular or spiritual pursuits it is by the patient climbing, so to speak, that the coveted goal is reached. As the poet has clearly defined, 'Heaven is not reached by a single bound, But we build the ladder by which we rise, From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies, And we mount to its summit round by round.' Our Savior declared that he who would be greatest must begin by being the servant of all. Before honor is humility ; and he who fails to be humble will also fail to possess true honor. It is those who are faithful over a few things who are willing to learn the initiatory lessons, that are made rulers over many things ;ï¿½or in other words heirs of the spiritual kingdom. Canterbury, N. H.
