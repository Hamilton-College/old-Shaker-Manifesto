CULTIVATION. By Andrew D. Barrett. MAKE home life attractive. We are an active people and unless our active spirits are filled to satisfaction there may be a tendency to warp from home life. It is the duty of every one to make home life interesting. There are burdens and responsibilities that should engage the attention of all, and there should be a willingness of spirit on the part of each one to accept these burdens. If the kingdom of heaven is to be within us, should it not work out, in our daily life? By all means have our interest greatest among our own Brethren and Sisters. Speak words of kindness to every one, in the home. Let every one be counted as a friend and give to every one the best attention we can. Kind words cost but little and yet they are valuable if brought into daily use. Good and gentle manners help wonderfully in the duties of life. Let us look on the bright side as this makes home pleasant. If it rains to-day, there may be sunshine and a blue sky to-morrow. It takes no more breath to laugh, than it does to groan. If we have a sorrow to-day, let us watch for joy to-morrow. Nobody ever looks for a grievance without find- 62 THE MANIFESTO. ing it. Be a man and resolve to conquer yourself. We will starve our troubles ; give them nothing to feed upon, no brooding thought, no morbid sympathy, and when they are buried, roll a great stone over the grave and start again. The duties of home life are many, and if we carry the sunshine of God's goodness in our faces we shall bear these burdens cheerfully. We have no right to inflict our woes upon Society. Troubles are like snow-balls, they gather strength and size as they go until some day we are crushed beneath their weight. If we think we are ill used there will be plenty of collateral evidence to prove it. Let us beautify and grace our home with our best faculties. This is my offering. Ayer, Mass.
