Enfield, N. H. Sept. 1896. Litekattjre, divested of vulgarity and moral insipidity, is one of the potent factors that inspire mortals to right living. Well may we be led to reflect that human beings are much like novels, being lined with elevating or degrading influences. But should the dots of evil and dashes of greed be left uncorrected? How valuable to society are those 'living epistles of righteousness,' whose examples intelligently show why virtue pays. Whose life chapters sMne with a godly light; Teaching lessons of truth o'er might; Lessons which tell of the Infinite plan, Heaven, not gained by faith in man; But from the force of spiritual strife, Is found the bliss of Heaven's life. On the evening of August 24th we were entertained by our friend Hon. Thomas Savage of Maplewood, First Lieutenant of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Co. of Mass. He gave an interesting recital of his trip to England with his fellow company. During the past two months, parties of two and four have been making occasional berry excursions; the results of which have been the securing of twelve bushels of blueberries and about eighteen bushels of blackberries. Twenty barrels of pickles and one ton of beet seed have been prepared for market. Artist Autumn has commenced his grand work of tinting the foliage which helps to make our locality, 'Beautiful indeed for habitation.' George II. Baxter.
