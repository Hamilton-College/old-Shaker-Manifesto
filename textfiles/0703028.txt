Baltimore, Md., Feb. 27, 1877 J. E. W.â€”My loving Friend: It has been nearly a year since I received your kind and affectionate letter. I am somewhat advanced in years, and quite out of the habit of writing; and on this account I have put it off from time to time, waiting a more convenient season. Please forgive me for my unfaithfulness. Your letter was received with thankfulness, and has been read over and over again with much interest. I do not feel worthy to be called a sister by one of God's chosen witnesses, as I have not lived a true Shaker life, although I fully believe in the doctrine, and have great joy in believing it to be the true and everlasting gospel. I thank God that he has prolonged my life to see the millennial day. I joy to see the little paper flying through the earth, going out from the new heaven with its leaves laden with 'good news ' and good laws, both for the body and mind. These maybe the leaves spoken of in scripture, that should be for the healing of the nations. The good health which I have enjoyed for several years I owe in a great measure to the comforting influences which I have received through those precious leaves. How happy I would be to assist in anything to help promote the great and glorious work. When the little Shaker reaches me with its cheering words so full of sympathy and love, it dispels the gloom and cheers the heart. I am even now anxiously waiting its arrival. Remember me in your prayers. Yours sincerely, C. E. B. I inclose one dollar to pay for the paper for 1877, and the balance may be retained to aid in doing deeds of goodness. C. E. B.
