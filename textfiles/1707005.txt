THINGS WORTH CONSIDERING. IDA A. THOMAS. I would bring my soul nearer to God that I might be a partaker of His unbounded goodness, knowing through Him and His ministering angels I have been gifted with faith which if obeyed will support me through all trials. Many times when weighed down with trouble and grief and looking about for that soul craving something I have found comfort in the faith given, that omnipotent power surging within my soul which holds firmly within the bounds of love and duty. Beautiful gospel I love thy principles, and all the true and noble souls who live and carry them out; to such I would gather closely that I may gather new life and strength ; with this support I can with many valiant soldiers in the battle more courageously meet the foe. I love the hour of worship when in union with my Brethren and Sisters I can come forth and worship God freely in spirit. Our body could not exist without its natural food and it is just as essential that the soul be fed with spiritual food to keep it alive and quickened and I want to be constantly kept awake knowing I am doing my duty; that I am pleasing and not grieving the good spirits around me, and when I feel grieved or tried in spirit to bend at the mercyseat in prayer that I may receive new strength to take up my cross anew. To all honest souls I know a helping hand will be extended and the light of everlasting truth will stand plainly revealed before them. For truth alone will stand forever. I will take new courage and press on more bravely with my Brethren and Sisters, I know the way of the cross is the way to salvation. Jesus says if you would be like me take up your daily cross and follow me. I am willing to forsake all, to crucify a worldly nature that I may dwell in, and know the everlasting joy and peace of the spirit. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
