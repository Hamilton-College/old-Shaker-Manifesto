Alfred, Me. October, 14, 1889. Beloved Editor ��Your correspondent from this place in Sept. No. of the Manifesto says that twelve buildings have been painted. It should have been twenty. We find it costs less to paint the buildings once in five or six years, than to wait lunger. From eighteen acres of sweet corn, planted, we carried to Ihe Corn Factory, r.ine hundred dollars worth of corn in the hus-k. Four and one half acres of light soil, which yielded but half a ton of hay to the acre, gave us forty-five dollars worth of corn per acre with no manure, except 700 lbs. of Buffalo Phosphate to the acre. From this corn planted, we had more than one hundred tons of silage, which we consider is worth at least four dollars per ton, in the silo. When I tell you that the corn, and six acres more of potatoes and other hoed crops, were planted, cared for and harvested by our own Brethren, without any hired men, and also that one hundred and thirty tons of hay were put into the barns, you will say that they deserved the blessing that attended their labors. [Believers in eyery Society, will say, God bless those Brethren. It is a beautiful record. Ed.] Have had but light frosts, the grass is still green. Your Brother, J. B. Vance.
