Cure for Dandruff .â€”The Journal of Pharmacy asserts that a preparation of one ounce of sulphur and one quart of water, repeatedly agitated during intervals of a few hours,will, in a few week, remove every trace of dandruif from the scalp, and the hair will become soft and glossy. The head should be saturated every morning with the clear liquid. He says, ' I do not pretend to explain the modus operandi of the treatment, for it is well known that sublimed sulphur is almost or wholly insoluble, and the liquid used was destitute of taste, color or smell. The effect speaks for itself.'
