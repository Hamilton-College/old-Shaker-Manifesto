WHO IS CHRIST ? The sermon of On under Sen', which was preached in India, we present with great pleasure to our readers. To those who will attentively read its substance, we need not apologize for the space it occupies. It is one of the most remarkable utterances of the times ; and is certainly the most Godsend to the religious world at large of any subject we know of. Treating the query as it does, coming whence it does, and being indorsed by so many prominent periodicals—The Christian Union for instance— we must say we feel the Church Universal to be nearer the present than ever before. Christ, and the life of Christ, are foundation and Cap-stone of the union of Churches ; and just so soon as we accept Christ's life as the best ensample and religiously and faithfully live it, every barrier to the success of the Universal Church will be removed* Then will we have but ' one Lord, one faith, and one baptism; ' and then will our missionaries, sent abroad, carry in their lives the pattern Christ lived, and only then be worthy rivals of Chunder tien; but when will they teach Christ by living Christ's life ?
