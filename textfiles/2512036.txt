Books and Papers. Number in Nature, an Evidence of Creative Intelligence 'Number in Nature, an Evidence of Creative Intelligence,' is a Lecture delivered by Edward White, at New College, London, England. It is not strange that the Editor should have selected this interesting address to help strengthen his position, in cumulative evidence in favor of a Creative intelligence and in opposition to those who say, 'There is no God.' When a man dwells on the right side he is quite sure to dwell safely and feels the undoubted assurance in his own mind. The many illustrations drawn from mechanism, from chemistry, from astronomy as well as from vegetation and from the plumage of birds, are each and all wonderful steps of in. telligence that lead up to God. Send for this little work at a price of only five cents and read this beautiful lesson of Creative Intelligence. H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
