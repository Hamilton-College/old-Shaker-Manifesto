UP AND DOWN In deep silence, quietness, and profound meditation — feeling after God — by sympathizing with all things in the natural world, commencing with man, as the head of the animal kingdom; descending through the vegetable to the unorganized mineral kingdom of Nature, is looking downward. While commencing and sympathizing with unbodied men and women — spirits, angels, cherub and seraph, who intervene between man and Deity, is looking upward. For unorganization is down; perfected organization is up.
