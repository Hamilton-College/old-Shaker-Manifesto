Canning Vegetables Peas and beans may be prepared for canning by simply cooking them as you would for the table, leaving out the seasoning, and filling the cans quite tup to the top while boiling hot. Have the peas and beans rather young and tender. Add the seasoning when you open the cans to use them. Keep them in a cool, dark place, free from dampness. Corn, to can, should be young and tender, but full grown. Strip off the outside leaves and silk, but leave on the inner leavesâ€”this will keep the sweetness in. Let it boil fifteen minutes. Take it up, cut the kernels through the middle, and then off the cob. Pack your cans as full as you can with the corn, and then take a cob that will fit in the jar without its being broken, and press it into the middle of the corn, and screw the tops on. Have the cans and the corn as hot as possible. Country Gentleman.
