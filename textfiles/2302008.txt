ELDER DANIEL BOLER. After a short confinement, Elder Daniel Boler, who has been head of the Shaker Communities for more than half a century, quietly passed away at seven minutes past six o'clock on the morning of the 11th. instant. He has left the burdens and cares of his important and responsible position to his successor, Elder Joseph Holden. Elder Daniel passed a useful life. But few�very few�of the denizens of this earth sphere have ever passed through it, from the cradle to the grave, leaving such a gracious record. He was not of the world, for when only ten years of age he was called out of the world, as Jesus was called out of it when young. To the public generally he was not a great and showy man. His name was not blazoned forth by the press, nor eulogized by orators; yet he was the senior Elder of the whole Shaker Order, consisting of seventeen Societies of the Believers in Christ's Second Appearing in the female order, as its first appearing was in the male order, through Jesus. We may almost say of Elder Dan'el THE MANIFESTO. 37 that 'his life was hidden with Christ in God.' It was indeed from the public gaze, for he was a quiet, unostentatious, peaceable, home Brother. He was best beloved by those the most like him. These knew him intimately and they knew personally that he was 'a man to be wondered at.' A man who, by self-control and self-denial, had conquered self, subdued pride and ambition, and extirpated lust. He was pure in heart and in thought. He was an overcome!1, being 'arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, the righteousness of the saints.' He was a pillar in the Eesurrection Temple, to go no more out forever, whether in or out of the earth body. In Elder Daniel's life and character was written the 'new name, the name of his God and of the City of his God,�the New Jerusalem, which is coming down from God, out of Heaven to earth.' That city has been formed by human beings ceasing to do evil in all things, temporal and spiritual, whilst yet on earth. For more than sixty years, Elder Daniel has been a Leader, and such a leader as filled his followers' ideal of what the Nazarene was ; of him who said : ' 'The works that I do ye shall do also, and greater works than these shall ye do,' for better conditions would be theirs than Jesus had been placed under. To the twelve disciples, Jesus was God incarnated. But Elder Daniel has had more than twelve hundred disciples, who believe that the Christ spirit was incarnated in him. They were the 'little flock,' whom he led in virtue's ways of pleasantness and peace. The great, busy world will not miss him ; but he will be missed very much by the little flock, to whom he has been as a sun of righteousness; for they had personal knowledge of his real character and believed in their hearts that he was a Savior who had come upon Mount Zion to judge the Mount of Esau�the natural man� beginning with Daniel Boler. One writer has said that, 'there was a great deal of Heaven in being in Hell with those you love, and a great deal of Hell in being in Heaven with those you do not love.' Hence the wisdom of the new commandment: that ' 'Ye love one another.' Shakerism Is a unique institution. Progress is its motto. But there can be no progress without change, and change is always a trying process, whether to an individual or to a system. We anticipate seven stages of progress, through which the successive classes of Shakers will pass during their travel toward the final stage when God will be all in all. The people will see eye to eye, and all will know truth, from the least to the greatest, not knowing mediators to say, 'Know the Lord !' During the life-time of Elder Daniel, marvelous changes have taken place. The gospel has been passing from the first into the second of the seven cycles. It has been a continuous struggle between the old and the new. Fifty years ago, Shakers, as a people, like the world from which they had been gathered, ignored hygiene and physiology ; diet and ventilation, drainage and bathing, had but little attention. The flesh of animals, from fish to swine, formed the basis of eating. 38 THE MANIFESTO. and exposers. rulers of the Alcohol, in some of its varied forms, from 'a nice cordial' to clear whiskey and brandy, including cider, was the basis of drink. Tobacco was used by all, from the Ministry and Elders, to proselytes and the stranger within the ers gates. Sickness, 'having no cause,' the was common, being regarded as providential and to be cured by prayer, without fasting. The sicker the patient, the richer and more unnatural the food. The order of Doctors and nurses stood next to the Ministry and Elders in the government of the people. Sickness was well nigh unto piety. Spiritualism. the priests of The marvelous world-wide wonder are stultified. of Spiritualism had its origin in the Shaker Order. Seven years before the Rochester rappings began to attract attention, Spiritualism was in actual, practical operation throughout the congeries of Societies of Believers. It was a powerfully efficient agent in effecting the changes called for, and indispensable to the introduction of the first principles of the second cycle of progress in the Shaker Order. Without the aid of thousands of spirits, the changes that have since become firmly established in the Shaker Church would have been utterly impossible. These spirits foretold to the Shakers the advent of Spiritualism in the outside world four years before the movement began at Rochester, and its subsequent history up to the present time. They also foretold much in the future of our government, of Church and State union, now consummated in closing the World's Fair to the whole world one seventh of the time, contrary to reason, to the rights of humanity, to liberty of conscience and to the Scriptures, which they term the 'Word of God.' Spiritualism has confounded the wise, and brought to nothing its opposTime and again, old heavens�the churches,�and the statesmen in the old earth, the civil government, have put Spiritualism down as a gigantic fraud. But, as an editor has remarked, it 'did not stay put down worth a single cent.' It has brow-beaten the Babylonian priests of all denominations ; mocked, as Elijah of old mocked Baal. The statesmen Members of their own families become mediums, and their dead refuse to remain in the costly coffins and sepulchres provided for them. What can they do when such a man as Greeley becomes 'entangled in the meshes of Spiritualism?' To Shakerism, Spiritualism has introduced Vegetarianism, Prohibition, Anti-Tobacco, Peace, non-resistance, Divine Revelation adapted to the present needs of humanity, Celibacy as being the true Resurrection, and Community of Goods, of Education and of Labor, teaching us that 'Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them,' to love one another with a pure heart fervently, and thus fulfill the law of the Christ Spirit.
