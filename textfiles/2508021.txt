Sabbathday Lake, Me. July, 1895. The historic day of which we promised to tell you in the last Manifesto, is now of the past: The Dedication of the Maine State Building, and the Centennial of the Kickers in Poland. As the preparations were not completed, the event was postponed until Monday. July 1st. It was a perfect day, so much so that it seemed to have been made for the occasion. Some of our people were present as we received a kind invitation. The principal speakers were our two State Senators, Hale and Frye. In the course of his speech Sen. Hale apostrophized the building and said to it: 'Stay right where you are and thank the Lord that you are out of Chicago. You ought to feel like a man who has just emerged from an election riot in the lower streets of New York City and has launched himself into the placidity of a Shaker meeting here in the state of Maine.' All the buildings were decked with red, white and blue burning; flags floated in the breeze while the band played the national airs at intervals. The time occupied by the speeches was two hours. The guests were then served with a sumptuous, free dinner, the menu for which cost the proprietors $87.00. We fared with the rest and also made good sales. The half of home interests and blessings can not be told, but the links of love and gospel friendship forged in our little eastern Society, help to strengthen and lengthen the chain of our union which encompasses all our Zion homes.
