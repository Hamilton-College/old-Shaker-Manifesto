PAUL OR CHRIST? Lillie E. Barr. ' I suffer not that any woman teach, Or bear the message of the Lord's good-will. Let her keep silence, she hath no call to preach, 'Tis hers to learn and modestly sit still,' Thus the Apostle. Yet the risen Lord, Waiting beside the newly broken tomb, Fo- messenger to send with his first word Unto the Church within that upper room, Chose but a woman with a loving heart Oh! fair her feet with these glad tidings shod ' I am arisen, and I now depart And go unto our Father and our God.' Did Christ make some mistake that first by her The truth and light of Resurrection shone? He, Mary chose to be his messenger, Would Paul have sent St. Peter, or St. John Selected.
