Dear children: Our good Enfield brother... Ayer, Mass., Nov. 1880. Dear Children:- -Our good Enfield brother has given you rich and valuable advice. To this I will add a few words. ' Order is Heaven's first law. ' It is wisely written, ' Have a place for everything, and everything in its place. ' We hear it said, ' Where there is no order, there is no God. ' Having the privilege, at one time, in a short call, of looking upon your pleasant faces, in your own beautiful home, I thought I would send this to you. You may rest assured, dear children, that nothing can so greatly enhance your happiness, as well as that of others, like this beautiful gift. It is a bright, guiding star, at whatever post of labor you may be called. In possession of this, I will insure success in all your efforts. While I make all due allowance for others who have not been blessed, like myself, in the days of childhood, I rejoice that I learned obedience. Nothing will so beautify the soul for time and eternity as obedience in righteousness. Your sister, Martha A. Carr.
