West Pittsfield, Mass. Sept. 1894. We seek a place in the Social Corner as we were not represented therein last month. Our good father, Elder Albert, has just completed the work of painting the windows of our large dwelling. To put two coats of paint on one-hundred and twentyfive window sashes is a great task for one of his advanced years. Hay and grain harvest closed early this season with an average crop. 2,300 bushels of oats were cut, threshed, and stored, away at our grist-mill by the 14th of Au- THE MANIFESTO. rs; gust with the straw all mowed away in the barns. Potatoes prove a good crop. Over six hundred bushels are now secured, and there may be two hundred more bushels. Apples and pears are improved very much; some of our best variety of pear trees, such as the Beurre de Anjon, Beurre Boss, Louie Bonne, and the Duchesse de Angonleme are loaded with fruit. Oh, the weather; well what advantage can one derive from complaints of it? It is true, we have had some dry weather of late, and it was just the right time to make some necessary repairs on our reservoir. The new flume, twenty ft. in hight, and built of Georgia pine was finished last week. Twelve men, six horses, and two yoke of oxen are employed in taking earth from one side of the pond, and carting it to the banks to make them higher. This work was commenced Aug. 13th, with no lost time from rainy weather at this date. They hope to finish by the last of this month. This will add storage room for about two million gallons more water. On the 23rd ult. thirteen persons from this Society enjoyed a very pleasant outing with our dear friends from Lebanon, N. Y. Left home at 6 o'clock a. m., met them at Chatham N. Y., and went on to Kinderhook picnic grounds, where they spent a happy day in rowing on the lake&gt; singing the sweet songs of Zion, and renewing of gospel union in genial conversation. The efforts made by good Elder Daniel, Eldress Anna, Br. Ernest, and others, to make the time pass pleasantly for all, will long be gratefully remembered. On August 6th loved Sister Matilda Reed spent the day with us. We love to have such mothers come to usthey always leave a blessing. We felt that she was a fit representative of her in whose footsteps she has so faithfully walked and of whose stepping upon American soil, this day was the anniversaryMother Ann Lee. Would that she had ten thousand as faithful daughters. Emoretta Belden.
