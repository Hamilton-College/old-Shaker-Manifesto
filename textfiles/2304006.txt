LIBERALISM. Alonzo G. Hollister. Is it liberal, philosophic, or intelligent, to test spiritual and metaphysical subjects by physical standards, in order to stultify and invalidate their teachers, to make them appear worthless, or to shirk the labor necessary to clearly apprehend them? Is that the true method of progressive thinking? 86 THE MANIFESTO. To illustrateï¿½In pure mathematics, each word is a sign of one thought, or idea, and of one only. The words one, two, three, applied to numbers, and square, circle, cone, applied to geometric figures, have each but one meaning, and hence never suggests but the one idea for which it is the sign. But the very nature of spiritual and metaphysical ideas, compels their representation, often, by words used as signs for natural objects, and hence arises the use of figurative and symbolic language. Is it candid, and the mark of a truth seeker, to ignore this property of language, or to construe it falsely, in order to invalidate spiritual ideas clothed in such language, because the ideas are distasteful to the natural man, or to stultify the wisdom and character of the teacher; because said teacher does not conform his instruction and practice to the ordinary course of this world ? An inspired Apostle of Jesus, described a two-edged sword that goeth forth out of the mouth. All know that material swords do not go forth from the mouth. But the testimony of truth, proceeding from the mouth of one who lives it, does slay error that gets in the way of it, and hence its likeness to a material sword with which men slay each other. Now as Jesus taught men always to bless, and never to curse each other, but to overcome evil with good, as he compared his followers to children, and to sheep for harmlessness, and sternly rebuked the use of a sword to shed blood, even in self-defense, is it just or fair to interpret him as meaning a carnal sword, when he said, 'I came not to send peace, but a sword?' Does not the peace here spoken of, refer to man's internal foes, and the sword, is it not that 'testimony of Jesus' which separates good from evil, light from darkness, truth from error, between which, no teacher that preceded Jesus, (if not Buddha,) seemed to know where to draw the dividing line. The carnal sword was already here, in so great excess of reasonable demand, as to render such reference to it, meaningless. Moreover Jesus forever rejected that, when he rejected the proffer of the kingdoms of this world through the Jewish national idea of a great military deliverer. But the testimony, 'Resist not evil, but overcome evil with good' continually, the testimony against adultery in the heart, the testimony dissolving all carnal and selfish ties, and abolishing all private ownership of property, including husband and wife-hood, was new and evolutionary, most radical and revolutionary, and pierced a tender spot. This testimony is of that spirit of truth, which Jesus declared 'The world cannot receive, because it sees her not neither knows her.' As no one knows the things of man but by the spirit of man, so no man knows the things of God, but by the spirit of God, which is one, incorruptible and holy, in all its messengers. If professed light bearers refuse to see the higher spiritual truth when it is proffered them, will they not lose the rank of spiritual teachers, even as the followers of Aristotle ceased to be world teachers, by refusing to see the THE MANIFESTO. 87 discoveries of Galileo? No blame is attachable to inability, unless it be self-induced, but perverted ability, and falsification of facts, will not aid a good cause, nor bring a desirable reward. It has become a proverb that' 'Books have souls.' Of that character is the New Testament record of Jesus and his immediate disciples, covering a space of less than forty years. What other book written by mortals, ever equaled it in the amount and quality of mental pabulum it has furnished to souls hungering for spiritual instruction? What other book of its size, contains so much truth in relation to man's moral duty, spiritual nature and destiny, with so little admixture of error? What vast numbers have been turned from error to righteousness, by conning its precious lessons, multitudes have been thereby induced to lead better lives than they otherwise would. An attempt to make Jesus responsible for all the wickedness practiced by pretenders to his name and authority, is unfair and unreasonable as would be an attempt to make virtue accountable for hypocrisy, or to make honest industry responsible for the avarice, greed, oppression and deviltry practiced to gain an undue share of its products. Those who seek the wisdom which comes from above, which is first pure and then peaceable, full of mercy and good fruits, will judge according to knowledge. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
