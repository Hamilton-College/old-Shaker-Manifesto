THE TWO FIRES In the moral and religious acceptation of the term, there are two kinds of fire. The first is the fire that swept through the first Two in the Garden and lost them Paradise, described by the immortal Milton thus—'With lust they burn.' What a pity! Are they alone in such burning? That is the fire of Hell—A hell within, of the deepest dip, is its inevitable concomitant. It is the first fire frail mortals feel. 'Albeit, that which is first is not Spiritual, but natural, and afterward that which is Spiritual.' When, by the Divine Afflatus, the germ of Divinity, in us, is roused to action, we feel another fire, for 'Our God is a consuming fire.' This is the Heaven Fire. We feel it in the marrow of our bones. We are in the Resurrection now. It must burn in us till the other fire, with all its combustibles, is consumed. It must burn till there is nothing left to hurt or destroy in all our Holy Mountain. Then will the morning stars sing together and the Daughters and Sons of God have a good time generally. Amen. Mt.
