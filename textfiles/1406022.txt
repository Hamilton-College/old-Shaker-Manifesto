MY WELCOME HOME. Who will greet me first in Heaven, When that blissful realm I gain,� When hands have ceased from toiling, And the heart has ceased from pain; When the last farewell is spoken, Severed the last tender tie, And I know how sweet, how solemn, And how blest it is to die. As my barque glides o'er the waters Of that cold and silent stream, I shall see the domes of temples In the distance brightly gleam.� Temples of that beauteous city From all blight and sorrow free ; Who from out its golden portal First will haste to welcome me? Who will greet me first in glory? Oft the earnest thought will rise, Musing on the unknown wonders Of that home beyond the skies. Who will be my heavenly mentor? Will it be some seraph bright, Or an angel from the countless Myriads of that world of light? No�not these ! for they have never Gladdened here my mortal view; But the dear ones gone before me,� They, the loved, the tried, the true; They who walked with me life's pathway From my soul by death were riven, They who loved me best in this world Will be the first to greet me in Heaven Selected.
