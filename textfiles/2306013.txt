GORMANDIZING. Count Leo Tolstoi in the July number of The New Review makes the following startling statement: 'If we begin our survey with the lowest and end with the highest strata of Society, ï¿½ it is my belief we shall find that gormandizing is the main end and object for which people live.' Speaking of many who pursue philosophy science, and even schemes of philanthropy he says: 'They merely dabble in these matters in the intervals of their real occupations, between lunch and dinner, when their stomachs are full and they can not .begin to gorge anew.' It is to be hoped that Count Tolstoi is taking quite too gloomy a view of present-day human nature; but beyond doubt most people think far too much of eating and drinking. We think it would be well for the world if such abstemiousness as Count Tolstoi's were the rule rather than the exception. He eschews both flesh-meat and intoxicating drinks, and lives in all respects in the utmost simplicity, and spends all his energy in the service of the people. 'A glutton,' says the Count, 'is powerless to do battle with his sloth, and he who is both gluttonous and slothful is powerless to check his fleshly lusts.' And he lays down this principle that 'the more a man gives to others, and the less he requires for himself, the better he is; the less he confers upon others and the more he exacts for himself, the worse he is.'
