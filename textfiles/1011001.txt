MINISTRATION OF LIGHT Watson Andrews . I will sing, for my heart is joyful now, The light of the Spirit is on my brow; The portals of heaven are all aglow, On the field of my inner sight. When the senses are still, all the passions asleep, And the sentinel angels their vigils keep, A foretaste of heaven the soul may reap, In these beautiful fields of light. How worthless, the best the world has then ; How little the greatest of mortal men; How trifling earth's fashions and forms are, when They're viewed from the fields of light. How precious the way that our Saviour trod ; How wise and benignant the councils of God; How plain and inviting the ' narrow road,' That leads to these fields of light. But when the gross passions assume the sway, And the fogs of the senses obscure the day, How dark and forbidden appears the way That leads to these fields of light. North Union, 0.
