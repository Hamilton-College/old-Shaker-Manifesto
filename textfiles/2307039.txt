Uncle Tom's Cabin A Literary Sensation. 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' has certainly 'broke loose'! The copyright on this most famous of American novels, by Mrs. Stowe, has recently expired, which frees its publication from the monopoly of the high-priced publishers, and though in anticipation of this fact they have within a few months greatly reduced its price, now that it is really 'unchained' the consequences are something surprising. John B. Alden, Publisher, of New York, issues several editions, selling them only direct (not through agents or book sellers;) one in good type, paper covers, for 5 cents, sent post-paid, or the same bound in cloth for 10 cents with postage 7 cents extra; also an excellent large type edition, on fine paper, handsomely bound in cloth for the price of 25 cents, postage 10 cents. Surely a copy of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' will soon be found in every home where it is not already. Mr. Alden sends a 32-page pamphlet describing many of his publications free, or a catalogue of 128 pages of choice books, a veritable 'literary gold mine' for book lovers, for 2 cents.
