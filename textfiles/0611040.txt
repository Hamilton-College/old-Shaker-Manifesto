The superstitious see horrid spectres and hideous phantoms in their sleep; their bewildered imagination creates tortures by which they are crushed and torn; they fancy they hear commands as dreadful as they are whimsical, and which they are constrained to obey. A superstitious person dreads his fancied God, and yet fancies that he finds refuge in his bosom. The fears derived from superstition are more causeless and stupid than those derived from any other source. Plutarch
