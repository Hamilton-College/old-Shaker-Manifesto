PEACE AND WAR. Peace is greatly the beauty of the world. War is greatly the horror of the world. Peace ne\rer grows less beautiful by consideration. Warn.ver grows less horrible by consideration. Peace is g.-ntle, patient, benevolent. War is boisterous, impatient, malevolent. Every good flourishes in time of Peace. Every evil increases in time of war. Peace is meek and modest. War is haughty and proud. Peace does good and never trumpets with loud voice its loving deeds. 'War is boastful of what it claims to have done for mank'nd and erects, with unblushing face monuments to its own remembrance and glory. Peacecontinual, universal Peacewould make the world a pai adise of beauty. Warcontinual, universal warwould make, the world a hell indeed. Let every man, woman, and child do all they can for Peace the world cannot have too much Peace. Let every man, woman, and child do all they can against warthe world cannot have too little war. Let us all read very often and carefully Christ's Sermon on the Mountit is full of peace and no war. J. II. in Messenger of Peace.
