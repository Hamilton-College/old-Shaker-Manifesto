NEVER TROUBLE TROUBLE. Fanny Windsor. My good man is a clever man, Which no one will gainsay; He lies awake to plot and plan 'Gainst lions in the way. While I, without a thought of ill, Sleep sound enough for three; For I never trouble trouble till Trouble troubles me. A holiday we never fix But he is sure 'twill rain; And when the sky is clear at six He knows it won't remain. He is always prophesying ill, To which I won't agree, For I never trouble trouble till Trouble troubles me. The wheat will never show atop� But soon how green the field! We will not harvest half a crop� Yet have a famous yield! It will not sell, it never will! But I will wait and see, For I never trouble trouble till Trouble troubles me. We have a good share of worldy gear, And fortune seems secure, Yet my good man is full of fear� Misfortune's coming sure! He points me out the almshouse hill, But cannot make me see, For I never trouble trouble till Trouble troubles me. He has a sort of second sight And when the fit is strong, He sees beyond the good and right The evil and the wrong. Heaven's cup of joy he'll surely spill Unless I with him be, For I never trouble trouble till Trouble troubles me! Selected.
