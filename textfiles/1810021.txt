PATH OF DUTY. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. All along the path of duty I am treading, Though the rock and briers pierce my feet; Yet amid the sternest trials and dangers, There are flowers blooming fresh and sweet. To the weary heart beclouded with sorrow, I would whisper of the hope within; Pointing ever to the crown awaiting, If we cling unto the cross we shall win.
