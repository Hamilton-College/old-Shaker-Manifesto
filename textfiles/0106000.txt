NOTICE! 1. The Shaker is the official Organ of the United Societies called Shakers. 2. Therefore, be it understood, that 'to owe any man aught, but love and good will,' is unbecoming a Christian, or Christian Community. No one having connection with the Societies, has any permission to run in debt; any one, therefore, trusting any member, does so at his own risk, under the discountenance of the leading authorities ; and no part of Society will be holden for debts so contracted. *
