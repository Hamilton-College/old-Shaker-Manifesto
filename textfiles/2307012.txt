Simple lessons, such as a child may learn... Simple lessons, such as a child may learn and easily comprehend are the only legitimate requisites of the gospel work, as brought to us by the great Teacher. We have no occasion to mystify that in which no mystery should ever exist. 'Learn of me,' said Jesus, 'for I am meek and lowly in heart.' Even this simple lesson in the mission of Christ is better than a volume of theology. Our Communities came into existence as the natural outgrowth of this principle of righteousness. Jesus the Christ, our loving example, was the source of inspiration that moved the hearts of those who were led to believe that in God was to be found all life, all love and all truth. To draw near to this spirit gave spiritual life, and this life inspired a love which could not otherwise than result as Jesus has so carefully taught in his lessons to the disciples. 'Thou shalt love the' Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself.' In this manifestation of the great and good news which the gospel had brought, and which as seed from the hand of the sower, was being sown in the hearts of men. All this was done in the very spirit of 'good news and glad tidings,' to that extent that 'the people heard him gladly.' It could not have been otherwise. It is in the very nature of man to be interested in that which may better his condition in this life, and enlarge his hope in the promises of an eternal growth in the world to come. Here enters the life of the Community, the 'good will to man.' So soon as Jesus had awakened a love for righteousness in his disciples, it immediately foreshadowed the growth of a Community. It came forward as naturally as does the light, on the rising of the sun. 'Cease to do evil and learn to do well,' was to be the occupation of the mind and the redeeming feature in the life of man. Nothing was said about a theologiTERMS. THE MANIFESTO. 165 cal formula, or of an antiquated creed that should fetter the mind of the Christian worker. That network of intricacies which sprang up at a later date and held such authority over the souls of men had no place in the primitive church, and it should have no place in our church. When Peter said to Jesus, 'I have forsaken all to follow thee,' what did he wish to have understood? Why should he forsake the relations in which he had a life interest, and follow in the footsteps of the Teacher unless there was a more advanced work in which to be engaged ? Why did Jesus say to the rich young man who came to him for affectionate care, 'The son of man hath not where to lay his head.' No house, no home, and not even a couch upon which to rest at night. Why should we be surprised that the young man went away in a sorrowful mood? All these lessons were used for a purpose and led directly to the communal relation, where the selfish interests that form the life of man are laid aside and the spirit of consecrated interest and universal love became the life of the people. Peter was puzzled over this subject and could not see clearly what advantage would be gained in running so great a risk; and as it was with Peter, sjo it is with the Christian church of to-day. The selfish interest comes first and then at a more convenient time comes a thought for the kingdom of God. In all probability some of us who are the communists of to-day, would be as sorrowful as the young man, if we had no place to lie down for rest at night. But as Jesus had no private, selfish home it was difficult for the selfish questioners to understand him ; and he was already giving lessons on this subject to those whom he met, in reference to a communal, consecrated interest. We have no occasion, for a moment, to raise a doubt about the eating and drinking or for the privilege to lie down to rest. His home was with his brethren, consecrated to God, and all that he had to eat or to wear or to rest upon belonged to the church of God. It was the home of a little community, and all they possessed was held in common for the good of the whole family. As the disciples gave up their selfish interests and entered into the work of loving their neighbors as themselves and began to work for the interest of the whole body, instead of working wholly for self, then each one could say as did Jesus, 'I have no place for selfish considerations.' The home belongs to God and to his children. Our homes, in like manner, must be the homes of God's children if we would have them prosper; and this can only be through our earnest prayers, and our faithful continuance in well doing as taught by the testimony of Jesus the Christ, and by the testimony of Mother Ann 166 THE MANIFESTO. and the Elders. This only can insure our safety and secure us against the influences of the world. The gospel of glad tidings should be preached, and preached far more effectually than it is at the present time, if it is expected to be heard. Mother Ann was our herald of good news, our preacher of righteousness, and our Teacher of the self-sacrificing life of Christ. Her life in God needs to be voiced with more emphasis than ever before, that her children may not lose sight of her gospel work, and wander in forbidden paths. Watching and praying is as essential at the present time, as it ever has been. One of our friends who has known the Shakers to love and respect them, and who has feared that they might be drawn aside from their gospel homes, writes as follows :ï¿½ 'It is all in keeping with the ways of the world for men to rise up as oracles in religion, in science or in literature, and demand that others should follow them. The Shakers are a good, honest people and while the Pope is all right for the Catholics, and Joe Smith for the Mormons, and George Fox for the Quakers, Mother Ann is good enough for the Shakers, and they have no need to run after other religious teachers, as they are all far below her standard.'
