Kind Words to us We have received the J uly number of the Shaker Manifesto, edited by G. A. Lomas, and published by the United Societies. Coming from such a source, it is of curious interest and not without literary ability, truth and common-sense. Among the subjects treated are 'Respiration,' by Martha Anderson ; ' Freeman's Faith,' a letter from the deluded wife of the fanatical Pocasset murderer, with Elder Evans' logical comments ; ' Philosophy of Shakerism,' by C. M. Overton ; ' Catholicism,' a reply to a Catholic priest, by H. L. Eads ; ' For the Intemperate,' etc. Shakers, New York.â€”Boston Commonwealth.
