The Preacher and Homilitio Monthly: Published by The Religious Newspaper Agency, 21 Barclay street, New York. Each month this collection of the best thoughts of a great variety of leaders of denominations comes to our table. It is one of the best means of arriving, with correct judgment, at the true status of the theological world — its decline or progress. The January number seemed more replete with good things than usual. The Manifesto meets at many homes where The Preacher would be a welcome addition. Sunday Afternoon: This is a rival of The Atlantic, to all intents and appearances ; and since the latter has chosen to pander to the tastes of the people, and lower its dignity as desired by lovers of the sensational, however untruthful, the sooner it has a successful, superior rival, to lead, not follow the people, the better. The Afternoon seems determined to give the people better mental food, and is deserving the many encomiums bestowed upon it. Send for sample copy to Merriam (inclosing 15 cents), Spring field, Mass. The Bible of the Ages, by G. B. Stebbins, is a very thoughtful book ; to any student of theology this would prove invaluable as an eye-opener. The grand cause of deadness among theologians is, it is chosen for them by their Alma Maters, that they should go it blind ; but so soon as they prefer truth to theology, then we have noble heretics like Swing, Thompson and others, whom the churches would burn if they dared. Get The Bible of the Ages and read, if you dare; for Colby &amp; Rich, of Boston, Mass., have copies to spare — price $1.50. Can be obtained at this office. Biographical Sketches of Prominent Spiritualists. The Ileligio-Philosophical Pub. House, Chicago, 111., has put in large octavo form the biographies of a dozen of the most prominent of Spiritualistic leaders. Twenty-five cents will be pretty well spent by the individual who secures a copy of this beautifully compiled book of life stories.
