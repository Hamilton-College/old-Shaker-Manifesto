'It is far more blessed to give than to receive.' ASENATH C. STICKNEY As I peruse the neatly printed pages of our ' Manifesto,' and take special cognizance of the names of its liberal contributors, I am forcibly impressed THE MANIFESTO. 13 that in this regard, as in alms-giving, 'It is far more blessed to give than to receive. ' My thoughts linger more especially upon the names and characters of our honored veteran writers who in our view justly belong to the class of the 'more blessed,' in every sense of the expression. Therefore, we the army of happy recipients feeling ourselves under great obligations to you as public teachers ask you to accept this day a tribute of gratitude for your constancy in advocating the principles of a religious truth which has sanctified and blessed your individual efforts, for so many long years. 'Venerable worthy friends ! ye come down to us from a former generation, as it were,' bringing your well-earned treasures, greeting us with your practical testimonies, and laying your precious pearls of thought, at the very feet of inexperience ; thus guiding and blessing those who should be your successors in the life and ministry of a pure, an ex- alted Christianity. Is it possible? we ask ourselves, for us to forget to love, appreciate and honor the names and characters of such representative writers. We trust not, and hereby we pledge ourselves anew to live by the precepts which you have so wisely Â«;iven. For we are witnesses that a life-time of personal practical goodness enables you to present us a genuine religion a proof of self-denial. Yea, Self-denial the only key yet fashioned to unlock to souls the mystic realm of spiritual peace wherein you dwell. May God continue to bless you as ' givers ' in His cause is our prayer.
