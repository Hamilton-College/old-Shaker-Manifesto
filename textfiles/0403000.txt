ABOUT THE MENNONITES A letter from a member of the House of Representatives, who was asked for information: ' I went first thing this morning to the Department. Results : Two years ago, U. S. consul at Odessa, addressed Interior Department. Mennonites came from Germany to Russia, the Emperor Paul promising military immunity. Present emperor threatened to withdraw this, hence Mennonites question American consul about his country. Next, last spring appeared Heller, attorney for Mennonites, and personally questioned Interior Department. Next, in October, came Mennonites in person. Cornelius Janzen, Berlin, Ontario, Canada. That's your man. He is spokesman, and will spend the winter in Ontario. Rev. John Funk, Elkhart, Indiana, knows something. I assume this, simply because Janzen visited him before he went to Canada. They [Mennonites] still speak German; have decided to settle in the United States instead of Canada. That's all they know here. So you must write Janzen, and mayhap visit him.'
