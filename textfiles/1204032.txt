Shaker Village, N. H. Everett Shaker Village, N. H. I went to the Camp with the Brethren and gathered sap. AVhen noon time comes the brethren blow a horn for the boys to come to dinner. We boys went out to play and swing on the trees. Two of us little boys had some sugar in a bucket. We had a little red, white and blue ball. It squeaked like a mouse, and then we had some dinner. Little Isaac was at home, but Albertis brought him some candy. [Age six years.]
