South Union, Ky, Sept. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry;�Your kind letter is received for which accept many thanks. The weather is cool now. We are making preserves. Have just finished the peaches, 1500 one quart, glass jars. Quinces come next and that will end that industry for this year. Farmers are fallowing for wheat the coming year. Expect to sow about 300 acres. Corn is doing well and promises abundant yield. The late rains have helped us much; other things in statu quo. H. L. E. ZSTortli Family. Sept. 8, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�In union with our Elder Sisters, Eldress Nancy and Charity, I send you a few Notes from the North Family. I am twenty-one years old and have lived here twenty-one months. I have been taught the faith of Believers and find it good. I intend to make an effort to live and die by it. By faith in God, confession of sin and obedience to gospel orders, good is gained and progress made in spiritual life. It shall be my aim to set a good example and to aid my younger companions, of whom there are eight in this family under age. Eldress Nancy is very zealous for our welfare both spiritually and temporally. We have had good crops of wheat and corn this year, and a fair crop of Irish potatoes. Plenty of vegetables, and fruit in great abundance. Of milk and butter, a large supply. We have preserved and dried for family use an unusual amount of peaches and other fruit. We have plenty of honey. Our Brethren and Sisters are promising and good spirited. E. M.
