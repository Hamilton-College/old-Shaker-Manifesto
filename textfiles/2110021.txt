How swiftly fly the wheels of time! Only a few days ago, seemingly, I wrote Home Notes for July and lo! and behold another month is numbered with the past! Have we anything to show for the march of events? Yea, surely. Our barns are well filled with the produce of the earth and potatoes are being stored for winter, which are of very fine quality. Pears are so abundant it is difficult to market them, especially since peaches glut the market of our inland city of Pittsfield. Both these fruits are very fine this year. Plums are also very plentiful, and prices range accordingly. Our tomato crop looks likely to be a failure, yet we hope to secure enough of this indispensable article to make us comfortable, insomuch as creature comforts are concerned. I am pleased with the musings of our poets O. C. Hampton and Cecelia De Vere. There are other gifted writers who contribute occasionally for our edification to the columns of the Manifesto; my thanks to each and all who feel an interest in making our paper a vehicle for Shaker thought and the intercommuning of the various Churches, located in the several states of the Union. Surely, we as a people should feel as much solicitude in sustaining our little Periodical for spreading the truths of Shakerism as other religious bodies are, in propagating their views of God and Christ and what constitutes Christianity. On Aug. 26, a party of eight Sisters and seven Brethren from our home went to G-reylock summit, the highest point of land in the state of Massachusetts, being about 3,500 ft. above sea level. We had quite an enjoyable time, for an outing. Some of us had to sleep on the floor, which did not quite come up in point of comfort to our nice hair and husk mattresses, still we roughed it through and liked the ciiange. T. D. E. !N o rtlx Fam ily-. Sept. 10, 1891. Chilly nights and cool mornings remind us of approaching winter and of the necessity of having our fire arrangements all in safe working order. At this season of the year we only need a little flash of fire, and the light fuel we use is just right to set chimneys and stove pipes on fire if they are not cleared of soot. Defective flues and carelessly put up stove pipes cause a large percentage of the fires in our country. I had a little experience in our boiler cellar, the other morning. We were burning some trashy stuff and a few sparks fell on the floor; I took the broom and swept them up and hung up the broom. In a few moments a scent of smoke attracted my attention, and I went to see what was the cause, and found the broom on fire; water being handy and I being right there no damage occurred. I have concluded hereafter to wet the broom before hanging it up. We are now engaged cutting corn for ensilage. We have the boiler outside the barn and we draw the wood as we want it; a cart load was dumped near by, and in the middle of the forenoon smoke was observed coming from that load of wood. A spark had fallen from the smoke-stack upon the wood and fire was the result. We make it an invariable rule after we start a fire in the boiler, never to leave it; we remain there until every spark is extinguished by an abundance of water, and the same with our kilns for drying apples &amp;c. They should never be left till the fire is in a perfectly safe condition, and never leave on any account when drying in the night. A hose should be attached to the hydrant and ready for instant use; but where there is no hydrant a barrel or two of water and pails should always be in readiness. We finished haying on Sept. 4. Fruit harvest has commenced and is very abundant. Our Ministry leave for Watervliet on the 16th. inst. In kindest love. D. O. Watervliet, N. Y. It is some time since we have written any Notes. We took the gentle hint in the Manifesto to do better. The summer is past, but the harvest is not ended. While hay and grain are secured, fruit and vegetables are not. Hay, fair crop. Oats very good. Eye fair. Beans rusted badly, consequently few cans filled. We are busy canning pears, plums and tomatoes, also drying corn. Fruit is plenty except peaches in our locality, of the latter we have enough to make us comfortable. Have had considerable wet weather, which has hindered work, but we keep moving as there is always plenty to do. We have had good, refreshing meetings, and if the spiritual atmosphere has not been cleared it is not for the lack of gospel testimony,�delivered not in a cooing, lullaby style, but in trumpet tones, that wakens into life the true-hearted Believer, if it does not effectually arouse the slumbering, or more properly the dead soul into newness of life. Our motto is, Fear not�'Cry aloud spare not,' neither the wrongs in ourselves nor others. We have also had beautiful ministering spirits in our midst the past season. Not only the loved ones who have gone before, but the loved ones still living with us in earth-life. Beloved Eldress Joanna Kaime, whose beautiful influence is with us yet, and her precious words will long be remembered. All the good Sisters from Enfield N. H. each one of whom we remember, and shall always feel drawn nearer to them for their beautiful testimony and life. Nor must we forget our dear Sister Amelia Calver and the two Sisters with her; also Br. Watson Andrews who seemed to possess the life and power of the gospel in his soul. We have heard rumors of an accident that befell him, but trust it is not as serious as reported. Health of Society good with few exceptions. Hancock, Mass. Sept. 9, 1891. Dear Editor;�With a soul full of appreciation and thankfulness for the luminous little monthly magazine that comes to us laden with riches, and sheds its radiant beams of light on the pilgrim's pathway, we take our pen for the purpose of adding our mite to the department of the Home Notes. Thoughtful remembrances and kindest wishes are tendered to the faithful band who so patiently toil to interest and instruct the many readers, while breathings of prayer ascend to the Father above, that he may continue to bless and prosper so laudable an enterprise. We recently had the satisfaction of entertaining for a few hours a company of devoted, worthy Sisters from the North Family of Mount Lebanon. Harvesting, cutting and drying of apples, canning of fruit and attending to other needful duties is the present occupation. Apples and pears are more plentiful than we had anticipated. Plums few or none. Oats a good crop. ^ Potatoes yielded well, but show signs of decay. Our little blackberry patch that looked so finely in the spring, gave us the nice product of sixteen bushels of rare sweet berries. 'Dr. Kaime finding a flower under the Humboldt glacier was more affected by it because it grew under the lip and in the cold bosom of the ice, than he would have been by the most gorgeous garden bloom.' In like manner we are surprised, ami record with great pleasure the fact that we gathered this season, from a tree grown in our Office garden, a bushel of good peaches. Such an incident has not occurred in this, section of country for several years. Br. Ira we are sorry to say, is not improving in health as it is desirable that he should. He now expects to make a trip as far south as New Jer- sey, by advise of his Physician. Being unable to make the journey alone, two Sisters will accompany and remain with him. God grant that he be restored to health and comfort. J. L. S. Shaker Station, Conn. Christ is spoken of in scripture 'as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.' The full meaning of this phrase comes to me now as never before. Here is the shadow of a great rock where we find sweet home peace and rest beneath the shadow of his protecting, guiding love, while the lif e-battle grows more and more earnest. If we could always remember that He does indeed do all things well what a comfort and blessing it would he! How light our burdens would grow, how easily we could walk and faint not. It does not seem right that we should bear burdens that need not be felt if we had more faith and trust in his eternal goodness and power. We are journeying on day by day, coming with each step nearer the rest and joy awaiting the faithful. Why may we not have more of that rest, more of that joy as we walk? Why may we not even here breathe the pure air of heaven and be strengthened by the sweet songs of peace the angels sing? Let us struggle on, hope on, hope ever. Let us be strong, be true, be manly, believing that 'He doeth all things well.' 'Guided by the Lord's anointfed' we 'walk through green pastures and by still waters,' and though sometimes the way seems rugged and sorrows arise, we have strength and courage to go on undoubtingly, and find peace and happiness in unexpected places. 4698 spaces of cream were sold in Aug. Our new ever-bearing strawberry plants are remarkably vigorous, and give promise of an early and late crop next season. Now is the time to decide on the number of fowls to be wintered. Hens that have moulted should be separated from those that have not, and placed in winter quarters, free from draughts at night. The moulting hens should not be slighted. Hot milk is a valuable drink for them. They need a variety of health-giving diets. When the moulting season is over they should have a good supply of egg-making material. Buck-wheat and corn exclusively is not a good diet for hens. It is best to act wisely when starting in the poultry business. Large flocks of hens do not often pay as large a percentage of profit as smaller ones. D. Orcutt. Soixfeli Family. Desiking to unite with a 'good gift,' we say,�The testimony among us which serves to awaken our home circle to purity of life and goodness of heart, is that where a few truth-loving souls are assembled to serve God in sincerity, there will the spirit of Christ be, to bless them. 'We gain spiritual substance, something living eternally, by our own exertion, just as we may gain temporal sustenance by industry. To expect redemption from the life of perverted nature by the merits of any other human being, however good, will inevitably lead to sad disappointment. We have the most favorable opportunity now to commence to build a mansion in God's holy temple, in which we may abide. To defer this Avork until we leave the mortal form, is unwise. Divine instruction leads us to believe that all souls will have an opportunity for eternal improvement. We can most favorably commence the work of self-improvement today. To accomplish this great work, we must bear the cross of Christ, which will enable every one to say, 'I have overcome the world.' When we have overcome our individual world of selfishness and unhallowed desires and have grown to the fulness of manhood and womanhood in the ministration of Divine love, (Christ) we have truly 'set down with Him in his throne.' Our Parents made their outward lives subservient to a spiritual travail. The temporal duties of life claim attention, but they should be subjected to the spiritual growth. We are pleased to see Br. D. Offord's remarks about the Reaper &amp; Binder; we have one of the same kind, and think it works admirably. Two horses can draw it as easily as a mower, in heavy grass. It will do more work, and better, than any four horse binder. Its name deserves mention, Adbiance. We have been trying a Pruyn potato-digger and are convinced of its n\erits; may have more to say about it hereafter. Two horses of moderate weight can draw it quite easily, when properly adjusted. The weather has been hot for nearly two weeks, but a great change has come and we now fear that frost will overtake the corn. It is surprising how suddenly extremes follow each other in our New England climate. We wish to mention a brief visit to our home from Elder Andrew Barrett. We felt him a messenger of spiritual riches, gained by a life of consecration. Eldeks. Ayer, Mass. Aug. 1891. Deae Editor:�I see by the last Manifesto that I am brought upon the stand, Criticism by Br. D. OfCord. Well, I think I deserve it, though it was my intention on leaving home to have only a few days of rest. I have gathered much spiritual treasure, and while enjoying these rich seasons of good at the several Societies, I did regret not having the company of our good Sisters, to share with me, and to drink in the heavenly inspirations. We are exhorted in our little paper to give breath to the spiritual as well as to the temporal. During my visit to my former home they gave me the privilege of a two days' visit to the little family in Canaan which met my feelings most agreeably. In my interviews with the Brethren and Sisters, many expressed a strong faith in the work of crucifixion, by the cross. The hour of worship really did my soul good, as I listened to the testimonies of truth that found utterance in that little united band, I could say with one of old, �'It is good to be here.' Not only were we with those in the body, but the presence of the immortals was sensibly felt during this beautiful season. All through my old home I could realize the blessings of a heavenly influence resting upon those who were still holding most sacred, those principles of purity which they have valued more than life. If by the outward we read the index of the mind, or that which is spiritual, we must say that Mount Lebanon holds her place as the fountain head, from whence our other homes may still draw new life. How pleasant it was to see consecrated souls ornamenting aud making their home attractive, in the beautifying of the Lord's heritage. After a wearisome season of toil and care we are beginning to realize the benefits of good and thorough farming. From less than a quarter of an acre we took seventy-five bushels of extra nice potatoes, and the remaining four acres have the appearance of producing as good results. Our corn and ensilage crop never was better. The Sisters are busy in preserving the fruit, and in caring for the herbs. The dry weather has very much reduced our water supply, and at present, we are obliged to resort to the pumps for much that we use. A. D. B. Canterbury, N. H. Weather Record, for Aug. 1891.

Sept. 1891, We are now quite certain that the summer is past, and the harvesting of many things has ended for this season, but the part that has special reference to beingsaved will be reserved till next time. During the past few weeks we have had sad forebodings of a failure in the potato crop, as in several instances there has been evidence of premature decay. As the early crop was touched with the disease, we thought that our foreknowledge would readily determine the state of the later crop. We now have a more favorable report, and shall wait through hope. We have had an evolution or a revolu'tion in the coming of ovens. In 1837 our fathers built a large oven of free-stone, and for many years it was thought to be one � of the best, and was in daily use baking the best of bread and pies', etc. etc., till 1865 when it began to depreciate in value and soon gave place to one of the galvanized iron ovens. After the pleasure of the change was over, this oven proved objectionable from the volume of heat that escaped as' the large doors were opened. The next change gave us a large square free-stone oven, surrounded by another of brick and heated by a stove placed in the rear and under the floor of the oven. Within this oven were four revolving cast iron disks which were reached by four doors at the front. As the wheels or disks were laid horizontally, the several doors in front were quite narrow and but little heat escaped when any one of them should be opened. The chimney was directly over the oven and as the draft proved to be defective from the first, this was charged as the cause of its failure. In a few years this oven was remodeled but without any marked improvement. A stove was placed inside of the oven, in order to obtain a quicker heat, but with the heat came more or less smoke and to this the bakers objected. The top of the oven was taken off and the flue enlarged. All this work did little good and it was decided to remove the whole of the chimney and the oven and begin anew. This time the chimney was built, having its foundation laid on stone work and the oven placed as near the chimney as consistent. In appearance this oven bears a close resemblance to the last one. The heating apparatus has been improved and the structure is now a nice, triple oven. The outer one is of brick; within this is an oven of blocks of free-stone and the inner or third oven is made of galvanized This last change has been at a cost of nearly three hundred dollars, but the oven has been in daily use for several weeks and up to date is pronounced a success. Elder George at Enfield Ct. has had a corresponding experience with the oven built at that place and of whom we received our first patterns. He thinks it is not best to say very much at present, about his improvements, which gentle hint need not be lost in our case, as we shall probably hear from him at no distant day. A company of five Sisters have recently made a visit to the Society at Enfield, N. H. and have returned with glowing accounts of a beautiful place, where many near and dear gospel friends. * live Sabbathday Lake, Me. Sept. 13, 1891. 'Oh, the blessings, rich and many, Which are mine to share to-day; All the fountains of God's goodness Seem to open in my way!' To-day is one of the many days in which we are especially blessed for we have but to ask and we receive. The summer is over. Now all New Eng. landers must prepare for winter. Harvesting is going on in this section. Our grain has been gathered and threshed, yielding over 200 bu. Winter apples are not very plentiful. Of early apples we have an abundance. Have already dried 72 bu. Hope to dry as many more before we get through. On the 4th. inst. a company of ten Sisters went from this place on an excursion to the city of Portland. They took the steamer, E. S. Spring and sailed out to the Islands in the harbor, visited Greenwood Garden on Peak's Island and watched for the White Squadron which was to come in that day but did not appear until after they had returned home. Another company went to the State Fair at Lewiston on the 9th. inst. They had a very enjoyable day, started early and returned late in the evening. Health of Society generally good, but we are still in need of rain. Clouds threaten to-day y�t 'All signs fail in a dry time' and we may not receive the much coveted blessing. A. S. C. South Union, Ky, Sept. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry;�Your kind letter is received for which accept many thanks. The weather is cool now. We are making preserves. Have just finished the peaches, 1500 one quart, glass jars. Quinces come next and that will end that industry for this year. Farmers are fallowing for wheat the coming year. Expect to sow about 300 acres. Corn is doing well and promises abundant yield. The late rains have helped us much; other things in statu quo. H. L. E. ZSTortli Family. Sept. 8, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�In union with our Elder Sisters, Eldress Nancy and Charity, I send you a few Notes from the North Family. I am twenty-one years old and have lived here twenty-one months. I have been taught the faith of Believers and find it good. I intend to make an effort to live and die by it. By faith in God, confession of sin and obedience to gospel orders, good is gained and progress made in spiritual life. It shall be my aim to set a good example and to aid my younger companions, of whom there are eight in this family under age. Eldress Nancy is very zealous for our welfare both spiritually and temporally. We have had good crops of wheat and corn this year, and a fair crop of Irish potatoes. Plenty of vegetables, and fruit in great abundance. Of milk and butter, a large supply. We have preserved and dried for family use an unusual amount of peaches and other fruit. We have plenty of honey. Our Brethren and Sisters are promising and good spirited. E. M.
