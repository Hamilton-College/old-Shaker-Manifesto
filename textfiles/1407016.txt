BIBLICAL. NO. 6. BY H. C. BLINN. Readers of the New Testament who wisli to be well informed on the subject, will study as carefully the text of the revision as they have that of the authorized version. The large number of changes that have been made in the book are a subject of surprise when we bear in mind that the work was generally considered quite perfect, in fact a work of plenary inspiration. The pruning, however, has been done by master workmen, and they have, no doubt, felt warranted in this purifying of the text from its many and varied errors. Some of the most important of those we note for the better information of those who are pleased to read. In the xvii of Lk. one whole verse is erased. It is of no great importance and its erasure can do no harm. The remaining part of the book of Luke has many doubtful passages and a very important one occurs in the xxii., 43 and 44, also xxiii , 17. xxiv., 6. The words, 'He is not here but is risen. ' xxiv., 40. ' And when he had said this he showed them his hands and feet. ' xxiv., 42. ' And they gave him a piece of broiled fish and a honey comb. ' As the most of this chapter treats of the resurrection, it was more visionary than real. Our spiritualist friends might say it was a materialization, as such forms appear to them and eat as did Jesus with his disciples. Those who wrote fish and honey comb went a little too far, as our revisors have their doubts about the last article of diet, xxiv., 51. 'And was carried up into heaven ' is not found in many of the ancient MSS., hence it is doubtful. Jesus had already made the declaration while among the brethren that he was in heaven. Jno. iii., 13. ' And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but lie that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven. ' Jno. v., 3. The multitude of ' blind, halt and withered ' that waited for the angel to trouble the waters of the pool can have no farther privilege, as the fourth verse is wholly struck from the text. All the sermons hereafter, based on that wonderful story will be at a discount. Jno. viii. From the first to the twelfth verse is considered spurious and not entitled to a place in the New Testament. Some churchal people think the change in Jno. x.. 16 to be very important. The A.V. reads, 'There shall be one fold and one shepherd. ' while the revision reads, ' they shall become one flock, one shepherd. ' We think it will make but little difference with those who live 'soberly, righteously and godly in this present world, ' as they can well trust to the ability of the true Shepherd to place them just where he would like to have them. Acts viii., 37 an important passage is erased, ix., 5 and 6 verses are very much changed. Paul on his visit to Athens xvii., 22 instead of finding the people 'too superstitious ' he found them ' very religious. ' Rom. viii., 1. ' There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.' The remainder of the verse is erased. Horn, ix., 5. Here is another singular passage and subject to much comment. The old MSS. do not agree. 'Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever.' The revision reads, ' Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. ' The marginal notes have changed the punctuation of the sentence and made it read entirely different from the A. V. It might puzzle a lawyer to decide which form ot text belongs to the apostle. 1 Cor. xiii. The word ' charity ' throughout the chapter gives place to 'love, ' and the ' tinkling cymbal ' to 'clanging cymbal.' A large number of corrections of less note have been made throughout the chapters of 1st and 2nd Cor. Eph. iii. 9. 'And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginniï¿½g of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ. ' A decided change has been made in this verse which must have been at one time in the hands of a trinitarian scribe. The revision reads. 'And to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which from all ages hath been hid in God who created all things. This makes God the creator instead of Jesus. Other variations are found in the margin which may improve the text. Phil, xi., 5 and 6. Another mystical passage, ' Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God. ' The revisors have changed the text and made it less objectionable. The E. I), reads, Who though being in God's form, yet did not meditate a usurpation to be like God. Dean Alford writes, Who being in the form of God, deemed not his equality with God a thing to be grasped. In the future we can have the satisfaction of choosing from the several translations. 1 Tim. iii., 16, Some officious scribe evidently made this passage to suit the times, but the revisors have seen fit to correct it. 'And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifest in the flesh, ' etc. In the revision it now reads, ' And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness. He who was manifested in the flesh. ' etc. The Catholic Bible reads. ' And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh. ' 2 Tim. iii., 16, ' All sc-ipture is given by inspiration of God. ' This has been one of the texts to prove that the whole Bible was inspired.of God, every word every letter and some have gone so far as to say every punctuation mark, and has probably caused more controversy than any other text of the same number of words. The revision has ruined it for sectarians as it now reads. 'Every scripture inspired of God is profitable, ' etc. The E. D. reads. All scripture divinely inspired is indeed profitable, etc. The Catholic Bible was more consistent than the Protestant, as that reads, ' All scripture inspired of God, is profitable, ' etc. 1 Jno. v., 7. This text has caused a great deal of loud talk among sectarians. It has, however, been considered spurious, for many years, and the revisors have thrown it out. It is not known who forged it, but it was written after the 5th century. Rev. viii., 13, has one of the most singular errors. It makes John say that he saw an ' angel flying through the midst of heaven, ' when he only saw ' an eagle. ' Can it be that an Angel and an eagle look so much alike that it was difficult to determine the fact. Who knows which is right? It would he as much of a wonder to hear an eagle crying woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, as it would to see an angel ftying in mid heaven. Canterbury, N. H.
