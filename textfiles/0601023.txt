Supposing your age to be fifteen, or there-abouts... Supposing your age to be fifteen, or there-abouts : You have 200 bones and 500 muscles; your blood weighs twenty-five pounds, your heart is five inches in length and three inches in diameter, it beats seventy times per minute, 4,200 times per hour, 100,800 times per day, and 36,792,000 times per year. At each beat a little over two ounces of blood is thrown out of it; and each day it receives and discharges about seven tons of that wonderful fluid. Your lungs will contain a gallon of air, and you inhale 24,000 gallons per day. The aggregate surface of the air-cells of your lungs, supposing them to be spread out, exceeds 20,000 square inches. The weight of your brain is three pounds; when you are a man it will weigh about eight, ounces more. Your nerves exceed 10,000,000 in number. Your skin is composed of three layers, and varies from one-fourth to one-eighth of an inch in thickness. The area of your skin is about 1,700 square inches. Each square inch contains about 2,500 sweating tubes or perspiratory pores, each of which may be likened to a little drain tile one-fourth of an inch long, making an aggregate length of the entire surface of your body of 88,541 feet, or a tile ditch for draining the body almost 17 miles long.
