THOUGHTS FOR TO-DAY Christ is coming Christ is Coming. — Frances E. Willard exclaims: 'Truly, Christ is coming, coming all the time, like sunrise from the east, or summer from the south, or heaven to hearts that love and look for His appearing. Happy are they who help to hasten, by a little, even, the day when He shall reign King of nations as He now reigns King of saints!' Some kindly deeds done Some Kindly Deeds Done. — Let every dawn of morning be to you as the beginning of life, and every setting sun be to you its close ; then let every one of these short lives leave its record of some kindly thing done for others, some godly strength or knowledge gained for yourself. Immortality Immortality. — The door between the two worlds has been constantly opening since the advent of man upon the earth, and the hour is at hand when it will be possible for the sons of men to view distinctly what is beyond. The only obstacle now in the way is the dull materiality by which man fetters himself to the earth, his painstaking devotion to stupidity, his self-stultification, his persistent wallowing in the slough of permanent errors, and the resolute sealing of his spiritual capacities to the light which is constantly beaming down upon him. Oh! when will 5man open his eyes to the divine capacities of his being? When will he take the same pains to know and to do the will of our Father in heaven, that he now takes to know and do foolishness? and when will he arise and take possession of that heritage which is placed at his disposal through the countless ages of the everlasting?
