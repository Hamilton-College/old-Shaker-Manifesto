This was the petition of Solomon, the wisest of kings ' Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people, that I may discern between good, and bad.' 1 Kings, Hi.. 9. This was the petition of Solomon, the wisest of kings, when in a dresim God said, 'Ask what I shall give unto thee. '�It is not stated in the divtee record that Solomon's answer was hesitatingly given, though it is consistent for us to imagine that through the youthful mind there passed iu rapid succession, visions of earthly pomp and splendor, wealth and fame, yet his innate regard for the Divinity above and the divinity within, with a noble humility of heart, rendered his aspirations of a loftier character than mere considerations of self. Though young, he seemed to realize that all earth could give, would not fit him for the leadership of Israel. His mind having been religiously cultivated and prepared, was able to turn from all minor worldly interests, and ask for an understanding heart. Are we not, dear readers, at some period of our lives, in the same mental position with Solomon of old ? I think so. The Savior has said, 'Ask and it shall be given unto you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you.' To Solomon then was given the gift of his choice. Shall we be as wise in our decision, is the question ; and what shall we say when the spirit of God meets us with, 'Ask what I shall give unto thee ? ' Will the baubles of earthly wealth, the fsinsel of fashionable attainments charm us, or shall fading beauty or that bubble, Fame, so engross our interest that we shall fail to choose, like Solomon, the greatest c/ all gifts, the wisdom of God? I air. led to believe that therein a time in the life of every intelligent person, in which this injunction is put importunately, ' Choose ye this day whom ye will serve !' May none of us, dear youthful companions, be foolish virgins or be so unwise in deciding our own eternal fate as to seek happiness or satisfaction in the fading things of time, for these, '�perish with their using.' May we all be wise like the youthful Solomon, and a*k for an understanding heart and an everlasting home in the principles of righteousness and peace. Canterbury, N. H.
