A WOMAN'S SONG TO WOMAN Pull the needle, swing the broom, Tidy up the littered room, Patch the trousers, darn the shirt, Fight the daily dust and dirt; All around you trust your skill, Confident of kindness still. Stir the gruel, knead the bread ; Tax your hands, and heart, and head Children sick and household hungry; (Though some thoughtless words stung you), All are waiting on your will, Confident of kindness still. Never mind the glance oblique, Never cause of coldness seek, Never notice slight or frown, By your conduct live them down ; All at last will seek your skill, Confident of kindness still. Lift your heart and lift your eyes, Let continual prayer arise ; Think of all the Saviour's wo When he walked with man below, How poor sinners sought his skill, Confident of kindness still. Sing the song and tell the story Of the Saviour's coining glory, To the children whom He blesses With your guidance and caresses, Who for all things wait your will Confident of kindness still. have 142 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. Feed the hungry and the weak, Words of cheer and comfort speak, Be the angel of the poor, Teach them bravely to endure, Show them this, the Fathor's will, Confident of kindness still. Gratitude may be your lot, Then be thankful; but if not, Are you better than your Lord Who endured the cross and sword From those very hands whose skill Waited ever on His will ? Noble is a life of care If a holy zeal be there ; All your little deeds of love Heavenward helps at last may prove, If you seek your Father's will, Trusting in His kindness still.
