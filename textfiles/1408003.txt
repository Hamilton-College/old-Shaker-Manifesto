UNTIMELY FEOST. F. W. EVANS. 1$ this world governed by chance? Is there no overruling, directing, intelligence that can influence the material elements for good or evil�for man's benefit, or to his detriment? Is a frost that is wide-spread, destroying the promise of one of the most fruitful seasons that avc ever experienced, purely material, the simple operation of natural law ? Or are there occult forces, spiritual laws, back of, or interior to it? Man is composed of the elemeuts of two worlds, an exterior and an interior. His body and soul are focuses of the forces and powers of both worlds. Again, his spirit may stand in relation to a third sphere or world. His physical, intellectual and moral being may each draw life forces from their appropriate world or sphere. The vital power of the man or woman is from the innermost to the outward world. If we see a man's physical body expressing intense love and affection, or powerful anger and rage, do we not at once recognize the fact that his soul is stirred within him and that his spirit is the primary cause of the physical manifestation in his body? Why then should we not refer an extraordinary exhibition of force in the external world, such as a Cyclone, an Earthquake, a Whirlwind or a great flood or fire, in a similar manner, to the inner worlds, of man's complex organism? If he move the even tenor of his way, in unison with the laws of nature and the will of his God, wherefore should not all things work together for good�the physical, the moral, the intellectual and the spiritual, all in harmony ? If one plants and another reaps, rf one builds and another inhabits, if one creates wealth and another possesses it, do we not realize that man, not God, is the cause of this abnormal phenomena, and that when certain religious changes are wrought in man's spirit, soul and body, they will cease? The teacher Moses, taught explicitly, that the external world Avas an effect of a world of causation�that in all things it was subject to that interior world. The blessings aud cursings Avere traced directly to man as a religious and moral being�in his sphere a God. 'If thou diligently j hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to do all his commandments, these blessings shall come upon thee. Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field, in the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, the fruit of thy cattle and the flocks of thy sheep. Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store. Blessed shall thou be when thou comest in and when thou goest out. Thou shalt be blessed in thy store-house and all thou settest thy hand unto. The Lord shall establish thee a holy people unto himself and make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy ground. The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven, to give the rain unto thy land and to bless all the work of thy hand. Thou shalt lend unto many nations and not borrow. ' Would not this be a Millennium condition of things upon this earth ? Yet all of this good was and is possible to the natural man�making the New Earth. 'In disobedience, the Lord shall send upon thee vexation and rebuke in all thou settest thy hand unto. The pestilence shall cleave unto thee. Thou shalt be smitten with consumption, with fever, with an inflamation, an extreme burning, with drought, blasting, mildew. The heaven even over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thy feet shall be iron. The Lord shall smite thee with the botch of Egypt, the emerods, the scab, the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed, with madness, blindness and astonishment of heart, and thou shalt grope at noon day as the blind grope in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways. Thou shalt build a house and not dwell in it, plant a vineyard and not eat of the grapes thereof. All thy trees and the fruit of thy land shall the locusts consume. The Lord shall bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, make thy plagues wonderful, even great plagues and of long continuance. Also every plague and every sickness that is not written in this book of the Law, them will the Lord bring upon thee.' These things apply to the natural man under the law, 'and when it shall come to pass, when all these things have come upon thee, if thou shalt return to the Lord with all thy heart and all thy soul, and obey his voice and keep his commandments, the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart to love the Lord thy God with all thy soul, and thy neighbor as thyself, that thou mayest live. The word I speak is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and iu thy heart and thou mayest do it. ' This is at the end of the law, an'l the beginning of a New Creation, New Heavens. Then cometh Christianity, in two Dispensations, a First and a Second appearance of the Christ Spirit I ask, What are the causes of our untimely frost? Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
