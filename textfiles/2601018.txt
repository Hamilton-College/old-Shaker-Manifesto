East Canterbury, N. H Dec. 1895. Jtjst one word before the year closes We are in harmony with the great body of humanity that is sending out so many hearty good wishes for the 'every body's' and their relations. The sermon that Santa Glaus preaches every year seems to have a wonderful effect upon the minds of both old and young. Impatient thro waiting for his December mission, his words are fully anticipated at an early date and the gifts at his hand are noted in full, long before he sends his message. Well, the snow has made us a visit, and the ice is trying to make itself ready for the sleds and skates that are to be on hand at a moment's warning. The flower gardens look sorrowful. The plants that must be saved, have been whrskt to a more congenial climate where they can bud and blossom to the very great pleasure of their careful attendants, while others are left to endure the severe storms of a long winter. All the birds and bugs and curious little insects have taken leave of us, to await the return of another spring. As we seem to be rather more closely confined to a special location than either a bird or a bug, THE MANIFESTO. we must study to build around us a home that shall be filled with the multiplied blessings of 'God's holy mountain' so that when the storms are without we may sing as does the good Christian, ''December is as pleasant as May.'
