Imaginary lines written by Elder A. Perkins which, perhaps, our departed Sister, Asenath Russell, might endorse. In death's dark hour an Angel came And said, good daughter rise; Leave pain and sorrow, house of clay, And break all earthly ties. She smiled on me and took my hand; Forthwith we walked along, First through a frowning gate we passed And then we met a throng, Not strangers they, but souls well known, With whom I'd lived, and toiled and grown; A nd often in the house of prayer Had met with them and worshiped there, In songs of joy with kindred dear, Such greetings I did never hear. We then walked through rich verdant groves, And flowery fields, and gardens fair; Then to my mansion 1 was led To view the treasures garnered there. The deeds of life, the crosses borne, And acts of kindness all were shown In life-long deeds, I then was clad, The vestments I on earth had made. Upon my head was placed a crown, Prefiguring mortal life laid down. And then a school as I was told I might attend, which would unfold The laws of life in Beulah land, Which gives the growth its laws demand. 'Tis here I breathe the air of bliss, A realm comx)lete with happiness. My joy is full, I realize Reward for every sacrifice. Enfield, N. H.
