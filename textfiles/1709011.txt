RETROSPECTION. AMELIA J. CALVER. There cometh a time when we shall look back upon life, and see in the many vicissitudes of our pilgrimage here, that the real ' means of grace' by which the true development of spirit has been attained, have been unappreciated. As such then, should we view the shaded glen of the pathway. In the broad sunlight we walk by sight, thus develop strength, activity; but as the shadows lengthen we feel our way, and thus grow careful and thoughtful, while a trusting confidence in the good within and without leads us on.
