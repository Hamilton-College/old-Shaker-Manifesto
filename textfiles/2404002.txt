A SUGGESTION. By Arthur W. Dowe. NOW that the attention of the civilized world is being called to the fact of the disordered condition of industrial affairs existiug under the present iniquitous competitive system, and many of the deepest thinkers of the day are endeavoring to devise means for the alleviation of the poor and suffering ones, would it not be well for Believers to utilize the knowledge and resources gained by a century of labor anu experience, in not only ministering to the present needs of those who are suffering the effects of sin and ignorance, but in bringing to birth a system that will prevent a repetition of the same state of affairs in the age to come. Certainly no one who has recognized the Divine compassion manifested in the humanity of Jesus the Christ, and who possesses a grain of the virtue of Charity, will contend that the misery surrounding him on all sides is none of his affair; nor will he be likely to repeat the question of the murderous Cain, 'Am I my brother's keeper?' On the contrary, the mere fact that fellow beings 'made of one flesh and blood to dwell together upon the face of the earth,' are, through wrong thinking and doing on the part of themselves or others, suffering for the simplest necessities of food, shelter, and clothing, ought to call forth a fellow-feeling in the hearts of all, and one that will be practically manifested in deeds of tender mercy and loving kindness, and not merely in words and empty prayers. To Believers, who have become dead to the world and alive unto God through the example and teaching of Christ and Mother and who now rejoice THE MANIFESTO. 85 in the calling of ministering angels of light and love, the responsibility of acting quickly and wisely becomes most pressing. Will it not be well for us as a body, to beware lest some one take our crown? Brethren and Sisters, the Lord God of Mother Ann calls us to work, 'The harvest is ripe, the laborers few.' Action is life. Stagnation is death. Statistics show that there are several millions of idle and destitute persons in this United States, the majority of whom, when asked the question 'Why stand ye here all the day idle?' would respond 'because no man has hired us.' Now, while it is true that Believers are not overburdened with wealth, they can at least contribute their 'Widow's mite' in doing all that they are able to do; and the inventive genius, so long developed in them through quietness and meditation, surely ought to be able to evolve some scheme of practice, that will bring a measure of peace and comfort to many of the 'unemployed.' Will you permit a suggestion, that, if properly carried out, may in a great degree, prove a lasting benefit to many a poor soul, as well as a joy and crown to faithful Believers ? Many of the Societies are at present encumbered with more land than they can practically utilize ; large tracts, upon which heavy taxes have to be paid are lying idle for want of hands to cultivate them ; extensive improvements that might be made are obliged to be abandoned, because the whole of the time and attention of the Society is demanded elsewhere. The hardy workers of yore are rapidly passing away and there is very little influx of new life and muscle to take their places. Mills, shops and other branches of industry closed either from a lack of laborers, or from outside competition. In many of our Villages, large and expensive buildings fitted with all necessary articles of comfort with scores of unoccupied rooms are patiently waiting for tenants to come in and enjoy their hospitable shelter. STow what excuse have we to offer before God, if, while millions are in need, and are perishing for the lack of these things, we who profess to love our neighbor as ourselves, keep from them those things which we ourselves can not use? It would seem, with the light that Mother has given us, we ought to see a way by which we can be a blessing to those outside of the fold, and thus reap a blessing for ourselves. Why not at once call for a report from the different Societies, as to the amount of land, buildings etc., that could be made available and thus utilized ; then compute the number of persons who could be employed and supported. As soon as this is done let the Societies make their kind invitation public through the newspapers or otherwise, under proper restrictions, and there is little doubt that the offer would attract the attention of many good people, 86 THE MANIFESTO. who have the welfare of humanity at heart who would provide the necessary transportation to those in need. Persons thus coming in to fill the demand, could then be grouped and organized for service according to sex and occupation. Every thing needed by them, should if possible, be made by their own labor as soon as circumstances would admit. Fair living wages should be paid for their labor, with a margin to provide for old age or sickness, but these wages should not be in money but in time or labor checks that would be receivable at the Society store for goods, rents, board, etc. All of which should be furnished at as nearly first cost as possible, the end in view being to benefit the needy ones, and not to make profit out of their necessities. Having gathered them into working order, and supplied their temporal wants, the gospel should then be given to them as they are able to bear it, and in neighborly acts and words of kindness, its great object lessons taught by living example, letting the light of the Divine life shine upon them: providing a healthy outlet for the exercise of the spiritual gifts and graces of Believers as well as uplifting those who are wandering and falling in darkness. Rules and regulations, firm but kind, would of course be established and the first principles of obedience thoroughly inculcated. By the abolishing of money as a medium of exchange, among those employed, and holding the base of supplies in their own hands for wise and proper use, Believers would be able to thoroughly eradicate the evils of drunkenness, gambling and other kindred vices, thus prepare a good soil for gospel seed. There is but little doubt that by these means many precious souls might be eventually won for Christ and gathered into his kingdom. There are doubtless many difficulties that would arise, but who are better prepared or more able to meet and overcome every obstacle, than men and women filled with the love and power of God? The above is offered as a suggestion, without details, as space in our precious Manifesto is limited, but it is sincerely prayed that it may be the means of awakening much earnest thought on the subject which will eventually bring forth fruit unto the glory of our God and his Christ.�Correspondence solicited at:�506 Turk St., San Francisco, Gal.
