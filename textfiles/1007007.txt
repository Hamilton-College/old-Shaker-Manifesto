WHAT MATTER What matter, friend, though you and I May sow, and others gather ? We build, and others occupy, Each laboring for the other. What though we toil from sun to sun, And men forget to flatter The noblest work our hands have done — If God approve, what matter? What matter though we sow in tears, And crops fail at the reaping; What though the fruit of patient years Fast perish in our keeping ; Upon our hoarded treasure, floods Arise and tempests gather — If faith beholds beyond the clouds A clear sky, what matter? What matter though our castles fall, And disappear while building ; Though strange handwriting on the wall Flame out amid the gilding ; Though every idol of the heart The hand of death may shatter ; Though hopes decay and friends depart— If heaven be ours, what matter ?
