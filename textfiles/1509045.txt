EARNEST PREACHING I do not love sensation preaching,ï¿½the personalities for spite, the hurrah for our side, the review of our appearances, and what others say of us ! We come to church properly for self-examination, for approach to principles, to see how it stands with us, with the deep and dear facts of right and love. At the same time it is impossible to pay no regard to the day's events, to the public opinion of the time, to the stirring shouts of parties, to the calamities and prosperities of our own town and country; to war and peace, new events, great personages, to good harvests, new resources, to bankruptcies, famines and desolations. We are not stocks nor stones, we are not thinking machines, but allied to men around us, as really, though not quite so visibly, as the Siamese brothers. And it were inhuman to affect ignorance or indifference on Sundays to what makes our blood beat and our countenance dejected Saturday or Monday. No, these are fair tests to try our doctrines by and see if they are worth anything in life. The value oi a principle is the number of things it will explain; and there is no good theory of disease which does not at once suggest a cure. Selected.
