Henceforth, let the Courts of the Lord's House — the dooryards — be made fruitful. The small fruits can be raised, in Believer's lawns, which have, hitherto, remained a barren waste. The food of trees therein abounds, and ought to be utilized. The blossoms, in spring — foliage, in summer, and fruit, in autumn, please the eye, comfort the spirit and cheer the heart of all beholders and partakers. Thus, the product of combustion, by fires and breathing, will be turned, from a curse, into a rich blessing. —Ed.]
