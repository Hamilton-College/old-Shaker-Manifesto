Christ is a fountain of life... Christ is a fountain of Life -- and the director of all the life and health giving elements that flow to his true disciples. All who receive from him, must receive in conformity to the laws established for the regulation of his Kingdom, and the guidance of its subjects. These, when rightly understood and applied, produce unity of spirit, and tend to increasing harmony nnd concert in. action. A. G.H.
