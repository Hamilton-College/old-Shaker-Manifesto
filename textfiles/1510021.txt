LITTLE THINGS Little words are the sweetest to hear; little charities fly farthest and stay longest on the wing; little lakes are the stillest; little hearts are the fullest, and little farms are the best tilled. Little books are the most read, and little songs the dearest loved. And when nature would make anything especially rare and beautiful, she makes it littleï¿½little pearls,little diamonds, little dews. Agar's is a model prayer; but then it is a little one, and the burden of the petition is for but little. The sermon on the mount is little, but the last dedication discourse was an hour. Life is made up of littles ; death is what remains of them all. Day is made up of little beams, and is glorious with little stars. Selected.
