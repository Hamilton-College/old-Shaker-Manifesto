West Pittsfield, Mass. Nov. 1897. The lovely autumn days have past. Days of beauty ever new; of fresh glowing tints on trees and shrubs; of magnificent sunsets, when the mellow tints of day meeting the darkening shades of night uniting in rich harmony flood the earth with glory. And the clear nights! As we look at the cloudless sky, perforated with its numberless shining stars, we think how aptly Longfellow describes it;ï¿½ 'Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven, Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget- me-nots of the angels.' Certainly we can not doubt the loving care of a Father who thus proves his remembrance of us. In the early history of our Society there leaned upon the side of the mountain, rising at the west of our valley, a barn, famous for its spacious apartments. In these rooms Eld. James Whittaker often spoke to large audiences the simple and powerful words of life. As years past on, like other barns, less famous, it became useless and was destroyed, but the beams marking the pulpit of the noted preacher were preserved and placed in the new barn which was built upon the site of the old one. For nearly fifty years it has stood like a fort, its walls painted by sun and rain in Nature's water colors, its doors and windows smiling a welcome alike to summer tramp or wealthy traveller seeking a shelter from the storm. On the 27th ult. flames were&gt;een ascending from its roof and encircling its sides. And so it fell, leaving a pleasant memory and a good insurance. Some forest fires have also visited our mountains. One burned about eight acres making quite a desert in the thick wooded hills. Sr. Catherine Allen of North family, Mt. Lebanon is sharing our home for a few days, and we are grateful for the opportunity thus given of enjoying the presence of one so earnest and true. Thus life passes! We can not call the daily work a duty, if we partake freely of the spiritual life which Jesus said should be like a fountain of water, overflowing because its waters are constantly supplied from unfailing springs, for we shall transform these duties into glad privileges.
