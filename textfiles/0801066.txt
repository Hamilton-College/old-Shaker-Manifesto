Steadiness of Purpose In whatever you engage, pursue it with a steadiness of purpose, as though you were determined to succeed. A vacillating mind never accomplishes anything worth naming. There is nothing like a fixed, steady aim. It dignifies our nature, and insures our success. Who have done the most for mankind? Who have secured the rarest honors ? Who have raised themselves from poverty to riches? Those who were steady to their purposes. The man who is one thing to-day and another to-morrow—who drives an idea pell-mell this week, while it drives him the next—is always in trouble, and does nothing from one year's end to the other. Look at and admire the man of steady purpose. He moves noiselessly along, and yet what wonders he accomplishes. He rises, gradually we grant, but surely. Dipping nails in oil, or even wetting them with water or spittle greatly prevents splitting of the lumber, and the bending of the nail. The longer linseed oil is kept for painting purposes the better, in regard to its drying qualities, transparency and durability. Almost any sting—except the sting of conscience- may be cured by applying Spirits of Turpentine.
