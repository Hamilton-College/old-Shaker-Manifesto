Word and Works Word and Works for May has a chapter on ''May Star Study' and the Chapter becomes very interesting as it informs its readers so carefully and so clearly how to make a nice map of the stars and how to study the map so that anyone can read the stars for themselves Everyone will want to see the 'Great Dipper' which has a liberal sized bowl and a nice long handle. The whole of it is made of beautifully bright stars. The people who live on or in those stars can boast of having the largest Dipper that is in the heavens. The passengers for this month have a very interesting page. In their 'Chats' they tell some wonderful stories; and these are illustrative of a great many subjects.
