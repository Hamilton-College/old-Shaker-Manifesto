LETTER BOX Dear Cora, I am glad to have the.... Shaker Village, Mer. Co., N. H. June, 1885. Dear Coea :ï¿½I am glad to have the pleasure of writing a few lines. I am going to try to get my lessons so that I can have a Summer ride. I hope my report will be good. I hope I can go to walk sometime, it is so pleasant to go to walk. I am going to try to talk gently while at my work. The flowers are very pretty. I set in type that motto you told us about in 'The Manifesto.' I liked it last evening very much. I am glad I have got a little flower bed. I like to take care of flowers. I should like to get 100 in all my lessons. I should be glad if I could. Sister Marcia said she would like to hear how I was getting along in school sometimes so I shall tell her. I don't know as I can think of much more, but after all I have a few more lines to write. I like my flower bed very much, I think it is very pretty. I hope it wont rain this evening if it does then I cannot go out and see about it. I should like to set another piece after I get that one done that I am doing. I hope I can have one next week. I shall try to get all my lessons next week. After I finish this letter I shall take my Arithmetic. I wish I could write a longer letter. I have tried to keep my motto. Your little, Daisy Cook.
