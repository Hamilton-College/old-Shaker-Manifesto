Unanimity of action is the order of Heaven... Unanimity of action is the order of Heaven. All of God's creation expresses perfection in unity and co-operation. The worship of Believers is symbolical of the ultimate attainment of the soul, when the whole being shall be in harmony with the Creator — God — and with associate intelligences living and moving in the element of pure love. This is the doctrine that the Christ taught, and that Jesus accepted; and this was the Spirit that prompted him to renounce his individuality and selfish life, with its prescribed interests, for the good of his brethren, whom he served in love. He said, ' The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.' And, in a spirit of true consecration, he said, 'Lo, I come to do thy will, O God! ' And those who are baptized into the same spirit, are lost to selfhood, and help to inaugurate the reign of ' Peace on earth' and of love to God, ' and good-will to man.' J. D. Knight, Mt. Lebanon
