OCCASIONAL THOUGHTS. MABTHA J. ANDERSON. Consecration of all our powers to the good of humanity, is our noblest service, and sweetest hymn of praise. Heaven as a place, its counterpart must find Within the secret chambers of the mind; All that embellish these with truth and grace, Prepare for us that blessed dwelling-place. Better be content with honest poverty, than acquire wealth through dishonest means. Great hearts are they who noble actions hold Above the praise of fame, or price of gold. Thought is the parent to the deed, then think aright, and thou shalt justly live nor have to meet the beggared train of ill-begotten deeds. False hearts are they who innocence beguile, And lure to sin through flattery's artful wile. Knowledge enlightens and expands the mind, and elevates it above gross ignorance and superstitious fears. Mark well the self-indulgent course, And trace the evil to its source; Large streams from little fountains flow, From finest seed great harvests grow. Compute not thy wealth in the aggregation of earthly riches ; but in the imperishable treasures of goodness, wisdom and truth that tliou hast secured in the jewelï¿½casket of thy soul. Ye glorious hopes that in my bosom rise, Proclaim immortal kinship to the skies. Honesty is our only safe investment, its bonds are current here and in eterniFew substances in nature pure are found, To show its light, the diamond must be ground. So in our souls, whatever is of worth, Must be reclaimed from all the dross of earth. More oppressive and galling than the chains of the chattel slave, is the thralldom of sensuality and sin. He that drinks from the lethean stream of sin, must taste of spiritual death. Just censure proves a generous meed of praise, If by its truth we wisely mend our ways. The peace that comes to stay, must be preceded by a mighty conflict, that the elements of discord may be eliminated from our souls. Where e'er with yearning hope we turn, We find some lesson new to learn, Far in blue depths are stars that burn Obscured by night's dark brow. And flowerets spring from nature's sod Where mortal foot has never trod, And wondrous miracles of God Are wrought, we know not how. Religion, like the desert rose, springs spontaneous wherever it finds an oasis in the soul, in which it may take root. Our trials prove often but friends in disguise, To humble our spirits, and make us more wise. Evince by your conversation and behavior that most angelic of all virtues, purity of spirit. Good deeds are better far than costly gems, True virtue weaves immortal diadems. Justice is the blending of wisdom and love, and not until man and woman are co-equal, will there exist just government among mankind. Vain hearts, to dream that pleasure lies In aught but noble sacrifice. You may cast away your physical life, but you can never escape the responsibility of your actions. If thou just censure wouldst escape The ways of others do not ape. Habits once formed, are not easier to break than the many stranded cable. Vaunt not thyself, shouldst thou attain The sum of human lore, More things unknown would yet remain Than thou hadst learned before. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
