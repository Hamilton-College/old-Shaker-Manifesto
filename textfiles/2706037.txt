A Volley of Grape Shot A Volley of Grape Shot. This is No. 46 of The Anti-Infidel Library, by the Editor of the Christian. The little book has several illustrations but the first one is special in its lesson of kindness. There is not the least suggestion of 'Grape Shot' and indeed should not be. This pamphlet of some 28 pages contains several short, interesting articles, well calculated to awaken thought on these special subjects. In the contents may be found, Playing with Gunpowder; It makes things Safe; The Price of a Man; Priests and Bakers; The Earl and the Cannibal, etc. etc. H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
