We have seen large books, profusely illustrated, agreeably to the text, and yet they were books not to be desired. Before us is a pretty little book only 2&gt;�x4 inches, upon the cover of which is the word 'Consecration.' No one is startled by that word or wishes to conceal it from view. The little story is said to have been written with tears anil prayers, and certainly can not otherwise than do good. Published by H. L. Hastings, Boston, Mass. The interest in Brook Farm will never die. Of all the communistic experiments ever made in America, it enlisted the co-operation of the most remarkable group of people, Almost all those who were active in it are now dead, Curtis and Dwight among the last to go, Charles A. Dana the only prominent man of the number still left among us. From Hawthorne's 'Blithedale Romance' on it has given birth to an enormous mass of literature. No adequate history of Brook Farm has ever been written, although the account in Frothingham's life of Ripley is excellent. But we have been given many fragmentary memories, and impressions of the life there, from varying standpoints. The New England Magazine The New England Magazine for May fur. nishes a real addition to this Brook Farm literature, in the form of, 'A Boy's Recollections of Brook Farm.' Mr. Arthur Sumner, the writer, was for a year or more a pupil in the school maintained there by Ripley, Margaret Fuller and their associates; and his recollections will be read eagerly by everybody interested in that episode in New England Trail scendentalism.�Warren F.

The proper way to brush and clean the teeth is to brush from the gums downward, for the upper teeth, and from the gums upward, for the inferior or lower teeth, writes W. Irving Thayer, D. D. S., in an article on 'Saving the Teeth' in the May Ladies' Home Journal. It is not less important to brush downward on the palatine-roof surface of the upper teeth, and upward on the lingual tongue side of the lower teeth, that is to say, brush the inside of the teeth as carefully as the outside.
