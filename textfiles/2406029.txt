BRUSHING THE TEETH BRUSHING THE TEETH. The proper way to brush and clean the teeth is to brush from the gums downward, for the upper teeth, and from the gums upward, for the inferior or lower teeth, writes W. Irving Thayer, D. D. S., in an article on 'Saving the Teeth' in the May Ladies' Home Journal. It is not less important to brush downward on the palatine-roof surface of the upper teeth, and upward on the lingual tongue side of the lower teeth, that is to say, brush the inside of the teeth as carefully as the outside.
