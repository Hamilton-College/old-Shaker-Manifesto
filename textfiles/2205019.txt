Ayer, Mass. Spuing has come at last and the hills and valleys have for a long time been covered with snow and ice. This has melted away* before the genial rays of the sun to j give place to the beautiful green verdure that nature sends forth to invigorate and give new life. What an inspiration we feel while breaking away from the indoor prison where old j winter has held us with his icy grip. I With the music of the robins and the blue-! birds we march out into the sunshine of God's goodness and shake ourselves from the lethargy that has gathered upon us. O what a touch of inspiration old Sol has upon our being, as he sends his cheery rays down to us. It seems to sweeten all the sour places, ever telling us to cheer up and look above the clouds, where we shall find the sun is still shining. What a lesson to learn for life. When the burdens press upon us and we feel a little disposed to say so much and no more, how noble it is to look up into the sunshine and put on the armor of God. Let our hearts be full of words of love which are the brightest flowers of earth's existence. They make a very Paradise of the humblest home. They are jewels beyond price, and more precious to heal the wounded heart than all other blessings earth can give. To think kindly of each other is good; to speak kindlj is better, but to act kindly is the best of all. Let us have this the work of the day. Our thanks go out to Br. Daniel Orcutt for his words of wisdom to the young. None too much, none too plain. Discipline is the greatest former of character, and when we learn to bear the discipline that is necessary for a growth in grace and righteousness we shall have far better conditions in Society. Spring's work has commenced, ploughing and sowing. Our wood is all housed in good order with the expectation that some of us will stay another winter on this side of the river. Work done for God goes with us into Eternity. Work done for earth perishes with us. A. D. P&gt;.
