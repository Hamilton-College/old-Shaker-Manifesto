THE HELPING HAND. I shall never forget the feelings I had once when climbing one of the pyramids of Egypt. When half way up, my strength failing, I feared I should never be able to reach the summit or get back again. I well remember the help given by Arab hands, drawing me on farther; and the step I could not quite make myself, because too great for my wearied frame, the little help given me� sometimes more and sometimes less�enabled me to go up, step by step, step by step, until at last I reached the top, and breathed the pure air and had a grand outlook from that lofty height. And so, in life's journey, we are climbing. We are feeble. Every one of us, now and then, needs a little help; a,nd if we have risen a step higher than some other, let us reach down for our brother's hand and help him to stand beside us. And thus, joined hand in hand, we shall go on conquering, step by step, until the glorious eminence shall be gained. Ah, how many need help in this world!�poor, afflicted ones; poor, sorrowing ones; poor, tempted ones, who have been overcome, who have been struggling, not quite able to get up the step ; trying, falling; trying, falling; trying, desponding; hoping, almost despairing! Oh, give such a one help, a little kindly aid, and the step may be taken, and another step may then be taken, and, instead of dying in wretchedness at the base, he may, by a brother's hand, be raised to safety, and finally to glory.
