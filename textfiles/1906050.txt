Biblical scholars should be very liberal in their interpretations... Biblical scholars should be very liberal in their interpretations of that wonderful book. For reasons best known to the early translators, great latitude was allowed. For instance the Hebrew 'Elohirn' a plural proper name, in the first chapter of Genesis, is translated 'God.' Now the English word God, is but another form of the old Scandinavian Odin, from which eminent scholars claim it originated. Again in the second chapter of Genesis, the creating power 'Yahveh'is rendered 'Lord God;' a strictly correct but concise translation of which into English is 'Will.' In the religion of the Hebrews, Yahveh represented the external world impersonated as a wild, and not the personal God worshiped by the Christian churches of to-day. The Bible is as yet a sealed book, and will so remain so long as its interpretation is warped to cover some dogma. It undoubtedly contains unfathomed oceans of truth, which can only be sounded by translators of both spiritual and intellectual unfoldment. Modern Thought.
