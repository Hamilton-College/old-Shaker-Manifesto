HOW A WOMAN PAID HER DEBTS. I am out of debt, and thanks to the Dish Washer business for it. In the past five weeks I have made over 500, and I am so thankful that I feel like telling everybody, so that they can be benefited by my experience. Anybody can sell Dish Washers, because everybody wants one, especially when it can be got so cheap. You can wash and dry the dishes in two minutes. I believe that in two years from now every family will have one. You can get full particulars and hundreds of testimonials by addressing the Iron City Dish Washer Co., 145 S Highland Ave., Station A, Pittsburg, Pa., and you can't help but make money in this business. I believe I can clear over $3,000 the coming year, and I am not going to let such an opportunity pass without improvement. We can't expect to succeed without trying.
