Enfield, Connecticut Enfield, Conn. It has been hard work to secure the hay this season. The Brethren went to turn one lot and found some of it quite under water. Apples and peaches will be quite plenty. If the rain does not hurt the peaches, we shall have a good supply, but some of the early ones are now decaying on the trees.
