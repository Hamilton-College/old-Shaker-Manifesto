Beloved Elder Henry;--In the Jan. number of the Christian Union... Enfield, Feb., 1891. Beloved Elder Henry;ï¿½In the Jan. number of the Christian Union, the Rev. Eeuen Thomas gives what he terms a 'Week Day Sermon,' upon the spiritual Teaching of Browning, on what he considers one of his finest religious poems, one of the most instructive as to its teaching. The entire sermon was very excellent, the subject being 'Saul.' I was impressed with one paragraph which seemed to me to be worthy of a place in our valuable and ever welcome Manifesto. I send you the article as a contribution. Dr. Thomas says, 'If only we will ponder this poem carefully, we shall find that Browning is again teaching us the necessity of the communication of a new life to man before his own lower vitality can awake into that power of which it is capable. In all the lower parts of his nature man fails ; he fails physically, intellectually, and emotionally. Very soon his physical force wanes, his intellectual vim weakens, his emotion cools. It seems as if the life in him is destined to ebb away and leave him less and less than before. Wherefore this ? Because man can never satisfy himself by mere strength, or mere wisdom or mere feeling. God intends him to find this out. And then, in his extremity, God finds his opportunity. Saul fails through self-will, doing as he likes instead of doing as God would have him. The end of it is black and unrelieved melancholy. He wants to be free from divine restraint. God's preser.ee is withdrawn and a starless night settles on his spirit. He wants freedom, not obedience. He gets it, and when he has got it, he is in worse slavery than ever. The path of obedience leads into sunshine. The path of freedom, shaking one's self clear of God, leads into dungeon depths of despondency. A new and greater truth always brings the sunlight with it, the selfwill in us sets itself up against the Divine will. The doubt, the fear, the unrest, the despondency and melancholy of men now, as in Saul's time, have their root in want of obedience to God. He gives us a place to fill; we may fill it regardful of self, and regardless of him, or we may fill it as his servant. In the latter case, his spirit will be with us enlightening and sustaining us ! In the former, mysteries will perplex us, doubts will befog us. Regeneration, the birth from above of the soul, by the life of God entering into it. This is the teaching of this great poet, and the teaching also of the Christ from whose teachings he learned so much. And so we may say, as with the poet, 'All's love, but all's law.'
