SURRENDERED Thus runs a postal card from Dr. Miller: Chittenden, Dec. 28,1874. Dear Elder Evans : Your article on Spiritualism in Tribune, Dec. 26, is just at hand. You are all sound on the genuineness of some of these manifestations ; I have been through it â€” have been with the Eddys ten days. They are as true as steel: the truth about them has not half been told. I differ with you on the subject that Spiritualism is not a Jleligion, but a Science. I think it is the Science of Religion. The Eddys have captured me, soul, body, and spirit; old things have passed away, and all things have become new. Yours, Eli Miller
