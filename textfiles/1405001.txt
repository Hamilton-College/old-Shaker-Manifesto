RELIGION. MARIA WITHAM. Can religion be illustrated and its power brought to bear upon the world apart from its manifestations as an indwelling principle of life in the heart? People may be suspicious of our sincerity, but a religious life forbids suspicion and puts doubt at a disadvantage. No science can ward it off. We acknowledge the truth and claim those divine principles which are effectual in bringing the heart and life into such perfect sympathy, that all Avho are governed by them, present to the world the image of godliness.
