About Coal Experiments have been made with a view to ascertain the amount of loss coal undergoes when exposed to the weather. It will, perhaps, surprise many readers to hear that the loss is considerable. Anthracite and cannel-coal, as might be anticipated from their compactness, suffer least; but ordinary bituminous coal loses nearly one-third its weight and nearly one-half its gas-making quality. From this it will be understood that coal should be kept dry and under cover, and that to expose it to rain or damp is to lessen its quantity and weaken its quality.
