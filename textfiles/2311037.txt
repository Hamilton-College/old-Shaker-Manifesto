In Memory of Sister, ELIZABETH COPLEY. Maria Witham. Life's reaper has gathered our Sister, From earth ï¿½n&gt;! her frail house of clay, Though in summer time she has heen garnered, We feel her loved presence to-day. Let us pause for a moment, and dwell on this solemn occasion. Our hearts are filled with sorrow to part with one after another of those we love; and also to see the numbers decreasing in our Zion home, that help to sustain the glorious cause. Our Sister has spent her life with Believers, and we trust her reward is to the faithful who possess an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ. We shall miss her in our home circle, and the school-room where her labors were cheerfully given to the young. They are passing away, our dearest friends, and their earthly sufferings are over; we soon must follow, and the summons to that peaceful shore may be near. Are we ready? Only the present moment has actual being. We all have the same privilege to right our wrongs, and there is no victory without a conflict. If life had no crosses, nor trials, we should never be willing to leave it; nor should we grow wiser and better by the polishing process. Earthly things are not perpetual. We think much of this world, but how insecure are its hopes and wishes and lofty ambitions. The surety of a thing, is the enjoyment of it. To be firmly anchored on the true foundation, is the condition of happiness and peace, which will abide forever. Forever. Ah! the word is full of meaning, and associated with an endless future and also with a ceaseless flow of unalloyed delight, to those who are prepared for the inheritance of the just and faithful while here in time.
