THINGS WORTH FORGETTING ALICE CHADWICK There are a great many things in the common course of social life which deserve to be instantly and forever forgotten. It is hard to forget a harsh word that has been spoken to us, but if we forgive and take it as a lesson not to do the same to others, it would sometimes prove a blessing. Perhaps we have noticed that many speeches become mischievous only by being heard a second time; for they are exaggerated when repeated ; but if they could have been forgotten they would have caused no trouble at all. Dr. Livingstone says : ' The person that can let drop all the burrs and thistles instead of picking them up and fastening them on the next passenger, is worthy of a blessing.' Such have many friends and are loved and appreciated by all who know them; their cheerful countenances bespeak what is in the heart ; they promote the happiness of all within the compass of their influence and are always happy themselves, for nothing makes such persons happier than to be surrounded by ardent friends. We may think that it is natural for some to be more amiable than others ; but if we do the best we can, we shall be loved. We all know that we can see the faults of others sooner than we can observe our own. If we could only forget the injuries,and think of]the good that has been done, we should feel better than if we brought them to mind every time we feel unkindly toward the persons who caused them. But this we should remember, that the happiness of our whole life depends on the cultivation of a good disposition. Enfield, Conn.
