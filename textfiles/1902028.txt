UNITY. Mrs. F. O. Hyzer. God of the Crescent and the Cross, God of the Gentile and the Jew, Source of all recompense and loss Through all the old and all the new ; Thy revelations on me shine Where'er a knee to Thee doth dow, For part of every faith is mine And part of mint is every vow. God of the arch-celestial spheres, God of the deepest depths of hell, Though earth be swept by fl ods of tears Or tides of rapture o'er her swell, Thou art the cause of all effect, Thine the effect of every cause, Since man's devotion or neglect Can never break Thy changeless laws. God of the fire that burns and glows Within the human brain and soul, Refining matter till it knows And feels Thine infinite control; Nameless, Thy children name Thee still, Boundless, they seek to bind Thy thought And limit Thy eternal will To self-conviction inly wrought. Denying while they own Thee still, Believing while they yet deny, Obeying evermore Thy will While in their madness they'd defy; Changeless Thou art thro' ceaseless change, For transmutations but reveal Of truth a broader, higher range Which fact and circumstance conceal. Lost in Thy life, myself I find Impersonal, yet one with Thee I blend with Thy eternal Mind As drops commingle with the sea, And like the drops I seek the sky Attracted by Love's cloudless sun, Again in ocean's breast to lie When day her royal course hath run. Or yet to linger in the cloud, To feel the fierce tornado's sway, Or when have ceased the thunder loud To glitter in the rainbow's spray; But whereso^'er my pathway lie I throb in Thy eternal heart, 0 Love Divine, since I am I Forevermoiv because Thou art. Thus conscious of my right divine, Of such inheritance the heir 1 find my sire at every shrine, And claim my kindred everywhere ; His Love and Wisdom on me shine Where'er in prayer a knee doth bow, For part of every faith is mine, And part of mine is every vow.
