One J. C. Mann has written... One ' J. C. Mann has written a most astounding Letter in answer to a Shaker ' so runs the heading of an article in the Mirror Supplement. The letter from this little Mann is remarkable more for its multiplicity of words without the establishing of any fact, than for anything else. There are a great many writers who are so selfishly bigoted that they assume the liberty to denounce all who may differ from their narrow conception of righteousness. That he is gifted in calling people bad names, is not in the least strange. Some entertain the idea that coarse language is stronger than correct English and use it from choice. ' A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. ' The little Mann seems to be quite a judge, and while he is 'all right' and can teach others, he pronounces their writings, 'the work of Satan, and without common sense. ' Of course he knows that if it does not agree with his sense it is not common sense. Yea, that is a nice discrimination and remarkable judgment for a little Mann. (Ed.) Ed.
