History of the English people A. GOOD CYCLOPEDIA. We have heretofore published notices referring to the publication of Green's famous 'History of the English People,' which is issued by The Useful Knowledge Publishing Company, of New York. Besides its issue in five handsome 'Elzevir' volumes, and in one 'Model Octavo' volume, it forms a portion of the Cyclopedia of History, which is being published by the same house. The plan of the Cyclopedia of History is that it shall contain, unabridged, the great standard works of such authors as Green, Macaulay, Grote, Carlyle, Creasey, Schiller, Mommsen, Gibbon, anJ others, with such additions by the editors and special writers as will be necessary to make the Cyclopedia complete and universal in character; unity and convenience of consultation being secured by the publication of the 'World's Index of Knowledge' in connection with it.
