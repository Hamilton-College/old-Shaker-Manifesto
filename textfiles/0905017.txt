The Living Issue It is clearly apparent to every thinking individual that secta rian bigotry and the lines of theological separation are being dissolved by that better religious element — Common Sense,— and men are looking above the mists of mere denominationalisms to see who is living the best, most Godly life. The living issue is to take precedence of mere profession; while his theology is right, whatever it is termed, whose life is righteous ? If Christ's life is the standard, the theology which teaches and demands a similar life of us is the correct one; and before it, let empty theological professions vanish.
