WHAT I KNOW ABOUT BOTANY. First I will tell about the liose. Our gardens are growing beautifully with them, and the pink wild'rose begins to blossom in the fields and by the roadside where we love to go and get them. There is much to learn about the rose family. It is a pretty flower, and related to it are many plants and trees that you will be surprised and interested to find classed with the pretty rose. Many flowers resemble each other very much, because they are made from them. Some flowers we find in our home walks and pleasant woods, and then, away in a distant State in a field, or upon a mountain-side, grows its own sister or a near relative. There are books that would aid you in finding these wandering families, though of course you do not expect to see every plant that makes each one, yet there are plenty for us to visit and compare, quite within our reach. Each Summer God's goodness gives us back these lovely roses, and we may be sure that all the rose-like plants are cared for by Him who cares for all. Now I will explain a rose. I will take the little wild one, for it is a real rosï¿½. A large double one is not in its natural state, on account of its cultivation. It has five pink petals a tuft of little golden things in the center called stamens. Now there is a certain tree which has a flower that looks very much like little roses. Strange as it may seem to you, this tree is an apple tree 'vith its little roses. They have five rosy petals, and a cluster of paler stamens than the wild rose. This is only one but there are the pear, quince, cherry, a peach too, all delicious fruits, whose flowers resemble roses clustered together. These silky, pink Damasks came originally from Syria; the little yellow Scotch are British; the hundred leafed and Moss came from southern Europe, and the pure white from Germany. So you see you are looking at a rose many times when you do not know it. I. M. F.
