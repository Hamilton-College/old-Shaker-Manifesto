RETROSPECT AND FAREWELL. A TRIBUTE TO D. CLINTON BRAINARD. By Cecelia DeVere. We knew for many a day that death might come And breathe his strange weird music in thy ear, Or strike the harp of life and make it dumb Before thy thought had any pulse of fear. But when it came we felt the sudden pain And awe that mingles sorrow with surprise, The sharpness of the tension-weight of strain That he can bring upon our tenderest ties. And tender were the ties that formed the bond With thee our brother, tender, close and strong, Yet with reliance on the world beyond We say to grief 'Thy time is not for long!' The law of sorrow has its work to do, We must accept it in its highest sense, The storms of winter late in fury blew, But bloom of promise now is recompense. We could not penetrate the dreary cloud, But trust and memory taught of coming spring, We may not pierce these heavy glooms that shroud, Yet faith and gratitude their solace bring. We were sustained through trials hard to bear, Let us give thanks, and ask for aid anew, Let us bow down in sweet dependent prayer, Let us again our covenant renew. Our loss is great, our brother stood the tests That challenge all who tread the upward way, Met them sublimely, there the glory rests That made his life a blessing and a stay. The ancients of the people oft recalled The little child that into wonders pried, The gentle youth by faith and duty walled. The manhood lofty in its native pride. Named for the Governor�-his father's friend� Endowed with statesman's dignity and grace, With kindred proud who glad their powers would lend To lead him on to wealth, to fame and place. 'Twas thus the kingdoms of the world were spread Beneath ambition's mountain, and the voice Of the old luring tempter archly plead, Yet he lookt up and made his heavenly choice. Again when war produced the torturing draft, And men were mad with valor, greed and fear, Some called him 'Captain,' while they mocking laughed And claimed him as 'recruiting volunteer.' But still he walked unharmed, aloof, serene, His mind his fortress and his faith his tower, From which the will of God for earth was seen, From which he saw the dragon's cruel power. His first brave leaders past the mystic bound, Companions sometimes faltered, fell or died, Yet with the true he firmly held his ground. And on the truth his inner soul relied. We give him honor such as angels prize, And wealth of love that earth could never buy; Happy his place among the pure and wise And bright the fields that now before him lie. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
