STEADFASTNESS. If true to God And true to one another, Doth not insure a blessing And a joy,� Where shall we look, My Sister and my Brother? Or what shall be Our otherwise employ? The earth may tremble 'Neath my feet, and tread, The clouds may gather And the tempest break,� Yet true to God And true to one another, I hold secure And new exertions make. M. W.
