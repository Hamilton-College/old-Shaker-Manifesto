THE WAR SPIRIT The ease with which the war spirit is aroused in this country fills us with dismay. It says little for the reality and depth of the hold which religion has upon the life of the nation. Assuredly, boasting of our advance in civilization and Christianity little becomes us, but rather shame and confusion of face. â€”Methodist Recorder.
