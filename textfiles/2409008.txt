MY PRAYER. By Amelia J. Calver. Father I pray. I do not know my needs, I only know I have a void within which Thou canst fill. And whatso'er the cup Thou givest me, I'll press unto my lips, and let it work Salvation in my soul. I do not know the way Which leadeth to the hights my soul would climb But trusting Thee as I have trusted e'er, Since first I cast my lot and took the staff The pilgrim's staffI'll follow on o'er hill And vale, where'er I hear thy still small voice, Until I reach another hight attained Unto by perfect trust, which overlooks The wayward windings of the past and gives Me sight to see still other hights beyond Which I must reach. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
