INFLUENCE OF LOVE MARIA. WITHAM As the sun of the natural world warms the flower into life and beauty, so the spirit of man receives from the great fountain of divine love, the warmth which animates it into action. This quickening spirit of love is the essence of our beings ; it flows from God into our souls, and forms a part of our lives. If love, then, is the essential principle of our beings( it is very important that we understand its nature and quality. Mankind partake of animal love, but with it we also partake of an inner, spiritual love, which is angelic in its perfection. As all sin comes from love of self, we should seek above all things, that power which lifts us above the realm of self, and its evils, into that heavenly sphere, where love is characterized by purity of word and deed. By the power of this spirit, victory over evil is gained, and the power of the enemy laid low. Love in purity brings from within itself all that our heavenly parents can bestow. Unto God give all thy thoughts, and in thy actions he shall be glorified, and in his love thou shalt be rewarded. Light and love— the intelligent eye, and kind heart of God — twin sisters in holiness, decorate the brow of their sterner brother truth, with heaven's choicest garlands. Love and wisdom smooth the rugged road, and make the sandy desert to bloom as a heavenly resting place for the heaven-bound pilgrim. Without God's love there is no harmony.
