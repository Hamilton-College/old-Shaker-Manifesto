The man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder... Carlyle: The man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder ; a waif, a nothing, a no man. Have a purpose in life, if it is only to kill and divide and sell oxen well, but have a purpose; and having it, throw such strength of mind and muscle into your work as God has given you.
