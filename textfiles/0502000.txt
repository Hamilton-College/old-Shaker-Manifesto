EDITORIAL CORRESPONDENCE Editor Tribune : Will you publish a paper in response to two remarkable editorials, ' Katie King,' of the Tribune, and ' How to investigate Spiritualism,' in the Scientific American, of even date ? The Shaker Order has ' business relations with the outlying world, with which your Railroads, Steamboats and Telegraphs do not connect.'—Will you give the (Shakers a voice ? Spiritualism and Geology are Sciences— Not Religions. The Shakers have studied Spiritualism, for a century, and put it to the practical uses of life. We have been patiently waiting for your over-wise people, to become scientific enough to hear and investigate its facts — to prove all things, Spiritualism included. We came to New York, to help you, and the press received us liberally — gave good notice of our Stein way Hall Meetings, of Nov. 22. But the Reporters, with the exception of the Tribune and Republic, utterly failed to tell the truth, or to refrain from gross misrepresentation. If the Editors and the Eddys are no more honestly dealt by, through the Reporters, than are the Shakers, Editors may learn that they know nothing yet, as they ought to know it, about either Spiritualism, or Shakerism. I will send a corrected, printed proof slip of the article. Please reply, 'Yes.' We will not undertake to publish all manner of crazy reports... 'Yes.' We will not undertake to publish all manner of crazy reports from credulous people who fancy that they have seen Ghosts. But we recognize Elder Evans as a man of ability, and shall be glad to give him any reasonable hearing. Ed. Tribune
