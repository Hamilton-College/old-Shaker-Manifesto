LIFE'S TREASURE CATHARINE ALLEN Like balmy Soutli winds in the early Spring, That help the myriad buds their casements burst; And like the perfumed freshness showers bring, When earth is parched, and nature droops with thirst, Pure love doth come to me. Like warbles heralding the break of day, And cheering us life's duties to pursue, And like their pensive notes at twilight grey, When falls on leaf and bud the cooling dew, Are words of love to me. And like the violets blooming in the grass, Which brightly covers o'er the faded sodâ€” That greet with smiling welcome those who pass, E'en though some heedless feet have on them trod, Is angel love to me. And like the fragrance of the opening rose, Whose treasure unto all is freely given, A beauteous life that silently outflows, As ministrations borne to us from heaven, Love's breathings fall on me. Each gentle deed, and every kindly thought, I**to my soul a messenger of good ; Far more than gems, or gold from Ophir brought, I prize the gift of angel sisterhood. Whose love doth flow to me. The severing of earthly ties and kin, Though fraught with trial, and with pain severe, And sacrifice of e'en the life within, I ne'er will count, if gospel friends so dear With love encircle me I'll humbly walk the straight and narrow way, And oft will seek the silent vale of prayer, Through self-denial strive each coming day So true to be, as worthily to share The love bestowed on me. A shield that from all harm my soul will keep; A light to guide me through the shadowy vale; And staff to help me climb the rugged steep A living fount, whose waters never fail, I've proved this love to be. It giveth holy courage to the heart, And strength that crowns with victory the strife, All radiant in truth, it doth impart A joy, forever new in endless life, This power of love so free. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
