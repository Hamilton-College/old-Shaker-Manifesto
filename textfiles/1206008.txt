A DREAM MARTHA J. ANDERSON gr. I dreamed that a beautiful summer Sprang from the winter drear ; The air was soft and balmy, And the sky serene and clear. The grass was as smooth as velvet, And out of the rich dark earth : Came plants of rarest beauty, And gems of floral birth. The birds were blithe in the sunshine, And sang mid the foliage green; While trees with blossoming fragrance Waved in the sunny sheen. Sweet vines o'er the fence were climbing; And shrubs by the wayside grew, All laden with snow-white flower*, And gleaming with pearly dew. A mellow haze was circling The distant wooded hills, And a sound of joyful music Came from a thousand rills. The kine on the slopes were feeding; Sheep, necked the meadows gay, Where with the gold-eyed daisies, Were dallying winds at play. A sense of rapturous beauty Over my spirit fell; And the glory of that fair season, Seemed an enchanting spell. But, there cometh a meaning Out of that vision bright, Clear as the morning shineth All in its golden light. A season of full fruition Of all our prayer and hope, Will, like a beautiful summer, In heavenly glory ope. And the good seed sown by angels Will come to a perfect birth ; For the sun of truth is meltingâ€” The frigid locks of earth. Methinks I feel the breezes, Warm as the south-land breath, The glow of inspiration That calls new life from death. And the types of gifts supernal, Pictured in earth's ideal, Will in the good time coming, Prove to our spirits real. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
