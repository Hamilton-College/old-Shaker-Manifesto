Briggs. Sept. 1891, We are now quite certain that the summer is past, and the harvesting of many things has ended for this season, but the part that has special reference to beingsaved will be reserved till next time. During the past few weeks we have had sad forebodings of a failure in the potato crop, as in several instances there has been evidence of premature decay. As the early crop was touched with the disease, we thought that our foreknowledge would readily determine the state of the later crop. We now have a more favorable report, and shall wait through hope. We have had an evolution or a revolu'tion in the coming of ovens. In 1837 our fathers built a large oven of free-stone, and for many years it was thought to be one ï¿½ of the best, and was in daily use baking the best of bread and pies', etc. etc., till 1865 when it began to depreciate in value and soon gave place to one of the galvanized iron ovens. After the pleasure of the change was over, this oven proved objectionable from the volume of heat that escaped as' the large doors were opened. The next change gave us a large square free-stone oven, surrounded by another of brick and heated by a stove placed in the rear and under the floor of the oven. Within this oven were four revolving cast iron disks which were reached by four doors at the front. As the wheels or disks were laid horizontally, the several doors in front were quite narrow and but little heat escaped when any one of them should be opened. The chimney was directly over the oven and as the draft proved to be defective from the first, this was charged as the cause of its failure. In a few years this oven was remodeled but without any marked improvement. A stove was placed inside of the oven, in order to obtain a quicker heat, but with the heat came more or less smoke and to this the bakers objected. The top of the oven was taken off and the flue enlarged. All this work did little good and it was decided to remove the whole of the chimney and the oven and begin anew. This time the chimney was built, having its foundation laid on stone work and the oven placed as near the chimney as consistent. In appearance this oven bears a close resemblance to the last one. The heating apparatus has been improved and the structure is now a nice, triple oven. The outer one is of brick; within this is an oven of blocks of free-stone and the inner or third oven is made of galvanized This last change has been at a cost of nearly three hundred dollars, but the oven has been in daily use for several weeks and up to date is pronounced a success. Elder George at Enfield Ct. has had a corresponding experience with the oven built at that place and of whom we received our first patterns. He thinks it is not best to say very much at present, about his improvements, which gentle hint need not be lost in our case, as we shall probably hear from him at no distant day. A company of five Sisters have recently made a visit to the Society at Enfield, N. H. and have returned with glowing accounts of a beautiful place, where many near and dear gospel friends. * live
