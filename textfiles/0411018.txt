Editor's Desk, August 19, 1874 Dearly Beloved Mother Eunice — I have just read critically your letter and accompanying article, of the 16th inst., to Eldress Ant'e. They impress me on this wise, that Eunice is a genuine Shaker, who has the life of God in her own soul. A. child and sister of Mother Ann. You have life in yourself as she had. You have not only heen baptized with the Christ Spirit, but have traveled — increased with the increase of God. You have not gone to sleep on the enchanted ground—'the success of the first cycle. You heard and obeyed the voice of the first thunder — testimony. And now you hear the voice of the second thunder beginning to sound. What a blessing to you! And what a blessing you are to the work of God in thus connecting the past and the present — the first and second degrees. While it is unreasonable to expect those of the first degree to be pioneers in the second, their blessing is heavenly. Of all the thousands who came out of Egypt only two entered Canaan. Only two retained the life of God in their souls to that degree, that they could be leaders in the army of the Lord, to fight the new class of enemies of the Lord in the land of Canaan — the Promised land itself ! !
