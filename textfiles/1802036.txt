Juvenile. Orcutt, Beloved Elder :--Allow me to say to you this fine morning... Shaker Village, N. H., Feb. 1888'. Daniel Orcutt, Beloved Elder :�-Allow me to say to you this fine morning that we find ourselves at Canterbury still giving thanks for the countless temporal and spiritual blessings which seem to environ as. Among the most noteworthy of these let us mention the kind encouraging words, and the virtuous influences, which reach us so often through the columns of the little Manifesto. And you must not be surprised if we send to you personally a special tribute of thanks from the youthful class, which you will please accept. Your manifest interest in their mental and spiritual growth is very apparent and has been felt and realized in the many instructive letters which you have kindly addressed to them through the medium just mentioned. I trust that we need not quote scripture to prove that yourself and many other worthy contributors to our paper, are entitled to a special expression of gratitude from the many readers. You are, no doubt, already aware of what is stated in 2 Cor. ix., 6, 7, and of its personal application ; thus�'� lie which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully'�and again, ' God loveth the cheerful giver,' therefore you must easily be convinced that our special tribute is mailed to the right address. As we are all learners in the school of Christ we must also all become children agreeably to his teachings if we would enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Thus v,':' include ourselves always in that class whom you are wont to favor with good advice. A significant jtliought in one of your letters most seriously impressed me. It was this.� ��While you are wai.ingfor opportunities to come, present opportunities are passing away forever:' Could we all properly realize this truth how many golden moments would be saved to us! Another pertinent saying re curs to me by a certain writer who said 'A wealthy man who obtains wealth honestly and uses it rightly is a great blessing to any community.' So I think that the individual who is rich toward God having obtained a spiritual competence by honest soul labor even while he toils for an earthly subsistence is by far the more wealthy of the two, and the more useful in Society. In this light we view those progressed individuals who always have some good spiritual gift to give to the hungrj poor. It has been my happy privilege to dwell with many worthy characters who are thus rich toward God and who are daily sowing the seeds of virtue in youthful hearts; and they too whose lives are so hid with Christ in God that their good deeds can never be numbered in Time, but Eternity keeps the record. Now, dear Elder, please accept our offering and feel blest in the efforts you have made for the youthful readers of today. That you will realize some satisfactory results from your labors of love, in the future, is our latest petition. Please accept with this an expression of kind regards from all within our home circle, which includes the whole household of Brethren and Sisters. Jennie H. Fish. PRAY FOR THE CHILDREN Marianne Farningham You know what life will bring them Of sorrow and of care ; You know the world has burdens, And each must take a share. The sun will oft be hidden, The storms will often come, Before the children enter The safety of 'the home.' But you, for sorrow sighing, Because you have no power To give them strength or shelter In the coming trial hour, Should need remember gladly That God, the Mighty One, Can aye defend the children, Until their course is run. And though you cannot save them From the sorrows of the way, You have a Mighty Helper Who hears whene'er you pray; And though the path be gloomy, Or the torrent deep and wide, He will support the children By keeping at their side. God will protect the helpless, And he will ever be The friend of those who labor, And set the captives free; His hand shall be upon them, To strengthen and to bless, He never will forsake them, Nor leave them comfortless. So, if you love the children, Take them in prayer to him, Beseech his love and mercy, For days or bright or dim; And he will turn and listen, And he will heed the cry, And this the great prayer-blessing Shall reach them silently. Oh, do not sigh for sorrow, That little you can do, For by your prayers prevailing, There is a power in you Which still shall bless the children When you have passed away, And never more shall leave them Till the dawning of heaven's day. So take the children early To the gentle Master's feet, And he shall teach them ever ^he lessons that are meet; And he will give them shelter, And he will be their friend Till the need of prayer is over, And all their troubles end. London S. S. Times. THE BROOK THAT RAN INTO THE SEA. 'O little Brook' the children said, ' The sea has waves enough; Why hurry down your mossy bed To meet his welcome rough? 'The Hudson or the Oregon May help his tides to swell: But when your few bright drops are gone, What has he gained, pray tell? ' I run for pleasure, ' said the brook, Still running, running fast; 'I love, to see you bend and look, As I go bubbling past. ' I love to feel the wild weeds dip ; I love your ringers light, That dimpling from my eddies drip, Filled with my pebbles bright. ' My little life I dearly love, Its shadows and its shine ; And all sweet voices that above Make melody with mine. ' But most I love the mighty voice Which calls me, draws me so, That every ripple lisps 'rejoice!' As with a laugh I go. ' My drop of freshness to the sea In music trickles on; Nor grander could my welcome be Were I an Amazon. ' And if his moaning wave can feel My sweetness n^ar the shore, E'en to his heart the thrill may steal;� What could I wish for, more? ' The largest soul to take love in Knows how to give love best; So peacefully my tinkling din Dies on the great sea's breast. 'One heart encircles all that live, And blesses great and small; And meet it is that each should give His little to the All. Selected.
