The Ladies' Home Journal A territory of 271,000 square miles, comprising Washington, Idaho and Oregon as they are to-day, was saved to the Union by one man. He had the courage and heroism to ride on muleback for three thousand miles. The ride was thrilling, the trials and hardships marvelous, the result a glorious one. The whole story, beautifully illustrated, will be given in the November issue of The Ladies' Home Journal, under the title, 'When Dr. Whitman Added Three Stars to our Flag,' the closing and most intensely interesting article in the Journal's successful series of 'Great Personal Events.' The first women to cross the Rockies figure in the story, which proves beyond a doubt that they preceded Fremont, the 'Pathfinder,' by six years.
