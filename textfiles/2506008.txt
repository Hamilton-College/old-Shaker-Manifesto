Vincens Hansens, Our Kind Friend... East Canterbury, N. H. April, 1895. VlNCENS HANSENS, Our Kind Friend ;Your letter of Feb. 23rd received and by no means has been forgotten. The remittance also received and the papers sent as requested. Agreeably to your request, one of the Sisters addressed a kind letter to the lady of whom you wrote several weeks ago, hoping thereby to open a correspondence if agreeable to her but we still wait a reply. We are happy to learn that The Manifesto proves a messenger of glad tidings, in your household. We think it should be as a burning and shining light which by its illuminating power and testimony of truth is able both to judge and save the lost. The pure gospel of Christ in the combined excellence of its first and second appearing will, we believe, eventually shake the whole earth; then will the ripened grain fall into the garner of God. The end of the world will come to those by whom the new life in Christ is accepted and lived. How can one who reads the prophecy in Matt, xxiv., 6, and compares it with the signs of the present fail to believe that its fulfillment is near,even at the very door. A powerful manifestation of the increasing wrork of God seems inevitable to meet the moral and spiritual needs of the present. The pioneer Shakers or Believers in Christ's second appearing were accused of breaking up family ties. 'Was it the Shakers or the truths of the gospel of regeneration which created this revolution? Making the old commandments of none effect, thus placing the soul in a position where it will be possible to love God with might, mind and strength. Wherever this condition is reached the Savior's word in Matt, x., M, will no doubt be verified. Then 'the oue may be taken and the other left.' We seem to read between the lines of your epistle a sincere hungering and thirsting for spiritual nourishment, 'the bread and water of life' and bid you God speed in your efforts to secure the soul-sustaining food. May you be encouraged to maintain the 'everlasting right.' As a Church we sincerely cherish the spiritual welfare of all such in our daily prayers. 'He that endureth to the end the same shall be saved,'endureth to the end of all controversy with the truth which is to free us from the thralldom of worldly principles. A spiritual Christian Church is established on the earth. The house is set in order promised by the Comforter. That the Christ spirit may be manifest in every individual claiming to be a follower thereof, is our fervent desire ; while our universal prayer is ; 'Hasten the time, when the laborers shall be, Many in thy vineyard, Lord, Sowing and reaping the harvest for thee Filled with the power of thy word.' We fully agree with your statement that it will be no easier to live the 130 THE MANIFESTO. Christ life in a future state. We believe that greater glory will crown such as deny self, while it is in their power to be ruled thereby. No soul c;in be justified in defening the day of salvation, by self-crucifixion, after hearing distinctly the call of the good Shepherd,'Follow thou me.' We realize the momentous work of the mission we have undertaken, to represent practically the principles of the Christ life. Whenever you think of our Church and its people you must feel assured that as all good is related, you are entitled by good efforts to a place in our visible kingdom of heaven on earth for we think an entrance thereto may be as accessible in Norway, as in New Hampshire, but we will do our part iu prayer to extend the bond of Christian fellowship across the wide waters, as no distance can saver the union of the spirit. Last but not least we express the kind love and remembrance of our Brethren and Sisters to the worthy mother and children. Respectfully, Sarah F. Wilson.
