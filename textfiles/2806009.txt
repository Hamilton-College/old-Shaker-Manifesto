Shaker Station, Conn. North Family. May, 1898. Mark our ways, how noiseless A)l, and sweetly voiceless, Tho the March winds pipe to make our passage clear; Not a whisper tells Where our small seed dwells, Nor is known the moment green whan our tips appear. We thread th? earth in silence, In silence build our bowers, And leaf by leaf in silence show, till we laugh atop sweet flowers. Again the earth has donned her emerald robe, and seems to have quite forgotten the pure mantle she so recently wore. Cherry-trees are white with bloom, and peach-trees promise a harvest. The orchards are much improved by the skillful use of the pruning-knife. Fruit trees past their days of bloom, and others unserviceable have been hewn down, and in their s,tead have set out one hundred and ten cherry and plum trees. We have also set out a large bed of asparagus. Our Sister Florence Staples who was so successful in the cultivation of currants in Canaan, has already commenced her favorite employment with five-hundred slips. Future prospects are bright. 'We fear not the coming time,' but while we are progressing and prospering in temporal affairs, we earnestly pray that we may not slight the spiritual; as it is for the growth 92 THE MANIFESTO. of the spirit, and for the attainment of all virtue, that we have banded ourselves together and we serve the Lord with gladness.
