Enfield, N. H. Aug. 1896. Veky acceptable is the endorsement of those New York physicians, as given in the previous Manifesto, that a life of chastity is the best remedy to annihilate existing evils. What better declaration could be given in favor of our doctrine, from those not of our Order: 'Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect.' The great, generous Creator of all good, freighted this world with mineral, wood and floral wealth for the benefit of mankind; and as we appreciate the products of the earth, surely the grander gifts of the Infinite should be desired, to obtain which, the cultivation of the virtues of Christ must be given thought to, as readily as the educational, domestic or mechanical work entered upon, if satisfactory results in spiritual growth would be obtained. As usual at this season of the year, a walk through our village would reveal to the observer the Sisters busy with domes tic and educational affairs, also the making of fancy work for sale. Brethren con cerned with mill work, business, trading and gardening. Quite a heavy and very creditable job has recently been done at our Office horse barn, wholly by the young brethren, in the relaying of the floor, and the rebuilding of the stalls for the horses. All, we trust, are especially concerned about the sacred responsibility entailed upon us as a Church to let our light so shine that others seeing our works may know that there are joys of the Spirit unknown to the selfish or sensual and duties of life which only a God-loving mortal-loving and service-loving soul can perform. George H. Baxter.
