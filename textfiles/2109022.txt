Enfield, Conn. Aug. 9, 1891. Everything passing smoothly with us gives reason for thankfulness. Our efforts on the farm have prospered. Eye has been garnered and threshed, proving a good yield. Oats are cut and ready to get in. Potatoes are large and fair, yielding fairly well. Blackberries are plentiful and large. Canning them for winter has taken much time and labor, without which nothing can be accomplished. We have more than we can use and are selling some. The weather is warm and dry. The present month thus far is more like summer than was July; the nights and mornings of that month were very cool. Repairing has been going on about engine and boiler house and other buildings. An excellent spring has been cleaned out and bricked around, so as to put in usable condition. Seeding down to grass and putting in rye are in progress. It is hoped all the land that will be in cultivation next year will be plowed this fall. A pleasant ride through Forrest Park was very much enjoyed by all the members of the South Family one cool day the past month. M. Witham.
