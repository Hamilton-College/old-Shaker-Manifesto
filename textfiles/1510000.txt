TESTIMONY OF ELIAB HARLOW. In consequence of the many vague and contradictory reports which have been spread abroad in the world concerning the first founders of this Society, many candid and respectable people have expressed a desire to receive from living witnesses, belonging to the Society, a true statement of facts respecting its first rise in this country, and especially concerning the character and manners, moral and religious, of the first founders and leaders. As I was one among the first who embraced the faith and tenets of the Society, and have had a general knowledge of the circumstances of its rise and establishment, and was intimately acquainted with Mother Ann Lee, and the first Elders and leaders, I shall endeavor to give a little sketch of j facts which came under my own observation at different times and places. Having received intelligence of a strange people living in the wilderness above Albany, who came from England, and who attracted considerable attention on account of the new and very singular religion which they professed, I felt an inclination to visit them. Accordingly, in the fore part of June, 1780, I set out one Saturday morning, in company with a number of other young people, to go and see them, with a view to attend their meeting the next day. As I was, at that time, about 18 years of age, of an airy turn of mind, and full of vanity, I did not go with the expectation of getting or seeing any good ; but merely to gratify my curiosity, as I had heard that they were exercised with singular and strange operations. But when I came to see the people and their worship, and heard their testimony and observed the remarkable operations which attended them, my mind was struck with the fear of God, and I was fully convinced that the power of God was there. Mother Ann's appearance seemed truly beauteous and heavenly, while walking the floor under the beautiful operations of the power of God : such Godly fear and heavenly love I never beheld in any person before. As my mind, at that time, was not biased with any kind of prejudice, neither in favor of the people nor against them, I could look on with an impartial eye, and felt able to judge with candor. The beautiful singing of Mother Ann so attracted my feelings that I was really delighted with it; and indeed no one could listen to it 'without admiration; even her very countenance could not but inspire a heavenly sensation. In passing by me, as she walked the floor, she turned to me and said, 'Young man, you must wait with patience; your time is not come yet. ' This she repeated several times, which inspired me with a feeling of reverential love. What it meant I could not then comprehend; but I kept my feelings from my companions. After returning home and reflecting on what I had seen and heard, I found that I was not yet prepared to take up a full cross against the world, the flesh and all evil, according to the testimony which Mother had held forth. I was very proud, and was not willing to let my faith and feelings be known to my nearest friends. So I went on, consulting my own feelings, and trying to pray to God and keep myself from sin ; but I found I was not able to resist temptations, and was frequently overcome in many ways, until I drew up a determination to take up my cross and confess my sins as soon as I could get a suitable opportunity. After this, I had power to resist temptations, which strengthened me in my resolution. Persecutions soon arose, and through the malicious influence of 'those who hated the cross, and were determined to put a stop to the increase of the work of God, Mother and the Elders were imprisoned in Albany, together with a number of leading characters who had embraced their faith, from New Lebanon. This prevented me from visiting them again until a little before Mother was separated from the rest of her companions, and sent to Poughkeepsie jail, when I visited them in prison, and still found them the same wonderful people, still bearing a powerful testimony against all sin, with a courage and fortitude which remained entirely unshaken by their imprisonment. Though confined within the walls of a prison, they could speak the word of God through the grates of the prison to multitudes of people with undiminished confidence in that divine authority by which they were commissioned. In this prison I had a privilege to fulfill my promise, and confessed my sins to one of the Elders. Ever after this I found increasing strength to bear a testimony to others, and to keep my justification and live in obedience to the instructions which I had received from Mother and the Elders. After they were released from prison, I had many opportunities with them at Watervliet, Harvard. Ashfield, Hancock New Lebanon and Stephentown ; and I always found their example to correspond with their teaching. They maintained an inflexible and undeviating testimony against all dishonesty, fraud, covetous- ness, injustice, slothfulness, idleness, hypocrisy, lies, lust, pride, fleshly affections, and intemperance of every kind. They taught us to be prudent and saving in all things that God had entrusted to our care: for (said they,) 'ï¿½ you cannot make one grain of corn, nor one spear of grass grow without the blessing ot God.' They taught these things by example as well as by precept; for they were remarkably prudent in all these things. Mother always manifested great concern for the protection of those who had set out to take up their crosses against a carnal nature, and follow Christ in the regeneration. Knowing that we were unskillful and unacquainted with the subtilities and wiles of Satan, and were exposed to be caught in his snares many ways, she spared no pains, day nor night, to teach us how to shun the snares ol the adversary. She would often speak to the young people after this manner : ' See that you do not lay temptations to provoke carnal desires in each other; but shun every appearance of evil. Ye young women, see that you behave modestly in all your manners before the young men, and in no wise entice them. And you young men, see that you lay no temptation before the young women, as they are the weaker vessel. But if they should be overcome iu their feelings, and offer themselves to you, stand ye like men of God, and teach them the consequences of those things, and save yourselves and them.' Mother also taught the married people to be careful, and see that they laid no snares for each other. 'But do your duty to each other in the fear of God, (said she,) and love one another as Christ loves the Church. Christ never had carnal knowledge of the Church ; so you must labor to subdue a carnal nature in yourselves ; and in so doing, you may be helps to each other. And be agreed to bring up your children in the fear of God, and be careful to govern them. See that while one is correcting a child, the other does not take the child's part; for that will spoil the child, and neither of you will be able to govern your children.' Thus did she instruct the married and the unmarried, each according to their situation and circumstances, and spared no pains to plant the principles of purity and righteousness in all. And all who were faithful and obedient to her instructions, found an increasing victory over the nature of evil, and proved the truth of her testimony by their own experience. Many evil reports have been circulated in the world against Mother and the Elders, in which they have been stigmatized as the basest of characters. Those who continued to obey the light of God revealed to them through Mother and the Elders, received the fruits of their labors, which are righteousness and peace, and a justified conscience. The truth is, Mother saw the loss of man to be in the lust of the flesh, and took up her cross against that fallen nature, iu all its branches, and labored in sufferings and cries to God for deliverance from it. She continued to labor for mortification and death to that nature until she found complete redemption from it, for all her conduct clearly showed it; and I have not the least doubt that she was so in the sight of a pure and holy God. Hence she was able to teach and lead other souls out of that corrupt nature ; and her testimony was like a naming sword against it in all its branches. This was so opposite to the nature and feelings of fallen man, that she and her testimony were both despised and hated. And this has been the cause of all the evil reports that have been spread abroad against her and her followers. I can testify that all those slanderous reports are without the smallest foundation in truth. When I take a view of the goodness of God in calling me from the course of the world, in the prime of life and in the height of youthful vanity, to take up my cross and embrace the gospel of Chriot's second appearance, through Mother Ann, I feel myself under the greatest obligations of thankfulness to God : for this gospel has saved me from the pollutions that are in the world through lust. And I am confident that the gospel which is able to save me from sin in this world, will save me from the punishment of sin, which is death and hell, in the world to come. By strict obedience to the orders and counsels which have been graciously given by Mother Ann, and those who have stood as her successors in the lead, I have found that degree of mortification and death to all carnal inclinations, that instead of feeling desirable, they are odious and loathsome to every feeling of my soul. And I can truly say, that the comfort and peace I daily enjoy in the gospel, more than repays me for all the crosses I have taken up, besides the assurance I feel of eternal happiness hereafter. Therefore I can testify by my own experience, to the truth of our Savior's promise : '' There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospel's, but he shall receive an hundred fold now in this time, houses and lands, brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life.' (See Mark x : 29, 30.) After having forsaken all for the gospel I have received an hundred fold of heavenly blessings and gospel union, with parents and elders, brethren and sisters, which I would not exchange for all the glory, riches and honors of this world.
