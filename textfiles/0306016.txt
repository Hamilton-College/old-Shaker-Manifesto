LIBERTY ' The sweet sound of liberty now is rolling: May it extend over mountain and plainT' That ' liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free 1' how it echoes and vibrates through the heart of every true Shaker! O the glorious Liberty of the Gospel! While reading the views of the Press, my soul breathes forth in prayer to Him ' avIio tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,' to strengthen and support the brave souls who dare to raise their voices against the evils of the present generation. The seed of the enemy is sown, and is rapidly bearing fruit. Yet, although mankind, in their natural wisdom and understanding, have followed in the paths of sin and wickedness, partaking of the fruits of evil, to which our first natural mother yielded, there is, at the present time, no excuse for continuing any longer therein. The day has dawned, when a spiritual Mother comes to our rescue; and we behold, in her, one who rooted out every evil seed from her own heart, thereby giving us a perfect example of -purity, to guide us onward through all the labyrinths of iniquity. Now the question arises: ' Have we not a right to proclaim our freedom throughout the length and breadth of the land, that others may hear the sweet sound, and gather to the standard of Liberty ? I hear the loud tones of response from our lovely ' JShakeress,' YEA! And my earnest prayer is, that the truths poured forth through your columns may ultimately find an abiding place in the heart of every woman; for I believe there are many women writhing beneath this ' yoke of bondage,' who, were it in their power, would gladly shake off their fetters. Lovely ' Shakeress,' I feel and know that I have a right to rejoice and dance — and will — ' with those that make merry ;' for whereas I was bound, now I am free. Rhoda Strowbridge, Enfield, Ct.
