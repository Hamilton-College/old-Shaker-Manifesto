Sabbathday Lake, Me. Nov. 6, 1892. We have just finished gathering in the harvest. Of winter apples we had an abundant supply. Christmas week the apple dealers are to take many bbls. away to the market. We receive $1.85 per. bbl. Plenty are left for family use until apples grow again and many bushels have been dried. To-morrow commences the cider making; from about 1,000 bushels of the smaller ones. The cider will be condensed five bbls. into one, and stored away for Shaker Apple Sauce of which we hope to have many orders from our customers during the winter. Our good friend Barker Holt and companion, of New Gloucester, came to visit us one day. They have always been very friendly to Believers. The children went to the Office to sing to them, and they in return instructed them very wisely. Friend Holt made a special prayer, asking God to bless and prosper the little ones and their teachers and indeed, all who were so kind as to take the children in and give them such a good home and loving care. The winter term of school commences the coming week. The house is all prepared, decorated with evergreens and fir boughs. Mottoes of autumn leaves and bright colored tissue paper are on the walls. Contrasting with the green it makes the room attractive. With all this to encourage us we hope to have a pleasant and successful term. These 'Notes' are the last for 1892, and now we will bid you farewell until we greet you in the New Year. A. S. C.
