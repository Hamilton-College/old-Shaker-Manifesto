CARPETS. We are glad that we are able to say that our home is once more almost free from the unhygienic carpet. Each year for some time past we have renewed or repaired one or more floors and dispensed with the carpet, and this year we have already discarded six, and hope to dispense with four more in the near future. Three of the rooms and one hall have double floors, laid to deaden sound. The upper floor is of hard pine, and all of the household are delighted to have the rooms free from these dust and filth collectors. In our double sitting-rooms we will not even have a rug. The filth and dust are not the worst features of wool carpets. There are particles of wool cut loose from them and floating in the air, and they are breathed into the nostrils. In a bright light o sunshine these particles of dust can be seen with the naked eye. Think of the breathing apparatus being clogged with such material, much worse and more irritating than earth dust and harder for the vital forces to remove. We hope our readers who are interested in and desirous of bringing better sanitary conditions about their homes will begin at once to free them from wool carpets. Perhaps the parlor or reception-room may be an exception, as it is not much used, but even the housekeeper or domestic must have hard labor and be filled with dust in caring for even that room. A nicely furnished, uncarpeted floor is more expensive at first than a carpet, but it lasts much longer than a carpet. If one does not feel able to lay a new floor, many old floors can be nicely painted with several coats, cracks and defects filled with putty, and a few bright rugs, if the mind will not be satisfied without, will make a clean, sweet, and a passably presentable floor.
