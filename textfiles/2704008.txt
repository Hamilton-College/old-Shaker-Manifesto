Shakers, N. Y. March, 1897. The poet Longfellow in his poem 'The Builders,' beautifully illustrates the unity of all the forces that emanate from the Divine mind. 'Nothing useless is, or low; Each thing in its place is best, And what seems but idle show, Strengthens and supports the rest.' The faculty that is termed the sense of beauty manifests itself in various forms to different minds. To some the beauty of flowers is the ideal to which they are attracted; some, of which our poet is an example, see it illustrated in varied forms and none can be rejected that tend to unify and exalt the life, bringing it nearer that universal mind, which from the crude material, is developing the beautiful and true. We can not but realize the unequal balance of life's necessities, when with the appalling famine in India our western farmers quote corn at eight cents per. bushel and are using it for fuel. When will the balance be adjusted? Echo answers, When? We can only realize with more clearness our own blessings and give our sympathy to the suffering altho unable to render them tangible assistance. To be able to view the problems of life seriously, does not imply that we should look1 at them with a sense of gloom and be misanthropic, but while realizing them in their importance take a cheerful, prospective view of the situation and look up through the clouds, to the sunlight of heaven. But with the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars that were recently spent on a dress ball in New York, the flaunting of such immense wealth in the face of gaunt poverty, rousing passions that will only give might the power to grasp it regardless of laws divine or human; to see the multitudes who are so absorbed in the rush after wealth as to give no thought to the many moral and social problems of life that are calling for adjustment, causes us to have serious thoughts as to the result.
