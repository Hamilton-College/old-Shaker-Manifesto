FAITH. By Annie B. Stephens. Into the solemn silence of the night, We lift our hands in calmest trust,not fear, And feel the strength of unseen forces near; A sheltering love encircles with its might, A light shines out upon the inner sight. The outer darkness may be dense and drear Yet even then we feel that God is here. And, with a child-like trust, we seek the light. Until by faith anointed, eyes were dim; We blindly groped the valley's shadowed way, Nor saw the glory of the mountain's rim, Nor blessed the hand that led from night to day; The stars may pale, but Faith's clear flame shall rise, Refulgent as the light of noon-day skies.
