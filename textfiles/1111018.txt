OUR CORRESPONDENCE EDITORIAL NOTES. Should we print one-half of the letters, referring with deepest regret to the subject of suspending The Manifesto, we should have room for nothing else. While we acknowledge with deep gratitude the appreciation of our own people as expressed to us, yet we wish we could better acknowledge our high admiration for so many kind and hopeful expressions that The Manifesto continue on its course, from so many individuals in every part of our country, and some from foreign lands. We were quite unprepared for, and truly affected by, so many messages of love and good will.
