Shaker Station, Ct. April 1896. 'Strive to enter in at the straight gate.' What a flood of happiness fills our souls when we have striven for overcoming power and feel that we are made better for those strivings. Constant, selfdenying efforts will insure us a sure passport to heavenly mansions. THE MA NIFES TO. It is our privilege to live so tli.it heavenly treasures will be ours. The first point is to start right, and keep in the heavenly pathwayit is plain. A virtuous life brings lasting peace but thousands prize it not. 'Virtue aione is happiness,' and happiness is heaven. Virtue is a bright jewel, richer than gold or precious gems. To obtain it, our hearts, which are the seat of principles, must be purified by the cross. Duties, in small things, as well as in great, are duties still. Row often are today's opportunities, to-day's privileges neglected, and time lost in anticipation of some good we are to gain in the future. Greater opportunities will not come tomorrow unless we are faithful to improve those that God has given us to-day. Let us be wary, watch and pray, and shun pitfalls. ****** * To obtain a good supply of eggs in winter we must have young hens. Pullets hatched in April or May will prove most satisfactory.
