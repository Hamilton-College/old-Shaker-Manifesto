Enfield, N. H. July, 1898. The firs|; f this month we had the honor of entertaining our friend, Honorable E. H. Cheney, editor of 'The Granite State Free Press,' of Lebanon, N. H. and ExConsul to Matanzas, Cuba. In the evening he gave us a very fine discourse, intersperst with many of his experiences while stationed in that beautiful, war-blighted island. As we think of the cruel power administered by the Spanish upon their subjects, can we do otherwise than hope that the Cubans will soon realize their longdreamed-of state of republicanism and personal freedom? Surely from out of the black war cloud now hovering over Spain's colonial possessions and our own country, we can believe that there will arise moral effects, enriching to each race, the consequence of a larger and better light of civilization and righteousness prevailing. On the evening of July 4, we gathered upon the lawn before our large Dwelling, which was well decorated with flags, as were also the fruit trees about, and enjoyed an entertainment of music and recitations, given by our little girls, after which, a collation of cake, ice-cream and berries was indulged in. Thus closed the 'glorious Fourth' of 1898, so eventful with national rejoicing. July 5, we again welcome Elder Henry C. Blinn, who was prevented by journeying 'into the valley of the shadow' from making Jiis regular visits to our Society, for a little while. We are also pleased to renew our relations with Elder William Briggs, and greet him-as the associate in office with Elder Henry. Our first service with them was fraught with gratitude for past blessings and petitions that added strength and zeal may be had, enabling us to work as the heart of one. George II. Baxter.
