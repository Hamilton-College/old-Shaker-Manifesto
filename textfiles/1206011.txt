DUTY In all the despatches of the Duke of Wellington, the word Glory so commonly used by Napoleon never occurs. Duty was with this great General, his watch-word, and his guiding star, and the greatest victories he achieved were but the discharge of the duties he owed to the British nation. So should it be with every battler in life, and more especially so with every soldier of the cross. To overcome evil, and to subdue the propensities of their natures is a duty they owe to themselves, and to exercise the beneficent influence of such a regulated nature is a duty they owe to others. The consciousness of having done our duty in the various relationships of life, will inspire youth, sustain old age, and smooth our passage to the tomb ; nor will it be asked in what particular garb or circumstances this duty has been performed. To all his faithful servants, the great Father of the human race will at last say ''well done.' j'What is our duty here? To tend From good to better, thence to best; Grateful to drink lifes' cup then bend, Unmurmuring to the bed of rest; Gathering the flowers that round us grow Scattering their fragrance as we go :' 'And so to live, that when the sun Of our existence fades in night; Memorials sweet of mercies done, SHAKER MANIFESTO. 131 May shroud our names in memories bright; And the blest seeds we scattered bloom A hundred fold in years to come.'
