TRUTH. RICHARD BUSHNELL. [Contributed by F. W. Evans.]The truth must be understanding^ and willingly received, sincerely believed and cordially obeyed or man cannot be spiritually regenerated, nor can the spirit of God's moral attributes be begotten in the soul. For God, in infinite wisdom, goodness and power, has so constituted things that it is impossible for this result to be effected by any oth. er means or in any other way. Consequently, the notion that the spirit of God can, as it were, like the electric or magnetic fluid, enter into man and by its own absolute power effect his spiritual regeneration, at any moment, without the instrumentality of truth, without the exercise of man's moral agency in heartily believing, loving and obeying the truth, is a dark delusive, anti-christian and superstitious doctrine. Truth is the foundation of virtue ; an habitual regard for it is necessary. He who walks by the light of it has the advantage of the noonday sun. He who would spurn it, goes forth amid clouds and darkness. There is no way in which a man strengthens his own judgment, and acquires respect, in society so surely as by a scrupulous regard for the truth. The course of such an individual is right on, straight on. He is no changeling, saying one thing to-day and another to-morrow. Truth to him, is like a mountain land-mark to the pilot, he fixes his eyes upon a point that does not move, and he enters the harbor in safety. On the contrary, one who despises it and loves falsehood is like a pilot who takes a piece of driftwood for his land-mark, which changes with every changing wave, on this he fixes his attention, and being insensibly led from his course, strikes upon some hidden reef, and sinks to rise no more. Truth brings success in our gospel travail, and yields peace to the. soul; falsehood results in ruin, misery and contempt. Therefore, truth is to be adored and obeyed, in all things. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
