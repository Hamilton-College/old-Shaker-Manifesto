Book Table Spurgeon's life and work We wish our space would permit of our doing justice to the most worthy firm of I. K. Funk, No. 10 and 12 Dey St., New York, but it will not. We beg of our friends to address the firm for a catalogue of their wonderfully cheap, but valuable publications. The last one received was ' Spurgeori's Life and Work,' price 20 cents ! and how such books can be sent for the money passes our comprehension, and at the same time meets our approbation ; for all their intentions are of a noble and nobler type, than simply the acquisition of money, for instruction of the valuable in literature is the special intention of these parties. Write for their catalogue. North American review The North American Review.â€” D. Ap pleton &amp; Co., New York, contains in its last number, Dec, a valuable article by an old friend, Ex-Secretary of the IT. S. Treasury, Boutwell, upon ' The Future of the Republican Parti/.' We would call attention to the value of the publication itself, which invariably contains deep digests of prevailing thoughts of the day. Religious telescope The Religious Telescope, of Dayton, 0., comes to us now in quarto form, like Christian Union, Christian at Work, Independent, etc. We are pleased very much with it, and with this change. We would suggest to all such an increase in their value, by cutting their edges, which can be done by small extra cost.
