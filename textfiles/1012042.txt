Religious telescope The Religious Telescope, of Dayton, 0., comes to us now in quarto form, like Christian Union, Christian at Work, Independent, etc. We are pleased very much with it, and with this change. We would suggest to all such an increase in their value, by cutting their edges, which can be done by small extra cost.
