SORROWFUL [It was with an extreme sorrow, with scarcely any avenue of relief, that we learned on the 27th of July that one of the noblest of God's humanity lay at the point of departure from earth.

Nevertheless, by the gracious hand of providence he was supported, and continued active and laborious till (after a short illness) in the arms of death he closed his earthly work July 28, 1880, deeply mourned and lamented by all who knew him We think that it may be truly said that he had'nt an enemy in the world.
