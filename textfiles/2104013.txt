Editorial. 'Line upon Line.' With what absorbing interest the teachers of every class of educational work, have read and re-read, and in serious meditation pondered this living experience of the good prophet of Israel. It was no new discovery that had just awakened in his mind, and made him the inspired messenger of so necessary a communication. The demand for this persistent force was in the world on the day that man was able to accept an advanced step in the truths of the natural or spiritual world. The early history of the human race is one of rules and laws to establish in the mind the necessity of a personal discipline for the peace and protection of Society. The prophet in his work of reformation was doing only as his fathers had done before him, bat his work may have moved so slowly toward the anticipated goal, while at times he suffered such unlooked-for reverses, that in his earnestness and faithfulness to elevate the mind of man, he at last came to this conclusion : If anything is to be accomplished for God or humanity, it must be a work in which there is no faltering and no reserved or expressed doubts. The apostle, wTas so assured on this point that he could not avoid warning his Brethren of the unpleasant state. 'A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.' Such a person has not as yet received these lessons of instruction which are sent from God, into a pure and honest heart. As is the work of the teacher among his pupils, in the rudiments of an education, so it must be with the work of a moral or spiritual teacher while working for the advancement of his class. It is from day to day and from year to year, 'Line upon line and precept upon precept,' until the process of remolding the mind has become so perfected that it cannot fail to meet with a reciprocal response. When a teacher is so fortunate as to observe the impress of 'wisdom from above' stamped upon the mind, and a steadfastness in tlie way of welldoing manifested through word and deed, then in all the 'beauty of holiness' descends a crown of hope, and for a season, witii an overflow of charity towaixl man, Iranian nature does not seem to be so very bad. Ameliorating conditions have arisen and we resume our work with renewed pleasure. We accept in all confidence the promised assurance and again enter upon the work, which ( ame through the mission of Jesus,ï¿½ 'Peace on earth, good-will to man.' It is with this spirit of anticipated success that all our work for God should be commenced, and then continued to the very end. To work under the shadow of a doubt, or with seeming indifference, is like working in the dark. Some good may be accomplished but the results will be far from satisfactory. God's prophets were untiring in their efforts to establish the work of morality among the Jews, and to bring the mind to the necessity of strict justice, in all their dealings among1 men, and their reward came through the consciousness of having been faithful in their sacred mission. Every teacher who has met with even an ordinary measure of success, has been obliged to adopt the precise course that was laid out by the prophets, and with earnest persistence present 'line upon line, here a little and there a ltttle,' till the whole work was accomplished. The great Teacher who could lay down his life as an example for others to lay down their lives for the good of mankind, has left this indelible impression, 'Peace on earth, good-will to man.'
