AIM Mrs. Lizzie Whitman Aim for the beautiful and bright, Aim for the good and true; Aim as the lark soars in its flight And flowers reach for the dew. Aim, though thy way be in the night, Still aim with lifted eye; Seek for the hidden stars whose light Shines in the darkest sky. Aim, though in lowest depths thy way, Thy path lie through the mire; Aim yet to reach high up thy way With hopes that never tire. So bravely go and upward reach, And oft though thou may fall, Each trial sweeter hope shall teach If thou but heed the call. Then take unto thy heart this thought, 'Twill be thy leading star, If faith be thine each trial's wi ought With beauty from afar. 'Tis upward to the realms that blest Then walk with soul of trust; In skies above go seek thy rest Not low, within the dust. Times, Phil.
