THE APPRECIATED CROSS We are in receipt of some very beautiful communications from different sections of our country and from Europe, and we appreciate their kind and encouraging contents. We are sorry, however, to have some of these epistolary tributes, while acknowledging the necessity of the cross, lamenting the fact that we use so much of it. This Shaker cross of self-denial is not different in any respect from that of the Christian founder ; and ' must Jesus bear the cross alone?' But the simple acceptance of the fact, that there is a necessity of some more cross by the people, is encouraging. Of one thing we have long been assured—that as, and only as individuals season their lives with more and more of the salt of the Shaker cross, can they with any reason expect more peace of mind, of households, and greater advancement in spiritual experience. Add a little more of this seasoning—add to life a great deal more of the cross and self-denials that ivere Jesus'—and our word for it, the dawn of happier sensations in life will ensue, and much greater satisfaction enjoyed. Try it; not necessarily calling the practice Shakerism—call it living like Christ, and share the happiness of Christ as a result. Let the world and its unchristian features alone ; let Christ and His Cross be uppermost and only ; and all lamentations of ' ,so much cross' will cease, and its fruits be thoroughly appreciated.
