Alfred, Me. Beloved Eldee Henry :�We 'Down Easters' could but commiserate our Brethren in New York, in their scramble for ice. While reading their pitiful story a company from New York were housing from our pond, blocks of crystal coldness eighteen to twenty inches thick. They finished cutting the 2nd. inst., having housed, altogether, over 40,000 tons. In answer to Br. Daniel's Sabbath query, we would say: If only those who have so far consecrated soul and body as to be able to make their 'labor worship,' go beyond the bounds prescribed by Moses, there would be but little danger of desecrating the Sabbath. But I fear the 'unprogressed humanity,' who need the Sabbath to aid in curbing the selfishness of their natures, would include the larger number among Believers, as well as among the children of this world. Then comes the query, How far Br. Daniel and the minority are obligated to set us an example of Sabbath keeping that will be safe for us to follow. Winter continues to 'linger in the lap of Spring.' The ground this 10th. of April is white with snow, which suits us no better than it does the robins. The young Brethren have finished sawing the wood, notwithstanding, every other day was stormy, and are now busy splitting the same. 'Hands at work, and hearts to God,' �I hope may ever be their motto. From our past Winter's experience, we would pray to be delivered from any more 'open winters.' The old-fashioned kind with its there or four feet of snow, and plenty of Zero weather is so much more healthy. J. B. V.
