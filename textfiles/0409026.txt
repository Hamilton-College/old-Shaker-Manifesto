A SERMON TO GAMBLERS The Rev. Mr. Hammond, revivalist, has been preaching a special sermon to the sporting men of St. Louis. He published an invitation to gamblers and fast men, and in response the church was crowded to its utmost. When no more could get in, about three hundred Christians kindly left in order to make room for the sinners. Probably a like congregation had never before been in a church. In the main, it was orderly, the only serious disturbance being caused by a drunken woman. Mr. Hammond began with an onslaught on tobacco, quoting to great applause this verse : Tobacco is a fljthy weed; It was the devil sowed the seed; It drains the pocket, scents the clothes, And makes a chimney of the nose. Among other things, Mr. Hammond told them the following story of David Mattoon, a Rochester gambler: ' He started one night for the theater, and got along beside a low brick church where an Evangelist was preaching. He saw the light, and an invisible hand drew him in. At the close of the meeting Mattoon, the professional sporting man, walked forward. Then and there he knelt down and prayed,' God be merciful to me, a sinner.' He rose from his knees a saved man. He went home. He had $3,000 worth of gambling implements. He burnt them all up. With a mother and sister to support, he said,' What shall I do ?' His hands were delicate and soft as a lady's. Everybody knew he was a gambler. After many fruitless efforts to obtain work—for people were all afraid of him—he hired himself to a grocer at $20 a month. His old friends, and one in particular, tempted him. He stood firm. He said, ' I will never touch a card again.' It was after this that he entered the service of the grocer. He neither drank, smoked, nor chewed. No Christian ought to do either. He became mayor of Oswego and was elected a member of the New York Legislature.'
