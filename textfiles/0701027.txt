What if benevolence were as strong a force in human nature... WHAT if benevolence were as strong a force in human nature as selfishness; couId not this be a happier world? Yet It might be as strong a force if it were as persistently I cultivated. Then don't go on applauding every selfish net or purpose you know of, unless you stop complaining of a bad world.-New Age
