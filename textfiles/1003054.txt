Travellers say that the Chinese... Travellers say that the Chinese' have a method of preserving grapes so as to have them at hand during the entire year, by cutting a circular piece out of a ripe pumpkin, or gourd, making an aperture large enough to admit the hand. The interior is then completely cleaned out, the ripe grapes are then placed inside, and the cover replaced and pressed in firmly. The pumpkins are then kept in a cool place, and the grapes will be found to retain their freshness for a very long time.
