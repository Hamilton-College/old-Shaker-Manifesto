Francis Train, Esq. : I see by your article in the Shaker and Shakeress, that you have seen some of the light and grandeur of the doctrines lived by the Shakers in America. You will be, I know, a mighty and valuable knight in the cause. You have every reason to believe a reformation in theology close at hand. All the signs of the times point to this work. God will bless you. No man has a right to be a reformer until he is reformed himself. You have chosen the true way. I want to tell you my experience in a few words : A few weeks since ] came to this Shaker village, and I was much impressed by their life. I finally received light such as you have got, and it seemed to open a new world to me of which I never thought it possible for mortals to know. Now I earnestly desire to be with you as soon as you commence to begin laying these mighty truths before the people. I have one lecture all ready now. I want to be enrolled as a private in this mighty battle. I will await orders from any direction, if the orders are only Forward I should like to go with you if you commence soon, as one of your^spiritual staff. You may remember we met on board the steamship Atlantic in 1871, where you came to the rescue of Elde Evans and Mr. Peebles when the clergy gave them the cold shoulder, as among those who gave reci tations in the saloon.
