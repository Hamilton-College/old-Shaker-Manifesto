In Memory of ANNIE BOOKER. We love one that's zealous to fill up their station, As bold as a lion yet meek as a lamb; In all their deportment without ostentation; The memory of such is like ointment and balm. The soul that is willing to suffer temptation And never afraid to encounter the foe; Such often are mentioned in good conversation And such we'll remember wherever we go. With all that is lovely such souls are surrounded; Their very appearance is comely and fair. And all who behold them shall yet be confounded, And have to acknowledge salvation is there. IDUMEA.
