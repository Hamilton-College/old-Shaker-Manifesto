GREAT INTELLECTS The abrupt discrepancy existing between the exceedingly splendid hues and colors of the spread tail of a peacock, when it glistens in the morning sun, and his homely feet, has often been noticed. Is there not much the same discrepancy existing between the mental glories of the illustrious brain-workers of Babylon, and their immorality ? How very often it has happened that in the actual every-day lives of these immortah) there was no foundation of character — no pure morality — why go any further ? Is it meet for Shakers to come into magnetic rapport with the incestuous Byron, the rowdy S, the drunken M, the thievish Bacon, or the licentious 'Bard of Avon? ' Nay ! and yet we will, in due time, have all of their noble, but much abused gifts, without the ugly peacock feet, to mar the beautiful picture of: our spiritually-intellectual lives.
