Hancock, Mass. Aug. 11, 1891. Beloved Elder Henby:ï¿½When the girls of the Bible Class read the last question they were unanimous in the opinion that they knew the answer perfectly well; so sanguine were they in the belief that there was no necessity to 'Search the Scriptures' that they delayed the work too long, so that we have but a few to send you this time. It is true they did know the day on which Jesus was crucified, also when he arose from the grave, but they found it hard to find the Scripture reference to it. Think they have learned that it is well to be certain that our knowledge is well founded. It is a bright, beautiful morning, all nature is rejoicing in loveliness and seems to wish so much to prove a true tribute of praise to the Creator that my heart bounds in unison and prompts me to add my mite to the universal praise-offering of nature. As I have not sent any Bible Class papers for some little time I enclose a few which please examine and do with as you think best. Please accept love from Ministry, Elders, Brethren and Sisters in Hancock for yourself, and as far as you think it best to extend. E. H. B.
