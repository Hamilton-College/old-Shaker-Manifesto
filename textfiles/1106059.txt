KEEPING THE HEAD CLEAN A distinguished physician, who had spent much time at quarantine, said that a person whose head was thoroughly washed every day, rarely took contagious disease ; but where the hair was allowed to become dirty and matted, it was hardly possible to escape infection. Many persons find speedy relief for nervous headache by washing the hair thoroughly in warm water. I have known severe cases almost wholly cured in ten minutes by this simple remedy. A friend finds it the greatest relief in cases of ' rare cold,' the cold symptoms entirely leaving the eyes and nose after one thorough washing of the hair. The head should be thoroughly dried afterward, and not exposed to draughts of air for a little while.
