When a certain ambitious self-seeker once clutched at the dominion of all Europe... When a certain ambitious self-seeker once clutched at the dominion of all Europe, stern disappointment met him in his path of invasion, flung a Russian snow-storm in his face, and out of the tiny snowfiakes wove a shroud to wrap the flower of French chivalry. The lesson that the proud usurper would not learn at Aspern and Eylan was taught him in the agonies of Borodino, and in ghastly blood-prints on the frozen banks of the Beresina. So, too, have we, in the defeat of our humbler plans of selfseeking, been made to hear the sharp teacher say : ' Do not be selfish. Other people have rights as well as yourself.' This lesson was worth all it cost us.â€” Rev. T. L. Cuyler
