Spare the Horse :. O, teamster, spare that horse, How hard he tries to go, There's load enough for two, Don't strike another blow, Give him a helping hand, Or ease the load, I pray, And he your kindness will A thousand-fold repay. How patiently he toils, All through the heat and cold, A faithful servant still, Though wearied, worn, and old. Poor, dumb, unconscious brute! And yet he seems to know, Caressing oft the hand That deals the cruel blow. What an imploring look, And what a knowing eye, And yet without the power To utter e'en a cry. See how he writhes and shakes, While smarting with the pain. Oh, cruel driver, pause ! Don't strike the brute again. Humanity at last Brought to a sense of shame, Will punish those who give Unnecessary pain. Oh, driver, spare that horse, How hard he tries to go ; There's load enough for two, Don't strike another blow.
