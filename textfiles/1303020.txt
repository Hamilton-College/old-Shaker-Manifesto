The needs, and reformatory... 'The needs, and reformatory spirit of our age abhor the useless works of vanity and of self interest. Many enthusiasts, by their fanciful ideas and fine spun spe^ilations, have formed to themselves a heaven and a kingdom of God which nowhere exists. Mistaken men, you try to arrange affairs with God, before you are reconciled to your fellow creatures, by whom you are surrounded.' George Rapp.
