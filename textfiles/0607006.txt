SOLILOQUY MARIA WITHAM My mind abandons itself to reverie, and is transferred in ecstacy to nature and nature's God. It sees in the simplicity of nature's elements and laws the wisdom and majesty of the great Creator. I feel withdrawn from earth and rise above the little theater of human passions and anxieties to lift my soul in pious contemplation. My mind expands with fervent desires for Truth and Knowledge ; and I scale heaven's pure walls with truthful aspirations rather than worship the good opinion of erring man. In the gilded canopy of heaven, Divinity reigns in all the grandeur of its attributes, greatness and strength, and travels through the dominions of an unlimited monarchy. Fancy may take its flight far beyond the power of eye or the telescope. It may expatiate in the outer regions of all that is visible, yet who shall have the boldness to say that the wonders of the Almighty are at an end, because we can no longer trace his footsteps ! Let me rather say with the Psalmist, ' What is man that thon art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou visitest him ! ' O bounteous one, what have I not received from thee! Throughout the seasons that are past, I see sweet places everywhere. My body and soul have been fed by the most congenial food. Thy chastening hand has proved a blessing; and looking backward through time that has passed, and along the way my feet have pressed, what have I not received from thee, my strength, my stay. A moment from this outward life I joyfully retreat, and in thy presence tell thee, that within I feel so satisfied thy cross to bear. Oh, do not spare the chastening rod that keeps me by thy side. Oh, sweetly give me strength to bear whatever waits me here. Enfield, Conn.
