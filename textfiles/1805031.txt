THINGS WORTH FORGETTING. It is almost frightful and altogether humiliating to think how much there is in the common on-going of domestic and social life which deserves nothing but to be instantly and forever forgotten. Yet it is equally amazing how large a class seem to have no other business but to repeat and perpetuate these very things. That is the vocation of gossips, an order of society that perpetrates more mischief than all the combined plagues of Egypt together. You may have noticed how many speeches there are which become mischievous only by being heard a second time; and what an army of both sexes are sworn to see to it, that the fatal repetition shall be had. ï¿½ Blessed is that man or woman that can let drop all the burrs and thistles, instead of picking them up and fastening them on to the next passenger. Would we only let the vexing and malicious sayings die, how fast the lacerated and scandal ridden world would get healed and tranquilized. Dr. Huntington.
