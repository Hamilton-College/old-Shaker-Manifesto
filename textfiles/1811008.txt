AMONG THE SHAKERS. By Hester A. Pool. THE COMMON LANDS PURCHASED MORE THAN A HUNDRED TEARS AGO- - -THE FIRST GATHERINGS UNDER ANN LEE- - -COMFORTABLE HOUSES AND FERTILE LANDS- - -EVERYTHING NECESSARY FOR LIFE GROWN OR MANUFACTURED IN THE COMMUNITY�THE IDYLLIC LIFE OF MEMBERS- - -QUAINT CHARACTERS. It was brother Daniel who met us at the station with a stout wagon and a span of well-kept horses ; brother Daniel whose face, round and rosy as a winter apple, beamed with placid content and cordial welcome. Our small party had just arrived at. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., the home of a large body of Shakers, in company with Elder F. W. Evans, and at his invitation, in order to study the domestic and religious life of that curious sect of which the world knowr. so little. After we had mounted the high vehicle the horses' heads were turned, the mountains looming upon the eastern horizon, up which the road winds, by a gentle acclivity, for a mile or more before reaching the Shaker Village. On either side the fertile lands belonging to the community extend for a distance of six miles or so by more than half that width, directly on the road leading from Lebanon Springs to Pittsfield, Mass., nine miles distant, embracing pasturage, forests, upland meadows, orchards, and rich intervales. Every acre shows the industry, thrift and intelligent management of its owners, beginning with the massive walls which enclose it, 'every stone of which,' said Elder Evans, 'was laid by consecrated han;!s.' It is about a hundred years since these lands were bought by the zealous followers of Ann Lee, who settled here and have obtained great triumphs and received great persecutions. The first gathering of the Shakers into a community similar to that of the primitive Christian Church, under the leadership of two orthodox clergymen who had been converted to her belief, was just one hundred years ago. Fleeing from the deadly warfare of the old world to the witch-burning bigotry of the new, Mother Ann and her seven devoted followers could little have guessed how beautiful the scene would one day become, whore now toil and worship a peculiar people, the like of which the world has never known. In a few moments we reached the Colony known as the North Family, and saw before us several large rectangular buildings, set within a few rods of each other in the midst of flowering shrubbery, gardens and orchards. The buildings, destitute of piazzas, look stiff and bare in their coats of dazzling white, but the walks are trim and faultless ; the hillside laughs with luxuriant verdure, and the whole scene is one of quiet and smiling beauty. Brother Daniel stopped before the first building, where, on alighting, a Shakeress bade us welcome and led us through a long hall to our several rooms. This sister, whom we soon learned to know and highly regard as Eldress M., devoted herself with the refinement of a perfect lady, to our comfort. In fact all witbj whom we came in contact seemed to have found that golden mean where, without officiousness or neglect, they were ready to give the 'reason of their being.'' In address, the leaders among the Shakers might easily stand before princes and kings. Eldress M.�and to describe her is to describe all,�was clad in a quaint costume very much like that worn in country places in the days of Mother Ann. After a time, its stiff simplicity exercises a certain attraction upon the visitor. By it age is softened and the mode-ty of youth enhanced, and one learns to regret its clear outlines and delicate coloring after returning to the absurdities of worldlv dress. It consists of a self-colored frock, full and plain in the skirt, which is laid in large, pressed plaits from waist to hem. The tint is always pleasant to the eye, either dove color, dun, soft brown, pale lavender or plum. Across the bust a large white kerchief 'half conceals and half reveals' the form, and from its upper folded edge rises an underkerchief, or collar white as the throat it encircles. A cap of snowy gauze covers the head and comes well over the thoughtful and placid face. Until within a year or two all the materials for clothing and bedding save plain cotton, were home-spun and woven as well as home-made. 'Why do you wear such lovely changeable silks every day?' was asked of Eldress A.�a lady of great culture, sweetness and refinement. 'Feel of it,' she replied laughingly. 'Instead of changeable silk it is home-made worsted, woven in our own looms more than thirty years ago. This skirt has been made over and pressed and new waists have been fitted to it again and again.' On examination it proved to have been spun with almost hair-like fineness from long-wool merino, dyed wine-color and then used as a filling for dark blue cotton warp, making a cloth as beautiful as it is indestructible. No more such material will ever be woven, and the few uncut remaining pieces are cherished as mementoes of early days. Truth compels us to say that the home-spun coats of the Brethren are ueither so well-fitting or becomiug as the clothing of the Sisters, though the same care has been bestowed upon them. But the home-woven blankets are soft, even, fine and warm. The guest rooms at Mt. Lebanon consist of four good-sized sitting-rooms, each with its large airy bed-room, containing two single beds. Husbands and wives occupy separate jooms while under the Shaker roof. These rooms are models of purity, for cleanliness is a part of the Shaker creed. The middle of the floor is covered with rag-carpeting made from new strips of listing, bound and made in sections for ease in frequent shakings, and no dirt ever dares to gather on the shining painted flooring at the edge. The sashes are raised and lowered and the fine hair mattresses and bedding undergo a thorough airing daily according to a certain method devised by themselves, and are then made into snowy mounds at a fixed hour, for perfect ventilation and perfect order are also parts of their religion. An indescribable air of purity pervades everything, and it takes little perception to see that this purity is a portion of the mental and moral as well as physical atmosphere of this Shakerian home. Within the same building are the work-rooms where clothing is cut and made, and store-rooms, cool and sweet. Underneath is the dairy, filled with cans of golden cream, and butter fragrant as the breath of yonder Holstein cows, stabled in that lofty stone barn filled with every appurtenance of bovine luxury and the just pride of all Shakerdom. Truly if there is perfect housekeeping within, the farming without lags not behind. A few rods back of the guest-house is the dwelling of the Shakers. At one end are the rooms of the Brethren, furnished like those of the Sisters, who have charge of them. Two or four room together in large many-windowed apartments, always furnished with single beds. The house, the occupants and iheir occupations are presided over by two elders and two eldresses, selected for those peculiar qualities and experiences which would alone render them fit to hold such relations to sixty or seventy men, women and children of all temperaments and many nationalities. On this point it is enough to say that the intentions and character of each novitiate are carefully investigated, and that scandal among them is unknown. The heredity of a child is studied before it is accepted as an inmate ; when once a member of the family its natural proclivities are considered and its u gifts' given room for free expansion. The school-room is provided with apparatus and a museum, and the little schoolmistress is dearly loved by her charges. While the Shakers believe celibacy to be the highest form of life, they respect the institution of marriage, concede that only a few are called to join their number and be separate from the world. Rather do they look to see their principles slowly spread over the earth and uplift its iuhabitauts to a higher plane of thought and action. For integrity and justice, as well as for breadth of sympathy and hope for the future of humanity, it may be safely asserted they have no superior. All are hard workers, leaders and teachers, as well as common members. Rising before five o'clock in the morning, each group of men and women repair to their respective duties. Two sisters take charge of the dining-room, two of the bake-room, and two of the kitchen,�the latter a large handsome room fitted with every convenience and exquisite with its well-oiled floor and rows of burnished sauce-pans. The Brethren have devised unheard of comforts for the in-door workers, and the visitor leaves with the feeling of pity for the housewife who does her cooking in the ordinary way. Here every step tells, every movement counts. Co-operative work can point to no greater triumph than in Shaker house-keeping. In the dining room the men sit at one table, the women at the other. The food is of the best quality and generous in quantity. Almost no use is made of flesh-food and home-grown and ground cereals are cooked to perfection. Such vegetables, plucked within the hour, and such pies, shortened with sweet cream and filled with fresh fruit or that preserved by their own peculiar process, we mutually confessed to have never tasted before. All the work is done by the Sisters who have their seasons of leisure and repose. Running water brought from large springs gushing from the mountain side grinds the grain, churns the butter, rocks the washing machine, cools the huge refrigerator, and being heated, warms the house in winter. Strung along ' Shaker Village,' half a mile or so apart, are seven such colonies as this of the North Family, each numbering from thirty to a hundred members, all together beings called a community. Every family dwelling contains a large room called the 'meeting-room,' where several times each week the members congregate for social or religious purposes. At the former there is reading from books and periodicals and discussions upon topics of the time, in which both men and women take part. And it is safe to say that nowhere can there be found persons better informed upon history, politics, sociology and religion than those members of a religious community who have withdrawn themselves from the great world in order to live in purity, crucify selfishness, and subdue the animal propensities to the dominion of reason. 'What have the Shakers ever originated?' we asked of one who had been a member of the order over sixty years, a Scotch gentleman, elegant, scholarly, of great experience, whose society is sought by some of the ablest of modern thinkers. He is a noble instance of one who has obeyed the laws of the higher life. In reply he demonstrated that the Shakers originated the drying of sweet corn for food ; they instituted the raising, papering and vending of garden seeds, and the raising, drying and preparation of medicinal herbs and roots for market. They also first manufactured medicinal vegetable extracts for market. They first raised broom brush and made it into brooms ; they made the first buzz saw in this country ; they invented and used planing and matching machines for dressing, flooring and ceiling lumber. They also invented the making of cut nails by machinery; they first cut and bent card teeth and punched the leather for setting them, and lastly, the invention and use of the metallic pen is due to the inspiration of some of the Brethren at Watervliet, near Troy, N. Y. A long enough list for a body of people who at no time have numbered over five thousand souls. Every community has its Churchbuilding, open during the summer months ; at other times the meetings are held in the large family rooms used for social purposes. Bare, and spacious, with polished hard-wood floors and provided with movable beaches, they are open, on occasion, to Sunday spectators from more ornate forms of worship. At the appointed hour two long processions file noiselessly in, the Brethren ranging themselves upon the seats along the wall od one side, the Sisters on the other. It is an impressive sight these latter present, with naive, serene faces framed in spotless lace, each with an introspective, unworldly look that hushes the spectator into quiet awe. They bear large, white kerchiefs, and hymn books on which the hands are clasped, and these trim, quaint forms and downcast eyes, motionless and soundless, while the breeze whispers within and the shadows dance upon the wall, seem to belong to some pale ghosts of the past, clarified from all earthly passions, which have returned to remind their fellow-beings of that other world to which they hasten. A few moments and the spell is broken. The Elders rise, and the others following, range themselves in two opposite parallel lines. Some one strikes a note and the others join in a simple but thrilling song. One of the Elders, when this is finished, gives a brief and practical exhortation, instinct with high, religious aspiration, linked with intimations �f struggle and trial, temptation and triumph. How to subdue the lower nature to the rule of the higher, how to live aright in thought and deed, seem the burden of these remarks. Another song follows and then an exhortation, perhaps by a Shakeress, who here as in all other places is on terms of equality with the Brethren, till finally the time for marching is at hand. The best singers among their number group together facing each other in the middle of the room, and burst forth in a stirring march. This is emphasized by the beatin ; of the hands and an increased stress on the accented measures of the bar, with the body gently swaying forward and backward and the feet keeping time to the rhythm of the music. Round these singers circled the Shakers, men and women by themselves, all beating time with upward palms of the outstretched hands, and keeping time with the advancing feet. Sometimes the convolutions resembled simple figures in the marches of light gymnastics ; at others it wras a mere rhythmic procession. Enrapturing religious emotion was plainly visible on the faces of many ; a serious but joyful earnestness on others. In the scene there was nothing ludicrous, nothing unseemly. On the contrary more than one onlooker found himself deeply impressed by this form of worship in which the body is recognized as the temple of the Holy Spirit. The services ceased with as little ceremony as they began, and after mutual greetings the members of each family return to their homes, which they regard with as much affection and pride as the members of a private family. Of this fact proof is shown in a variety of ways. kt When you see a good thing,' said a Spanish philosopher, 'put on a magnifying glass�' None is needed in regarding the Shakers. The social advantages they enjoy, their freedom from anxiety in regard to a livelihood, the conviction that labor meets with an honest reward, the satisfaction arising from wholesome, delightful and elevating environmeuts and associations,�all these are advantages not to be despised. It is no light thing to be shielded from want and wrong, to look forward with content to a life of repose and comfort. Yet agreeing with all this will not make a person a Shaker. There are vital underlying principles which must first be apprehended and embraced. There are not many who can sacrifice the stirring hopes and ambitions, loves and warfares which are a portion of the common lot, and so there are but few who desire to step aside from the roses and thorns of the ordinary pathway into that straight, well-fenced, verdurous road that leads into the fold of the Shakers.
