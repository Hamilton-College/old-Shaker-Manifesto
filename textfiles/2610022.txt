GOOD TEMPER. There, s not a cheaper thing on earth, Nor yet one half so dear; 'Tis worth more than distinguished birth. Or thousands gained a year. It lends the day a new delight, 'Tis virtue's firmest shield; And adds more beauty to the night Than all the stars can yield. It maketh Poverty content, To Sorrow whispers peace; It is a gift, from heaven sent, For mortals to increase. It meets you with a smile at morn, It lulls you to repose; A flower for peer and peasant born An everlasting rose. A charm to banish grief away To snatch the brow from care; Turn tears to smiles, make dullness gay, Spread gladness everywhere. And yet 'tis sweet as summer dew That gems the lily's breast; A talisman for love is true As ever man possessed. What may this wondrous sprit be, With power unheard of before This charm, this bright amenity? Good Tempernothing more!. Good Temper'tis the choicest gift, That woman homeward brings, And can the poorest peasant lift To bliss unknown to kings. Chatterbox.
