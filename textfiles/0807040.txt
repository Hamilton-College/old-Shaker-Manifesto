FARM and GARDEN Stable manure is good There is nothing better than stable manure, but not enough can be had. Muck is good if we get the right kind, fibrous and not too much decomposed. It may be profitably composted with stable manure, six or seven loads to one of the latter, with ashes and with salt. The coarse grass which grows on muck swamps, if piled up with it, helps decomposition. Salt was recommended as a good fertilizer for all kinds of fruit trees It helps to decompose plant food. Ashes are good, and leached ashes, 300 bushels per acre, are excellent on sandy soils, helping mechanical texture, and furnishing needed manurial elements. Rural New Yorker
