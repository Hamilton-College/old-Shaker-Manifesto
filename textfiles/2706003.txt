A REVIEW. By George Baxter. AFTER giving according to our profession, our undivided interest to the ~l\. maintenance of our Communal Home, our motto, 'All for Each and Each for All,' made practical by word and deed, and bringing the same united consecrated spirit into the house of worship, we can not fail to attract pure and heavenly ministrations, which like the morning dew upon the thirsty plant, invigorates our spiritual aspirations, teaching us to endure patiently, the little annoyances incident to life, creating an earnest desire for a love that is higher, broader and purer than is found in the things of earth. If as individuals we fall below our standard, are false to our colors, then the fault is ours and should never be laid at the door of the Shaker Church. Our honored parents suffered too deeply, workt too incessantly and prayed too earnestly for the continued prosperity of their united efforts in establishing gospel principles in consecrated homes to admit of anything but that of the highest regard. They entertained great hope for the future and it is not for us to say that they were mistaken. If Shakerism is yet in its infancy and some of us believe it is, we have nothing to fear. We may rejoice at the progress already made. Nothing should prohibit us from proclaiming the truths revealed to us, remembering it is our duty to sow beside all waters, and in trusting faith and confidence leaving it to a higher power to bring in the returns. The words of the Rev�iator, ' 'Whosoever will, let him come and partake of the waters of life freely,' applies to the members of our Church. There may be no compulsion in the gospel of Christ. Brethren and Sisters who claim a relationship are justly entitled by virtue of their uprightness, honesty and fidelity to the best that heart and hand could offer. I would say to every young person, Beware of the sin of ingratitude. It is well to bear in mind that we are indebted to an older class of Brethren and Sisters for many of the spiritual and tempoial blessings which we now enjoy, while many of those have past beyond our mortal vision. Let us remember that the spiritual and temporal inheritance placed in our keeping is not to be used for any selfish purpose. In Christ's kingdom there are no rich, no poor, no higli and no low. In that perfected kingdom the golden rule which is the outcome of the pure, unselfish love by which the disciples of Christ are known, will be in active operation. The doing by others as we would wish to be done by will settle all difficulties between capita] and labor in that kingdom ruled by the Prince of Peace. It will be impossible for strife and contention to exist, and it is our duty as Christians to be cultivating in our own hearts the elements which constitute the kingdom of heaven. We may feel as we often do that our lives are obscure and that other Christian workers are coming to the front, and leaving us in the rear so far as the evangelization of the world is concerned, yet the youngest child in our midst is being taught the very principles which will be prominent factors in this work of redemption and the angel voices are already crying to us,� Zion be no longer dumb, Let thy sons declare What thy wondrous love hath done, What thy daughters share. Of the sacrifices tell, Which the work requires; COf the light, the truth and love, Which the cross inspires. Enfield, N. H.
