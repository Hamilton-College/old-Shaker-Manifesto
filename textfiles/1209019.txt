Calvin G. Reed teacher. I visited this school on... Mt. Lebanon, N,Y,. Dis. No. 12. Calvin G. Reed teacher. I visited this school on the 13 of Jan. I found everything in perfect order, and can speak in the highest terms, both of the teacher and scholars. The school-room was in perfect order, supplied with globes, charts, maps, Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, and every thing that is needed for teacher and scholars. The order was perfect and recitation superior to schools in Columbia County. The attendance was the best in the Second Commissioner District, being 95 per. cent. The teacher's success did honor to himself as a teacher, and honor to the Society. Penmanship was one of the good qualities of the school, but reading was a success. The pronunciation was clear and distinct. Each word was accented correctly, and the scholars understood what they read. I was well pleased with the reading exercises. The interest the Shakers take in education is very commendable. I regret that more of our Public Schools do not take a deeper interest in our schools and bring them up to the standard of the school at Mt. Lebanon. The teachers attend the Institutes and Association, and are ready to catch every new idea or new method ; therefore 'their teachers are well posted in all the New Methods now in use. Isaac T. Haight. School Commissioner
