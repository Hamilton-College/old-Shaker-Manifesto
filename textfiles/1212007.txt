CHARACTER. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. God is no respecter of persons, but of character, and this character is one who does the will of God, as it is made known to him, or her, and was exem-r plified in the life of Christ, both in his first and second Appearing, and is attainable by all who will live his life and follow his example. It is a lovely character. Let all who name his name strive to attain it, press into it. 272 SHAKER MANIFESTO. This character has no creed except what is contained in the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and in this there is no authority for marrying in the church of Christ, but it is strictly a virgin character, and has reference to those who are living a life of virgin purity.
