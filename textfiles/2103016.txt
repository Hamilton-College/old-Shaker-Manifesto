Dear Editor:ï¿½The Manifesto continues its monthly visits and is a welcome guest. We always find items of interest in Home Notes of the different Societies and families. In most of the articles of the last . kindly notice is taken of the demise of our honored and much beloved Elder Giles, whose place will be filled by Elder Joseph Holden to the best of his ability. While it is a great cross for us to part with him from the Center family, we are glad that our little circle had one in its midst so worthy and acceptable to the people as he is and we of the Center bid him good, or God-speed in his new vocation. We know he will do honor to the place and to the family in whose kindly care he grew to manhood. Br. Alonzo is a worthy successor to Elder Joseph, who meiits the love and good feelings of Believers far and near, and I doubt not will have the prayers of his numerous friends both among Believers and those not connected with the household of faith. Winter is far progressed and the weather taken together has been quite moderate. All the families in our Society have secured a winter's crop of ice. One family secured theirs this week, in nice condition. Although the season has been quite icy, yet there has been no report of broken bones thus far, which is cause for gratitude. We pray the Lord of the harvest to send forth more reapers, as we have room in our houses and in our hearts for many, many faithful souls, who may wish to come and dedicate themselves to a life of self-abengation. Oar love to the whole household of faith. T. D. R.
