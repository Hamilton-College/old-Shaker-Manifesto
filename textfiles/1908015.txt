When souls in Christian society feed so profusely... When souls in Christian society feed so profusely upon the faults of society that it becomes so vile in their sight, there is little to approve and bless, they become so blind to their own errors, they are often more faulty than those whom they censure ; and their soul's food is so innutritious and poisonous they must, eventually, starve to death, or die of poison, spiritually, unless they change diet. A persistent and continued neglect to labor for the interest and welfare of souls, ultimates in a selfishness so narrow, that, having no souls whom they have nurtured and blest, whose gratitude would cause them to return blessings for blessings received, and love for love bestowed, they must, eventually, be left severely alone, in their own narrow cell of poverty, to die, spiritually, for want of support. G. B. Avery.
