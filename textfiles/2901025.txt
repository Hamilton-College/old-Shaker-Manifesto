I WILL BE WHAT I WILL TO BE. [Contributed by Ezra J. Stewart ] I mean to tread this narrow way, Whatever may betide; I care not what my flesh may say, In all its lordly pride; I will be what I will to be; From all the chains of sense set free. I will to be at one with God— And that and nothing less— In everything with full accord I will in His ways press. E'en tho He say the flesh must die; At once that flesh I' 11 mortify. 16 TEE MANIFESTO. If I am weak, what matter that? The Master's leal and true. His spirit's leadings have begat What can but bringme through. Ne'er as a coward will I flee The strife which sets my inmost free. I am determined to pursue The course I have begun; And with abounding life in view All clown that course I'll run. Hinder me not, you fearful crew; To all that's good I will be true. Sel.

The three pillars are significant of the three aspects presented in the true spiritual family. First, parent to child. Second, child to child. Third, child to parent. All was pure white. Selected
