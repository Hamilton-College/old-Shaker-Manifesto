TRIMMING APPLE TREES F. W. EVANS Now, not in the spring, is the time to trim apple trees. Limbs, of any size, cut off the sooner after the crop is gathered, the better, will heal kindly, and the stump will remain clean and white. At this time, the strength of the whole system will be turned to repair the wound, and to perfect buds for another season's crop. If the orchardist understands his business, he will, as soon as possible after removing the fruit, take off every dead limb, and superfluous branch; scrape the body, and wash it with strong soap suds, or lye that will nearly float an egg. Dig round the trees and manure them. Then, if the borer, the caterpillar, or any thing else deters the trees from bearing next season, charge it to Providence! Who will demonstrate the best time for trimming, by cutting off a block from limbs, the first of each month, and present to some agricultural society's museum? The pieces will vary, from a bright wood color, to a black canker, unsightly, and yet conclusively passing the verdict.
