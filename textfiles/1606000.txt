The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 3. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Rewritten by Henry C. Blinn. Elder John Hocknell, is justly ranked among the first founders of the United Society, and one of the principal supporters of the gospel testimony in America. He was born in Cheshire, England, and was a man of respectable character, and a member of the Methodist Church. On receiving the faith as made known through Mother Ann and the Elders, he became a zealous and faithful Believer. He was gifted in visions and revelations, and was an especial medium in the gift of healing. His wealth permitted him to be of great help to the Believers, even in a temporal view, and it was through his liberality that the little company were enabled to cross the ocean, from England to America, and subsequently to establish themselves in a permanent home in this country. He was known as a very honest, conscientious and upright man, and faithfully maintained this name through lifeHe deceased Feb. 27th 1799 at the age of 7G years. David Meacham was a resident of the town of Enfield, in the State of Conn., where he owned a farm. He was a man of religious impressions, and hearing of the revival of the word of God among a people in the vicinity of Albany, he made arrangements to visit them in the month of January 1781. Mother Ann and the Elders received him very kindly, and soon made &amp; favorable impression upon his mind, through the intelligence of their profession. During this visit David became as one of the family, and saw the people in all their daily duties. In the religious service he became fully convinced that the spirit of the living Christ had taken up its abode with them. Their testimony was pointed against the sins of the world, and an encouragement for truth and righteousness. At the close of the service he obtained an interview with Mother Ann and the Elders, and more particularly informed them of the object of his visit. Mother Ann remarked, 'David, God has called you to take up your cross and to obey the gospel of Christ. You should make an honest confession of your sins to God, and then forsake them forever, and in obedience to this spiritual light, God will have mercy on your soul.' David accepted the gift. It was a revelation of the spirit of God to his soul. He now saw with distinctness the strait and narrow path in which he must walk, as an evidence that he had renewed his life to God. On the following day, Mother Ann again spoke to him in reference to his privilege. 'If you are faithful to take up a full cross against pll sin, God will make you able to preach the gospel to the children of this world. You will meet with a great deal of opposition, even in your own home, but you must not be ashamed to own and to testify to your faith before all men. God has called you in relation to the people where you live, and if you are faithful, he will raise up those who will love and honor him.' On his return home David met his father, who was an Elder in the Baptist church, and informed him of the journey that he had made. An inquiry was soon made about the religious people in Watervliet, and what he thought of them. David replied, 'They are the only people of God, and the true church of Christ upon the earth. ' This sudden departure from the religion of his father was received with astonishment. 'My son,' said he, 'you are deceived ; you are deluded. ' Several ministers were called in conference with a hope of reclaiming the young man, but to no purpose. After several months of spiritual warfare with the priests and people, and the severe opposition of his father, he had the great satisfaction of seeing the blessed fruits of his consecrated labors. The testimony of the gospel found a permanent foundation in the hearts of many of the people in and near the town of Enfield. It was a feast of good things to David, as he could, with joy, witness the passing away of the old heavens and earth in the midst of so great a noise. In May, 1780, Mother Ann and the Elders visited the towns of Washington, Grafton and Harvard in Mass., and Enfield in Conn. David had long wanted the Elders to visit his home and the pleasant anticipation was about to be realized. He had hoped to enjoy the company of his gospel friends for a few days, but in this he was to be disappointed. The Elders had been in the place but a short time before there were rumors that a mob was gathering to molest them. To prevent anything unpleasant, the Elders thought it prudent to leave the place, as soon as they could conveniently. The Elders made another visit to Enfield on the first of March, 17ft2, and remained ten days. A part of this time passed very pleasantly and satisfactorily, but on the second week a mob of two hundred persons stationed themselves before the house and threatened violence to the persons of the Elders unless they left the place, immediately. In Oct. 1782, the Elders made a third visit to Enfield under the charge of David Meacham. Soon after reaching his house, however, a fierce mob from the town of Somers, surrounded the building and iuhumanly committed many acts of violence. This might, very properly,' be recorded as a religious persecution, as the leaders of the mob were baptized professors of the church, and respectable (?) men in society.| In June 1783, David was in company with the Elders in the town of Shirley, Mass., when a mob had gathered to molest the Believers. He passed among them without fear, and through the kindness of his remarks obtained a good influence over many minds that had come to do mischief. The leaders of the mob on learning this drove him into the house and forbid his preaching to any of the company. David followed the mob at the time that Father James Whittaker was tied to a tree in the town of Harvard and so inhumanly scourged with rods. During this shameful proceeding, David was thrown to the ground and held there, by several of the persecutors, till the whipping was finished. �f A more extended account of this mob violence will be found in the article which speaks of the journey through Preston, Windham, Strafford and Enfield. He was also at the trial of. Mo I her Ann and the Elders before Eleazer Grant, a justice of the peace, in New Lebanon. In order to get David out of the way a warrant was issued to seize him, under the pretence that he had cruelly abused one of his own children. This malicious act soon ended in a mock trial and David was set free. This very worthy Believer occupied an honorable position among his townsmen, as upright and honest, and by his wealth stood independent of any favors that might be offered. On his acceptance of the armor of Grod, he became a bold and valiant soldier of the cross of Christ, and was for many years, at a subsequent date, the senior Trustee in the Church of the Society at New Lebanon, N. Y. John P'arrington resided in the town of New Lebanon, N. Y. At the age of twenty years he made a visit to Watervliet to see Mother Ann and the Elders, of whom he had heard so much. He was at this time under deep religious impressions, and receiving the full approbation of his parents, he went to test the 'virtue and efficacy' of the religion of the Elders. This was in May, 1780. John made a visit of several days, during which time he was deeply interested in all that he saw and heard amonsr o this new order of people. The testimony of confessing and forsaking all sin had been clearly set forth by the Elders so that every one present knew what it was to bring their deeds to the light and to be joined to the Lord in one spirit. He subsequently reported that he had enjoyed everything that met his obser- vation, and was really baptized into a new spirit. He now made arrangements to return to his home in NeAV Lebanon, and informed the Elders that he should try and amend his life. To this the Believers replied ;�'All of your promises and resolutions to that end are very commendable, but by an honest confession of all sin, you will be better able to bear your cross and to renew your life to God. ' The love and confidence which had grown in tthe mind of this young Believer toward Mother Ann and the Elders, gave him all assurance in their word, as his trustworthy, spiritual advisers. He had also become convinced that this was the requirement of God, and said he, 'I undertook it and made as honest a confession of all sin as I was able at that time. ' He then returned to his parents and became a zealous advocate of the word of God, and an able supporter of the principles that governed the work. 'Mother Ann's industry, prudence and economy,' said he, 'were equal to her humility aud charity; so that in all things she was a pattern of godliness and gave the evidence that she was a Mother, indeed, in every good word and work. As the Lord Jesus set an example of righteousness to all men, and instructed his disciples to follow m his footsteps, in order to find acceptance with God ; so Mother Ann set an example of righteousness to all women and instructed all her followers to take up the same cross in order to find their relation to Christ.' The incident related of John Earrington which took place while Mother Ann and the Elders were visiting at the home of his father is peculiarly characteristic of the man. He did not hesitate to face a mob of lawless characters that were in front of his father's house. When they seized him, instead of fighting them, he cried out ' Love, love,' and his tormentors cried mockingly, 'love, love.' As they increased their grip, John cried still louder, 'More love.' This so frustrated those who had John in charge, that they allowed him his freedom. He then delivered his message to them, and went into the house. When the Church was organized at New Lebanon, and the people established in the community relation, John Farrington was appointed the senior Elder, and for many years commanded the love and respect of all who lived in the Society, and to a great extent, of those who were not of the order. \ (To BE CONTINUED.)
