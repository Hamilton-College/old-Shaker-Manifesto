SPIRIT COMMUNICATION Aurora, N. J., Aug. 14, 1872. To Dr. G.Haskell: 'Spirit Child: Through the Divine assist- ance of spirits from higher spheres than the material plane of life, I have been permitted to come here and communicate a few thoughts expressive of my views of the Resurrectionlife of the Shaker Institution — as we view it, another and higher plane of spiritual existence than the animal, sexual or social plane in the external life. In this you are educated that a life of trtie sexual moral purity, or womanly virtue, is the only road that leads to true happiness — the happiness that leads through the endless spheres of present and future spiritual existence. As the happiness of the future depends upon the life of the present, you know what your early instructions were. The principles taught by true Quaker Friends do not differ so widely from the Shakers as do those of the world. ' As these were the principles you were taught when a child, and the principles imbibed and practiced till you arrived at mature age, what I would here express is my thanks to the good Father of all life, animate and inanimate, that the Shakers have an existence in the land. I consider it the saving Institution of the age. In it is cultivated true spirituality and strict morality, and all the higher affectional elements of the nature of the individual are cultivated in the highest, grandest and broadest fraternal sense; the Fatherhood of God, the Motherhood of Nature, and the Brotherhood and Sisterhood of all Humanity's children, as they become quickened in spirit, resurrected from a life in the flesh — that more glorious Resurrection-life of the Spirit. Hoping this will reach you, and thanking the friends for giving me this opportunity of communicating to you, I am yours in spirit, Ruth Barry To F W. Evans and Antoinette Doolittle.
