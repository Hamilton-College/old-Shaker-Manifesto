Extract from a letter to Elijah Myrick Ayer, Mass. Buckland, Mass., July 4,1875. My dear Friend and Brother : I have been re-reading all those beautiful and God-like utterances of the Shaker and Shakeress. Truly, if ever divinity shaped mortal aims and purposes, and clothed in spirit dress and power, the thoughts and words of mortal men and women, it has been done in the productions of this blessed paper. I think I see clearly a special new spiritual and physical revelation of divine love and mercy to the race of man, in the inception and active promulgation of the principles underlying the economy and faith of the Shaker system. Looking over the declaration of principles and the holy life and simple purity exhibited in the whole system of Shaker life, I feel constrained to exclaim Eureka! the remedy is found. I think Shakerism the only remedy for the miseries, political, moral and theological, of the race. I think the solution of the perplexing labor question can be found in the Shaker community system only. I see clearly that the only certain antidote for the moral pestilence, the social evil, is seen in Shaker celibacy. The cure for financial ruin and distress can be found in the Shaker simplicity of dress and life. I fully realize that the restoration of humanity to the blessings of full physical health and a development of full physical beauty and moral and mental force, can be reached by a strict adherence to the Shaker system of food and labor. In short, I am fully convinced that if men learn war no more, beat their swords into plow-shares, if the lion in humanity lie down with the lamb, it must be done in and through a channel precisely like the life of the disciples of Ann Lee. Your brother for truth, humanity, for God, William Alcott
