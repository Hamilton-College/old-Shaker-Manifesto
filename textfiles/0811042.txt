'To See Ourselves.' The intoxication of anger, like that of wine shows us to others, but hides us from ourselves; and we injure our own cause in the opinion of the world, when we too pas- sionately or eagerly defend it. Neither will men be disposed to view our quarrels in the light that we do; and a man's blindness to his own defects, will ever increase in proportion as he is angry with others, or pleased with himself. It is easier to pretend to be what you are not, than to hide what you really are; he that can accomplish both has little to learn in hypocrisy.â€”Laxon.
