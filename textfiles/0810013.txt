'the harbinger of light.' This Australian (Melbourne) monthly lately honored us by publishing, under the title of 'Shaker Christianity,' the entire article of our Bro. Wm. H. Bussell upon 'Christian Culture.' How silently the good work goes on ! and how very deeply the waters of hu- manity are stirred by Shaker testimony ! How fraught with hope for the better life of the world, as found by earnest seekers, far and near, in the simple pages of our manifesto ! And yet there are those, so in love with the root of evil, that they live in unrest, striving to make themselves and others believe that the shaker manifesto is a non-essential or superfluity. Soon, such will pass away ; and we make all such welcome to their rewards. And to those who are sensible of the grand work we are doing, we add to their present, sufficient reward of 'God bless,' our sincere gratitude.
