Winooski, Vermont, Jan. 25, '75 Editors and Editresses of Shaker and Shakeress — Esteemed Brothers and Sisters: I come to you for counsel and efficient action. I am at liberty to negotiate with an efficient party. I want to see a community, as I have told you, based on the Christ-spirit, under the banner of peace and harmonial science, having, for its corner-stone, practical goodness, with love to God and love to. man. For this I look to you. WTill you come to our rescue ? Will you take hold and build or help build a community to advance to a higher plane of life, on the following basis ? — 1st. We will go with you, in self-denial, confessing and forsaking sins, with honesty and purity of effort. 2d. For official station, celibates, with ability, shall have preference, by the law of right. 3d. Scientific reproduction, of our species, commensurate with wisdom, divested of the baser passions, under guidance of purity, culture and refinement, by such as are esteemed worthy, for this life-demand. 4th. Celibates to take rank as senior order. I beseech you to not let this hope of humanity perish from the earth. Truly, yours, Orrin Shipman
