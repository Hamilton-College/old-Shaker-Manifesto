The late W. H. Howland... The late W. H. Howland, was a successful business man and was distinguished by the consistency with which he carried into business life the principles of religion. It is remembered of him that when he was made receiver of the Central Bank of Toronto, the failure of which menaced many citizens with ruin, his first act was to assemble in the back parlor his colleagues and clerks and ask divine guidance in the extremely difficult task they were beginning, and that they might be so directed that no man might suffer loss or injustice by their mismanagement. Over the mayor's office chair the motto was emblazoned by his order at the beginning of his first term, 'Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.' Christian Herald.
