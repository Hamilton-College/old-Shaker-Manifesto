Amy. (12) How brilliant is the orb of day, Continually it gives The glowing light, and heated ray, By which creation lives ; How vast it is, how great its worth ! Yet some have been so wise As to compare it with the earth, And tell us just its size. Eleanor. (12) — Yea, I have heard it mention'd too, But 't is so great to tell, More than a million worlds like this, (If I remember well;) Some thousand added, it would take Four hundred, seventy-two, A body like the sun to make: Though wondrous, it is true. Nellie. CD — 'T is very strange about the sun, Why so, I cannot think ; But when I look toward it, How fast it makes me wink. It is so very dazzling bright, And yet so far from me, Those who live upon the sun, I should not think could see. Amy — AVell, how that is I cannot say, I have it yet to learn; But to the pleasant sunshine bright, My thoughts I often turn ; Without its rays, and pleasant showers, No fruitage would appear, And this delightful home of ours, Would soon be dark and drear. Eleanor — 'I would be a never-ending night, And soon we all should die, For every thing that liveth Doth on the sun rely; All — Then, will we not more thankful be, And love its cheering light? For health and strength it daily gives, And makes our pathway bright. By three Girls — Canaan
