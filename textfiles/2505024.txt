SPRING CLEANING. [Contributed by Genevieve DeGraw.] Yes clean your house and clean your shed And clean your barn in every part; But brush the cobwebs from your head And sweep the snow-banks from your heart Just when spring cleaning comes around Bring forth the duster and the broom, But rake your fogy notions down And sweep your dusty soul of gloom. Sweep old ideas out with the dust And dress your soul in newer style, Scrape from your mind its worn-out crust And dump it in the rubbish pile. Sweep out the hates that burn and smart Bring in new loves serene and pure, Around the hearth-stone of the heart Place modern styles of furniture. Clean out your moral cubby-holes, Sweep out the dirt, scrape off the scum; 'Tis cleaning time for healthy souls Get up and dust! The spring has come! Clean out the corners of the brain, Bear down with scrubbing brush and soap, And dump old Fear into the rain, And dust a cozy chair for Hope. Clean out the brain's deep rubbish hole, Soak ev'ry cranny great and small, And in the front room of the soul Hang prettier pictures on the wall. Scrub up the windows of the mind, Clean up and let the spring begin; Spring open wide, the dusty blind And let the April sunshine in. Plant flowers in the soul's front yard, Set out new shade and blossom trees, And let the soil once frozen hard Sprout crocuses of new ideas. Yes, clean your house and clean your shed And clean your barn in every part; But brush the cobwebs from your head And sweep the snow-banks from your [heart. No need to go to Florida To keep your house in good repair; No need to leave a sunny home To breathe the southern sultry air. The Northern climate is the best, Most healthful too for soul and mind. Its fruits,none better can be found For all the ills of human kind. ï¿½Selected.
