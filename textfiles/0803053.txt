The Cost Of War Give me the money that has been paid in war, and I will purchase every foot of land on the globe. I will clothe every man, woman, and child in an attire that kings and queens would be proud of. I will build a schoolhouse on every hillside and in every valley over the whole habitable earth. I will build an academy in every town, and endow it; a college in every State, and fill it with able professors. I will crown every hill with a church, consecrated to the promulgation of the Gospel of peace. I will support in the pulpit an able teacher of righteousness, so that every Sabbath morning the chime on one hill should answer to the chime on another around the earth's broad circumference, and the voice of prayer and song of praise should ascend like a universal holocaust to heaven.â€” Stebbing
