Mullein as a Cure for Consumption A correspondent writes as follows about the flower of a well-known plant: 'I have discovered a remedy for consumption. It has cured a number of cases after bleeding at the lungs had commenced and the hectic flush was already on the cheek. After trying this remedy to my own satisfaction, I have thought that philanthropy required that I should let it be known to the world. It is common mullein steeped strongly and sweetened with coffee sugar and drank freely. Young or old plants are good dried in the shade and kept in clean bags. The medicine must be continued from three to six months, according to the nature of the disease. It is very good for the blood-vessels also. It strengthens and builds up the system instead of taking away the strength ; it makes good blood and takes inflammation away from the lungs. It is the wish of the writer that every periodical in the United States, Canada, and Europe should publish this recipe for the benefit of the human family. Lay this by and keep in the house ready for use.' Lexington Press.
