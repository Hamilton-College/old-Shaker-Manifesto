MORE ABOUT INDIANS General Sheridan charges that mismanagement of Indian affairs by governmental officials has caused all the troubles with the red men, and he believes kind treatment, administered with steadiness and justice, would relieve our western frontier from all the appalling horrors arising from Indian outbreaks. Peace Policy.—Win. Penn was the first and only man that ever solved the Indian problem. And how did he do it ? He did it by fair dealing, and practically carrying out the Peace Policy ; and by this policy he conquered the Indians and made them his friends. And we have never heard that a drop of Quaker blood was ever shed by an Indian. Gen. Grant indorsed the Peace Policy when he said, ' Let us have Peace ;' and when he recommended to Congress the appointment of an Indian agency, from among the Society of Friends, he did a good thing for the Indians, and an honor to the country. It was taking a step in the right direction—approved by all Christian people A Beautiful Indian Custom. — A few weeks since, a camp meeting was held in the Creek Nation lasting several days. The meeting was attended by many Choctaws from our sister nation over the line, and had been one of great solemnity and serious interest. At its close and before parting they all placed themselves in two lines facing each other, and the Choctaws in their own language sang some of their sweetest hymns. Then each passed down the opposite line and earnestly shook the hands of the Creeks. Then the Creeks repeated the graceful ceremony, singing in their beautiful Muskoke language, shaking the hands of the Choctaw worshipers, wished them God speed, and then filed off to their respective Nations and homes. This was an exemplification of the ' peace on earth and good will' policy.— Indian paper.
