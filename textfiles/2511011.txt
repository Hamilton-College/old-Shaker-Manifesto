The golden days of Autumn, remind us that the growing time, for our locality, is passed. Nature will soon nestle under her white counterpane, for a season of rest. And rest it should be, for she has dealt bountifully with us. From early spring until now the brown earth has been producing, O such a variety of fruits and vegetables. We begin to realize that there is no place so sure of a good crop of something, as our hillsides. Thirty kinds of fruit and vegetables have been grown in our large garden this season. Potatoes weighing two pounds, and tomatoes one and a half pounds, prove that the farm is not useless yet. We feared that the severe cold of last winter, had injured the peach trees, but not so; every tree has done its prettiest. Three bushels of as nice peaches as can be found, have just been gathered from one late tree. Our village school, which for the past century (I think) has been the burden of the two families comprising the Church, now passes into the hands of efficient teachers from the North family. Carpenters and painters have made the school buildings and environments look very attractive, and we trust that the extra tax on the district to meet the demands will make the words of a noted educator true. 'The school tax is the best tax.' We have just been reviewing the latest book issued by our Society; 'Mt. Lebanon Cedar Boughs,' a collection of choice and beautiful poems original with the sisterhood of the North family. Surely it makes one feel the influence of the inner court to peruse it. Amelia J.
