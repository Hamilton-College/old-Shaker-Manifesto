QUESTIONS. We question of the silence rast, Of souls that people distant spheres ; What cf their future and their past? Have they our sorrows, joys and fears? Do the same flowers make glad their sight? The same birds sing? On their great seas Do ships like ours, with canvass white, Move stately, answering the breeze? Have they their Christ, their Christmas day? Know they Mahomet? Buddha? One, Or all or none? And do they pray? And have they wrought as we have done? We cannot guess,�-'tis hard indeed, Our own orb's tale of its dim past Through centuries untold to read, And who its future shall forecast? We know the hand that holds in check The whirling worlds, each in its course, And saves the universe from wreck And peril,�this tremendous Force Holds likewise all our little lives ;� The suns and stars do all obey His bidding,�never planet strives To swerve from its appointed way The dangerous boon alone to us Is given�to choose 'twixt ill and well, Rebellion or obedience,�thus To build our heaven, or dig ovir hell. But one great thought our strength upholds ; Nothing shall perish! Though His rod Smites sore, His mercy still enfolds His own,�God's souls are safe with God. Celia Thaxter in March Cottage Hearth.
