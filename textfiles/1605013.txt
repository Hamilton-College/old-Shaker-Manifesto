Copy of a letter to a Jewish preacher... Copy of a Letter to a Jewish Preacher. Prof. Adler. Esteemed Friend ;�Your discourse in Chickering Hall, New York, Nov. 22, 1885, as briefly reported is to me more than interesting. ' GrO mend your ways. ' ' Cease to do evil learn to do well.' 'Execute righteous judgment between man and man.' 'The great need of the present religious situation is to show that the Law is of Divine origin.' 'This one divine element is left to men and cannot be taken away. It did not originate in experience, but is founded on an awful and transcendent sanction. And that the reformed Jews should elaborate the Moral Law into practical propositions, so as to right wrongs and establish justice now. And bend themselves to the tafek of uplifting the moral condition of humanity. ' Please to accept our thanks for these timely utterances. Without doubt the time is at hand to begin ' to finish trausgression, to naake an end of sin, and to bring an everlasting righteousness.' The whole scope of the Old Testament is to these ends. Indeed an analysis of that book, is 'Do no harm to yourself. Do no harm to others.' In other words, personally, keep hygienic law. Socially, keep moral law. If a man is intemperate he is also immoral. These laws are inseparable. Practical goodness from divine motives, is religion, and rests on the observance of said laws, as a house does on its foundations. Hence the necessity for the awful, and transcendent sanction you have placed before us. These laws as formulated in the scriptures are as applicable to-day as when first given. The sanitary and financial laws of that code are now imperatively needed. It is a significant fact, that that measure of obedience to hygienic law which your people have carried down with them through the ages, has given them a superiority wherever they have sojourned. And has also enabled them more successfully to resist disease, contagious and epidemic, than the so-called Christians. If the people of your city would but imitate the orderly Jews who live among them, and abstain from the products of the dairy when flesh meats are oti the table, they would have clearer heads, be better men and women, and also save themselves from much ill health, and from nine tenths of the doctor's bills they now pay. The amount of food saved thereby, wTould suffice to give a good dinner every day to every destitute person within the city's limits. The non-observance of hygienic law by the populations called Christian, is evidence that they are of heathen origin ; for 'The diseases of Egypt cleave unto them ' as do their habits. Most certainly their 'speculative religion' has not saved them from sin nor from disease ; nor enabled them to bring in a present, much less an everlasting righteousness. Most assuredly the religion ' of the better day' will fulfill these requirements. On every hand there are signs that the elements of a new era are at work. And your present word to the public, may be considered inspired. 'Ye are gods to whom the word of God came. ' To do good to others at the expense of self, is to be divine. This kind of divinity will be the corner stone of the Temple of the future. Standing in that divinity�in the afflatus that gave the law, and inspired the Prophets ; both can be fulfilled, but not otherwise. Man being dual in his emotional life is capable of so standing, he can die to the lower and live in his higher life. Even as the lower life in men and women, has brought forth the world as it is, so also will the higher life when in operation, bring forth an order of social life which can enter into, and abide within the Holy of HoJies. Live the higher life to-day, let it be a fixed fact, and the Law and the Prophets are fulfilled. Should all who are thus minded, unite their energies and their interests in uplifting humanity, most surely no good thing will be with-held from them. Praying that your words may not return unto you void, I have the happiness to be respectfully your friend, D. Fraser.
