RETROSPECTION M. J. Tatterton Another year has passed into eternity with its sad and pleasant records. Pleasant as it speaks of victories gained over self and temptations to error. One thing is certain the New Year finds us one year nearer our Eternal Home the state of perfection or vice versa. A the beginning of the year it is customary for thoughtful persons to make new resolutions concerning their conduct in the future ; it is generally regarded as a favorable opportunity to forsake bad habits and commence the journey of life afresh determined that the soul shall gain the ascendency over the g-osser elements of our natures. Wa need firmness and courage to carry out a whole hearted devotion and lo arm the soul with every advantage possible, to review our past lives, to test our motives, affections and inclinations. What eye save one which seeth in secret notes the efforts of the soul to walk with God, or the repentance for follies and sins of the past? There are seasons of soul refreshing and renewing when baptized iu the love of God the Christian starts anew on the heavenly journey. God grant that the closing and the beginning, and indeed every day of the present and coming years may be blest by the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit; which shall be the means of drawing our hearts from earth to heaven or in other words while faithfully performing our work on earth, securely placing our soul's treasure, ' where no moth corrupteth or thief approacheth.'
