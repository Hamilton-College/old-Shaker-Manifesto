HOW THE DUMB CREATURES LOVED HIM A French writer says of an old Bordeaux sailor of sixty years ago: He was so kind to dumb creatures that I have known his boat was coming sometimes through seeing the pigeons start off seaward, and wheel and hover around her till she touched the landing steps, when, almost before he had stepped on shore, they would perch on his shoulders ; and then, when his head appeared above the quay, the goat would come capering down, bleating. Old Tinker, the donkey,—such a rascal that it was said he could open every gate in the parish, and the cattle all knew it, and would follow him, and he had to be tethered,—would, as the old man advanced, whisk his tail, prance, throw back his ears and bray; and the very pig, who was often let loose for a run would come shambling down, anc grunt, and arch his back for a rub, noi to speak of the tortoise, which woulc follow him about, and eat out of hi and no other hand.
