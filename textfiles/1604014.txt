The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom. ' AMELIA J. CALVER. Seeing the above beautiful proverb in illuminated text the other day, brought to mind its explanation given me when a child. 'The fear of the Lord' said a dear friend, ' is to fear to do wrong.' Finding the exhortation so often among the choice words of wisdom uttered by the wise Solomon, I had begun to think that the path of the wise and good must necessarily be trodden in fear and trembling ; a not very inviting prospect to the happy heart of childhood. But this simple explanation brought sunshine to the portentous path, and all seemed easy. �' To fear to do wrong ;' not from a slavish fear of mortals, but from the promptings within, which would above all, dread the censure of conscience. The little child, who when tempted by an evil adviser to pocket the rich ripe fruit, because no one was there to see him, possessed the true fear of God, when he replied, ''I cannot for I shall see nr self.' Another under the same circumstances said, ' I cannot for God will see me.' This dread of self-censure and God-censure, is to me all the same. We say, ' Godp is good'' 'God is Love'' 'God is everywhere;' and how can we doubt it, when there is so much evidence of it. God is the synonym for the source of all good, as is the sun, for the source of all light, although as to the material substance ot either, the wisest philosophers are yet in doubt ; while the existence of both is evident without a doubt as shown by their effects. It is God within us, which creates the beautiful glow of love we sometimes feel, melting all selfishness, all hardness of feeling, and it is also the God within us which we dread as an accuser. Then is it not the 'beginning of wisdom' when we learn to obey the voice of God�the voice of conscience� the voice of principle ? for though we may be at peace with all the world, if when we 'sit alone with our conscience' we find that we are self-condemned, there is no peace. I surely feel grateful that my early instruction deeply impressed me, to fear nothing like self-accusation. It lias been a life-guard to me, amid the trials and temptations incident to a mortal pilgrimage, when I have been guided by its monitions ; aud regrets have always followed a disregard of its counsels. Were I to offer any one instruction as a safe-guard to the young, I would repeat the words of the 'brave old Greek.' 'Let every man wheu about to do a wicked action, above all things in the earth, stand in awe of himself, and dread the witness within him.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
