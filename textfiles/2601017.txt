Shaker Station, Ct. Dec. 1895. 'Trust in God ye faithful souls, trust in Him forever.' How blessed it is to feel that we are under the care of Him 'who doeth all things well.' We delight to think on God's promises to those who obey Him. Let us cling to Him who is our refuge and strength, and by the cross make our lives full of joy and brightness and an honor and glory to Him who has enabled us to be heirs to a kingdom that is eternal in the heavens. Let us 'sow peace and taste its fruitage sweet.' Self-denying efforts bring sweet peace and joy never ending. There is no shield from trouble and sin in a worldly life. Peace reigns with the pure. First pure then peaceable. Let us be sure we are sowing the seeds of truth, purity, kindness and love, which will, with good cultivation, grow and yield a harvest of heavenly treasures.' 'America's largest bell was lately cast in Cincinnati. It weighs 30,000 pounds and cost $16,000. The clapper is seven feet long and weighs TOO pounds. 'The deepest lake in the world is Crater lake in Oregon. It is 2,000 feet deep. From the top of the Crater down to the surface of the lake is 2,010 feet.' 'The specie in the Bank of France is stored in 800 barrels.' 'In Brazil there are said to be 300 dialects and languages spoken by the Indians.' 'The largest nugget of gold was found in Australia.' ****** * To obtain a good supply of eggs in winter, we must have young hens. Pullets hatched in April or May will prove most satisfactory. Variety and plenty of eggmaking material is absolutely necessary. Ground meat, bone, boiled potatoes with wheat bran make the best morning meal. Whole grain should be the feed after the morning ration. Daniel Orcutt
