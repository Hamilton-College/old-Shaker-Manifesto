Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Much has been said of Shaker speaking and singing at the Salt Point, N. Y., Peace meeting, and there is no doubt much good was done by the attendance and efforts of Elder F. W. Evans &amp; Co. The music, 'Pray, ope the gates,' being a New Hampshire production, and highly complimented, we may as well consider that Enfield had a representative spirit there. While Philadelphia was a failure, Salt Point was a grand success ! Why? Worldly ambition was entirely obliterated in one of these places! Any Societies, dedicated to human improvement, will do well to urge Mt. Lebanon to participate.
