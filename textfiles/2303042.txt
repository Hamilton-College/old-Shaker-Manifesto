Beloved Editor:--I think the Manifesto grows better and better... Enfield, N. H. Feb., 1893. Beloved Editor:ï¿½I think the Manifesto grows better and better There is much written from which we may obtain a great deal of good instruction. I am getting old, but have always been a great reader, and I prefer the Manifesto for my Sunday reading above that of any political paper. Your Brother, Simeon Childs.
