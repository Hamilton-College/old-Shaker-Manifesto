KIND WORDS. I wish to extend my and our, kind thanks... Enfield, N. H. I 'wish to extend my and our, kind thanks to all who aid, in any way, in the publication of the Manifesto. We hail its appearance every month, as a messenger of good things. Could I have had the reading of its pages when younger, I should have been much better satisfied than with the reading of books I could not and did not understand. Ann Cumings. Beloved Editor:--I think the Manifesto grows better and better... Enfield, N. H. Feb., 1893. Beloved Editor:ï¿½I think the Manifesto grows better and better There is much written from which we may obtain a great deal of good instruction. I am getting old, but have always been a great reader, and I prefer the Manifesto for my Sunday reading above that of any political paper. Your Brother, Simeon Childs.
