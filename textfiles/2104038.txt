SPARING THE ROD. The parent who flies to the rod to correct every trifling fault or misdemeanor, says The Ladies' Home Journal, will have no influence with her children when they are too old to be governed by force. A child should never be struck in anger. A box on the ear may rupture the membrane that forms the drum, and cause permanent deafness. A hasty blow may do mischief that years of repentance cannot undo. Punishment is for discipline, not for revenge. It is to teach the child to avoid evil and to do right. It never should be a vent for the angry passions of the mother. Love, patience and firmness are the instruments she must use to mold her child's character. Punishment is a means to an end, let her pray for grace to use it wisely.
