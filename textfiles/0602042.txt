Parisian police lanterns __Parisian police lanterns. Safety lamps of an original construction are used by the night policemen and watchmen of Paris. A small glass vial holds a piece of phosphorus as large as a pea, upon which is poured boiling olive oil sufficient to fill up about a third of the vial. The latter is then closely stopped by a cork. In use, the stopper is released for a moment, so as to permit the entrance of air to the phosphorus. The vacant inner space is thereupon lit up, diffusing a clear, and, of course, perfectly harmless light. When the light fades it may be revived by a fresh uncorking. A lamp so prepared will hold good for six months without renewal. â€”Journal of Chemistry. Journal of Chemistry
