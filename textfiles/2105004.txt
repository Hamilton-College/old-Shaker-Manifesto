GOVERNMENT OF THE TONGUE. Maggie Ladd. To do this properly, we will be enabled to manifest a love for all that is good, as all good comes from the same and only fountain head, from which source we derive all our blessings. God is love, and his children, wTho would dwell in his kingdom, should be examples of love and light to those in darkness. We can never gain those who do not see as we do, by uttering words that are harsh and unkind, but in a spirit of meekness, prove to them that we have learned to govern our great enemy. In the thirty-fourth Psalm, and loth verse, we find this injunction. 'Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile.' St. James also describes the tongue as an unruly member, full of deadly poison. It is, therefore, necessary that we place a strong restriction over the words that fall from our lips and let them be seasoned with grace and piety. But where the tongue is governed and brought into subjection, we may utter words that will be like a healing balm, be just as ready to see the beam in our own eye, as we are in the eyes of others ; and thus in godly fear, labor to build up the good and reject the evil, in our daily intercourse with our friends and companions.
