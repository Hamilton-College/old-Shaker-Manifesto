SPIRIT VOICES ANNA WHITE Mount Lebanon, North Family, 1876. Voices sweet as angel whispers, Come to us from yonder clime, Gentle as the evening zephyrs, Is their song of love divine. Living souls with hope resplendent, And a spirit formed anew, Catch the joyous notes triumphant, Swell the chorus rich and true. Tarry with us blest immortals, We will learn the heavenly song, Press toward the shining portals, Whence the melody was borne. These have left the world forever, Turned from darkness unto light, Thus renouncing every error, That the spirit's growth would blight. Ye who still are waiting â€”watching, For the bright and morning star, See, the dawn is fast approaching, And the gates are left ajar. And the Bridegroom now appeareth, With his Bride in raiment white, Hear ye what the Spirit sayeth, Come receive the truth, the light. Not in measured form ' tis given, Nor in dogmas of the past, Word of life flows down l'rom heaven, Void of priestly cant or caste. ' Tis the ' Rock of Revelation,' ' Tis the gift of God to man, Showing all whence comes salvation, The established, gospel plan.
