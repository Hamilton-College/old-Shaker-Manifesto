Sudden Warming A very dangerous, yet a very common winter practice, is that of sudden warming when very cold. We frequently read in the papers of little children falling down dead on suddenly going to the heated stove after a long, cold walk. Others are injured seriously who have no guess at the real cause of the difficulty. Every intelligent person knows that a frozen limb will become dead flesh if suddenly warmed. The temperature must be raised very slowly. The limb must be put into cold instead of warm water, or be rubbed with snow. When the limbs are half frozen, they cannot resist the injurious effect of sudden warming. Convulsions in children occasionally occur; many more are made suddenly faint and sick without knowing the cause; the eyesight is often particularly affected, and people call it ' snow blindness.' All skin difficulties are greatly aggravated by sudden warming, and sometimes very painful ones are induced. It is generally thought that chilblains are caused by the severe cold, but the true cause is sudden warming after they have been very cold. It seems as if this distressing malady were largely on the increase â€” even very little children suffer from it. Too great care cannot be taken in this matter of warming cold feet slowly, and by friction rather than by putting them near the fire. Sudden warming, too, makes the whole system so subject to cold for a long time afterward that extra garments are always needed, and then the frame shivers in what was once very comfortable temperature. Physicians have observed this in their cases, and say that they have sometimes suffered in this way for years from a single act of such imprudence. Use proper precaution on your own part, and watch carefully over your children, who of course follow their natural impulse to rush to the fire when very cold.
