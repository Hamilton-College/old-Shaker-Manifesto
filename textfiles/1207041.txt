A BOY FULL OF THE BIBLE There was once a little boy who went to Sunday-school regularly, and learned all his lessons well, so that he had a great many Bible verses in his mind. He was a temperance boy. This boy was on a steamboat, making a journey. One day, as he sat alone on deck looking down into the water, two ungodly men gentlemen I cannot call them) agreed that one of them should go and persuade him to drink. So the wicked man drew near the boy, and in an exceedingly pleasant voice and manner invited him to go and drink a glass of liquor with him. 'I thank you, sir,' said the little fellow, '¦but I never drink liquor.' 'Never mind, my lad ; it will not hurt you. Come and drink with me' ' 'Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging, and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise,'' was the boy's ready reply. •'You need not be deceived by it. I would not have you drink too much. A little will do you no harm, and will make you feel pleasantly ' ' 'At last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder,' ' said the boy. 'And I feel safer, and certainly think it wiser, not to play with adders.' 'My fine little fellow,' said the crafty man, '•it will give me pleasure if you will come and drink a glass of my best wine with me.' 'My Bible says, 'If sinners entice thee, consent thou not,' ' was his reply. That was a stunning blow to the tempter, and he went back to his companion. 'How did you succeed?'' said he. 'Oh, the fact ;s,' replied the man, 'that little fellow is so full of the Bible that you can't do anything with him.' So may it be with all boys and girls.—Ex. Do the duties of to-day, and leave the cares of to-morrow till they come,
