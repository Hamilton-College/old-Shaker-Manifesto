Sabbathday Lake. April, 1893. To-day the weather seems a little flattering and we are too ready to believe that winter is over. Cold weather has continued up to this time with but few moderate days; and spring is surely a month later than it was last year. We have lived through a very cold winter. Is the earth approaching another great glacial period? It seems like it. The night of the (5th inst., about midnight, we had a storm of rain, then hail and snow, with heavy thunder and lightning. The barn of one of our near neighbors was struck and a cow killed, but the barn was not burned. On reading the notes of last month's Manifesto, we see that our Brethren and Sisters, generally, have experienced trying times with the freezing up of the water pipes. We have had the same trouble with ours. Pipes laid four feet under ground have frozen and it will be some weeks yet before they can be repaired. Our Brethren have lately purchased an eight H. P. portable engine to take the place of a smaller one, which was considered unsafe, from the throwing of sparks; and had to be forced to do the work required,ï¿½that of sawing wood and cutting ensilage. They would like to be running the sawmill, but the logs are encased in several feet of ice which has not even begun to break around the shores of the mill-pond. Last year they commenced sawing the fourth of April with no ice to be seen. We have lately received a large order for sweet corn seed, which we shall furnish at three dollars per bushel, and the Brethren are hastening to have it in readiness when called for. All are aware that the season is approaching when we shall be surrounded by people from every nation, and realize the importance of being armed with that spiritual strength which will administer to them instead of receiving of their spirits.
