ONWARD, UPWARD. Ada Cummings. Onwakd, let our motto be, Striving for the right; Upward is the way of God, Leading iinto light. Onward, upward, let us march, With a zeal that's strong; Never faltering in our ranks Courage urges on. Who will stand the fiery test? The battle, who'll endure? Who will ever onward go In the path that's sure? There's no time for doubting now Onward, i* the song! ' Gird the shining shield of truth While ye march along!' Though the cross seems hard to bear Upward, we must go; Till we feel its weight grow less Conquering every foe. Moving upward, leaving all Worldly dross behind. Press we onward, is the call, Winning peace of mind. Toiling on with courage brave Trusting in our God; Noble souls who've gone before, In this way have trod. God will lead us onward sure, Through the golden gate. Onward, upward, friends so pure There in love await. West Gloucester, Me.
