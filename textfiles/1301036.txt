When to Cut Timber â€”An old farmer, with large experience, says that hickory cut in July or August will not become worm eaten, lie says oak, chestnut, walnut and other timber cut from the middle of July to the last of August, will last twice as long as when cut in winter. White-oak cut at this season if kept off the ground, will season through if two feet in diameter and remain perfectly sound for many years. Whereas, if cut in winter or spring, it will become sap-rotten in a few years.
