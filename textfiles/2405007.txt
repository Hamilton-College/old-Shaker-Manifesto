Correspondence. Authur W. Dowe, Dear Brother in the Gospel... San Diego, Cal. Feb. 1894. AUTHUR W. DOWE, Dear Brother in the Gospel ;�Your very welcome letter received. I am more thankful than I can express that after many long years of waiting I have found an honest co-worker on this Coast. As regards locality, I think your suggestion of forming a society in the center of the state is good and that it would be more successful in many ways. The people here seem to run in cliques, while all that I have talked with seem very friendly. I have had several tell me that they would like to join a society and would put in what they had ; but as we did not have a society here at that time they have gone over to the Theosophists. I think as you do about having a home to offer people. It will require all the strength, both physical and mental that we can get together, to be successful in this work, and I do not want the word failure in it, I shall write, this evening, to my people at Watervliet, N. Y., and also send your letter as you have expressed your views of the work better than I can, and ask them to show it to the Ministry and see what they think of it. There is a great amount of fruit raised near here and a canning factory would probably be successful. I lived in Oakland for twenty years so am familiar with that portion of the state. I feel that we can not make any definite plans until we hear from the Ministry and as soon as I receive an answer will let you know. Did you join the Society while at Canterbury? Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain, Your Sister in the Gospel, Cornelia R. Powers. Dear Friend, Martha J. Anderson... Camden, New Jersey, 1894. Dear Friend, Martha J. Anderson ;��I thank thee for the pamphlets tliee sends me occasionally. I am interested in The Manifesto, and think it is rightly named, because it tells all about your home life, which to outsiders, speaks much. It shows your adherence to Christian principles, and social order and discipline. There is no purity where peace dwells not. The fruit of unity is loving service. The foundations of modern society are out of course. Conformity to fashion and the rules laid down by those who are in the tide of worldly pleasure, shuts out the simplicity that shines with lustre in a truly virtuous character. But, it is as the wise man saith, the end of all is 'vanity and vexation of spirit.' If people were more eager to speak and spread the truth, instead of discussing the forms of doctrines and creeds of the various sects, there would be more of the true spirit of religion in the earth and not so much infidelity. Man is prone to wander from the known into the unknown, hence, from light into darkness. The teachings of the Master are plain and simple. 'Deny thyself of all ungodliness take up the cross daily and follow me.' THE MANIFESTO. Ill This is a selfish, grasping age, the lust of money and the greed of power, overrule the love of righteousness, and the desire to do good. 'Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled.' There are but few who share this blessing. Disunity and confusion prevail in the political, industrial, and social systems that man has inaugurated. The time has not come when the Lion and the Lamb can lie down together and be led by a little child; neither has woman found her just place and position as man's true help-meet in every sphere of life. There will yet be a renewal of heavenly strength and God will make manifest his power, through those whose lives are upright, to the pulling down of the strong worlds of satan. It gives me great pleasure to hear from thee. God bless thee. Sincerely thy friend, Sarah Hall.
