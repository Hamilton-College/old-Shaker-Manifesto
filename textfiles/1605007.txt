My Gospel sister Edith; It may not be too.... Enfield, Conn., Sunday Eve. Jan. 1886. My Gospel Sister Edith ;ï¿½It may not be too late to wish you and all gospel friends, 'A- happy New Year.' Another milestone in life's journey is reached. We start upon a new cycle of time. Shall we not try to make some one's way smoother or birdens a little lighter, or life brighter or braver? Sometimes cheering, encouraging words do more good than we have any idea of; or the ' word spoken in due season,' leading to just the thoughts we need, but which had not come to us unaided, and which lead us on to the true source of help. As the old year has passed, I think over what it has been and what the coming one may be with many conflicting emotions. It is so natural to long to know what our path willbe, and to reach out in vain endeavor to grasp something of the future. But we can only leave it in God's hands, trusting and praying Him to fit us for its duties, to guide us into straight paths, and to ' work in us the good pleasure of His will. ' I look back into the year just passed, recalling its various victories and failures, its joys and delights, and its disappointments, andsorrows ; and I look forward resolving to do better and to be better in the year that is to come. My heart is full of hope, and I have made many strong resolutions. Out of the fullness of my loving thought of you and your gospel companions, and my good wishes for you all, I will say, may all the blessings that you have desired for me, be blessed to your own hearts and lives. Iu gospel love, I am your father and brother in the gospel. Daniel Orcutt.
