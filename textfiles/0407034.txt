VALEDICTION Farewell, blessed of thy Father! Enter now thy bright abode! Well beloved of thy mother,â€” Cherish'd by the saints of God. Dearest sister, ' very pleasant Thou hast ever been to me ;' Still, O may I feel thee present, Breathing love and purity! Now, thy loss, we'll not deplore it, Though it may seem hard to bear ; God is good, He will restore it, With his blessing everywhere. We will mark thy footsteps lowly, Walk the path of peace and love, And with Angels blest and holy, We shall join with thee above. Catharine Hall, Harvard, Mass.
