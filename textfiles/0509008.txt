ADULTERATED CANDY A late writer on the subject insists that candy is injurious, not only to the teeth, but the stomach, and hence to the health of children and adults. The oils and acids used in flavoring are particularly dangerous. He says the jargonelle pear flavor is made of the acetate of amylic ether, which is prepared by distilling a mixture of fusil oil, acetate of potash and concentrated sulphuric acid. The pineapple is made from butyric ether dissolved in another portion of alcohol. Butyric acid is made from decaying cheese, grape sugar and chalk, fermented together. Various mixtures of the ethers, with the addition of various agents, such as acetic acid, camphor, orris, vanilla, the volatile oils, etc., result in imitations of strawberry, raspberry, apricot, currant, etc. The tonka bean is used very much in place of the vanilla pod, to imitate the vanilla flavor. The common oil of almond (bitter) always contains a considerable amount of prussic acid. This oil is said to be substituted sometimes by the oil of mirbane or nitro-benzole, eight or nine drops of which is said to have produced death. The peach and almond flavors are also imitations, made from prussic acid in some form, and are very poisonous.
