PLOD ON MARIA L. SHULTZ Plod on, brave soul, to thee as to all others Will come the final, promised rest at last; Thy life-toil over, and thy journey ended, Its dangers narrowly, but safely passed. Plod on, brave soul, on thee as on all others Will shine the gen'rous sun of God's good will ; What though thou ploddest slowly, they are wisest Who walk with care, nor try to run up bill. Plod on, brave soul, for thee as for all others The blessed rains of Heaven's love will fall; Then do not faint and fear, but be all mindful Of Him whose loving care is over all. Plod on, brave soul, 'round thee as 'round all others Will close the shadows of a dull despair ; Yet cast not down thine eyes, but lift them skyward, The bright Hope-star is beaming out somewhere. Plod on, brave soul, 'bove thee as 'bove all others Will flash the lightning, will the thunders roar; But, afterward the sweet and gentle windharp Of Peace, will tell thee that the storm is o'er. Plod on, brave sonl, o'er thee as o'er all others Will burst the Golden light of Heaven's day ; Ah ! then be hopeful, steady in thy climbing, From doubt apart, and from the night away. Plod on, brave soul —¦ nor weary in thy plodding— On thee will rest as much of God's true grace As upon him whose feet unwary runneth. The swiftest in this life's uncertain race. Plod on, brave soul, what if thou gainst the summit Not all at once, nor first doth reach the God will not care as long as thou'st walked truly, Hast climbed in Faith, and kept a patient soul. Plod on, brave soul, to thee as to all others Will come the final, promised rest at last; Thy plodding over, and thy life march ended, Its dangers narrowly, but safely passed. Canaan, N. Y.
