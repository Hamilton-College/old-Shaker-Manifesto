Home Topics Camphor Balls Clarify a pound of mutton suet, and add to it three pounds of spermaceti, two of white wax, and one of gum camphor cut into very small pieces. Melt these together with gentle heat, and stir until the camphor is dissolved, then pour it into molds. Frequent applications of this emollient will prevent disagreeable roughness of the hands. Should they become chapped, a most effectual but slightly inconvenient way of healing them is to wrap them in wet cloths with an outside bandage of flannel, first making a free application of the camphor balls. This treatment will soften and whiten the roughest skin, and it is also an excellent application in chronic rheumatism.â€”Banner of Light. Ingrowing Nails Our much valued eldress at So. family, Mt.
