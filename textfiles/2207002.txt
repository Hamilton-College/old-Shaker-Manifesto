MY HOME. Mary Whitcher. I am walking 'mid sweet flowers, Blooming roses, lilies fair; And around these fragrant bowers Stately oaks for shade appear. There are children of the household, Lovely youth are flowers sweet; And the oaks are well-tried pillars, 'Neatli whose shadow we retreat. And behold, within the center, Is the word of God revealed; By the union of the spirit Truth nor purity concealed. 'Line on line' and loving precept, With the 'new commandment' came: 'Love and bless ye one another,' This the language clear and plain. Canterbury, N. H.
