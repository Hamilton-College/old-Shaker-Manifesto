THE NEW CHURCH James G. Russell Enfield, N. H. The glory of the heavenly spheres, In visioned splendor now appears, As on Mount Zion's summit stand The followers of the Bride and Lamb. They sing before the Throne of God, Their harps attuned to praise and love; Emblazoned on their banners bright. The ensign Victory—• glorious sight. Their gallant Leader, at the head, Before them moved with fearless tread ; Opposing forces could not stand Before this valiant, marshalled band. Through fields of conflict they have moved, And loyal to the cause have proved. And in their foreheads now is seen The signature of the redeemed. 4. Assembled thus around the Throne, Their heavenly Parentage they own, As Father, Mother, in their place, The new and living Church to grace. The children of tho heavenly Twain,-Both sons and daughters swell the strain ; Sweet music floats upon the air, And all is pure rejoicing there. The mighty contest now is past; The glorious prize is won at last; Enslaved no more by powers of sin, The spirit, Christ, now reigns within. Upon their heads are crowns of gold, And palms within their hands they hold ; Their vestures are of spotless white, Prepared by purity of life. 5. O may the glory there displayed, To earth's dominions be conveyed, That her inhabitants may share The glory of Mount Zion fair. Salvation's sound! O may it roll Throughout the earth from pole to pole, Till Peace shall spread her wings of love, On earth, as in the worlds above.
