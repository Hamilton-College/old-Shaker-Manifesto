West Pittsfield. Oct. 1893. The beautiful October clays have winged their way hither, and the many hued tints in the leafy robes of the grand old forests, bespeak the fact that autumn is fast preparing for her departure. We are improving these golden days by harvesting the crops with which a benevolent Father has blest us. The Central Ministry are tarrying with us for the brief space of two weeks, and in their benign presence, we realize a fullness of blessing and that power and goodness which comes only from a source divine. In our hearts there is a wish that their stay might be prolonged, but knowing that the Societies over which they preside are many, we strive to restrict our selfishness and have our interest more universal. We trust that in the future we shall be more frequently favored with visits from them, as both Shaker Station, Conn, and our Society are now in their Bishopric. Elder Albert Battles and Eldress Caroline Helfrich, formerly of our Ministry, reside with us in our family. Elder Albert bears his fore-score years with the dignity of a veteran in the Lord's army, and although somewhat enfeebled, is one of the busiest wherever duty may call. Eldress Caroline is the presiding Eldress in the Church family, the former Eldress, Martha Johnson having succeeded Lucy J. Osborn as Trustee. In mentioning the laying of water-pipes in the 'Home Notes' of Oct. No. it should have been iron, instead of earthen pipes, and distance, five-hundred and twenty-five feet. Julia L. Sweet.
