1876 EZRA T. LEGGETT Less than one pulse the universe is beating, Less than one wave that breaks upon its shore, A hundred circling rounds of earth, repeating, The lights and shades that make life's varied store: In days of long ago, an angel, sighing, The lives of nations, and of men did write; Their blood-stained fields, their martyred heroes dying, Their broken altars, and their reign of night. Not strange, the angel, from its golden pinions Shook earth's dark dust, and soared to brighter spheres— Not strange its tidings, from earth's dark dominions, Less oft were heard in gladness, than in tears 1 One hundred years! how few of hearts, unbroken, That saw their light, and with their suns went down! How few of hopes, then born, that left a token, That life had conquered victory, or death a crown! Again, the angel, with a brighter pluming, Descends, as dew upon a thirsting world; And barren deserts smile, as gardens blooming, And Freedom's banner is to man unfurled. Not to the east where Freedom's sons were lying, Entombed by despots, in their country's grave; But with its sister sun, the angel, flying, The Promised Land seeks on the western wave. There hills and dales, with life and love are blooming, Where once was hidden nature's solitude; Where night, as queen, with silence sat communing, And bashful stars the murky darkness wooed: There stranger nations coalesce, o'erflowing, The land where once but nature's wild man trod; There stranger tongues together blend, upgoing, In thanks and praise, for liberty, to God 1 Land of the peerless mountain, lake and river — Where all God's sons and daughters dare he free! Where man hath covenant with God, forever, That there shall be the home of Liberty! There Freedom's hosts are heart to heart replying, ' And echo gives the seas and mountains voice; May Freedom's echoes, to the nations flying, Rouse all earth's slumbering millions, to rejoice!
