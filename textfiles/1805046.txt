The Cosmopolitan The April Number of The Cosmopolitan (published April 7th) will strongly sustain the standing of that bright young magazine for the timeliness of its subjects and the crispness of its varied contents. The leading article is a delicate description, by the poet-critic George Edgar Montgomery, of Shakespeare's ' Mid-summer Night's Dream,' as produced at Daly's Theatre, copiously illustrated by portraits in character, and many of the exquisite scenes (printed in color,) which have made this play a conspicuous event in the dramatic season just closing in New York. Other timely articles are Moncure D. Conway's 'Reminiscences of Kaiser Wilhelm ' (with illustrations) drawn from his frequent contact with the Emperor during the Franco-German war, when he was Murat Halstead's comrade as special warcorrespondent; and Lucy C. Lillie's article upon Louisa May Alcott. Among the prominent contributors to this number will be found also Max O'Eell, John Burroughs, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, May Riley Smith, J. Breck Perkins, and E.P. Roe with his Southern serial story ' Misa Lou,' making all together an exceedingly attractive number.
