'LET THE MUD DRY FIRST' Heke is a capital lesson that may well be imprest upon the memory of both young and old; Mr. Spurgeon in walking 128 THE MANIFESTO. a little way out of London to preach, chanced to get his pantaloons quite muddy. A good deacon met him at the door and desired to get a brush and take off some of the mud. 'Oh no,' said Mr. Spurgeon, 'don't you see it is wet, and if you try to brash it now, you will rub the stain into the cloth? Let it dry, when it will come off easy enough and leave no mark.'' So, when men speak evil of us falselythrow mud at usdon't be in a hurry about brushing it off. Too great eagerness to rub it off, is apt to rub i$ in. Let it dry: by and by, if need be, a little effort will remove it. Don't foster scandal about yourself or others, or trouble in society, or in a church, by haste to do something. Let it alone; let it dry; it will be more easily eradicated than you think in the first heat of excitement. Time has a wonderful power in such matters. Very many things in this world will be easily got over by judiciously 'letting them dry. ï¿½Selected.
