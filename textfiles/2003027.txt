Groveland, N. Y. Feb. 3, 1890. We are thinking just now, what manner of report we can give of home proceedings that will most interest the reader. While we are pondering and exchanging one idea for another, this ''happy thought' reaches us. Make out a programme of the evening's entertainments. So here we give them. Sunday evenings are devoted, alternately, to Prayer and Singing meetings. Monday to family Readings and Recitations. Tuesday to Vocal and Instrumental music. Wednesday, Bible Class, conducted by Elder Alexander L. Work and Ella E. Winship. Thursday, Readings and Recitations by William H. Bussell. Friday, Vocal and Instrumental music. Saturday, Religious Service. Thus closes each day in some profitable way. The Society supports a 'Select School.' Winter term commenced Nov. 26th. Scholars manifest a general interest in their studies, much to the pleasure of the teacher and credit of the school. Number of scholars in attendance, 12. School taught by Ella E. Winship. Arrangements have been made for renovating the reservoirs, which action was promptly responded to by some of the enterprising members. A few days labor completed the whole. We are now rewarded with cisterns well supplied from the copious rains that soon followed. Our principal source of water for laundry and all domestic purposes is that which ''cometh down from above' and with filters for purifying it we find the most refreshing life-giving and healthful beverage that can bless humanity. Our herdsman commenced feeding ensilage to the stock January 1st. The creatures appear to relish it, and seem to think (if they do think) they are living sumptuously. We are having plenty of weather, but are puzzled to know the kind. Whether it is Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall. We experience each day some of them all. G. D. G.
