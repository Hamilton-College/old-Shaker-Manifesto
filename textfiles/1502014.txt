PARTY SPIRIT. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. Why do not the Shakers vote ? We answer briefly. For the same reason that Christ did not vote. And they take Him for their example. Voting by the ballot for civil rulers is not a Christian institution but a civil rite, and belongs exclusively to the children of this world and not to Christ's kingdom. The '' ballot' is one of the best institutions the world have to preserve order on the earth plane, where, the laws of voting, and the ballot box is kept sacred, and not perverted to a wrong use. The world have a right to the 'ballot, ' it is their privilege to vote, all who are recognized as citizens of the United States without regard to nationality,� age�sex�or color�not excepting the women of our country, especially, if they hold property, and are taxed ior it. They have a right to the 'ballot, ' and to use it as a weapon of defence, in common with all other citizens, and to help vote down and out, all tyranny and oppression, injustice and wrong, fraud and deception, chartered monopolies, and monied aristocracies, which go to endanger the liberties of the American people, and to hold in perpetual bondage, less favored classes. Such is the power of the 'ballot,' and this power is in the hands of the American people, and it is left optional with every individual, to use this power, by voting or to abstain from it. There is no law requiring every citizen of the United States to vote, because he is a citizen, and it is right it should be so, otherwise our country would not be a free country. And those who choose to vote have no right to impose the ballot on those who have conscientious scruples against voting. If it were not so, our country would not be a tree country. Father James Whittaker, in speaking on this subject, said that those who allow themselves to feel for one political party more than another, had no pai%t with him. Father James was one of the first founders of ' Shakerism.' He had the spirit of Christ, and knew whereof he affirmed. We remember the time when one of our Elders from Union Village, Ohio, a man of liberal education, and classical learning, said, 'Brethren! Are thereany parties among you? Tf so, I will tell you just which side I will join. Neither ! Christ, is not divided. His people are called to be one people, of one heart, and of one mind. ' This timely warning from one of the faithful watchmen on the walls of Zion, took effect. It put a quietus on a ' party spirit, ' antl we heard no more of voting. It served to shut out, and keep out, a k'party spirit,' from among us, from that time, henceforth. Nori'h Union, Ohio.
