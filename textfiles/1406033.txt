IN COMMUNION. MARIA T. SCHULTZ God give us strength! our struggling hearts Grow weary with our pain,�our growing' pain; Hope baffles u�, and Peace departs,� And in our weakness we complain, complain ! We would be strong in nerve and will, Brave, to endure, throughout their weary length, These days of trial,�pain, and ill, Which burthen us with fear;�God give us strength. God give us light! our tear-wet e3-es, Grow strangely dim with watching forii sign Of Thy dear favor! will the skies Of upper spheres let their light for Us shine ? We would see clearly through the dust Of doubt, which doth environ us, as night; Our faith, imperfect yet, we trust, But trust not wholly: Oh God, give, us light! God give us truth! our hungry souls Grow discontent with earth's material things; Our longings infinite, control, And help our spiritual sufferings ! We would be fed! break unto us Thy living bread; Thy hand of love, in ruth, Upon our bowed heads la}-, and thus, Requite our living pain! Gcd give us truth! God give us rest! our patient feet, And careful hands, with toiling, tired grow, Our hearts, grown anxious, look to meet Some answer to our praying here below. We long for rest! not idleness, Or dull inertia, but a blessing, blest Of Thee, to wean our weariness Of heart awa5%�Oh dear God, give us rest! Canaan, N. Y.
