Human Elevation means Animal Extinction It is well known that since mankind's advent, many species and varieties of animals have become extinct. Now, is it not as reasonable to believe that when the human race shall have become sufficiently refined and spiritualized to no longer need nor feed upon animals, they will all disappear from the globe? And may not internal parts of the human body likewise disappear? Animals are to the erection and completion of the human kingdom what scaffoldings are to the construction of a dwelling. When the structure is finished the builders remove the instrumentalities, so that other and higher artisans may proceed with the finer works ; and after the gardens are prepared, the decorations completed, and the furniture arranged, it is then natural to expect and welcome the angel of the house. And if animals are man's indispensable predecessors and subordinates, are they not fully entitled to human sympathy and uniform kindness? â€” A, J. Davis
