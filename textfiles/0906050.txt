IF WE HAD BUT A DAY Mary Lowe Dickenson C. G. Reed 1. We should fill the hour with the sweetest things, If we had but a day; 2. We should guide our wayward or wearied wills, By celestial light; 3. We should waste no moment in weak regret Ii the day were but one; We should drink alone at the purest springs, In our upward way. We should keep our eyes on the heavenly hills If they lay in sight. But secure the treasure our souls would bless Ere the set of sun. We should loye with a life-time's love in an hour, If the hours were few, Wo should trample our pride and our discontent, All beneath our feet, We should bo from our selfishness wholly free, Live to work or pray, We should rest not for dreams, but for fresher power, To be and do. We should take whatsoever a good God sent, With trust complete. And to be what the Father would have us be, Thro' out the day.
