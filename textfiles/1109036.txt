REQUEST BY A YOUNG SISTER UNDER INFIRMITY CATHARINE ALLEN When with the saint's assembled In worship's holy hour, Where unseen hosts have gathered, With blest redeeming power ; Where offerings of the faithful With fragrance fill the air, And angel gifts are falling, Oh, breathe for me one prayer ! When round the holy altar Where sacrament is given, The wine of truth eternal, And living bread from, heaven ; And you with dearest kindred In soul communion share, Some crumbs for me, O gather And think of me in prayer. To drink from living fountains My spirit is athirst, And lest my hand be strengthened, The rock I cannot burst. Through you as mediators, Relation I can share, With purified immortals, Who answer to my prayer. I know I am dependent, My sould would famished be, If that I only merit Were given unto me ; And meager seem the raiment My spirit form would wear, Without a woven garment Of charity and prayer. Though shadows of affliction My pathway now have crossed, The light that shines above me Can 'ne'er be dimmed nor lost ; If I in spirit lowly Will seek the angel's care, And you my gospel kindred Remember me in prayer. I'll seek the flowing river, And wash my soul from stain, I'll prove the heated furnace, Until no dross remains. And when the clouds are breaking, And lightnings rend the air, To gain a new baptism, 0 help me by your prayer. I'll arm my soul for contest, 'Gainst selfishness and sin, Will list to wisdom's counsels, And bear the cross within ; I would not shrink from duty, But toil and trial bear, That healing power be given, Remember me in prayer. Others with soul and body Renewed for holy strife, Thank offerings I will render, In fruits of holy life ; And thus to those who've blest me, With patient, loving care, Through consecrated service, . Give recompense for prayer.
