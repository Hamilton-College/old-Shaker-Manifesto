KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES. MARCIA E. HASTINGS. Don't lag and suspend, and postpone ; be ambitious to appear well in every sense of the word. Use pood language,�pure, gentle, simple, modest,�with no slang phrases. As a wellspring to this good language cherish pure thoughts and feelings, harbor none others. Be polite and graceful in conversation, in manners and movements,� sitting, standing or walking. Avoid foiling on furniture, window sill, or against the wall of a room or doorcase, especially in the apartments of superiors and seniors. This advice may be thought out of date and unnecessary, with the great advantages and much teaching of the present day ; but I have occasion to think that more regard to ihese lessons will not be amiss. Mother Ann taught that a reprimand or correction for an error should be heeded when once given, and never be needed a second time. In this way progress is made and spiritual life, with happiness and contentment obtained. Persons who allow themselves to be indifferent and careless, neglecting to amend when shown a fault or awkwardness, with the slipshod return, 'I forgot it'�'I don't think of it, '�ilI haven't thought of it since,' are not happy, not vigorous and growing in grace, certainly not beautiful and lovely. Advantages for good education are abundant, improve them aright, as they are presented ; not sluggishly wait to be urged, driven to use energy and brain ; use strengthens brain as well as muscle. Nay, don't be indifferent and loth to exert yourself to mental or physical usefulness, and in the future have to regret your stupidity and wish somebody had obliged you to learn when you were young. Bestir yourself of your own accord, from an ambition to be equal in talent and goodness to the best of your class. Come up to the mark, improve every advantage in your means, in union and by approval of your kind teachers and advisers ; thus keep up wi:,h the times. With interested love for everyone.
