Shaker Station, Conn. July, 1894. 'Blessed are the meek.' We are exhorted by precept and example, to have a meek, submissive disposition, a resigned spirit. Meekness is one of the characteristics of God's people. One of the fruits of the spirit is meekness, and we are encouraged to walk in the heavenly pathway 'with all lowliness and meekness' and to 'put on mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, long-suffering' and to follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love and patience. We are told if these things abound in us, we shall be dilligent, earnest workers in God's vineyard. There is no such thing as being too humble and meek. Let us increase in every virtue that will fit us for that home where we wish to go. 'Say nothing that you would not like God to hear.' 'Do nothing that you would not like God to see.' 'Write nothing that you would not like God to read.' 'Go to no place where you would not like God to find you.' 'Never spend your time in such a way, that you would not like God to say, 'What are you doing?' ' There is but one foundation for happiness, truth and purity. If the cross has been borne the crown will be worn. 'Time was, is past; thou canst not it recall. Time is, thou hast; employ the portion small. Time future, is not, and may never be; Time present, is the only time for thee.' ******* 'The processes which convert the heavy bar of pig iron into the finest cambric needles, are too manifold to enumerate, though all are interesting, perhaps most of all, the drilling of the eye. So delicate a task is this, that the skilled workman can drill a hair and pierce it with its end. Auditorium building, Chicago, length 362 feet, width 187 feet, height twenty stories, or 266 feet. Cost of structure $3, 000 000.' ****** * One of the greatest drawbacks to beginners in poultry growing, is to attempt to keep one hundred hens in a house or lot none too large for fifty. Poultry yards should be on sandy soil, if possible, in order to avoid mud on the ground, as roup is liable to affect the flocks that are kept in wet locations. Barley should be fed spairingly to laying hens, as its nature is too fattening. Daniel Orcutt. South. Family. July, 1894. How delightful to gaze upon the beauties of nature at the present time, and to listen to the music of the feathered songsters as they fill the air with peans of delight. It does not fail to call forth inspirations of love to the Giver of all good for the blessings that rest upon our lives. Whenever my heart receives such ministrations, it uplifts, strengthens and brings a peaceful influence which elevates the mind and I recognize that Power whose ways are wise; whose works are grand. As time is swiftly passing I desire to become quickened and gain a new comprehension of life and its duties. June was extremely dry and on the last day of the month a very hard shower came which was much needed, but for the new and commodious facilities for watering the 192 THE MANIFESTO. garden, tl;e effect of I lie drouth would have been more conspicuous. The strawberries were much b( nefitted by it, and made good returns with a bountiful supply of nice fruit. The peas also were made to yield a good supply, by watering. All the early vegetables have come in their season, currants and cherries quite plentiful. The corn, potatoes and tomatoes, are in good growing condition but rather later for the drouth. Our haying has just commenced, so far the weather has been propitious, so warm and dry. The prospect for apples is not favorable, although the blossoms were extremely full and promising, but the fruit is falling off while very small. Pears are looking finely. Thankfulness for the constant blessings enjoyed, should fill our hearts, knowing a Father's love keeps watch, and rest content to know his way is best. Maria Witharn.
