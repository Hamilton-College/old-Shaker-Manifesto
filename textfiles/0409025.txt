Sexual promiscuity... 1. Sexual promiscuity â€” corresponds to savageism ; or the gross, selfish and sensual in human nature. 2. Marriage, for the propagation and education of the race. This institution lies at the foundation of society and civilization in the natural order. 3. Celibacy; alias life in the mental and moral brain-region rather than the cerebellum. Plato, Jesus, Appollonius, Michael Angelo, Sir Isaac Newton, Miss Bremer, Florence Nightingale, John G. Whittier, the Quaker poet, and a whole galaxy of the great and good, lived and live celibate lives. All live thus in the Spirit World of immortality. J. M. Peebles
