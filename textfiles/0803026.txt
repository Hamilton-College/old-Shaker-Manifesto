OUR HOPES We do not expect to live to any great age ; but we do live in large hopes of hearing, that through the gift of some benevolent person, having no better use for it, the sum of at least ten thousands of dollars has been put out at interest in behalf of The Shaker Manifesto ! We have ever been confident, of living to see this provision made for The Shaker, either in propria personse, or springing from the posthumous relics of some one or ones, who, sitting in the heavens, will thus everlastingly smile on us, or the work being done by our modest Manifesto. Do you think, will it be so?
