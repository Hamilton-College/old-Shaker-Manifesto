WITTY AND TRUE Rowland Hill Some of the sayings of that pious but witty clergyman, Rev. were remarkable for hitting the nail on the head. Not another blow was needed to drive it home. Being very much grieved at the conduct of some of his congregation, who were frequently unpunctual, he once offered the following prayer : '•' O Lord, bless those who are in their places, have mercy on those who are on the road, and save those who are getting ready to come.' He once said of a man who knew the truth, but seemed afraid to preach it in its fullness: ' He preaches the truth as a donkey mumbles a thistle — very cautiously.' On a wet day a number of persons took shelter in his chapel, during a heavy shower, while he was preaching; he remarked: 'Many people are blamed for making their religion a cloak, but I do not think those are much better who make it an umbrella.' Entering the house of one of his congregation, he saw a child on a rocking horse : ' Dear me,' exclaimed the aged minister, ' how wondrously like some Christians ; there is motion, but no progress.' A professed Christian, who was addicted to drinking, asked him impertinently,' Now, do you think, Mr. Hill, that a glass of spirits would drive religion out of my heart ? ' ' No,' he answered, ' for there is none in it.' A lady who professed religion, but whose daily practice was not in harmony with it, once said to him, ' I am afraid lest after all I shall not be saved.' ' I am glad to hear you say so,' replied Mr. Hill, ' for I have been long afraid for you, I assure you.''
