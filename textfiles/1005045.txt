Fried Oysters . â€” Get the largest and finest oysters, rinse them in clear water, and dry them quite dry in a cloth. Beat up the yolks of two eggs, and thin with half a gill of milk. Dip each oyster separately into the egg and milk, and then into very finely powdered cracker-crumbs. Let them lie an hour, and dip them in the egg and cracker again, and then fry them in plenty of melted butter, which must be so hot that it will brown them at once. They must be turned over in the boiling fat, and the whole operation must not take over five minutes.
