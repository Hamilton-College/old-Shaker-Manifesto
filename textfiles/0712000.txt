'WHAT LACK I YET?' JAMES G. RUSSELL Good master, what would'st thou have me to do, That I may have eternal life in thee? I seek a part within thy kingdom new; What further sacrifice remains for me ? The things that thou hast mentioned—all h ;\e 1 Most sacredly observed, and ever set My heart intent on godliness, whereby I would in truth be free: what lack I yet? Loved one—the goodly master now responds— If perfect thou would'st toe, go sell thine all, And give unto the poor, release their bonds, Then come and follow me. Most blessed call! And yet behold the sorrowful effect! The sacrifice too great, for great indeed Were earth's possessions, thus to resurrect And unto God the miser'd soul to lead. Away the anxious face with sorrow turns, With feelings of dismay and deep regret, Though for eternal life the spirit yearns— Comes forth in words of grief—much lack I yet! Ah, is the sacrifice too great to make ? A life of woridliness to lay- aside? The Christian pathway cheerfully to take ? And in the loving grace of God abide ? Thou surely shalt have treasures stored in heaven, If cheerfully the price thou'lt fully pay, If unto God thy time and strength be given, To walk with care the self-denjing way, Though worldly riches be the selfish part, That calls for sacrifice, though great or small, Or be the idol sinfumess of heart, That seeks indulgence, allied to the fall; Whatever be the part for sacrifice, If God's pure love is all in all to thee, From worldly loves and pleasures thou may'st rise, And in my kingdom have a part with me.
