New Bedford, May 28, 1877 Dear Friend: Enclosed you will find 60 cents to pay for The Shaker. I will say that the paper is very satisfactory to my mind and I could only wish that it was published weekly and enlarged to the size of the religious press of Boston. Why not publish it weekly, and raise the price? I believe the growing, liberal sentiment of the New England community would sustain such a paper, especially that large class who are sick of the teachings of ' orthodoxy,' with its Sabbaths, vicarious atonement, and very many other absurd doctrines. In conclusion, I wish The Shaker God-speed in its mission to redeem the world. Yours truly, Caleb C. Peckham
