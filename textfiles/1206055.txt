Grumblers Chronic grumblers are pests from which the Church may well pray to be delivered, especially if they grumble with a serene confidence in their own superior sanctity, under shelter of their own groundless assumptions. As long as they sit in their bomb-proof of self-complacency, and seold at the Lord's workers through some convenient hole, it is useless to answer them with facts or arguments. They are too good to do anything themselves, and as nobody else does anything to suit them, they grumble for their own glory. Well, let them enjoy themselves ! Evangelical Messenger
