WRITE The Spirit says, 'Write' —What shall I write? — 'Write what oometh unto thee.' Now, more than ever before, is soul atmosphere permeated with elements of progress — of human elevation — more than ever before, are the old heavens — old religious organizations, creeds and forms, on which men did rely — being dissolved—the elements, thereof, melting with fervent heat. Henceforth, will men and women work out their salvation, instead of having it rubbed in from the outside. New Heavens are being formed in the Souls of the People. In the souls of such as aspire to the purity of Angels. No darkness in the New Heavens — neither act, word, feeling nor thought, that will not bear the searching light. Who will ascend the hill of the Lord ? Who will be living stones, builded into the Living Temple of the Living God ? Splendid opportunity now, to draw the highest prize. What of the old Earth — the generative order f That, too, has become affected. The fact is — the old Heavens, and Earth — religion and generation — have been so mixed up, compounded and confounded, that both are sick, past recovery. No D. D.'s nor M. D.'s can resuscitate them. We must have new earth, as well as new heavens. In the New Earth — new order of generation, use is the motto — the cardinal — the organic law — no abuse — no prostitution of generative organs. Those, whose aspirations reached not to the highest prize — the new Heavens —may find a field, lower doAvn — in the new Earth. We do not say they will get lower-priced article. We only say they will get an article not worth so much. What per cent, of what is called humanity, will aspire to the new Heaven — what per cent to the new Earth remains to be seen. The remainder, through delicacy, we'll call debris — of no account. Oliver Prentis, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
