Whitewashing Good whitewash, well applied to fences, rough siding, and the walls and ceilings of buildings, has a highly sanitary influence, as well as being in the highest degree preservative in its effects. To be durable, whitewash should be prepared in the following manner: Take the very best stone-lime, and slack it in a close tub, covered with a cloth to preserve the steam. Salt — as much as can be dissolved in water used for slacking and reducing the lime — should be applied, and the whole mass carefully strained and thickened with a small quantity of sand, the purer and finer, the better. A few pounds of wheat flour mixed as paste may be added, and will give greater durability to the mass, especially when applied to the exterior surface of buildings. With pure lime, properly slacked and mixed with twice its weight of fine sand and sifted wood-ashes, in equal proportions, almost any color may be made by the addition of pigments. Granite, slate, freestone and other shades may be imitated, and without any detriment to the durability of the wash. The covering is very often applied and with good effect, to underpinning, stone fences, roof, and the walls of barns and other out-buildings. Germantown Telegraph
