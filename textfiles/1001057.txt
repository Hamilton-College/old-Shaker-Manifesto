Valuable manifesto hints Valuable Manifesto Hints.— Shelter the stock from storms. Keep all in a growing condition ; not necessarily fat, but give sufficiently of fodder and grain to keep off the ' stunt.' It is easier and cheaper to keep stock thriving, than to start growth and good conditions after a decline. Feed regularly. Remember we keep cows mainly to give us milk. Let their feed and warmth all tend to this end — best for the cows — best for us. Early lambs must have the shepherd's extra care; and this ' extra' may be better spent in taking unusual care of the lamb's mothers than of the lambs. Let all the stock get to the sun's rays. Let fowls have dry dirt to wallow in; and dust horn cattle frequently on the backs with fine sand it will disperse vermin and prevent hide binding. Work the horses, blanket when not moving; feed enough, but be careful about overfeeding in the winter. Remember, on stormy days, to wash, mend and oil the harnesses.
