NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Sontli Family. June 4. 1890. Dear Editor :�Almost an unheard-ofthing happened last Sabbath afternoon. It was a beautiful day, and four lovely people from the North Family came to the Sunny South to have a visit. Elder Frederick Evans our dear father whom we love, and Br. Daniel Offord whom we respect, Eldress Anna White whom we all admire, and no less our precious Sister Martha Anderson. Do you not think we were highly honored? We wanted Elder Frederick's autograph. He wrote this original verse, Like a candle almost out, Or a person in a doubt, Flickering, burning very low, Studying, shall I stay or go. Eight here we must say that the oldest Sister of Mt. Lebanon who has been quire bright all winter, has during the past week been sick, and at the age of ninety-two has passed over the river. She came to Mt. Lebanon while young, of her own free-will, and has from infancy lived a divinely pure life. We have a good Samaritan here by name Sister Louisa Rice, and who during forty years has patiently cared for the infirm, the sick and the dying; 'Glory to the righteous, who can know their worth?' S. A. C. , TsTortli ITa,mily. June 12, 1890. On the 8th. our Society Meetings were opened. I did not number the people, but there was a large assembly. Farm and garden operations have been put rather behind, on account of the weather. Eain, weeds and worms, with winged insects are far too prolific. I never saw the tent caterpillars so numerous on the fruit and forest trees as they have been this spring. Many trees have been entirely stripped of all foliage. We need the God of Israel to come among us, and teach us how and what to do, to be saved from the curse of worms, flies and bugs. Israel of old was, according to the Scriptural record entirely saved from this curse, when obedient. Where is the wise man, spirit or God, that will tell us just what to do to be saved. On the 9th, Elder Frederick completed his eighty-second year, sixty of which have been spent among Believers. A company of five, one Brother and four Sisters are busily preparing for a visit to all the Eastern Societies Glorious are the anticipations, but as nothing to the realization. They start in the forepart of July. Peace and joy to all. Daniel Offord. Center Famliy. June 14, 1890. Dear Elder Henry :�Last Wednesday night we had a terrific wind-storm doing considerable damage in the gardens breaking down beans, tomatoes and corn and stripping off cherries so the ground was quite covered with them, they were rather scarce before the storm, but much more so now. Our prospect for pears and plums is very slim indeed this season, yet we are buoyed up with the hope of having enough of other fruits to make us comfortable. The Sisters have just about finished spring's cleaning, there are so many buildings to be cared for it comes quite hard on them. Brethren have done a little painting inside the dwelling on the bath room and Vestibule on east side of house. I have had considerable difficulty this season with Hubbard Squash seed, in getting it to grow , something destroys it in the ground and that little pest the mole has made me much work in the hot-bed by rooting under the plants. But with all these drawbacks, we have enough to be thankful for; a good degree of health and a fair share of prosperity in temporal things. Your Brother, T. R.
