0FFENCES. AGNES E. NEWTON. Jesus said, 'Woe unto the world because of offences ! for it must needs be that offences come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh.' Matt, xviii., 7. The sin of intemperance, is one of the world's offences, which can never be eradicated, until those claiming to be Christians, at least, are in possession of the spirit which enabled St. Paul to say, 'Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.' 1 Cor. viii., 18. The act, or condition, occasioning the offence may not be sinful, in and of itself, that is, in its effects upon the perpetrator of the act. Those, upon whose lives, the blighting effects of intemperance have never fallen, may taste the wine cup without serious injury to themselves; but to the companions, with whom they are associated, some of whom may have inherited the almost unconquerable taste for strong drink, the power of example, becomes a rock of cffence, upon which, the characters of many become hopelessly shipwrecked. Intentionally unkind, or thoughtless words, personal habits, and selfish considerations of whatever name or nature, which would cause a weaker brother to offend, should be brought into obedience to the perfect law of Christ, the author of the new commandment. His followers love each other, with that love which enables a man to lay down his (selfish) life for the good of his friends. Canterbury, N. H.
