John Whiteley, My Dear Friend... South Fitciiburg Mass., Jan. 1893. John Whiteley, My Dear Friend ;ï¿½ In looking over my papers, I notice your excellent letter of Dec. 15th. We have seventy or more boarders in our charge, ranging from three months to eighty-four years. Some are passing away with consumption and some from old age. We know whereof we speak when we say that humauity is a mixed problem. O Elder John! If the masses could be prevailed upon to live sober and be industrious, taking the example of your people, what untold blessings would be in store for them while posterity could truthfully bless their memory. God help us all as we look up to the hills from whence comethour strength. Sad, indeed, must be the reflections of a misspent life. Thank God, Elder John, with all our short-comings, to think that you and I are not cursed with these sad memories. I often think of the influence that a Christian life had upon me following the years of my engagements with you. It was the fork in the road of my existence or journey, and I took to the right. Your idea is that in the ratio we aid weak humanity we help ourselves up the grade of life. We cannot emphasize the fact too strongly, that we help our own cause in life when smoothing off wherever we can, the rough places in the pathway of weak humanity. To one person who came to our home, I said, 'If you will try and be a man among men, I shall help you,' and he promised with tears. In three months he was able to attend church in the city, and his most intimate friends did not know him. Although there may have been some cases of failure, in our trying to assist our fellow men, yet I shall lose no opportunity or courage in trying again and again. In friendship and interest, George H. Jefts.
