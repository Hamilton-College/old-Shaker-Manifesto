East Canterbury, N. H North Family. Dec. 1893. In the year that has nearly passed, we can with pleasure look back to the many comforts and blessings, both temporal and spiritual. These, an all-wise Providence has bestowed upon us, to make home pleasant and to draw our hearts to a greater consecration in God's service. For all his blessings we are truly thankful and in the beginning of the glad New 20 THE MANIFESTO. Year would consecrate our souls anew to that spiritual understanding which is given to us through Christ our Savior. Our hearts swell with gratitude, for the pleasant surroundings that encompass us, and for this we would give to God all our services. We are thankful for temporal blessings and for the bounteous harvest we have received. Hay an average crop, and housed in good condition. Apples not abundant but we will be thankful for a few. We harvested a good crop of potatoes, and by the unremitting labors of Elder Nicholas we had a nice family garden and a good yield of lovage. Our door-yard has been made a flowery dell, the past summer, by the Sisters with a little extra help. We thank God for the gifts he has given to us. Let us put these talents to such use that when the Divine Teacher calls we may hear the welcome sound, 'Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' Potter Dyball.
