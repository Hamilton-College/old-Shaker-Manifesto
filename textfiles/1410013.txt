BABU PROTAP MAZ00MDAR AND DR. SCUDDER. [Contributed by G. B. Avery.]Babu Protap Chancier Mozoomdar, the Hindoo, was invited to speak in Dr. Scudder's Plymouth Church, while here, cind there he gave expressions to views not exactly in harmony with those of the distinguished divine whose pulpit he was temporarily occupying, and which creatad for outsiders a very pleasant ripple of merriment. The celebrated Hindoo alluded to the Christian missionaries and their work in India in the highest terms, and then naively said that he 'could not congratulate them on their success in reaching the national heart there, because they did not conciliate the peculiar religious tendencies which existed in the Hindoo mind as it is. ' He thought there should be more conciliation in regard to the views of the Hindoos. For this candid expression of his own personal views, it has been whispered that Dr. Scudder told him that he had acted a part that he considered not exactly proper and courteous under the circumstances, and in order to controvert his position, he made a prolific statement to a reporter of the InterOcean, giving an elaborate account of the success that had crowned the labors of the missionaries among the Hindoos. The public will be allowed, of course, to take their choice in the statements of the respective parties, the same as in all other questions of dispute now agitating the public mind,�the majority probably leaning favorably towards the views expressed by the distinguished Hindoo, who, in response to a question from Dr. Scudder, said that he did not know about Southern India; his remarks had been in regard to Northern India. Had Dr. Scudder carefully read what the New York and Chicago papers have said of Mozoomdar's addresses in this country, he would have considered him too liberal to occupy his pulpit, to which he invited him, and then like a little pampered boy, pouted because he wasn't reflected in the remarks that were made. However, notwithstanding Dr. Scudder's displeasure, he paid his foreign visitor a high compliment during his interview with a reporter, saying : ' He is one of the ablest men I ever knew. Chunder Sen, at the head of the movement, is one of the grandest men the world has today. And I believe they both are Christians. I have read Mozoomdar's ' Oriental Christ, ' and from that and his talk I believe he is a Christian. That was why I invited him into my pulpit. He may call it Brahmo Somai or what he will, but my opinion is it is Christianity, and that his conversion was brought about by the influence of the missionaries, I bid them and their new movement Godspeed, and I hope it will do much for India and help the Christian missionaries to convert the land. But we must not get discouraged so easily. In this country, a Christian nation, one person in five is nominally a Christian� attends church. India has five times as many people as this country, and it will take a long time to convert her 250,000,000 heathens.' Religio P. J.
