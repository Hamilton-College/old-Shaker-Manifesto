Notes from Florida. Live Oak Lake, Aug. 1895. Am I to be the first to send some Home Xotes from our new home, if so I hope I shall do justice to the occasion. Our little company are trying to build up a home spiritual as well as temporal, and how we shall succeed the future only can tell. We are building on the principle of love and kindness which is the fundamental work of the gospel of Christ. This includes a love for every Brother and Sister as we shall manifest it to them through acts of kindness. We need not fear to show our colors, especially to our friends upon whom we so much depend. Of course we must exercise our best judgment in all that may be presented to us. Out of the good treasures of the heart let the mouth speak to those who form the home, as often as opportunity may offer. Kindness begets kindness and an interest in the prosperity of others becomes reciprocal. There are many homes that hold a vacant chair, where it would have been otherwise if an affectionate regard had been expressed, and a little encouragement extended to them in the hour of need.
