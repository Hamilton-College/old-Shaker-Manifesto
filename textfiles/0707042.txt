BOOK TABLE 'What Shall I Do to be a Shaker?' Plain Talks on Practical Religion. By Geo. A. Lomas, Editor of The Shaker, Shakers, N. Y. The writer favors 'the eradication of all sexual, sensual lusts,' thinks 'the holding of private property belongs to the earthly, generative state;' that 'Marrriage, War, Riches, Poverty, and Slavery' indicate a depraved moral condition ; that Ann Lee, the Shaker Christ, who said, 'Put your hands to labor and give your souls to God,' was the . Queen of social architects; and says the Shakers 'were thoroughly convinced of spirit communication, guidance and obsession long before the Rochester Rappings.' A vigorous and incisive statement of Shaker doctrines, it shows an intelligent sense of reigning unrighteousness in society, customs, and governments. The book inspires us with a deeper respect for Shakerism than we before entertained.â€”The Word. Evening Times, Albany, N. Y. To those who are at all interested in affairs at the cap* ital of the Empire State, we advise them to subscribe for the Albany Evening Times. Its columns are filled with the choicest reading and news ; it is a paper for family reading : none but the most select and chaste of advertisements grace its borders, while its editorials, according to the remarks of a political opponent, are 'unequaled by any north of the city of New York, and scarcely there.' We know whereof we speak, and, unsolicited, we give it the highest encomiums type are capable of expressing.
