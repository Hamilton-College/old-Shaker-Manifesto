POWER OF FAITH MARTHA J. ANDERSON Mount Lebanon, N. Y. __Feelingly. Thou who hast walked upon the wave, And calmed the storm on Galilee, Come forth again with power to save, And bid the faithless come to thee. For tempest tossed like those of old, Are hearts depressed with doubt and fear, May such, through faith, enjoy, behold, A blessed Saviour ever near. 2. The same rebuke, Oh, may we bear, Which was to thy disciples given, Oh, ye of little faith beware Lest ye may slight the gifts of heaven; Oh, that our souls might feel the glow Of faith that filled thy soul with light, And shed its radiance here below, To beam with lasting glory bright. 3. How beautiful that holy trust, Which made thy life a work sublime, Whose noble deeds undimmed by rust, Have lived through all the years of time. The earthly miud still seeks a sign. As did the ancient Pharisee, But, give us, Lord, that faith divine, Which blest thy heavenly ministry. The faith that works by truth and love, To search and puriiy the heart, Which turns the mind to joys above, From sin and worldliness apart. As oft we ask in silent prayer From out the soul's Gethsemane, Our spirits, trusting, own thy care, And look for strength and help from thee.
