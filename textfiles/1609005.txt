WORK. ANDREW BARRETT. ' And he said, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves nor scrip, neither bread nor moneyï¿½' Lukeix; 3. Do the true followers of Christ need to wait for power to fit them for the work of convicting souls to righteousness ? Nay, not if they are Christians in thought, word and deed ; for in that case they always have it with them an ever present minister, and need only to put it in use to have the desired results. Conviction of soul comes by soul and hand labor. Not waiting for some miraculous preparation. Power from on high is revealed to those who work, not to those who wai^ while duty calls. The command is not to wait, but ' go work in my vineyard.'' Go preach with the promise, ' Lo I am with you always. ' 'Pray without ceasing' is excellent counsel but prayer and work together will bring better results. 'Wait upon the Lord' reiterates the Psalmist. '' They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.' But this waiting upon the Lord and looking to Him continually for strength is very different from waiting for Him to do our work. It is not waiting for the spirit with folded arms, hoping for some great influx of power, that is going to fill the net with good fish. As well might the invalid expect to get strength by lying in bed and feeling of his muscles or invoking a supernatural power that would supersede personal exertion to walk. Therefore, instead of waiting for the spirit to awake souls to a consciousness of their lives, and produce a revival among them, let us enter upon the work ourselves with perfect faith in God that his Spirit will go with us and give us strength for the day and hour. True faith looks to God and laughs at impossibilities. What has been done can be done again, say the followers of Christ, and with this faith they enter upon the work assigned to them. 'Verily the storm rages and the ship is engulfed in the waves.' If the Christ is asleep is it not our duty to awaken Him ; if we do not whose fault is it if we perish? Ayer, Mass.
