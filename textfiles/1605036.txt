THE BROOM. To and fro moves the broom Across the room. With active grace, It seeks each place, While the guiding hand, With a firm and forceful motion, Seems to understand, And pay a true devotion To the sacred art of neatness, To the purity and sweetness That should reign in every room, Through tne service of the broom. Earnestly the patient broom Seeks the shreds throughout the room; Gives to corners zealous care, Lest the atoms lurking there Breathe a strain upon the air. A Many feet maybe have met, And their impress there have set. But the broom in circling round Makes of all one common ground. Gathered in a centered heap, Each with all communion keep, Like the thoughts of men that come and go; Then together like a river flow. .Living lessons, grand and strong, Are taught in this the house broom's songï¿½ Day by day, Prepare the way, Sweep from out the soul its selfish aiming! Sweep away the greed of foolish gaming! Sweep from side, from corner, and trom center, Loose the shutters, let God's sunlight enter; Crowning conscience with her trusty broom As she purifies the worker's room. Inter-Ocean.
