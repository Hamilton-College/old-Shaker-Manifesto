FUNERAL EULOGIES Said a certain man of parts and great vices : 'Do not let such a minister speak at my funeral, for he will lie in my favor : nor such a one, for he will gloat over my sins ; but get a man of sense, that will leave me with God and posterity and say a tender word to my family.' The praising of bad or equivocal men by the press or the pulpit has a bad effect on youth, by instilling into their minds the feeling that there is, after all, no radical distinction between the good and the bad.
