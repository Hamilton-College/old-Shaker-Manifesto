South. Union, Ky. April 14, 1805. This is Easter Sunday morning, find 'behold the lilies of the field' how beautiful they are, as fair and bright and odorous ats they were in the vales of old Palestine m the days of Jesus whose resurrection from the grave we commemorate to-day. This is a day well fitted for oration and sermon, prayer and song: for the sky is so blue and the air so clear, so soft, so refreshing, one feels as if he were in the Better Land. For the birds thrill both air and tree with their warbling song, and the sward beneath our feet is dotted with variegated daisies and yellow dandelions. There is a very good prospect for a fruit crop this year, for the trees are ablaze with a radiance of bloom, unsurpassed in former years. Our corn is planted, and all kinds of work are progressing. New fences are taking the place of old ones; new grasses look more pleasant to the eye than the old broom sedge that has covered some of our pasture fields so many years and the painter too is using his brush with a facile hand. He is making the facade of our buildings to look brighter and better. The prospect of an exodus from this Society is not very promising at this writing. In about four weeks we will have an abundance of bright red, delicious strawberries. How good they are powdered with sugar and covered with cream to eat with cake. James Carr.
