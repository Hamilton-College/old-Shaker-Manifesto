VIRTUE. Annie R. Stephens. Could I my pencil dip in heavenly rays, All virtue I would paint in dazzling light, And rival them with sunset's radiance bright. Blest souls are they! who, in life's early days Have taught their feet to walk in Wisdom's ways; With inmost beings touched with God's own light, Their hearts forever pledged to truth and right, Archangels chant for them the hymns of praise. But' be it mine, this humble gift I pray, All good to love, admire and strive to know, And may all virtue in yon distant day, Along my character divinely glow. Like sunlight rifts obscuring clouds of gray, And o'er the earth a veil of joy doth throw. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
