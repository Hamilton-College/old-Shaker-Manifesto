Dear Editor: Of that little monthly... Mount Lebanon, Feb. 12, 188. '&gt;. Dear Editor : Of that little monthly sunbeam. I hope you will kindly place the following stanza in some corner of the Manifesto. It is sweet to me and might contain encouragement to others. Just as easy to live aright, Powerfully maintain the fight. You will truly receive more light. Manfully to climb each height. A great deal of varied thought is contained in it, and can be applied by each soul to itself. I am yours truly, Leopold Homan.
