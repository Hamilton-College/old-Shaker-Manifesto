A NEW YEAR. Ida Lackey. How swiftly the years pass by! It hardly seems possible that twelve months have elapsed since we were making so many good resolutions, and were so sure that the future would bear a better record than the past. But today as we sit meditating at the close of the Old Year, and as it were on the verge of the New, we realize either in joy or sorrow, how much success has attended our efforts. Perhaps we have felt, at times, in days past that we have been left alone, or without the special tender words of sympathy and encouragement, which childish years demanded, and upon which we then so much depended. To-day as we look back we can trace a gentle hand that was guiding and a watchful eye ever anxious to see which path we would choose if left to our own strength. Or, if we have fallen among thieves did we not find the 'Good Samaritan,' or did not the 'Good Samaritan' find us ? and is this not a proof that we were not entirely forsaken ? Let us gather all the lessons we can from our past successes and failures, as a means of help and encouragement for another year, which we must commence at ouce for ' Time and tide wait for no man.' We must begin now to write with care another volume of Life's History. As mentally I view these pages in their perfect whiteness, there is a sincere prayer rising from my heart to our Heavenly Parents and angel guardians, that we may not be left to ourselves as unprofitable servants, but 'Asking their guidance though often we stray, When light and conviction are pointing the way.'
