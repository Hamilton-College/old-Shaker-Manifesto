A minister was riding through a section of the State of South Carolina, where custom forbade innkeepers to take pay from the clergy who staid with them. The minister in question took supper without pra3'er, and ate breakfast without prayer or grace, and was about to take his departure when 'mine host' presented his bill. 'Ah, sir,' said he, 'I am a clergyman!' That may be,' responded Boniface; 'but you came here, smoked like a sinner, and ate and drank like a sinner, and slept like a sinner; and now, sir, you shall pay like a sinner.'
