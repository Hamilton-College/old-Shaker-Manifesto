It is always easy to count our trials and difficulties... It is always easy to count our trials and difficulties, but we should not be unmindful of the sweet scented gardens through which we pass, nor of the angels of comfort with whom we frequent, who present us with heavenly flowers, which in our hearts die not, neither lose their sweetness, the blossoms of faith, hope, innocence and love, and the white lily of purity which I would guard most sacredly from aught that would wither or blight. C. Allen.
