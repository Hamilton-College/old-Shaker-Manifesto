UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCE. It is daily life that tests usthe manner of men we are. It is not our prayer, it is not our profession; but it is the tone of daily intercourse and conduct that decides how we stand. The little, homely graces; the cheerful, every-day amenities; the Christ spirit uttering itself not so much in conscious act as in unconscious influence ; not so much in deeds as in that subtle aroma which, without name, exudes from the saintly soul to equals and inferiors; to agreeable and disagreeable; to rich, poor, ignorant; to young, to old; bearing burdens, accepting crosses, seeking no great thing to do, content to put self by, and be a servant of the lowest these are fruits of only one rootfruits that none may counterfeit. ï¿½Selected.
