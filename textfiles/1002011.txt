NOT AS I WILL Ida T. Burger [Lines written by a short time before her decease, aged 21.] Not as 1 will, 0 Father, When filled my cup appears * My soul seeks light in darkness, While in this vale of tears. Not as 1 will, O Father — Thy will be done through me, And in the last bright sunset, My gifts I'll bring to Thee. Not as 1 will, 0 Father—While kneeling at thy shrine, Will I break the bread Thou givest. But in Thy will, not mine. Nay ; not my will 0 Father! Thy bread and wine so sweet, Shall fill me, when life's blossoms lie withering at my feet. Not as I will, my Father! In lone Gethsemane. I enter, Love's pure breezes there shall bear me home to Thee. This will, of mine, 0 Father ! I pray may sometimes be Brought into perfect oneness, Accepted Lord of Thee. Canaan Shakers, N. Y.
