CHRISTIANS SHOULD NOT MARRY. Count Leon Tolstoi Declares That Marriage Was Not Instituted By Christ. The Author of 'Kreutzer Sonata' Advances a Startling Theory That Celibacy Is Right and Marriage Wrong. [Translated from Count Tolstoi's Manuscript.] (From the Philadelphia Press.) I have received and still continue to receive, numbers of letters from persons who are perfect strangers to me, asking me to state in plain and simple language my own views on the subject handled in the story entitled 'The Kreutzer Sonata.' With this request I shall now endeavor to comply. My views on the question may be succinctly stated as follows : Without entering into details it will be generally admitted that I am accurate in saying that many people condone in young men a course of conduct with the other sex which is incompatible with strict morality, and that this dissoluteness is pardoned generally. Both parents and the Government, in consequence of-this view, may be said to wink at profligacy and even in the last resort to encourage its practice. I am of the opinion that it is not right. It is not possible that the health of one class should necessitate the ruin of another, and, in consequence, it is our first duty to turn a deaf ear to such an essentially immoral doctrine, no matter how strongly society may have established or law protected it- Moreover, it needs to be fully recognized that men are rightly to be held responsible for the consequences of their acts, and that these are no longer to be visited upon the women alone. It follows from this that it is the duty of men who do not wish to live a life of infamy to practice such continence in respect to all women as they woiald were the female society in which they move made up exclusively of their own mothers and sisters. � A more rational mode of life should be adopted, which would include the abstinence from alcoholic drinks, from excess in eating and from flesh meat, on the one hand, and recourse to physical labor on the other. I am not speaking of gymnastics, or of any of those occupations which may be fitly described as playing at work; I mean the genuine toil that fatigues. No one need go far in search of proof that this kind of abstemious living is not merely possible, but far less hurtful to health than excess. Hundreds of instances are known to every one. This is my first contention. CUPID TO BE 8IIUNNED. In the second place, I think that of late years, through various reasons into which I need not enter, but among which the above mentioned laxity in opinion in society and the frequent idealization of the subject in current literature and painting may be ment'.oned, conjugal infidelity has become more common and is considered less reprehensible. I am of opinion that this is not right. The origin of this evil is twofold. Tt is due, in the first place, to a natural instinct and in the second to the elevation of this instinct to a place to which it does not rightly belong. This being so, the evil can only be remedied by effecting a change in the views now in vogue about 'falling in love' and all that this term implies by educating men and women at home through family influence and example, and abroad by means of healthy public opinion, to practice that abstinence which morality and Christianity alike enjoin. This is my second contention. In the third place, I am of opinion that another consequence of the false light in which 'falling in love' and what it leads to are viewed in our society is that the birth of children has lost its pristine significance, and that modern marriages are conceived less and less from the point of view of the family. I am of opinion that this is not right. This is my third contention. CHILDREN OVERFED AND SPOILED. In the fourth place, I am of opinion that the children (who in our society are either an obstacle to enjoyment�an unlucky accident as it were) are educated not with a view to the problem which they will be one day called on to face and to solve, but solely with an eye to the pleasure which they may be made to yield to their parents. The consequence is that the children of human be- ings are brought up for all the world like the young of animals, the chief care of their parents being not to train them to such work as is worthy of men and women, but to increase their weight, to add a cubit to their stature, to make them spruce, sleek, well-fed and comely. They rig them out in all manner of fantastic costumes, wash them, overfeed them, and refuse to make them work. If the children of t^e lower orders differ in this last respect from those of the well-to-do class, the difference is merely formal; they work from sheer necessity, and not because their parents recognize work as a duty. And in over-fed children as in over-fed animals, sensuality is engendered unnaturally early. Fashionable dress to-day, the course of reading, plays, music, dances, luscious food� all the elements of our modern life, in a word, from the pictures on the little boxes of sweetmeats up to the novel, the tale and the poem�contribute to fan this sensuality into a strong, consuming flame, with the result that sexual vices and diseases have come to be the normal conditions of the period of tender youth, and often continue into the riper age of full-blown manhood. And I am of the opinion that this is not right. It is high time it ceased. The children of human beings should not be brought up as if they were animals, and we should set up as the object and strive to obtain as the result of our labors something better and nobler than a well-dressed body. This is my fourth contention. LOVE OVERRATED. In the fifth place, I am of the opinion that owing to the exaggerated and erroneous significance attributed by our society to love and to the idealized states that accompany and succeed it, the best energies of our men and women are drawn forth and exhausted during the most promising period of life; those of the men in the work of looking for, choosing and winning the most desirable objects of love, for which purpose lying and fraud are held to be quite excusable; those of the women and girls in alluring men and decoying them into liaisons or marriage by the most questionable means conceivable, as an instance of which the present fashions in evening dress may be cited. I am of opninion that this is not right. The truth is that the whole affair has been exalted by poets and romancers to an undue importance, and that love in its various developments is not a fitting object to consume the best energies of men. People set it before them and strive after it, because their view of life is as vulgar and brutish as is that other conception frequently met with in the lower stages of development, which sees in luscious and abundant food an end worthy of man's best efforts. Now, this is not right, and should not be done. And, in order to avoid doing it, it is only needful to realize the fact that whatever truly deserves to be held up as a worthy object of man's striving and working, whether it be the service of humanity, of one's country, of science, of art, not to speak of the service of God, is far above and beyond the sphere of personal enjoyment. Hence it follows that not only to form a liaison, but even to contract marriage is, from a Christian point of view, not a progress, but a fall. Love and all the states that accompany and follow it, however we may try in prose and verse to prove the contrary, never do and never can facilitate the attainment of an aim worthy of men, but always makes it more difficult. This is my fifth contention. How about the human race? If we admit that celibacy is better and nobler than marriage, evidently the human race will come to an end. But if the logical conclusion of the argument is that the human race will become extinct, the whole reasoning is wrong. To that I reply that the argument is not mine; I did not invent it. That it is incumbent on mankind so to strive and that celibacy is preferable to marriage ave truths revealed by Christ nineteen hundred years ago, set forth in our catechisms and professed by us as followers of Christ. MAN NATURALLY CHASTE. The same truth is confirmed by our reason, which tells us that the only solution not repugnant to the sentiment of humanity of the problem of overpopulation is afforded by the systematic striving after chastity, which though distasteful to animals, is natural to man. It is a most extraordinary thing when you come to think of it; Malthusian theories can be broached and propagated; millions of children may be allowed to die every year of hunger and want; millions upon millions of human beings may be butchered in war; the State may strain every nerve to increase and perfect the means of killing the people and look upon this as the main aim and object of its existence�all these things may be done under our eyes without striking us as in any way dangerous to humanity, but let some one hint at the necessity of celibacy, and immediately the cry is raised that the human race is in danger. When a person asks you his way to a place there are two methods of directing him. You may either point to a distant tree and tell him to make straight for that, thence on to the village, and from the village along the river bank till he comes to the hill, &amp;c, or else you may give him the general direction, telling him to walk due eastward and to let the inaccessible sun and stars serve him as finger-posts. The former of these methods is that of transitory religions with their detailed prescriptions and instructions; the latter is that of the inner consciousness of eternal, incorruptible truth. In the former case certain actions are described as having to be performed or avoided, in the latter the goal only is pointed out�a goal which, though forever unattainable, is recognized by our inner consciousness as 'the true one, and communicates the right direction to our life work. Keep holy the Sabbath day, perform the rite of circumcision, drink no spirituous liquors, do not steal, give a tithe of your goods to the poor, do not commit adultery, make the sign of the cross, receive the sacrament of communion, &amp;c. Such are the formal precepts of Brahminism, Buddhism, Israelitism, Mohammedanism and the ecclesiasticism called Christianity. TO BE CONTINUED.
