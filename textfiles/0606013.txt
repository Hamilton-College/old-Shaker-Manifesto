GOD IS LOVE SIMON MABEE Editor of the Shaker : I have been putting some of my thoughts on paper; can you use them ? I am advanced in years — for this age, very old— and being desirous to do all the good I can before going hence, I solicit just space enough to say, how I think God is love. God loves humanity continually. They that love God, keep his commands. God has so loved that he has ever sent a warning to humanity before he has sent j udgment and tribulation, and those who have repented have escaped judgment. The greatest evidence of God's love has been manifested in revealing to human minds how they can be saved from their sins — saved from committing any more sin. All who follow Jesus' example are saved from their sins — sinning no more than did Jesus — and he was saved, all admit. By his example, not his blood, all people may realize the love of God, to their complete salvation ; and in this way only, Jesus ' will save his people from their sins.' By following his example, they will be celibates ; they will not fight; they can hold no private property — not a dollar's worth ; they will be unworldly, and willing to die rather than forsake true principles. Thus did Jesus. He died for us in defense of principles ; he lived for us,' that we might live ' as he did. Of such godly love let us be in possession, and do as Jesus did. This love and life are God's love, and the eternal pith of Christianity. Hancock, Mass.
