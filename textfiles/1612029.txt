REST BY THE LATE FATHER RYAN My feet are wearied, and my hands are tired, My soul oppressed And I desire, what I have long desired Rest�only rest. 'Tis hard to toil, when toil is almost vain, In barren ways: 'Tis hard to sow, and never garner grain, In harvest days. The burden of iny days is hard to bear, But God knows best; And I have prayed, but vain has been my prayer For rest�sweet rest. 'Tis hard to plant in spring and never reap The autumn yield; 'Tis hard to till, and when 'tis tilled to weep O'er fruitless field. And so I cry a weak and human cry, So heart oppressed; And so I sigh a weak and human sigh, For rest�for rest. My way has wound across the desert years, And cares infest My path, and through the flowing of hot tears I pine for rest. And I'm restless still; 'twill soon be o'er; For, down the west Life's sun is setting, and I see the shore Where I shall rest. The Catholic.
