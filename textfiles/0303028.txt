SUSAN B. ANTHONY BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION By permission of the Constitutional Convention, Susan B. Anthony appeared before that body, and delivered a forcible and earnest plea in behalf of female suffrage, in which she requested the Convention, in making their report, to suggest that the objectionable word male be stricken out of the State laws, so that women may enjoy that liberty which is their right, for, said Susan Anthony, it is just as certain that ultimately the franchise will be accorded women as that it has been granted to the negro; and by your honorable body assisting us now you will be simply performing a duty that, in the event of your failing, will be granted by your successors, and to them will be given the honor.
