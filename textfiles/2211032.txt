INQUIRY. No. 8. Does a community of interest require that all the personal property of those joining a Shaker Society shall immediately become the property of the Community? It does not. Probationary members may retain the lawful use of their property, and if living separate from the family may manage their own temporal concerns. If they enter a Shaker family, an inventory of all the property received, will be taken, and then used as the parties may agree. If at any time they desire to make a donation to the Society they are at liberty to do so, provided they are clear of debt and their temporal abilities will admit of it. If such members withdraw from the Society, the property may be resumed according to contract, but no interest can be claimed for its use.
