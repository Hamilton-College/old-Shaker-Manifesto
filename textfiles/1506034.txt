Kind Words. Proprietor of Manifesto: Dear Sir, In behalf of my... National Home, Wis. Apr. 1885. Proprietor of Manifesto : Dear Sik,- -In behalf of my comrades gathered in this Home, I take pleasure in thanking you for your kindness in contributing your valuable publications to the Soldiers' Beading Room. It has contributed, not a little, toward enabling these twelve hundred scarred and mutilated veterans to pass, pleasantly and profitably, many an otherwise weary hour. Geo. W. Barber. Librarian.
