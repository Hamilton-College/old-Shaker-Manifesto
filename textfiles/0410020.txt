BOYS AND GIRLS The daily habits of every boy and girl are materials with which they are building up their characters, and every repetition has the effect of strengthening them for good or evil. Justice, benevolence, honor, integrity and self-control are no ephemeral blossoms that a day's sunshine can call into being and a night's frost can wither and kill. They grow slowly and develop gradually, but once rooted firmly in the heart and trained by con- stant exercise, they will prove sturdy, healthful, long-lived plants that will bear rich and abundant fruit. It is not enough to teach; we must also train. It is not enough to tell the child what is right; we must accustom him to love its atmosphere. So with self-culture. If we would become nobler and more virtuous, we must habituate ourselves to the constant exercise of pure thoughts, generous affections, noble and disinterested deeds.
