'ALL THUGS NEW.' OLIVER PRENTISS 'No more death—no more pain, for the former things are passed away.' How? How is this little planet to be ' replenished,' withont pain? How are our mortalities to be disposed of, without death f Materialization and Dematerialization are the keys to unlock the deep mysteries of Holy Writ. If dematerialized spirits can be rematerialized, for a short time, as from credible evidence doth fully appear, why not for a longer time? If a materialized spirit can be dematerialized, for a brief period, why not as long as the Lord pleases. Who objects? Not those, sure, whose part it is to perform the painful drudgery of reproducing the old way — the maternal drudgery. Let us have the new way and make a clean thing of it — the New Earth and New Heavens, so long foretold —¦ the ideal of all the truly great and good, since the world began. Who knows but God put that ideal in their souls? Why not have the ideal actualized, as the heavens have graciously pleased to vouchsafe the ways and means?
