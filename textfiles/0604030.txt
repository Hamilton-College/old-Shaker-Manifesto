THE EAR In his treatise on physiology, Hinton gives us to understand that the passage of the ear does not require cleaning by us ; nature undertakes the task, and in the healthy state fulfills it perfectly. Her means for cleansing the ear is the wax, which dries up into thin scales and peels off and falls away imperceptibly. In health the passage of the ear is never dirty, but an attempt to clean it will infallibly make it so. Washing the ear out with soap and water is bad; it keeps the wax moist when it ought to become dry and scaly, and makes it absorb dust. But the most hurtful thing is the introduction of the corner of a towel screwed up and twisted around. This proceeding irritates the passage and presses down the wax and flakes of skin upon the membrane of this tympanum, producing pain, inflammation and deafness. The washing should only extend to the outer surface, as far as the fingers can reach.
