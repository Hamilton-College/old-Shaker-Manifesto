ASCENDING LIFE. By Martha J. Anderson, The fine and subtile laws of alchemy A secret power of transmutation hold, Touch with refining sensibility, And bring to light each hidden grain of gold. Thus, from earth's basis to ethereal spheres In pure atomic substance wisely planned, More sublimated each degree appears That forms successive kingdoms, high and grand. Life's occult forces work with magic skill To build anew, till earth and heaven blend, Eternal laws of progress to fulfill In chain of being that shall never end. Mark the material forms that round us rise! They reach their zenith, yield to blight and death, But spirit hath a growth that never dies. 'Tis life of all that lives, and ceaseless breath. 'Tis spiritual force that guides the suns And worlds that fill immensity of space, 146 THE MANIFESTO. Electric fluid through each atom runs That evolution gives a form and place. Mancrowning point of the created whole The impress of his Maker's image wears; This microcosmbody, spirit, soul, Resemblance to creation fully bears. Each special phase of being here combined, The soul and sentiment of every thing Is germinal within the immortal mind That yet shall blossom in eternal spring. My wisdom placed within this rudimental sphere To give his noble powers unfoldment free, His childhood state brings teachers, year by year, Who spreads for him the chart of destiny; He reads and thinks, he learns and understands, Aspires still further with a yearning hope, And lo! his God-like soul expands, And ever fruitful fields before him ope. 'Tis life progressive, ever on and on, A glorious resurrection day by day ; 'Tis step by step, and starry summits won, That mark our ever upward, onward way. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
