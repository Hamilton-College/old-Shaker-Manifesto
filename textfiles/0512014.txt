WORK 'If all the year were playing holidays, To sport would be as tedious as to work ; But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come. And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.' One of the greatest means of assistance to those struggling for redemption from the existing evils of society, is the privilege of daily labor. Our ideas and aspirations are usually far in advance of what we are, in our worldly condition, capable of. Our ideal of a life of purity is, practically, a life of many burdens ; it is only through the ' fiery furnace ' of trial that we are qualified for that life that has ever been our ideal of what the earth life should be. During these days of regeneration a busy hand is a safety-valve, as it were, to an overcharged brain and heart. Time spent in brooding over our dark thoughts, and in listening to the enticing voices of the sirens of the world, is simply time spent in creating troubles with which we may have to battle months and years before conquering. Humble yourselves with laborâ€” ' therefore he brought down their hearts with labor.' Work hard, until the physical man is stilled and tired ; and then, in tranquillity and rest, receive the ministrations of the spirit. Our days of rest are enhanced by their becoming a necessity ; the hours devoted to general intellectual enjoyments are made pleasurable by their being the exception and not the rule ; ' when they seldom come, they wish'd for come.' David, in promising reward to the righteous, says: ' Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands ; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.' Eat not 'the bread of idleness,' either in spiritual or temporal things, for it is while in this open condition of inactivity that our minds are filled with doubtings and wonderings; it is then that evil influences fill our souls, simply because of the dearth of those good influences which are attendant upon constant conscience-eet-isfying labor.
