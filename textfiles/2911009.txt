THE MANIFESTO. NOVEMBER, 1899. OFFICE OF PUBLICATION. The Manifesto is published by the 'United Society of Believers, and is the only work issued regularly by the Shaker Community. Its aim is to furnish a plain and simple statement of the religious views of the Order and to inculcate the spirit of righteousness. Address, Henry C. Blinn, East Canterbury, N. H. NOTICE. Our little Magazine which at the present time is known as 'The Manifesto,' issued its first number in January, 1871, at Watervliet, N. Y. At that time it bore the very pleasant but modest title, ''The Shaker.' It was the messenger of 'good news,' and in its advocacy of the testimony of the Christ, gave no uncertain sound. Its publication has been sustained by the liberal contributions of the several Shaker Communities, as they have manifested a deep interest in its success as a medium for good to its own members, and no less to those who were not residents of the Community. Possibly it may be after a term of some thirty years, 'The Manifesto' has accomplished all the good it can for the present, and may now go into retirement till another wave of enthusiasm calls it again into action. To all who have ministered to the success of the little paper, as writers or readers, or to its circulation, we extend our kindest thanks. Times have changed. Money is scarce and the several Societies have suffered with the laboring classes in the common distress. It is now proposed that the December number of 'The Manifesto' for 1899, shall be the closing of the publication. The- Directors.
