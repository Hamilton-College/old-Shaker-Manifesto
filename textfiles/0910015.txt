'HANDS TO WORK AND HEARTS TO GOD.' LOUISA E. GREEN ' Hands to work and hearts to prayer.' That was a maxim taught by our first founder on the earth, and is it not as necessary now, to-day, as it was then ? And how can we put it in practice that we may reap the most benefit therefrom in a Community ? It is certainly not by standing still and waiting for the tides of life to turn, expecting something that will please our fancies, or yield the most enjoyment to self. It is not by sitting with our hands idly folded, and seeing our brother or sister lifting the heavy loads of care, without rising to duty and rendering our assistance, thus failing to call into action the Golden rule. It is not by finding fault with another for not doing what we do not like to do, but what is our duty to do ; nor by leaving the stern battle of life for one or two to fight, and then expect a share of blessing in the victories won. Ah, nay ! If we would be noble men and women in the new creation, true brethren and sisters in Christ, we must together toil for the upbuilding of our homes, feeling that it is our home, we must together face the duties of life, lift the burdens, and lighten the cares, together seeking each other's comfort and happiness, thus securing the same blessing to ourselves. In so doing, we will be living examples of that faith which we profess ; and ours will be the inheritance of that Peace, which the world know not of, because we have sown the seed, nourished the plant, and finally reaped the harvest of patient toil and labor in Zion's cause. And thus will we be practicing the blessed injunction of our Mother, Ann Lee : ' Hands to work and hearts to Prayer,' and our very lives will be the essence of praise to God. Canaan, N. Y.
