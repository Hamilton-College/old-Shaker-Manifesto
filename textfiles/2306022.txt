It is the lives, like the stars... It is the lives, like the stars, which simply pour down on us the calm light of their upright and faithful being up to which we look, and out of which we gather the deepest calm and courage. No man or woman of the humblest sort can really be strong, gentle, pure and good without the world being better for it, without somebody being helped and comforted by the very existence of that goodness. ï¿½Phillips Brooks.
