DO NOT JUDGE YOUR NEIGHBOR. By Sophia L. Sehenck. [Contributed by Eldress L. E. Greene.] Do not judge your neighbor, harshly, Be not hasty to condemn ; Things unknown to you may alter What now seems averse to them. Shadows, looking dark and dismal, Could you rightly comprehend Might assume a brighter aspect And ward off some bitter end. Often in this life of trial, Upright hearts are falsely charged ; Gossips toss the merest trifle Till it soon becomes enlarged. Do not add your censure to it, Lest you live the deed to rue. Think, what seems to brand your neighbor. Possibly may prove untrue. Better far defend a brother When sharp, poisoned arrows fly ; Your kind word may change the current Of the public hue and cry. When a man is down, don't strike him But extend your friendly aid. One lift may give him courage And his downward coarse be stayed.
