THE PARSON'S TEXT BY M. ALICE BROWN A pabsox once, the story goes, Maligned by friends as well as foes ; 3?or tales made up, surmisings dark, And cruel slanders, made the mark ; Bethought himself a blow to deal, Which etery guilty soul should feel. Without a word of his intent, He to his Sabbath duties went,— 'My text you'll find within the book Of Exodus, if you will look, The chapter twenty-three, the clause And verse are first, but here I pause,— As it is broad and comprehends, The highest nights, the farthest ends, To which I wisli your thoughts to soar, No words of mine could add aught more ; To every one within my fold, This text I give to Iceej) and hold; An application in it lies, But 'twill be plain to all the wise, 'Tis sermon, rule of life as well, It's worth if heeded who can tell! I now proceed to close my theme. Your own reflections best I deem.' Then home they sped, with wonder stirred At this new preaching they had heard; Each one in heated haste to see, What such a wondrous text could be, But what was their chagrin to read, Though terse and trite, most fit indeed, These words, more keen than long retort,'Thou shalt not raise a false report.'
