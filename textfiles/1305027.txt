To sleep in clothes worn through the day To sleep in clothes worn through the day is a bad practice. The clothes are filled with the effluvium emanating from the natural wastes from the body all through the day. Especially is this the case with those who labor hard, or perspire easily. The poisons of the system thus ejected or thrown off by people in vigorous health furnish a strong reason, if there were no other, for removing on retiring every article worn through the day.
