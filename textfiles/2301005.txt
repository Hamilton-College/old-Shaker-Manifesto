WITHOUT FAULT Nancy G. Danforth How pleasant the thought that we may stand with the redeemed on Mount Zion! How the heart swells with rapture as we anticipate the glorious prospect! But what must be our attainments to entitle us to this claim? We read that 'in their mouth was found no guile.' This, then, is their condition, and for this perfection we must strive. The Apostle says, 'If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body;' thus bring the life in accordance with the Divine will which is unbounded love and charity for all. This heavenly love extends to all; even the most sinful and erring are objects of Divine love and pity. As 'out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,' it is evident that the heart and mind must be cleansed from all evil thoughts and hard feelings, by the truth and fire of the gospel testimony, until in truth, we can in honor prefer one another. 9 10 THE MANIFESTO. When the love of God reigns supreme in our hearts and we can lend a helping hand to those in need, without judging their worthiness, or despising their infirmities, then we have begun to control our whole being, so that 'in our mouths will be found no guile,' and we can 'stand without fault before the throne of God' today and each day as time rolls on. God grant that we may all strive for this glorious attainment. East Canterbury, N. H.
