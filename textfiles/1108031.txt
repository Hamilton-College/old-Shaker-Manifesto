WHAT A MOTHER CAN DO A mother on the green hills of Vermont was holding, by the right hand, a son, sixteen years old, mad with love of the sea. And, as she stood by the garden gate one morning, she said : 'Edward, they tell me, for I never saw the ocean, that the great temptation of a seaman's life is drink. Promise me, before you quit your mother's hand, that you will never drink liquor.' 'And,' he said, for he told the story, ' I gave the promise, and I went the globe over, to Calcutta and the Mediterranean, Ban Francisco and the Cape of Good Hope, the North and South Poles. I saw them all in forty years, and I never saw a glass filled with sparkling liquor that my mother's form at the gate did not rise up before my eyes, and to-day I am innocent of the taste of liquor.' Was not that sweet evidence of the power of a single word ? Yet that is not half. ' For,' still continued he, 'yesterday there came into my counting-room a man forty years old.' ' Do you know me? ' 'No.' ' Well,' said he, ' I was brought drunk into your presence on ship-board; you were a passenger; they kicked me aside; you took me to your berth and kept me there till 1 slept off my intoxication. You then asked me if I had a mother; I said I had never heard a word from her lips ; you told me of yours at the garden gate; and today I am master of one of the finest ships in New York harbor, and came to ask you to come and see me.' The mother's words on the green hills of Vermont! God be thanked for the mighty power of a single word!
