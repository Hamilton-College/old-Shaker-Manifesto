INTEREST FOR ZION. Abraham Perkins. Many, many times am I mentally drawn to the subject of Zion, its needs, the call of souls to the support of its interests, and with their knowledge of Christian life, their great responsibility, together with the cares, burdens and duties evolving. In my heart I exclaim,�that with all there exists of human weakness, man is able to satisfy the Almighty and become his glory, however mighty the work or great the sacrifice. Our God is not an unreasonable being ; a being who would require of his creatures beyond their capacity of performance, although the demand to be, perfect even as He is perfect may seem preposterous. As his children, we are to be perfectly obedient to the revelation of his will given us ; and as we grow in knowledge to the risingstate of manhood, with that addition of knowledge, the character of our lives should correspond, producing evolution, progress and greater perfection, God-like, and as is manifested in the works of the Creator. If we would find, we must seek; if we would be opened unto, we must knock. Thus do we grow in understanding to know good from evil, to become in capability and power, not Gods, but men and women of God, such creations as the All-wise designed we should be. He hath said,�'Shall I bring forth and not cause to bring forth ? Shall the earth bring forth in one day? Shall a nation be born at once ?' Neither is manhood perfected in a day. It requires a term of years and soul travail to accomplish it. It should not be inferred from these facts that ease or indolence is justifiable. We must work while the day lasts, while mercy continue th and while the cistern remains unbroken. Our God, though long-suffering, is not to be mocked. In his character He is justice as well as mercy; a good requiter for every service rendered Him and positive exacter to the utmost farthing for every deed of unrighteousness. Enfield, N. H.
